Mr. Bad mouth and Miss Clumsy!

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,550
- Hey!
- Hey!

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,160
Lightning, please strike me!

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,230
Hey! You came to
get hit by lightning?

5
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,620
Is this your experiment?

6
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,600
You'll be dead before
finishing the experiment.

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,460
I won't die so easily.

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,850
Lightning, strike me!

9
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,070
- Lightning!
- Whoa!

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,240
Lightning is way stronger
now than when we were kids.

11
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,760
It's too dangerous!

12
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,200
Let go of me!

13
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Well, I created the group chat
since our fathers are friends.

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,550
What should be the group's name?

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,440
How about “Dad's Friends”?

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,760
Cool!

<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

30
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:34,258

31

<i>That's enough for me.</i>

32
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,211
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

33
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:42,774
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

34
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,596

35
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:51,229

I might lose you.</i>

36

<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

40
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:07,901
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

41
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:47,862
Thank you, friend.

42
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,632
Hey! It's late already.
You can sleep over here.

43
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:56,472
I have my own home.

44
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:00,132
But you don't have friends there.
It's lonely.

45
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,242
I have someone to cure my loneliness.

46
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,632
“I have someone to cure my loneliness”.

47
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:18,832
Bamee is in a relationship!

48
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:24,242
Heartbreak is a natural thing.

49
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,212
I will find a new crush for you.

50
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,772
Where did you guys go?

51
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,292
I accidentally met him at the campus.

52
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,042
It's late at night.

53
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,402
What did you guys do there?

54
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:51,942
Personal issues.

55
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,642
What issues?

56
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,202
You ask so many questions
like you're my wife.

57
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,582
The professor didn't
assign any homework.

58
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,282
It's impossible that you have to be
at the campus at this time.

59
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,872
You can tell me frankly

60
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,112
that you went on a date with Bamee.

61
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,192
And when Bamee said.

62
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,882
“I have someone to cure my loneliness.”

63
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,092
That someone is you!

64
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,042
Oh no!

65
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,752
You are overthinking.

66
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,282
I really accidentally met him
at the campus.

67
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,382
If you lie,

68
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,682
I'll curse you to go to hell.

69
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,002
Believe it or not, it's your call.

70
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:50,002
(Oh, this sweet love…)

71
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:53,152
Baiwan.

72
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:54,512
Yes, mommy.

73
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:02,072
Please come in, mommy.

74
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:08,822
Baiwan,

75
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:12,022
don't have a crush on Kiew for real.

76
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,602
I knew that you're going
to have a serious talk

77
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,262
when you knocked
on my door at this time.

78
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:22,952
What if I like Kiew for real?
What is wrong with that?

79
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,932
So, you like him for real?

80
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,922
No, you can't.
You can't like him at all.

81
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,162
Get over him now.

82
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,072
I need to know the reason.

83
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,462
Because Kiew is a friend…

84
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,422
a friend of yours.

85
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,234
It's okay to fall in love with a friend.

86
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:47,852
You and dad used to be friends
before being a couple too.

87
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,432
But one day, Kiew has
to travel on a long journey

88
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:56,812
and might never come back.

89
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,082
I don't want you to suffer from it.

90
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,972
He's going to study abroad?

91
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,242
He'll settle down somewhere else.

92
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,342
Then, if I graduate,

93
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:14,782
I will go with him.

94
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,932
And I can bring you and dad with me.

95
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,482
Baiwan, it's not as easy
as you think it is.

96
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:26,532
Let's say

97
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,672
I have enough reason

98
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,632
to refrain you from being with Kiew.

99
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,742
Do as I ask you to do.

100
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:10,642
Hey!

101
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,362
I will sleep with you here.

102
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,502
No, you'll force me
to make love with you.

103
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,302
- Go away! Go!
- Whoa!

104
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:18,962
I won't do that.

105
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,612
I didn't have the feeling for you
like I have for Bamee.

106
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,142
Why did you want to sleep in my room?

107
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,762
My heart is really broken.

108
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,732
I don't want to be alone.

109
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,512
Can I sleep with you?

110
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,692
Please, please, please.

111
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,842
You told me to play it realistically.

112
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,592
Is this realistic enough for you?

113
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,062
This is very good.

114
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,952
I'll walk you to the building.

115
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:52,002
In general, are your parents strict?

116
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:54,402
My dad is strict, very organized,

117
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,452
but never scolds me.

118
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,562
My mom is kind, reasonable,

119
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,062
and always in a good mood.

120
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:01,272
But for some serious issue,

121
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,382
she will beg for my cooperation,

122
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:04,162
and I always yield to her.

123
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:05,858
They both are still the same.

124
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,632
You talked like you have known
my parents for a long time.

125
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:15,922
My dad used to tell me

126
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,562
what his friends are like.

127
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,072
So, I knew some information
about your parents.

128
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,402
My parents used to tell me
about their friends,

129
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,952
about uncle Prach, uncle Art,

130
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:31,092
but they have never talked
about your parents.

131
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,152
Maybe...

132
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,812
they did, but you didn't know.

133
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,102
Possibly…

134
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:43,837
Focus on your studies.

135
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,222
See you at noon.

136
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,702
Today, we will test your memory

137
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:07,342
by playing a pair-up game.

138
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:09,052
Hey, can I be with you?

139
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,092
The same buddy!

140
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,762
You can't escape me. Hahaha.

141
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:20,612
Whatever game it is,

142
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,422
play it well this time.

143
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,482
I know.

144
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,572
This activity will tell us

145
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,822
whether we care for
our friends well enough.

146
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,902
It will train your observation skill

147
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,052
that will be beneficial
for you in the future.

148
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,772
It's him... not!

149
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,072
It's not him.

150
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,572
Here is my buddy. Plawan, my buddy.

151
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:21,642
- That's right!
- Yay!

152
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:33,172
Why was I the only one
who got punished?

153
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,392
You're the only one
who guessed incorrectly.

154
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:39,752
If I were you, I wouldn't miss it.

155
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,522
I remember every cell of Bamee.

156
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:44,962
You remember every cell of him?

157
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:45,902
Why?

158
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:48,192
Aren't you too observant?

159
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,372
Who would remember?

160
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:57,172
Figure, face, hairstyle,
they're all the same.

161
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,522
How could you remember me?

162
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,442
Your odor.

163
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:06,882
Hey, my armpit odor?

164
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,202
The fragrance you use every day.

165
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,432
Oh, damn it!

166
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:17,402
Why didn't you tell me?

167
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:20,382
My armpits are wet now.

168
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:23,832
That's enough.

169
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,952
Let's go. Baiwan is waiting.

170
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,702
Let's go.

171
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,062
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go! What are you waiting for?

172
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,072
Let's go.

173
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:36,942
What's wrong?

174
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,333
Hey, what are you doing? Let me try.

175
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,042
- Normally it doesn't get stuck.
- Right.

176
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,672
Can I try too?

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,970
It's all done, boss.

178
00:12:58,282 --> 00:12:59,712
They're all locked up.

179
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:17,992
Peek-a-boo!

180
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:21,122
You wanna get in trouble with Kiew?

181
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:23,513
I can cause him trouble too.

182
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,512
My dad taught me.

183
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,822
You're all grown up and still asking
your dad to clean up your mess.

184
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,402
Don't you feel ashamed?

185
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:34,432
I'm improved now.

186
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:39,042
I just used my intellect to
solve a problem just now.

187
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,992
Alright. I'm happy for you.

188
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:52,152
If you don't have anyone
to have lunch with,

189
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:54,786
you can have lunch with me.

190
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:57,562
I have lots of friends,

191
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,489
plus one sweetheart.

192
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,182
I won't interrupt you.

193
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:07,422
All your friends
might ditch you already.

194
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,699
They're not like that.

195
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:27,842
Oops!

196
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:31,872
You got locked up in the toilet.
How could you show up here?

197
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,662
I just called the janitor. That's it.

198
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:36,642
How did you know we were locked up?

199
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,722
You did it!

200
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,292
I just walked here
from another building.

201
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,652
Check out the CCTV
if you don't believe me.

202
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,142
You could ask someone else to do it.

203
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:50,772
I didn't.

204
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,002
It's fine then.

205
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,962
Why did you mess around
with Baiwan again?

206
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:57,722
I miss her.

207
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,132
I don't have to own her.

208
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:02,962
Loving her,

209
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:04,542
seeing her face,

210
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,592
talking to her,

211
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:08,142
these things make me happy.

212
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,482
Keep your words for a soap opera.

213
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:16,164
Get away from me before I get moody.

214
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:21,922
Hahaha.

215
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,712
He looks pale.

216
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,412
He's freaking afraid of you.

217
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,402
He's such a coward.

218
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,562
I've been thinking about it.

219
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,802
I think it must be Franc
who locked us up.

220
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:52,642
He's the only enemy
we have in this campus.

221
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,472
But it seems stupid
to do something like that.

222
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,892
We all have mobile phones.

223
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,622
We can ask anyone to help us.

224
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:03,572
He's stupid
since he was in the previous school.

225
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,572
He got caught every
time he tricked anyone.

226
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,412
But he's good at studying, that's why
he could get into this university.

227
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:09,892
You wanna take revenge?

228
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:12,082
Nope,

229
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,602
it's a waste of time.

230
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:15,902
I have more important thing to do.

231
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,072
Is it about traveling
on a long journey?

232
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:25,922
Your parents told you?

233
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,992
Now you know the truth?

234
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:32,919
The truth?

235
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,782
You said it like
you're keeping secrets.

236
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,422
Is there anything we don't know about?

237
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:38,242
Well, I…

238
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,202
Kiew is going to study abroad.

239
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,322
When?

240
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,322
Soon.

241
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:52,532
Why do you have to go?
Can you change your mind?

242
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,872
This journey is very important to me.

243
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:02,922
I have to go.

244
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,502
I don't want Kiew to go. Do you?

245
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:22,162
Want it or not, he'll go anyway.

246
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:24,752
The sooner he leaves, the better.

247
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:26,762
So, we don't have to bond
with him any deeper.

248
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,869
Just thinking that Kiew's leaving,

249
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,672
I feel like I want to cry.

250
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,102
Are you falling in love with Kiew?

251
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:47,702
Have you ever been beside someone and

252
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,712
your heart beats fast?

253
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,702
Hey,

254
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:14,542
the heart symbol shows
the heart rate, right?

255
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,572
Why the number is rising like this?

256
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,122
Are you alright? Hey!

257
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:20,712
It's nothing.

258
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,312
The watch gets wet from the
rain, so, it might be an error.

259
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:34,402
No, never.

260
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,722
I feel that way

261
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:39,912
every time I'm close to Kiew.

262
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,002
Let me ask you frankly.

263
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,912
Have you ever thought, for a second,
about falling for Baiwan for real?

264
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:14,812
Not even a second.

265
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:16,762
She's like my child.

266
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,442
Just like you two!

267
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:22,242
Kiew! My hair is messy!

268
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,072
Whoa!

269
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,562
Franc is afraid of you,

270
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,472
but he doesn't stop chasing
after Baiwan.

271
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,362
When you're not here,

272
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:35,392
how should we deal with him?

273
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,222
Why do I have to be the first one?

274
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,542
You do some exercise.
You have basic athletic ability.

275
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,252
You should be the easiest one to teach.

276
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:55,472
Come quick!

277
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,682
Split your legs as
wide as your shoulders.

278
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:10,102
Your left-hand grabs here.

279
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,282
Your right-hand grabs here.

280
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,520
And then…

281
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,232
Hey, ouch!

282
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:23,842
Whoa! That's cool, teacher!

283
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,352
Hey!

284
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:31,772
Bamee fights back right away.

285
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,952
You wanna start a real fight?

286
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,722
You did it first.

287
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:45,202
Kiew doesn't give in easily.

288
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:47,962
Bamee doesn't stop either.
What's it gonna be?

289
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:51,282
What? Bamee, what's he gonna do?

290
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,042
- The fight starts now!
- Bamee!

291
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:27,682
I'm tired already.

292
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,172
You can teach the next one.

293
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,182
You can't beat me so you
ask me to teach someone else.

294
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,402
Plawan!

295
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:39,492
Here I am.

296
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,316
Take a bow, right?

297
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,212
Split your legs.

298
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:53,052
If you learn martial arts for a while,
you will be able to deal with Franc.

299
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,092
That's right.

300
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:56,482
Then, Franc will stop chasing
after Baiwan.

301
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:58,832
I'm so hungry.

302
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,042
Let's find something to eat.

303
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,282
How about grilled pork buffet?

304
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,342
Yeah, go for it!

305
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,502
You guys go ahead.
I already have a plan.

306
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,372
With your partner?

307
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,362
Whenever I ask him
about personal issues,

308
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,732
he always walks away.

309
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,222
He's very strict with his privacy.

310
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,122
I can't imagine

311
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:21,112
who would like to be with someone
who is as cold-hearted as he is...

312
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:49,212
You look so awesome!

313
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,552
I came here to see you.
I can't look too basic.

314
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,162
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

315
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,312
How are you? Do you feel hot today?

316
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:58,422
I do.

317
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:11,122
Hey,

318
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,642
Bamee is dating a school boy?

319
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,692
He's good-looking too.

320
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,082
Not half as good-looking as me.

321
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:22,682
You're so full of yourself.

322
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:25,332
Well, it's obvious.

323
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,402
I don't believe that the school boy

324
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,182
will be sincere with someone
who is older than him.

325
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:29,980
He's fooling Bamee for sure.

326
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:33,652
If you don't know him
and talk about him like this,

327
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,222
it's called libel.

328
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:36,372
You wanna prove it?

329
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:38,572
Let's get straight to it!

330
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:41,062
I feel like having fun now!

331
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:42,822
Let's go.

332
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,462
Oh, he even puts on shoes for him!

333
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:18,162
They must be so in love.

334
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,412
Oh, what I see now is already painful,

335
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,782
and your words make my heart hurt!

336
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,972
You want me to die right here?

337
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:27,532
Calm down, my friend.

338
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,397
Please don't die now.
Come on, boy.

339
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:46,572
He pays for everything
that the boy wants.

340
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,392
He's the real sugar-daddy.

341
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:50,582
And that boy wants everything.

342
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:52,512
Does he want Bamee to be penniless?

343
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:54,982
Do you believe me now,

344
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,492
that Bamee is fooled by that boy?

345
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,442
If we tell him directly,
he won't believe us.

346
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:03,212
He'll think that we blame his partner.

347
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:05,802
How should we deal with him?

348
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:20,612
He's coming!

349
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,252
Isn't it cool?

350
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:26,022
It's very trendy.

351
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,372
Someone who is very kind
bought me this.

352
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:30,562
Whoa,

353
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:33,602
clothes, bags, shoes,

354
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,042
you got everything.

355
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:36,522
You're so awesome!

356
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,002
You have someone to sponsor you.

357
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,242
Can you find me one?

358
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:40,452
It's very difficult to find one.

359
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:42,802
It's not difficult.

360
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,632
Just find someone
who is older than you,

361
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,082
please him a little,

362
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,542
be sweet to him a bit,

363
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,192
he'll give you whatever you want.

364
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,652
This is so cool.

365
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:54,382
He's such an asshole!

366
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:57,282
They all look like thieves.

367
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:02,832
What's that?

368
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:10,732
Hello, teacher.

369
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:12,732
- Dress properly, hold a bag, that looks best.
- There he is.

370
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:14,732
- Dress properly, you can go...
- Hello.

371
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:19,202
Yeah!

372
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:28,672
Can I get the ball back?

373
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,462
Come talk to me first.

374
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:31,532
I'll give it back to you later.

375
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:33,702
Are they causing trouble to you?

376
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:38,002
No, I think they might
wanna have a talk.

377
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:42,992
I think you are still young.

378
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,322
We just want to warn you first.

379
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,902
Quit the bad things you're doing.

380
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,762
What are you talking about?
I really don't get it.

381
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:50,572
Don't pretend!

382
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,162
Whoa,

383
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,632
I'm even more confused now.

384
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,042
What does that mean?

385
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,322
Are you annoying me?

386
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:58,912
Kiew, calm down.

387
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,772
He isn't annoying you.

388
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:01,932
I don't know the meaning either.

389
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:06,322
Did you study language at all?

390
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,902
I mean don't act like you don't know.

391
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,212
I really don't know.

392
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:16,332
What are you guys talking about?

393
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:17,872
You recognized the wrong person!

394
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:20,482
I recognize you so clearly.

395
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,412
Stop fooling Bamee for money!

396
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:25,002
Oh I see,

397
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,072
Bamee's friends.

398
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:30,452
I've never fooled him at all.

399
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:33,762
Damn, Bamee paid for your shopping.

400
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,562
You dare to say you didn't fool him?

401
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:38,402
He gave them to me with his pleasure.

402
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:39,772
I don't care about it.

403
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:42,072
But from now on,

404
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:43,712
if you ask him to buy anything for you,

405
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,782
you'll get in trouble.

406
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:49,112
Noted.

407
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:51,612
But I'll do it or not,
it's my own right.

408
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,562
Good bye!

409
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:00,062
He's disturbing!

410
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:02,722
I think he's afraid of us.

411
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:04,262
- He's just acting like he's brave,
- Right.

412
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:05,612
Or he wouldn't run away like that.

413
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:08,512
I think he won't dare to keep in touch
with Bamee anymore.

414
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:10,812
Bamee'll get his heart broken now.

415
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:15,752
I volunteer to heal his heart.

416
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:23,602
Here,

417
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:26,132
I bought them for you,
less sweet like you like.

418
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:28,552
I'm not hungry.

419
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:34,802
When will you stop rejecting
good intentions from friends?

420
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:36,802
Plawan bought snacks for you,

421
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,222
at least you should
accept his kindness.

422
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:40,872
I'm not hungry.

423
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,477
What should I take them for?

424
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:44,002
To throw them into a bin?

425
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:48,062
You don't know
how to accept things from others.

426
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,432
You only know
how to buy things for others.

427
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,762
Who did I buy things for?

428
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,532
Don't talk a lot.

429
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:58,292
He'll know that we stalked him.

430
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:01,202
Nothing.

431
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:04,422
I will eat them myself.

432
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,442
It's time for class.

433
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:18,452
Hey, you said he'll get heartbroken.

434
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,482
Why doesn't he look sad at all?

435
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,602
Or that boy hasn't broken up with him?

436
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:36,672
- Good bye teacher.
- Good bye.

437
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,762
Don't wander around.

438
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,372
- See you!
- Go home safely.

439
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:43,372
Good luck! Good luck!

440
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:45,974
That asshole still doesn't break up
with Bamee.

441
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:49,922
Bamee is like his gold goose.

442
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:51,957
If I were him, I wouldn't break up
with Bamee easily.

443
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:54,772
We need to execute him
on a maximum level.

444
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,752
You're not like anyone I have known.

445
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:03,292
I want you and me
to stay together all the time.

446
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,672
If you're lonely, just call me.

447
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:08,242
I only want us to have a good time.

448
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,692
If you're sad, I'll comfort you.

449
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:13,342
If you feel low, I'll hug you.

450
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,312
Just think of the time when…

451
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,082
Hey! What the hell is this?
Why did you catch me?

452
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,052
Come here!

453
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:25,212
I told you to break up with Bamee.

454
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,242
Well, he doesn't stop contacting me.

455
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:29,952
You guys are his friends.

456
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,332
Why don't you stop him?

457
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,542
Because you all know right,

458
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:38,512
that he doesn't listen to anyone.

459
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,012
He trusts himself the most.

460
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:41,982
You can't blame that it's my fault.

461
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:52,752
You look into my eyes for a long time,

462
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:53,862
I might get pregnant.

463
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:55,112
Say whatever you want to say.

464
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,782
Leave Bamee alone!

465
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,062
If he calls, don't pick up.

466
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:00,452
If he comes to see you, don't meet him.

467
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:03,062
Don't talk about impossible things.

468
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:11,402
Kiew, what you taught doesn't work.

469
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,002
Hey, Plawan!

470
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,842
You did the wrong posture!

471
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:19,592
You asshole!

472
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:23,062
Good bye everyone!

473
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:29,522
Kiew, will you let him go like that?

474
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,322
He's right.

475
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:34,692
We should stop Bamee.

476
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:39,112
He said it

477
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,602
because he knows that

478
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,602
we can't stop Bamee.

479
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,982
We'll find a way to stop him.

480
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:53,992
No,

481
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,442
I don't dare to do it.

482
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:58,742
Bamee told me once that
if we want to be friends,

483
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,162
don't interfere with his privacy.

484
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:02,162
But he's being fooled, Baiwan!

485
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,692
But he is not stupid.

486
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,002
He won't let anyone fool him so easily.

487
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:11,152
What about
when he bought things for that boy?

488
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,682
I think that.

489
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:18,782
Bamee has thought it through.

490
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,422
He might think it through,

491
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:25,412
but it doesn't mean that
he can follow that boy's thoughts.

492
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,012
So, it's me!

493
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:30,872
He doesn't like me anyway.

494
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,872
I can be the only one he hates.

495
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:35,492
Whoa!

496
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,472
The sacrificing Kiew!

497
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,112
Come with me!

498
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,202
What's wrong?

499
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:02,652
I don't want anyone to see your tears.

500
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,642
Nothing can make me cry.

501
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:08,152
Even that boy?

502
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,662
Which boy?

503
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,682
The one you took for shopping.

504
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,232
What's wrong with that boy?

505
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,502
Take a deep breath.

506
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,672
Take a deep breath.

507
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,552
Take a deep breath.

508
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,862
Take a deep breath.

509
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,732
I'm sorry

510
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:31,572
that I couldn't rescue your dad.

511
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:57,382
What's wrong with that boy?

512
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:06,272
You don't have to call him.

513
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,732
Give me back my phone!

514
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:28,432
That boy is fine!

515
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:32,232
Why the hell did you scare me?

516
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,892
I told you to take a deep breath.

517
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:38,182
Be focused. What is scary about it?

518
00:34:41,142 --> 00:34:42,489
That boy is fooling you.

519
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,112
No way!

520
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:46,317
That boy is sincere to me the most.

521
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:48,362
I trust him the most too.

522
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:50,752
Even though he'll fool
you till you're broke?

523
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:52,752
I yield to him.

524
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:55,492
Don't interfere with my privacy again.

525
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:58,672
But we're concerned about you!

526
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:03,712
Your concerns
don't make me feel any better.

527
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,488
It's better to not to be
concerned about me at all.

528
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:20,362
<i>I have something in my heart</i>

529
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:25,424
<i>that feels deeper
than just being friends.</i>

530
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:28,772
He doesn't pick up the call.

531
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:33,472
When he's in a bad mood,

532
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:34,912
he likes to be alone.

533
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:37,042
Just leave him alone for now.

534
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,152
He'll get over it.

535
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,272
I worry about him and I get in trouble.

536
00:35:41,362 --> 00:35:42,652
Next time, I won't worry about him.

537
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:45,602
Why is he so f*cking stupid?

538
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:47,042
He knows that the boy fools him,

539
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,132
still he yields to that boy!

540
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,442
Now, here's another one
who's having a bad mood.

541
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:00,722
Then we have to keep our good mood.

542
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,462
When they recover, they can talk again.

543
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:13,972
You can make up any story.

544
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:15,742
Something like molding clay subjects.

545
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:18,080
Do you like spice?

546
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:19,922
- I do.
- Spices like…

547
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,312
We have an amulet subject in school.

548
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:23,372
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

549
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:24,942
- Really?
- Amulet like...

550
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:11,932
You're so mad at us that
you don't attend class?

551
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:17,742
You're a grown-up now.

552
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:20,642
Can't you separate personal
feelings from responsibilities?

553
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:22,982
It's none of your business.

554
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,412
If your dad knew that

555
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,822
you behave like this,
he would be disappointed.

556
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,512
Even though your dad enjoyed drinking,

557
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,912
but he paid attention
to his studies.

558
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:34,522
He loved his friends.

559
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,922
Your dad's kindness brought me
here to take care of you.

560
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:39,922
Nobody asked you to do it.

561
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:54,062
Art, your son is so irritating!

562
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:12,962
How is he?

563
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:17,792
I thought that mentioning Art

564
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,202
will make him come to the class.

565
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:21,632
He's so strong headed.

566
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:34,242
I don't know what
we are studying.

567
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,702
I don't know anything.

568
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:38,082
A guy is fine too.

569
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,352
Oh my gosh,

570
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,722
there's a guy waiting for her
in front of the building.

571
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:44,802
- I'm so jealous of her.
- Oops!

572
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:46,702
- I'm leaving now.
- Hold on a bit.

573
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:49,832
Hi, what's your name?
You don't look familiar.

574
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,142
Right, you're not in Humanities, right?

575
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,162
Baiwan's never told us that
she has a very handsome friend.

576
00:38:57,092 --> 00:38:58,272
Don't tell me that…

577
00:38:58,272 --> 00:38:59,842
- That…
- That…

578
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:01,972
Kanom, Jenny, Mudmee,

579
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,712
you guys are too much.

580
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,882
This is my friend, Kiew.

581
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:07,892
He studies Architecture.

582
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:10,592
Kiew, isn't it?

583
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:12,722
His name is so yummy.

584
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,722
Let's go.
Don't be a third-wheel for them.

585
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,722
- Let's find some dumplings to eat.
- Let's go.

586
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,252
You mean the yummy dumpling, right?

587
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:22,002
Yeah, let's find something to eat.

588
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:24,722
I don't know where Bamee is, Baiwan.

589
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:26,662
He didn't pick up anyone's calls.

590
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:28,092
Can you try to call him?

591
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:31,042
Okay.

592
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:42,202
Master Bamee,

593
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:43,912
you're in a very bad mood?

594
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,382
Why didn't you pick up anyone's call?

595
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:50,602
Yeah, I understand.

596
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,762
Where are you now?

597
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,212
What are you doing here?

598
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:33,782
I came to see Bamee, just like you.

599
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,802
He gave you the key?

600
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:41,502
Don't tell me
that you two live together?

601
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,232
Yes, we live together.

602
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:51,472
Come on in!

603
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:09,432
Wait a bit.

604
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:36,992
Bamee is taking a shower

605
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:38,432
and listening to music,

606
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:39,922
so, he didn't hear the bell rang.

607
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:42,632
Did you tell him that
a friend came to see him?

608
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:43,992
I did.

609
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:46,422
But he said,

610
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:48,532
he doesn't want to talk to you.
You can go home.

611
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:50,532
Don't block my way.

612
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:52,422
I know you don't want me
to talk to Bamee.

613
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,732
He's gone, right?

614
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,922
Shit! I don't wanna talk to you.

615
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:33,922
Get out!

616
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:42,562
Get out!

617
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,122
- Get out!
- No!

618
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:11,582
You don't have a fever.

619
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,562
Do you still have a headache?

620
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:19,732
I asked you,
do you still have a headache?

621
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:21,092
Hey!

622
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:23,792
Huh? I don't have a headache now.

623
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,322
Are we gonna talk in this position?

624
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:33,062
If I get up,

625
00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:34,712
you'll chase me out of the room.

626
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,012
No, I won't.

627
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:52,512
Hey! Hey!

628
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:54,872
You almost exposed your eggplant!

629
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:57,452
But it's okay.

630
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:59,752
I got used to it when
taking showers with friends.

631
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:01,102
We all are the same.

632
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,052
Hey!

633
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,162
You screamed out loud.

634
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:10,042
Don't be shy. We are all the same.

635
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:14,842
What's wrong
that you have to come to my house?

636
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,152
Baiwan said that you have a headache.

637
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,462
So, I thought maybe it's because
of that day in the rain.

638
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:21,862
I just want to check up on you.

639
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:23,982
Now you see that I'm fine.

640
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,732
You can go back home.

641
00:44:30,772 --> 00:44:31,752
Hey!

642
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:40,922
I won't chase you away anymore.

643
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:58,415
(Past Senger)

644
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:01,662
He's gonna sleep here tonight.

645
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:04,182
I'm not convenient to have a stranger
to sleep over at my house.

646
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:07,792
Argh! I'm screaming now!

647
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,102
Argh! I'm screaming too!

648
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:11,892
Do I have to scream too?

649
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,392
Argh!

650
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:15,962
They did it even in the campus.

651
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,262
That's right.

652
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:18,972
Baiwan, you need to have
a talk with him.

653
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,822
It's not okay, right?

654
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,210
<i>I want you to know.</i>

655
00:45:30,221 --> 00:45:32,788
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

656
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:37,855
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

657
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:41,436
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

658
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,249
<i>and hug you in my dreams.</i>

659
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,225
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

660
00:45:46,235 --> 00:45:49,078
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

661
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:52,828
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

662
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:55,572
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

663
00:45:55,582 --> 00:46:01,244
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

664
00:46:01,254 --> 00:46:04,134
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

665
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:06,970
<i>and hug you in my dreams.</i>

666
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,181
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

667
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:12,119
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

668
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:17,817
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
