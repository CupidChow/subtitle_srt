(Previous Episode)
Hey!

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,650
What are you trying to do now?

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,290
I'm finding a happiness for myself.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,569
If you wanna get a drink,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,540
come sit next to me.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,400
I want to go home.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,170
I, Ann, and Keng

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,470
discuss about this every day.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,950
We still don't know what to do.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,470
I think there should be some way.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,269
Yeah? How?

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,720
Thunder happens from
the merge of electric charges.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,820
If we use the generator to release
the electric charges inside of me

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,180
in the same amount of the thunder,

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,690
I think it could be possible.

<i>that I might lose everything.</i>

28
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:35,802
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

29
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,677
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

30
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,770
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,630
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

32
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:47,193
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

33
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:50,015
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

34
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:55,648
<i>But I'm still afraid that
I might lose you.</i>

35
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,695
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

36
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:01,406
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

37

<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

39
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:12,320
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,890
You fold them all by yourself?

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,930
1,000 pieces

42
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,370
to make my wish come true.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,790
What about the lights?

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,590
I hired someone to do it.

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,820
You really put effort into it.

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,900
With all that you've done,

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,900
are you sure about this?

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,320
You think I did it out of my emotion?

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,860
Is that why you haven't given me
the answer?

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,600
We quarrel almost every day.

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,340
How could you like me?

52
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't know.

53
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,380
But when I'm with you, I'm super happy.

54
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,320
So happy that
I want to stay like this forever.

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,770
I'm going back to the bar.

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,890
My wish didn't come true, right?

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,530
You can go to work.

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm going to quit,

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,080
because you don't like it.

60
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,230
Hey,

61
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,260
were you at uncle Prach's place
or a military camp?

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,400
You are so well-disciplined.

63
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,410
Well, you don't like a messy room.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,290
Do you wanna take a shower together?

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,180
Eww!

66
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,670
You're so into getting naked.

67
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,670
You go take a shower alone, pervert!

68
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,530
I'll be right back.

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,309
Just taking a shower,

70
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,170
It's not like going to Mars.

71
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,890
Shit, don't tell me that…

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,970
Can I sleep with you?

73
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,340
Calm down first.

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,860
So what?

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,040
Hey!

76
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Have a good night.

77
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,079
Yay!

78
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,390
It's a happy ending.

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,130
Without Baiwan and you two,

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,540
I wouldn't know my feeling.

81
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,590
Because you're too stupid.

82
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,569
Now that Kiew
has to take care of Bamee,

83
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,520
I think I have to find a substitute
to take care of Baiwan.

84
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,130
Who's that?

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,530
Baiwan, have you watched this series?

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,899
I watched all series in this year.

87
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,499
Oh, me too!

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,470
I don't know what to watch anymore.

89
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,879
Do you like Korean series too?

90
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,009
Yes, I do.

91
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,339
I want to tell you many times,

92
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,490
but I don't have a chance.

93
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,530
- I…
- Baiwan!

94
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,870
How is the fish?

95
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,330
It's fine.

96
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,980
This is for the fish.

97
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,250
That's it.

98
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,890
I gotta go. Bye.

99
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,510
It's strange.

100
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,000
He didn't cause a problem today.

101
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,390
He said he regretted it.

102
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,110
Someone like Franc? Regret?

103
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,010
Don't believe him. He's tricky.

104
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,740
What's wrong with you?

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,020
I'm gonna teach you
how to wash veggies.

106
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,580
Look here,

107
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,920
take this off.

108
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Slowly take it off like this.

109
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,740
Rinse it gently.

110
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,440
Who's that?

111
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,780
Oh,

112
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,230
Kiew cooked all this?

113
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,340
Bamee helped too.

114
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,650
I know how to cook a little bit.

115
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,400
Next time you can try my food.

116
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,840
I'll empty my stomach for that.

117
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,900
Wow, it looks yummy.

118
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,450
You have a pretty face
and can cook very well.

119
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,220
You're a man in my dream.

120
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,509
Too bad, your mouth…

121
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,989
Don't eat it then!
You talked too much.

122
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,960
I have to eat because I'm hungry.

123
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,410
Let's eat.

124
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,700
Here, I took the bones out already.

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,060
Thank you.

126
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,790
Hey, you two!

127
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,949
It's nothing.

128
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,589
Don't think too much.

129
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,029
- Right?
- Yeah, right.

130
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,620
You two are suspicious.

131
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,250
How is it?

132
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,810
How?

133
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
How suspicious?

134
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,280
Yeah.

135
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Really?

136
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,989
Yeah.

137
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,230
Let's eat now.
They're getting cold.

138
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,320
Come, let's eat.

139
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,809
Here's for you, brother.

140
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,880
Who's your brother?

141
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Are you gonna eat it or not?

142
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,319
Did you disobey your brother?

143
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,829
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

144
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,939
I have one and only brother.

145
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Alright. Okay.

146
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,580
The real brother will take care of you.

147
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
Can you take care of me, too?

148
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,770
- You can take care of yourself.
- Please do it for me.

149
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,880
Will I survive tonight?

150
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,050
Hey,

151
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
what are you doing?

152
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,330
Don't rebel.

153
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,630
Do as I say.

154
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,820
Hey, are you sadistic?

155
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,370
You'll know it.

156
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,120
Slowly open your eyes.

157
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,870
I want to stargaze with you.

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
That's the Northern lights.

159
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,630
Let's see it for real someday.

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,420
Do we have such beautiful lights
in our world?

161
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,890
Yeah.

162
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,940
Where is it?

163
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,800
Norway, Canada,

164
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,750
and other countries.

165
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,680
Let's work and earn money.

166
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,640
We'll visit all countries together.

167
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,670
Let's do it.

168
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,130
Hello.

169
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,010
We're applying for a job.

170
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,210
What's your name?

171
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm Bamee.

172
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,100
I'm Kiew.

173
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,340
You can wipe the tables.

174
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,190
The tools are over there.

175
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,890
And you,

176
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,940
practice how to make a coffee.

177
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,359
Take it out like this.

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,920
Do it gently. Be careful.

179
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,919
Let's check if it's the right angle.

180
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,029
Okay.

181
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,420
Then, you use this thing

182
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,230
to make the coffee flat

183
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,240
by turning it inside 3 times.

184
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,060
Turn it inside.

185
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,869
3 times already?

186
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

187
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,570
Then, we use this thing

188
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,860
to press the coffee to make it tighter.

189
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,430
Hey, wait.

190
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,019
This is too hard.

191
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,700
Use only one third of your force.

192
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,100
Okay.

193
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,030
Do it gently.

194
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,799
- Okay?
- Okay.

195
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,050
Okay.

196
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,870
Then we use this thing.

197
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,070
- Yes.
- Take it to the coffee machine.

198
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,159
When you put it in,

199
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,310
make sure it's clicked.
It has to be like this.

200
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,320
Do you know the relationship
between me and Bamee?

201
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,350
It's none of my business.

202
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,360
So, you really want to do this?

203
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
I quit.

204
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,160
You need to earn
your tuition fee, don't you?

205
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,719
Do you want to ask Bamee first?

206
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,180
Then tell me later.

207
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,030
How's it?

208
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,709
It's an easy job. We can earn a lot of money.

209
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,439
The working time doesn't overlap
with studying.

210
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,730
It's very difficult to find a job like this.

211
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,410
But I think Soda is suspicious.

212
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,169
We can keep working for now.

213
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,630
Maybe there's nothing serious.

214
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,360
But if you don't feel okay,

215
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,410
we can find a new job.

216
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,210
If we can find a better place,
we can quit right away.

217
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,150
What should I do
while we're still working there?

218
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,430
Do nothing.

219
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,760
Just trust in me.

220
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,170
I'm not the only one feeling

221
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,590
that they're looking at us, right?

222
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,420
Did we do something wrong?

223
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,200
Bamee, you're in trouble!

224
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,880
Hey!

225
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,130
Everyone misunderstands you now.

226
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,130
They think
that you work in a sex industry.

227
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,679
Do you know who took this video?

228
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,500
Why did they discredit you this way?

229
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,730
I have no idea.

230
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,950
I know who did it.

231
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,400
Baiwan sees the fish
I gave her every day.

232
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
She must miss me somehow.

233
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,409
- That's right.
- Right, boss.

234
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,629
Ouch!

235
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,949
- You're a snake in the grass!
- Don't, Kiew! Don't!

236
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,890
Hey!

237
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,400
Hey, hey, hey!

238
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
Everybody, don't do this!

239
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,550
Stop it now!

240
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,329
Everyone, stop it! Stop! Stop!

241
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,750
Can't you hear me? I told you to stop!

242
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,119
Here, compress your wounds first,

243
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,760
so, they won't be swollen.

244
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,530
I told you a person like
Franc won't regret anything.

245
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,429
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,000
Using violence to solve a problem?

247
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,809
You know what,

248
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,049
the president of the
Thailand beautiful fish association

249
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,419
doesn't compromise.

250
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,950
He wants to put you all into prison.

251
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,570
Why do you have to be afraid…?

252
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,580
Uncle Keng is a judge.

253
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,720
He can find a way to help us for sure.

254
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,660
Don't think that you have a back-up

255
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,890
and you can act like
a gangster like this.

256
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,680
Next time, I'll let you all go to jail.

257
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,710
Hello, I'm here to
bail these students out.

258
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,709
You can bail only 3 of them.

259
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,960
Someone has bailed
Mr. Ekkawee out already.

260
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,760
Who bailed me out?

261
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,500
It's me.

262
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,800
Either you were forced to do this
or whatever reason it is,

263
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,060
thank you.

264
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,650
But next time
you don't have to help me.

265
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,980
Bamee!

266
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,450
What are you gonna blame me for?

267
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,540
There's no one around.

269
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,600
You don't have to pretend
to be my kind stepmother.

270
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,010
Bamee, can you listen to my mom first?

271
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,080
I didn't give you the money

272
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,779
because I hoped that

273
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,240
when you couldn't stand the tough life,
you would get back home.

274
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
But I was wrong.

275
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,050
Everything got worse.

276
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
A family

277
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,930
is still a family despite
how often we quarrel.

278
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,740
Go back to our home, Bamee.

279
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,990
I haven't seen you
for a long time, Pim.

280
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,970
You are still handsome as always.

281
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,480
I'm not a cruel witch
who is mean all the time.

282
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,130
You could hear me?

283
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,520
Thanks to everyone
for taking care of Bamee.

284
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,380
Let this meal be my treat.

285
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,270
I like eating for free.

286
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,470
Bamee, can you share
what you did at the bar?

287
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,910
Just a waiter.

288
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,720
I can guarantee.
I saw him working at the bar.

289
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,969
Franc discredited Bamee.

290
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,570
How could we not get angry?

291
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,419
No matter how angry you are,

292
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,580
you can't use violence as a way out.

293
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,190
Yes, dad.

294
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,520
Franc's dad won't accept this.

295
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,919
We have to find evidences
to confirm who did this.

296
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,790
So, Franc's dad won't dare
to bother us anymore.

297
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Brilliant!

298
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,130
That's why you are a judge's daughter.

299
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,610
A bunch of my friends
are experts in technology.

300
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,510
I'll ask them for help.

301
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,730
What can we do
to stop the misunderstanding?

302
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,490
A live press conference?

303
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,870
They'll say it's an excuse.

304
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,700
I found him now.

305
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,980
The famous person of the campus.

306
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,900
What are you doing?

307
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,100
I swear that Bamee

308
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,400
is not like what you all think he is.

309
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,130
Anyone who slept with Bamee,

310
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,710
bring your evidence to show to get

311
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,420
50,000 Baht.

312
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,150
But if you lie,

313
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,340
I'll sue you for 500,000 Baht.

314
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,560
That's it for now.

315
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,060
I did this

316
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,090
in hope
that things can get a bit better.

317
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,230
How did you come here?

318
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,300
Engineering, junior year.

319
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,130
See you at the café.

320
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,710
Who's that?

321
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,040
The coffee shop's owner.

322
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,990
Freaking cool!

323
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,200
You have such blunt eyes.

324
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,850
What's up, Moodaeng?

325
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,570
Huh? What?

326
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,350
Oh, I got hurt so badly
without any reason.

327
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,370
It sucks.

328
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,610
You didn't do it for real?

329
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,010
Of course!

330
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,500
I'm manly enough.

331
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,820
Who blamed you for this?

332
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,340
I wanna know, too.

333
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,580
So unlucky.

334
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,190
Don't let me know who did it.

335
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,540
Ouch, it hurts.

336
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,910
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

337
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,840
We now know that you didn't do it.

338
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,780
A customer just posted it for fun.

339
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,630
Someone shared it in a university page.

340
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,890
We are sorry.

341
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,310
You're freaking manly!

342
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,260
We accept

343
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,470
that we are wrong.

344
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,390
Then,

345
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,170
we have to say sorry to you too

346
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,390
that we messed with you.

347
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,300
Let's be friends.

348
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,550
Thank you very much.

349
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,940
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

350
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,470
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

351
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,990
Please wait for a moment.

352
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
This is the last order.

353
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,570
Are you okay?

354
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,150
Thank you for doing
the live to help me.

355
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,300
I'm glad that I got to help you.

356
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,520
Hello, what's up?

357
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,180
Hang out where?

358
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,620
There's a place to hang out here?

359
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,670
Of course! A fun place.

360
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,280
Seriously, it's not dangerous, right?

361
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,070
I love you all so much.

362
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,450
I wouldn't let you do scary things.

363
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,710
This is the way to the Pho tree.

364
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,990
That's where we're going.

365
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,230
The Pho tree? Why do we go there?

366
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,820
Ouija board?

367
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,170
No way! I'm scared.

368
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,190
You're scared of the tree,
just like your dad.

369
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,359
Hasn't my dad told you

370
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,099
that he's scared because

371
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,199
the priest Phuang Ngoen is very sacred?

372
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,010
Don't ever disrespect him.

373
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,840
My dad told me the same thing.

374
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,360
But if the priest was really sacred,
my dad wouldn't die.

375
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,640
When dad's car overturned,

376
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,760
you asked the priest to help our dad?

377
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,030
Ghosts, spirits, priests,

378
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,020
they aren't real.

379
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,100
Don't waste our time playing here.

380
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,336
But everyone says that

381
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,150
when they play here,
the glass really moves.

382
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,790
They pushed it themselves.

383
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,839
But I wanna play.

384
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,559
Please play with me. Please. Please.

385
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,070
- Alright. Alright.
- Okay.

386
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,830
Hey, it means that I have to play, too?

387
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,860
I don't play it.

388
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,040
If you don't, walk back by yourself.

389
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,150
It's so dark, who would dare to do so?

390
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,370
You have no choice.

391
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,319
If the priest is real,

392
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,130
please come in this glass.

393
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,580
Argh! Who's screaming?

394
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,230
Kiew! Don't be kidding.

395
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,520
Not me.

396
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,190
Or we hurt the priest
when we put the incense there?

397
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,540
Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,870
Do it.

399
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,009
Arghhh. It's obvious!

400
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,560
Nobody spoke.

401
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,239
A ghost is here!

402
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,560
Arghhhhhh!

403
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,840
A crazy woman!

404
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,799
Ouch, ants bite me!

405
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,150
Ants bite me! Ouch.

406
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,890
I almost believe that ghosts are real.

407
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
(Home)

408
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,720
Argh!

409
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,120
It's me.

410
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,660
Hey, Kiew!

411
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,559
Stay concentrated.

412
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,090
I'm going to ask now.

413
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,090
(Home)

414
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,020
The priest, are you for real?

415
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,639
The glass doesn't move.

416
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,599
Maybe he's not for real.

417
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,670
Let's stop playing now.

418
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,820
This is just the first question.

419
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,960
He might not want to answer this.

420
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,450
Let's change the question.

421
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,440
Who pushed it?

422
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,000
Go home?

423
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,750
He wants us to go home.

424
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,420
Let's go home.

425
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,930
P

426
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,280
H

427
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,160
O

428
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,370
NG

429
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,389
S

430
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,680
EE

431
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,160
Phongsee?
Is that your name?

432
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,510
You didn't push it, right?

433
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,399
The priest is for real.

434
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,489
When I count 1 to 3,

435
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,630
take your finger out.

436
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,530
One, two, arghhhh.

437
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
No one knows my mom's name.

438
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,190
Why did the glass know how to spell her name?

439
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,880
Or I'm really here
because of the priest?

440
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,220
Hey!

441
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,420
You thought that
the priest follows you here?

442
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm just thinking about things.

443
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,029
Come on,

444
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,070
bring your mind home.

445
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,380
The glass didn't just move.
Let's say that it ran.

446
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,370
No one pushed it at all.

447
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,370
My parents said
that the priest is real.

448
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,840
You shouldn't challenge him like that.

449
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,920
At that time I was forced to do it.

450
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,980
Hey!

451
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,720
You played something fun
without telling me.

452
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,790
We didn't intend to go.

453
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,720
I made this for you.

454
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,060
Eat well so you can study well.

455
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,300
Bamee's smart enough.
He doesn't have to eat it.

456
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,870
I'm not so smart. I can eat it instead.

457
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,800
I knew you would make this excuse.

458
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,120
So, I cooked something for everyone.

459
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,500
Don't forget to eat it.

460
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,440
I told Ann and Keng about
the Ouija board spelling your mom's name.

461
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,640
What did they say?

462
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,440
Ann will consult
with the spiritual leader.

463
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,380
What is it?

464
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,539
A fortune-teller it is.

465
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,409
You confused me.

466
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,459
Ann is an expert in spiritual beliefs.

467
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,400
She knows a lot of
great fortune tellers.

468
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,919
Kiew, if science doesn't work,

469
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,530
try the black magic.

470
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,630
Please wait for a moment.

471
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,530
You wanna try touching my cheeks too?

472
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,949
The cup is cold,

473
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,000
so, your hand must be super cold.

474
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,820
Getting warmer now?

475
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,650
You'd better work!

476
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,909
Hey!

477
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,100
How did you seal the cup, huh?

478
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,100
Ouch!

479
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,540
I'm sorry.

480
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,880
You'll get in trouble hurting
the customer.

481
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,380
Let me deal with it.

482
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,420
Hey!

483
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,460
Don't be furious in my coffee shop.

484
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,390
This is your money.

485
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,040
Get out!

486
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,040
Come with me.

487
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,100
Give me your shirt.

488
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,770
I'll wash it.

489
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,770
No…

490
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,950
Just do as I say.

491
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,830
Did he do something to you?

492
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,070
He just gave me
a t-shirt to get changed.

493
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,220
Bamee! Kiew!

494
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,779
Hello.

495
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,639
Are you here to buy a cup of coffee,
aunt Pim?

496
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,880
I can make a coffee for you.

497
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,000
It's free of charge.

498
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,539
This customer can drink for free
for a lifetime.

499
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,759
Hello, aunt Pim.

500
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,850
Hello there.

501
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,700
Do you know each other?

502
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,619
Soda is my friend's son.

503
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,080
I made desserts to sell here
since the first day.

504
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,540
Your desserts are yummy.

505
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,640
They are all sold out within 2 hours.

506
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,990
I work here in the evening,
so I haven't seen you delivering the desserts here.

507
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,010
Bamee and Kiew are lucky
to work with Soda.

508
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,290
He's studying,
doing business, and cooking.

509
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,590
He's good at everything.

510
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,450
He is the real millionaire
at a young age.

511
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,159
Please take care of them.

512
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,250
No worries.

513
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
No more tiredness.

514
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:24,059
Hey, today someone's trying to flirt
with Bamee in front of Kiew.

515
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,650
He's so brazen.

516
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,139
His name is Soda.

517
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,120
Soda…

518
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,319
Is it him?

519
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Hey,

520
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,830
did you know him?

521
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,970
A son of my mom's friend.

522
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,400
Too bad Bamee and Soda
met each other too late.

523
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,249
Don't feel that way.

524
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,840
If they met before,
would you support him?

525
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,900
He's super perfect.

526
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,460
I have to support him for sure!

527
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,310
He's the scary competitor for Kiew.

528
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,100
Do you think that.

529
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,570
Bamee will change his mind?

530
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,310
You said it that
we all have a right to choose.

531
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,970
If Kiew does something wrong,

532
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,550
Bamee might fall for Soda.

533
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,210
I want to stay like this.

534
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,369
Aunt Pim asked me
to go home many times.

535
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,730
I'm thoughtful for her feeling.

536
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,070
You can sleepover
at my place sometimes.

537
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,830
I'll go for sure.

538
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,560
I'm home now, dad.

539
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,240
Hey!

540
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,780
Kiew looks exactly like his dad.

541
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,000
Kitti Tirakan.

542
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,410
Hey!

543
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:59,463
Translated by 9 Days team.

544
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:02,470
(Past Senger)

545
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:04,880
Who are you?

546
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,582
Your boyfriend.

547
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,049
You know that uncle Kiew
has disappeared for a long time.

548
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,740
Why are you fooling uncle Prach and us?

549
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,810
I've never met someone
with such a strange fate.

550
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,170
- The priest Phuang Ngoen.
- Hey!

551
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,079
I'm here because of him?

552
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,600
Don't disrespect him again!

553
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,860
Complete your unfinished task for him.

554
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:36,000
But we redeemed all vows already.

555
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,210
Not yet!

556
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,650
You haven't completed all
that you promised to do.

557
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,060
Think about it carefully.

558
00:46:42,902 --> 00:46:45,511
<i>I want you to know.</i>

559
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,259
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

560
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:53,537
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

561
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:56,907
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

562
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:59,720
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

563
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:01,696
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

564
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:04,549
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

565
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,299
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

566
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:11,043
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

567
00:47:11,053 --> 00:47:16,715
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

568
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:19,605
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

569
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:22,441
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

570
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,652
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

571
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:27,590
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

572
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:33,288
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
