If Soda was sitting next to me right now,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,900
it would be nice.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,058
Hey!

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,344
Why did you push Kiew?

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:17,990
He's trying to touch my cheek.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,065
My arm is hurt.
It takes ages to finish cleaning.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,490
I can do it for you.

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,345
But I don't want you to.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,750
You said you want to recover
soon, so, you can leave me?

12

Bamee!

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,360
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,269

- Bamee!

Bamee! Bamee!

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,470

Bamee, Bamee.

43
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,619
You and I promised that we will go
see the Northern lights together.

44
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,029
I want to go,

45
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:24,699
but not with you.

46
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,638
And if you wake me up
for nonsense again,

47
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:31,903
you'll be in trouble.

48
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,749
What do I do to restore his memories?

49
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,071
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

50
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,349
Can you remember now?

51
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,079
Yeah.

52
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,869
Can you remember

53
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,389
why I called you on that day?
To do some mission?

54
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,639
Err…

55
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,399
You lied to me
so, you can go home, right?

56
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,799
I'm not easy to fool.

57
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:44,889
For me, you are the missing piece.

58
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,307
Soda lets Bamee take a break
because his arm hurts.

59
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:52,999
Look now,

60
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,929
he looks at his face all day.

61
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,028
If it goes on like this,

62
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,819
Soda will win Bamee's heart.

63
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,489
Taking him to places
he's been to doesn't work.

64
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:07,559
Giving him things that he's
impressed with, he can't remember.

65
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,618
I think we have to
use the maximum level

66
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,073
to make him remember.

67
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,619
What is the maximum level?

68
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:22,459
Depends on how intimate
the two of you were.

69
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,159
Shoot!

70
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,339
Shoot!

71
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,479
Shoot! Shoot!

72
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,969
To the left, left.

73
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,369
Let's do it.

74
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,818
Hey, what the hell is this?

75
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,439
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

76
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,459
Where are you going?

77
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,488
- Hey!
- Ouch!

78
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,799
My arm! Kiew! Ouch!

79
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,929
It hurts. Ouch,

80
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:06,689
ouch.

81
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,559
Ouch!

82
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,359
I have to do it
to restore your memories.

83
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,559
Ouch.

84
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,139
Ouch.

85
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,939
Ouch!

86
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,329
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

87
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,786
This is how you restore my memories?

88
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,799
You do it for your own pleasure.

89
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,748
I'm not that horny like you think.

90
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,338
If you think this is going to heal me,

91
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,439
you must be very stupid.

92
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,299
I wouldn't be so impressed with your sexual
ability that it could restore my memory.

93
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,260
Maybe, living alone

94
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,899
can make me remember you
better than living together.

95
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:04,519
Bamee!

96
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,779
(Bamee's calling)

97
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,348
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

98
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,779
<i>But I'm still afraid.</i>

99
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,279
Hello.

100
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,766
How did you know
that your room key is with me?

101
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:36,999
Hey, Bamee.

102
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,739
Professor Anek called you.

103
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:48,329
Plawan, do it now.

104
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:14,249
Why didn't you say anything
at that moment?

105
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,089
Then I wouldn't know

106
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:17,969
what a bad plan you guys have for me.

107
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,539
We are doing this for you.

108
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,399
He's trying to rape me.

109
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,819
It's not right.

110
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,539
Yeah,

111
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,949
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,729
I will give you the key.

113
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,539
Hold up.

114
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,369
The more I see you,

115
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,199
the more I get confused.

116
00:09:58,259 --> 00:09:59,559
It's like…

117
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,289
I like you.

118
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,749
Bamee!

119
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,698
Ouch!

120
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,099
How could you do this to me?

121
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,279
We all have the right to choose.

122
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,309
I already chose.

123
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,659
You can choose again.

124
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,198
Bring back good memories now!

125
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,988
Bring back good memories now!

126
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,019
- Moodaeng!
- Bring back good memories now!

127
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,248
- Bring back good memories now!
- Moodaeng! Moodaeng!

128
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,488
He'll get hurt. Calm down!

129
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,999
- Bring back good memories now!
- Moodaeng! Moodaeng!

130
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,839
Calm down!

131
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,858
How could you do this to me?

132
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,859
- Damn!
- Moodaeng!

133
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,239
Dad taught us that

134
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,959
brothers have to share.

135
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,419
Didn't Moodaeng listen to dad at all?

136
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,859
You knew

137
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,039
that...

138
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,759
he did it out of sickness.

139
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,759
Don't overthink it.

140
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,779
It's not about that.

141
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:21,309
What is it about?

142
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,798
What if he doesn't recover

143
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,839
and becomes like this forever?

144
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,038
What a coincidence

145
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,148
that your dad was away

146
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,889
and you asked me to sleepover here.

147
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,739
Or I wouldn't see
how severe Bamee's condition is.

148
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:44,879
Calm down.

149
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:49,465
The doctor said it takes time.

150
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,709
He'll recover soon.

151
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,009
Let's go to sleep.

152
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,899
The more I see you,

153
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,248
the more I get confused.

154
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,699
It's like…

155
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:32,359
I like you.

156
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,628
Maybe, living alone

157
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,329
can make me remember you
better than living together.

158
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,299
Where did you go?

159
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:28,544
Moodaeng is mad at me because of you.

160
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,799
You went to see Plawan?

161
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,306
Why was Moodaeng mad at you?

162
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,564
Shit, it's worse than we think.

163
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:48,719
That's right.

164
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,499
I don't know what to do now.

165
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,459
There should be some way to bring
back Bamee's memories. Keep finding,

166
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:58,918
we'll find it eventually.

167
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,279
It's not just about memories.

168
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,548
Bamee doesn't feel guilty
for what he does.

169
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,383
I feel sorry for Moodaeng.

170
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,021
Hold up.

171
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:23,914
The more I see you,

172
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,282
the more I get confused.

173
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,452
It's like…

174
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,207
I like you.

175
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,243
Hey, what's wrong?

176
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm worried a little bit.

177
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:42,647
It's not a little bit, I think.

178
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,147
Can I help you with anything?

179
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:45,833
No, you can't.

180
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,333
Forget it.

181
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,727
I'll feel better soon.

182
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,082
Last night, I almost had sex with Kiew.

183
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,669
I think he wants to do
what he used to do.

184
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,043
Don't tell me that.

185
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,239
I and Kiew used to…

186
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,190
Yeah.

187
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:16,934
Ewww,

188
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,551
I feel disgusted
just thinking about it.

189
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,012
It's better to do it with you
than with Kiew.

190
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,826
Then,

191
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,251
we have to make Kiew decide
to leave by himself.

192
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,093
So, aunt Pim won't get mad at you.

193
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:34,881
From now on,

194
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,179
you don't have to work at my café.

195
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,636
You're firing me?

196
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,008
As I said it.

197
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,480
You want Bamee to stay away from me,

198
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,108
so, he can't remember me,

199
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,363
then you will take him from me, right?

200
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,618
Evil!

201
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,384
You can curse me however you want.

202
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,392
I just want Bamee
to feel the most at ease.

203
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,509
I hope you get me.

204
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:11,506
It's been 2 weeks

205
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,186
that I've tried to bring back
Bamee's memories.

206
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:16,569
He still can't remember me.

207
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,239
Forgetting you doesn't affect my life.

208
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,271
I used to take his photo?

209
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,958
At that time,
you thought I was high on drugs.

210
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:26,964
Can you remember anything?

211
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,092
Yes, I can.

212
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,347
What is it?

213
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:33,543
I shouldn't take his photos to waste
my phone memory's space.

214
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,509
Hey, hey, ouch!

215
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:40,721
Argh!

216
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:45,534
I did this to make you realize that

217
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:46,928
I used to do this with you.

218
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,417
I can't remember anything.

219
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,494
What is this? No, I wont take it.

220
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,609
It's like a children toy.

221
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:02,013
I'm scared, priest.

222
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,377
I'm scared that I can't go back in time
to rescue my mom's life.

223
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,135
I don't know what to do now.

224
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,379
Please help me.
Please make Bamee remember me again.

225
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,989
Did he change the password?

226
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,768
If he can't get in the room,

227
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,109
he has to stay at uncle Prach's.

228
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,779
You're super smart.

229
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,599
I'll do everything to make you happy.

230
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,193
Wait.

231
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,031
Bamee.

232
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,531
Mommy!

233
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:38,907
I miss you so much.

234
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,017
I miss you too.

235
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:42,998
Soda told me that

236
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,453
you're so stressed being
with Kiew alone.

237
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,128
So, I came here to take you home.

238
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,179
Yes!

239
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,315
You're having fun.

240
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,599
In a good mood now?

241
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,808
Yeah. I can't get mad at Bamee.

242
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,207
Whoa, if I had a brother like you,

243
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,330
I would be so happy.

244
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,683
Are you happy having
a boyfriend like me?

245
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,834
I'm happier than having you
as a brother.

246
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,823
Let me continue my game.

247
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,897
Hello, aunt Pim.

248
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,091
Whoa, you look so happy to be home.

249
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,847
Of course, I'm free
from an annoying person.

250
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,089
Mom prepared a lot of food for you.

251
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:37,445
Take your stuff upstairs and
come have a meal together.

252
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:38,072
Yes, mom.

253
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,442
Shit!

254
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,371
Aunt Pim asked me to stay here

255
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,287
until you can remember everything.

256
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:58,600
Hey!

257
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:02,587
If you love your mom,

258
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,381
don't make her worried.

259
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:06,895
She has good intentions for you.

260
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:18,909
These are your favorite dishes.

261
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,247
Eat a lot.

262
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,040
I don't feel like eating.

263
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,302
Do you want me to feed you?

264
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:29,920
I can feed you too.

265
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:31,223
It's not funny.

266
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,242
Let's spend some more time together.

267
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,872
I want you to be the same old you.

268
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,536
If nothing works,

269
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:42,723
Then I'll give up.

270
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:49,953
Alright, mom.

271
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,674
I used to do this to you.

272
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,639
Can you remember anything?

273
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,359
No.

274
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,873
Take some rest, mommy. Sit here.

275
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:26,928
I'll massage you.

276
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,205
I have 4 sons now.

277
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:31,601
I don't get to be tired.

278
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,818
I'm afraid
you'll be 4 times more tired.

279
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:36,039
They are not easy to deal with.

280
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,208
Kiew is here.

281
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:43,661
It might help Bamee to recover faster.

282
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:45,955
Don't worry, mom.

283
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:47,539
We have...

284
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,169
a lot of plans.

285
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,089
Aunt Pim asked you
to help me wash the dishes.

286
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,752
Hey, I already took a shower.

287
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,681
- Today is a Songkran.
- Hey, my house is dirty now, Kiew.

288
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:41,365
I don't play like that.

289
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:46,061
Let's try. Maybe you
can remember something.

290
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,336
You should apologize
to Moodaeng and Plawan.

291
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,981
Don't be nosy to tell me
what to do and what not to do.

292
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:28,001
They don't get mad at you.

293
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,972
Don't you realize
how much they love you?

294
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,439
Bamee! Bamee!

295
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:47,510
What?

296
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,026
Tonight the sky is full of stars.
Let's stargaze.

297
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,041
Nope.

298
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,436
I hope tomorrow you wake up

299
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,027
and remember me right away.

300
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:57,848
I'll go first.

301
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,238
No, I'll go first.

302
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,318
I'll go first.

303
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,778
No, you can't. I'll go first.

304
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:03,349
A badass boy!

305
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,981
Early lovebirds.

306
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,438
- Let's find someone like this for us.
- Let me copy your homework.

307
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:13,855
They're crazy.

308
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:15,652
For you.

309
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:19,781
You're being sweet.

310
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,363
Did you do something wrong?

311
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:23,467
Shit,

312
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:25,743
I'm being nice and you
still find faults with me?

313
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,231
No more for next time.

314
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,912
Whoa, you're super sensitive.

315
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,248
Yeah.

316
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:35,779
I want you to appreciate me.

317
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:37,117
I have a heart too.

318
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,415
Oh, I thought it's with me.

319
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:42,124
Yeah,

320
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,894
that's why I'm here.
I want you to feel confident

321
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:46,659
that Bamee can't change my mind.

322
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:50,994
- Come here.
- What? Where are you going?

323
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:53,626
What are you doing?

324
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,090
What are you doing?

325
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:58,257
What?

326
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,589
Thank you.

327
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:06,788
I'll go to class now.

328
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:20,546
You peeped?

329
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,098
I wanted to see when you're shy.

330
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,808
But you dragged him out of sight.

331
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,790
Did you two kiss?

332
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:29,168
It's about me and my servant.

333
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:32,506
Shit, I bet they kissed for sure.

334
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:34,800
Don't be too nosy.

335
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,799
Muah, muah, muah, muah.

336
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,354
Damn, you guys! Let me kick you!

337
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:01,599
I'm here to take Bamee only.

338
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,069
We're going to the same destination.

339
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,063
If aunt Pim knows,

340
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:06,814
you won't look good.

341
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:09,590
Don't make me get violent.

342
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,539
I'm gonna shout for aunt Pim.

343
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,349
You'll get scolded.

344
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,023
Have you watched
the latest series I sent you?

345
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,756
I watched 2 episodes already.

346
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,668
I'm so into the main actor.

347
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,038
I knew you would like
this series for sure.

348
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:42,692
You know me more and more every day.

349
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:44,193
Because...

350
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:45,639
I want to win your heart.

351
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:56,406
I think you've almost run out of
this. So, I brought a new one for you.

352
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,259
How's the fish?

353
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:04,466
It bred a lot.

354
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:05,718
Really?

355
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:07,369
Then,

356
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,289
next time I will change
the tank for you.

357
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,913
So, the fish can live in a wider space.

358
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:13,378
Okay?

359
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,254
Yeah.

360
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:16,153
You said you won't flirt with her?

361
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,361
You like Baiwan, right?

362
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,511
That's why you make
such annoyed face

363
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,516
every time I talk to her.

364
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,610
You already knew.
Why do you still flirt with her?

365
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:31,845
It's my own business.

366
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,326
Don't be stressed.

367
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:37,547
I gave up on dreaming,

368
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:40,591
so, Baiwan won't feel pressured.

369
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:43,962
What about you?

370
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:46,926
Try harder.

371
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,223
You may be luckier than me

372
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,270
to win her heart.

373
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,026
Hi,

374
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:20,688
I saw that two guys were talking to you.

375
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,624
Where did you go to worship?
Take me there, too.

376
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:24,838
I've never done that.

377
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,367
If you do,
a bunch of men will chase after you.

378
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,748
Pong is kinda handsome too.

379
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:31,590
Have you said yes to him yet?

380
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:35,645
He seems to be the right one,

381
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,285
but he's not.

382
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:40,538
I don't know how to explain.

383
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:42,058
Or are you confused?

384
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,988
Because Franc's behavior is
a lot better now.

385
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,859
I don't know.

386
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:49,148
Ouch!

387
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:50,848
I feel uneasey.
My chest is going to burst.

388
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,295
I want to be the one
who chooses too.

389
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:57,502
- She's so lucky.
- Yes.

390
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,160
Hi there!

391
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,249
I knew you would be here.

392
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:44,580
You're fired. What
are you doing here?

393
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:46,078
I'm here for a coffee.

394
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:47,618
It's a coffee shop, isn't it?

395
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,328
Come here now, I'm gonna order.

396
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,347
Come here now.

397
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,198
Another one, just like this.

398
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:15,045
Shall we spice it up a little bit,

399
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:16,730
so that he'll leave...?

400
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:19,004
Let's do it.

401
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,131
We're busy.

402
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:28,400
Aunt Pim!

403
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,288
You fooled me.

404
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,059
Who did it?

405
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:43,438
I just missed aunt Pim,

406
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,683
so, I called her name.

407
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:52,879
I'm closing the shop.

408
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:53,879
You can go.

409
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,582
I can't go.

410
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:58,715
I asked my friends to come here.

411
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,831
Hello, everyone.

412
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,890
Let's study in a green space.

413
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,976
My badass boy will learn faster.

414
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,201
You guys are trying to block me
and Bamee, right?

415
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:23,414
It has to be that way for now.

416
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,508
Once Bamee is fully recovered,

417
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,792
you can flirt with him again.

418
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:29,834
If you win because you take advantage,

419
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,111
you won't be proud.

420
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:39,842
Bamee,

421
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:42,044
please go with me after work today.

422
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:43,746
Where to?

423
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:55,781
We used to play Ouija board here.

424
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,780
Yeah, I remembered.

425
00:32:59,099 --> 00:32:59,971
He can remember!

426
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:01,908
Just me,

427
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,759
you,

428
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,173
and Moodaeng.

429
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:07,874
Then you knew that the priest is real.

430
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:10,363
Yeah,

431
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:11,788
but I don't want to play it anymore.

432
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:15,332
Don't you want to know

433
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,343
if your memories can come back?

434
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,042
I can answer for the priest.

435
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,165
I can't remember you.

436
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:25,616
You stick to me like glue. If I'd remembered
you, it would've happened already.

437
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:32,998
It's fine that you don't play.

438
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:34,669
But since we're here,

439
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,446
let's pray and make a wish
to the priest.

440
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:39,669
Good.

441
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:41,873
I have something to wish for.

442
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,964
I wish that I will be free
from Kiew as soon as possible.

443
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:52,645
Amen!

444
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,268
I wish that Bamee will recover
from dementia.

445
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,249
Amen.

446
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,564
I think the priest heard us.

447
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,497
Let's see whose prayer will come true.

448
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:34,827
After we prayed,

449
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,965
suddenly it was so windy.

450
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,601
I don't know that the priest will grant
our prayer or Bamee's.

451
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,178
But there are 3 of you,

452
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,459
Bamee is just one.

453
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,123
The priest must choose the majority.

454
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,369
Yes, I agree with him.

455
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,340
If the priest grants our prayer,

456
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,474
I will dress him
with colorful fabrics.

457
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:06,395
You have something for her again.

458
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,131
It's flirting, right?

459
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,544
I want to cheer Baiwan up,

460
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:15,672
so, she's energized to restore
Bamee's memories.

461
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:23,835
Here, for you guys.

462
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:25,623
Does it mean that

463
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:27,546
I flirt with all of you?

464
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:31,838
Franc! It's you again!

465
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:34,338
Hey, Bamee, wait, wait.

466
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,258
What's wrong with you?

467
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,570
Hey, listen to me first.

468
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,718
Calm down, hey.

469
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,218
Hey, calm down.

470
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,368
- Bamee, hold up! Hey!
- Hey! Wait!

471
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,465
- Calm down Bamee!
- Hey!

472
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:49,978
Hey!

473
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,850
Bamee! Listen to me first, Bamee!

474
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,242
Bamee, listen to me first.

475
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,764
Bamee, hold up! Bamee!

476
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:10,180
Move away!

477
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,646
Hey!

478
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:09,968
- Argh!
- What's wrong?

479
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:13,739
Ouch! You let Franc get away.

480
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:16,404
- Bamee!
- Do you have a headache, Bamee?

481
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:17,837
Very much.

482
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:19,752
Let's take him to rest.

483
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,574
Come with me, slowly.

484
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,727
Ouch.

485
00:37:24,728 --> 00:37:25,643
Slowly, slowly.

486
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:38,087
Sit slowly.

487
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:39,217
Do it slowly.

488
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,661
Is it an effect from the accident?

489
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,356
Do you want to go to the doctor?

490
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:54,178
No, it's alright.

491
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:55,481
Ouch.

492
00:37:58,508 --> 00:37:59,842
Hey, what are you doing?

493
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:01,857
Nothing.

494
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:03,020
Give me your mobile phone.

495
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:08,783
Come on, give it to me.

496
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:09,616
Hey!

497
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,447
If you don't want to do another round,

498
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,244
do it quickly.

499
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:39,811
Run! Go!

500
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,803
You said that you will be quiet,
won't you?

501
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:00,677
Ouch!

502
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:20,285
Shit!

503
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,248
Eat nicely.

504
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:50,965
Wake up now!

505
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:15,551
Kiew!

506
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,960
Why are you staring at me?

507
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:29,971
I'm mad that you for
let Franc get away.

508
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:32,517
He doesn't seem okay.

509
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:33,273
Let's take him to the hospital.

510
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:36,638
I'm okay now.

511
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,047
I'm gonna wash my face.

512
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:58,738
<i>I have something in my heart that feels</i>

513
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:04,097
<i>deeper than just being friends.</i>

514
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:05,897
<i>I want you to know.</i>

515
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,117
Bamee!

516
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,707
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

517
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:15,387
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

518
00:42:15,388 --> 00:42:18,247
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

519
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:21,117
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

520
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,247
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

521
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:26,047
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

522
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:29,777
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

523
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:32,487
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

524
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:37,898
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

525
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:41,047
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

526
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:43,687
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

527
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,867
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

528
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:48,317
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

529
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,027
Is it because I bumped into him in
the first place we met,

530
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:50,857
so, I can remember him?

531
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,917
I can remember you now, Kiew!

532
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:56,123
I can remember now!

533
00:42:57,528 --> 00:42:58,506
I can remember now!

534
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,130
I can remember you now, Kiew!

535
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:04,522
I can remember you now, Kiew!

536
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:18,998
Why are you smiling?

537
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,164
You recovered, right?

538
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,102
Err…

539
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:24,059
Kiew!

540
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,099
What?

541
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,551
I feel irritated just seeing you.

542
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:48,799
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,586
Try the Sci, Cos, Tan. Sci, Cos.

544
00:43:58,818 --> 00:43:59,784
I shouldn't study science and math.

545
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:02,037
We should study together.

546
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,127
No, no, no.

547
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,827
Supposed there are 7 classrooms.

548
00:44:07,418 --> 00:44:10,028
Then, science classrooms will be...

549
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:12,307
around 4.

550
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,437
Another 3 classrooms are separated.

551
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:16,938
Like this.

552
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:17,661
See,

553
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,197
A-B =

554
00:44:21,198 --> 00:44:22,817
do you understand? Yeah, like that.

555
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:24,047
Hey!

556
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:25,766
You're back to sit next to Kiew?

557
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:29,948
I just moved the chair.

558
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:31,232
It blocks my way.

559
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,761
(Past Senger The Series)

560
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:02,109
The food is ready just in time.

561
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,717
Wow,

562
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,254
they look so yummy, aunt Pim.

563
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:09,177
Err…

564
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:10,985
it's you!

565
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:13,997
You keep calling mommy as aunt Pim.

566
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:15,808
I get confused now.

567
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:17,690
Now you blamed me!

568
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:20,020
You said you wanna have a talk with me?

569
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,770
Why are you lying still
and looking at the stars?

570
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:25,383
You really can't remember me?

571
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:26,904
No, I can't.

572
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,300
At first, I want to wait
until his memories are back.

573
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,638
But my time is up now.

574
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:34,319
I'll call uncle Prach.

575
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:36,797
Then,

576
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,767
I'll get ready in my room.

577
00:45:38,878 --> 00:45:40,489
When you are leaving, just call me.

578
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,202
Can you please not go?

579
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:52,915
If I didn't pretend to ask Moodaeng,

580
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:55,574
you wouldn't admit that you
can remember me now, right?

581
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,106
<i>I want you to know.</i>

582
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:01,760
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

583
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:07,038
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

584
00:46:07,421 --> 00:46:10,394
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

585
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:13,221
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

586
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,197
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

587
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:18,050
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

588
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:21,800
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

589
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,544
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

590
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:30,216
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

591
00:46:30,226 --> 00:46:33,106
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

592
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:35,942
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

593
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:38,153
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

594
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:41,091
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

595
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:46,789
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
