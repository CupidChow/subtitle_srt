You look way too awesome!

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:05,849
I came here to see you.

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:07,036
I can't look too basic..

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,148
Let's go!

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:09,365
Let's go.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,613
Oh, he helps him put on shoes!

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,463
They must be so in love.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,593
Oh, what I see now is already painful,

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,981
and your words make my heart hurt!

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,991
What's wrong with that boy?

11
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:28,636
You don't have to call him.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,916
Give me back my phone!

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,276
You guys' concerns
doesn't make me feel any better.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,724
Don't worry about me.

15
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:42,473
<i>I have something in my heart</i>

16
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:47,661

just being friends.</i>

41
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:30,345
What's wrong that you
have to come to my house?

42
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,921
Baiwan said that you have a headache.

43
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:33,689
So, I just wanted to check up on you.

44
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,800
Now you see that I'm fine.

45
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:37,586
You can go back home.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,423
Hey!

47
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,593
I won't chase you away anymore.

48
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,909
That boy has lived
with you for a long time?

49
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,587
A very long time.

50
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:24,517
Hey,

51
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,600
have you been together
with him since you were 2?

52
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,684
Being with someone younger
than you isn't sustainable.

53
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,972
Not for him for sure.

54
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:37,458
Are you saying that
you believe in true love?

55
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,692
Your dad was handsome,

56
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,827
and kind too.

57
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,569
You talk about my dad so often.

58
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,375
Had you met him before?

59
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,868
A long time ago.

60
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,102
You love him very much, don't you?

61
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:05,545
Yes, of course.

62
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:08,251
If you love him,

63
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,098
study hard.

64
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,884
Don't disappoint him.

65
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:15,748
I'm leaving now.

66
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:21,299
Eh?

67
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,195
Are you gonna see me off
at the gate?

68
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,038
No, I'm going downstairs anyway.

69
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,492
You never say something
to make your friends happy.

70
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,051
We have a guest at home.

71
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,425
Don't you wanna say hi?

72
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,507
He's a familiar face!

73
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,017
You like to fool around.

74
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,634
Because I'm a fool.

75
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:03,785
Playful!

76
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,709
You got me!

77
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:08,792
This is Kiew.

78
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,156
Hi, I'm Moodaeng.

79
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,463
You can call me Moodaeng for short.

80
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:19,785
You can call me
Moodaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeng for long.

81
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,954
Can you stop me, please? Moodaeeeeeeeng...

82
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,169
Please take care of Bamee.

83
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,343
Are you a friend or an old relative?

84
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,362
You said your last rites!

85
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,039
I'm not going to die!

86
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:32,478
You got me!

87
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,809
I like it!

88
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,318
I'm gonna do my best

89
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,281
to take care of Bamee.

90
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,697
I told you to not bring anyone home.

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,599
This is Aunt Pim.

92
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,487
Hello.

93
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:04,931
Please don't blame Bamee.

94
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:07,873
He didn't bring me home.
I came to see him by myself.

95
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,816
You can talk to him
in front of the gate.

96
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,319
You don't have to bring him inside.

97
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,891
Mom, it's not like that.

98
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,578
I invited him inside.

99
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,770
You don't have to speak for him.

100
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:21,328
You are leaving now, right?

101
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:22,225
Go ahead.

102
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:25,239
He's gonna sleep here tonight.

103
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,987
I'm not happy to have a stranger
to sleep over at my house.

104
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,361
My friend is not a stranger.

105
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,349
Let's find something to eat.

106
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,685
Moodaeng,

107
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,242
Eat with me.

108
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,685
I apologize for my mom.

109
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:50,311
Mom…

110
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,385
Why didn't you tell me that
Moodaeng is your brother?

111
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,135
Because you've never asked me.

112
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,162
Eh? It means I'm wrong?

113
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,152
Yeah, but that's right.
I've never asked you.

114
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,465
You asked me to sleep over just to
go against your stepmom, right?

115
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm old enough now.

116
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,779
I won't let anyone force me
to do something irrational.

117
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,680
Yeah, I understand.

118
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,747
I used to do the same
to my mom quite often.

119
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,049
Okay, let's eat!

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,908
Take this.

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,094
I don't like to eat it.

122
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,540
I don't like it either.

123
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:00,624
Then give it back to me.

124
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:03,747
Here,

125
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,109
I'm gonna take yours too.
I can eat it for you.

126
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,639
Hey, you said you don't like it.

127
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,122
I lied.

128
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,088
I just want you to eat good food,

129
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:15,419
so, you'll be in a good mood.

130
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,198
Oh, I lied too.

131
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,614
Hey!

132
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,368
You don't have to eat it.

133
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,358
If you're so picky,
only eat the spaghetti.

134
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,007
- Hey, I want to eat shrimp!
- No, no.

135
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,508
I'm gonna eat it myself.
You're too picky.

136
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,618
- You don't get to eat it.
- Hey, but I want to eat it.

137
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,777
- No.
- I was just kidding.

138
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:35,399
My shrimp!

139
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,583
Let's share! There are 3 shrimps!

140
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:38,072
Nope!

141
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:41,983
You wanna start a fight?

142
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:51,190
Your stepmom is strict, but not mean.

143
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,133
She cooks for you for every meal.

144
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,602
She gives me food

145
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:58,542
and a place to sleep.

146
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,017
But she never loves me.

147
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,823
She raises me like a dog left
from the previous owner.

148
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:07,914
Come on,

149
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:10,357
at least Moodaeng loves you.

150
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:12,743
He is a good boy,

151
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:14,422
so, I make him
happy however I can.

152
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,813
Shit!

153
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,629
Hey, I already took a shower!

154
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,639
Today...

155
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,558
- is a Songkran day.
- Hey, you're messing with my house,

156
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,446
Kiew!

157
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,916
You don't feel sad anymore?

158
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,808
Come wash dishes here.

159
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:00,655
What?

160
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:02,240
Sleep over at Bamee's?

161
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,064
You said there's nothing
between you two?

162
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,879
I sleep at your house,
are we something more?

163
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,427
Tell your dad that
I'm not going home tonight.

164
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:09,674
Bye!

165
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,749
Hey! Wait!

166
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,259
Hey!

167
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,937
Is there something between them?

168
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,265
Argh!

169
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:23,872
Sigh!

170
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,410
I have to take a shower one more time.

171
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:36,980
You can just get changed.

172
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:38,694
You're overly hygienic!

173
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:48,465
Hey!

174
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,828
Come here, let's have a talk.

175
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:52,186
Yes, sir.

176
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,851
Why didn't you tell me
that you're Bamee's brother?

177
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,200
Wait,

178
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,807
have you guys met before?

179
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,830
Yes, he went to see me at my school.

180
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:11,546
Why didn't you tell me?

181
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,538
I wanna know

182
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:17,560
how much your friends love you.

183
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:18,918
Oh,

184
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,647
were you trying to test me?

185
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,507
How was it? You know now?

186
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,128
I know now

187
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,897
that you guys love Bamee so very much.

188
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:31,898
Mom went to bed already.

189
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,162
Your friend sleeps over at our place,

190
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,786
let's show him what we got.

191
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:40,645
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,621
My dad made this corner for stargazing.

193
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,677
I still remember his face

194
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,525
while he was looking at
the stars and smiling to himself.

195
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:05,683
We miss him, right?

196
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:07,921
Yeah.

197
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:12,400
If it's possible,

198
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,666
I'll take your dad back to you.

199
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,656
Keep dreaming!

200
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,898
You met my dad.

201
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,149
Have you heard about his friend
who went missing?

202
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,852
Your dad told you about him?

203
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:34,025
Yes. He loved that friend very much.

204
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:41,592
We're named in
rememberance of that friend.

205
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:47,865
Do you know

206
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,336
that friends name?

207
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,424
Same as your name.

208
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:55,822
He's uncle Kiew.

209
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,598
Moodaeng is cute.

210
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,572
He's a lot more friendly than you.

211
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,108
Don't tell me that you're
gonna let me sleep on the floor.

212
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,015
It's mine.

213
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:32,172
Why don't we sleep in the bed together?

214
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,234
I like to sleep alone.

215
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,600
Up to you.

216
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,521
It's so comfy!

217
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,328
Oh, shit!

218
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,229
Haha!

219
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:14,334
You get scared so easily!

220
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,214
You rustle in your sleep so
much that I can't sleep either.

221
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,714
Come sleep in the bed next to me.

222
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,228
I can sleep here.

223
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:25,515
Come here, quick.

224
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,536
Are you gonna sleep
like this or in the bed?

225
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,670
That's it!

226
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,880
- Heyyyy!
- Arghhhh!

227
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,337
Have you ever dreamed of a stranger

228
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,920
and met him in real life?

229
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:00,367
No.

230
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,927
What if you dream of him,

231
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:04,993
and you meet him in person one day,

232
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,438
will you tell him?

233
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,253
No, I won't.

234
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,657
He'll think that I'm crazy.

235
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,318
- And if you…
- Why are you asking so many questions?

236
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,096
I'm sleepy!

237
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:23,415
Okay, I'm sleeping now.

238
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,077
Let me help you.

239
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:10,927
If I'm Moodaeng's friend,

240
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:12,499
will you show me kindness?

241
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,963
Bamee only has you
and Moodaeng as family.

242
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,441
If he's not happy with his family,

243
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,208
one day he might do something worse

244
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,294
just to be make
a mess of his life.

245
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,578
Are you lecturing me?

246
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,628
I'm begging you.

247
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,419
Please give some love to Bamee.

248
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,415
You can share a slice of love
you give to Moodaeng to Bamee.

249
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,127
If he's downstairs, he's
gonna laugh at me for sure

250
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,758
that I woke up and called him right away.

251
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,179
Why are you smiling, Bamee?

252
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,709
Oh, you're back?

253
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:53,798
No, you're dreaming.

254
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:56,851
Oh, I'll go back to sleep then.

255
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:05,158
- I'm back now!
- Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

256
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,143
Oh, I really thought that I'm dreaming.

257
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,132
Why are you sleeping in my room?

258
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,887
I'm waiting here to ask you

259
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,134
why did you have to
sleep at Bamee's last night?

260
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,629
I feel sorry for him.

261
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,068
I think he's mad

262
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,478
but didn't know how to react to aunt Pim.

263
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,445
That's why he used this trick
to be sarcastic.

264
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,510
You've been saying

265
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,122
that you've known him
since you were young.

266
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:33,759
Why couldn't you remember Moodaeng?

267
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:37,187
Can you remember someone you met
since you were a baby?

268
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,793
Since uncle Art died,

269
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,418
I haven't seen Moodaeng since.

270
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:47,984
Woo! Woo!

271
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,482
- Woo!
- Hey! What's wrong?

272
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:50,767
Why are you so
happy all of a sudden?

273
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,878
Bamee doesn't belong to anyone.

274
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,348
Uh, I'm gonna be late to class.

275
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:55,962
I'm gonna take a shower now.

276
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:57,590
Uh, you take a shower now too!

277
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,223
Hey, what are you doing?

278
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:00,869
I'm gonna take your clothes off.

279
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,648
- You don't need to!

280
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,778
I'm gonna repay you for
bringing me good news!

281
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,663
No, you don't need to!

282
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:06,012
I can do it myself.

283
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,035
Come here! Come!

284
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:11,628
I'm gonna take your clothes off.
Come on!

285
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,839
Wait, Kiew, don't. Kiew, wait!

286
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,448
Hahaha!

287
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,698
Are you ticklish?

288
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:17,428
Don't!

289
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,253
- I got yoU!
- Don't! Kiew! Don't!

290
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,623
Kiew! Hey!

291
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,949
Here you go!

292
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:27,402
You wanna try me?

293
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:30,121
Sure! Let's see!

294
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,011
You don't have
to wait for me every day.

295
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,213
No, I have to.

296
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,048
If Franc sees
that you're walking alone,

297
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:42,943
he'll follow you again.

298
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,239
I don't want to interrupt you.

299
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,438
No, it's okay.

300
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,438
I can only take care of you for some time

301
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,268
and then I'll have to go.

302
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,047
Oh, but don't worry.

303
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:53,518
When I'm not here,

304
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,668
you still have the 3 musketeers
to take care of you.

305
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:57,699
See you at lunch time. Bye!

306
00:22:58,139 --> 00:22:58,727
Okay.

307
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:12,189
Are you Kiew?

308
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:14,442
Yes, I am.

309
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:17,480
The dean asked me
to tell you to see him.

310
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,310
Okay.

311
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:21,355
Not in this building.

312
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,008
I'm gonna take you there.

313
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:30,990
He…

314
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,177
the dean asked me to meet him here?

315
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,556
Did you trick me into
sexual harassment?

316
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:47,599
If I straight up ask
you to come with me,

317
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:50,047
will you come?

318
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,039
I like you.

319
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,862
Let's be together.

320
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,147
I don't like a bitch!

321
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,099
He has such a bad mouth.

322
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,280
Slap-and-kiss kinda guy.

323
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,188
I love him!

324
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,995
Who are you waiting for?

325
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,385
No one.

326
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,789
Who are you looking at?

327
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,185
There's no one to look at.

328
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:37,110
Here, this is for you.

329
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:43,068
Why are girls these days so brazen?

330
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:44,885
She tricked me
to follow her and kissed me.

331
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,948
Damn!

332
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,040
What a scandal! Is she beautiful?

333
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:50,894
She is.

334
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,221
Do you like her?

335
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:54,684
If I liked her, would I
curse her out like this?

336
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,990
Here's an iced coffee

337
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:01,724
to calm you down.

338
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,774
Hey.

339
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:04,386
What?

340
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:05,564
Do you know her?

341
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:07,416
I've never seen her face before.

342
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,447
Maybe she's a man-hunter.

343
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,046
It's good
that you didn't play along with her.

344
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,278
It's disgusting.

345
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,821
Yeah, right.

346
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,479
Shit, you're being dirty again.

347
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,777
I saw that you laughed at me.

348
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,468
This punishment is too easy for you.

349
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:29,649
Hey,

350
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,238
you're taking revenge for him?

351
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,538
No, I…

352
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,828
- Are you gonna fight with me?
- No, I just…

353
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:36,648
What? Kiew? Don't do it!

354
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,758
It's wet! No, don't! Kiew!

355
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,318
Don't! It's wet!

356
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,608
Kiew!

357
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,562
Now what? Huh?

358
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,212
How old are you?!

359
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,298
Hey! I'm getting wet now!

360
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:53,929
Plawan!

361
00:25:54,395 --> 00:25:56,478
What? Hey! Let me shoot back!

362
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:56,864
Kiew!

363
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,152
Hey!

364
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,118
Hey! That's enough!

365
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:03,981
That's enough!

366
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:11,251
Argh!

367
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:13,073
I'm screaming now!

368
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,072
Argh! I'm screaming too!

369
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,564
Do I have to scream too?

370
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:21,311
Argh!

371
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:26,738
Kiew!

372
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,058
They kissed in public like this.

373
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,566
You can't ignore this, Baiwan!

374
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,098
They did it even in the campus.

375
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:34,129
That's right.

376
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,074
Baiwan, you need to have
a talk with him.

377
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:44,270
It's not okay, right?

378
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,221
Huh! So tired!

379
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,858
You guys need to do some exercise!

380
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,068
What are you laughing about?

381
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,639
Hahaha.

382
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:15,818
- What is it?
- Hey,

383
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:17,149
Nice facial hair!

384
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,256
Look here.

385
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,755
Hey!

386
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,775
- Oh!
- Go wash up in the toilet.

387
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,886
Hey, I'm going with you.

388
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:37,995
Do you wanna go?

389
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,880
I can't even walk now. You go ahead.

390
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,300
Do you wanna go?

391
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,548
You go ahead.

392
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:43,841
- I'm too tired.
- Bamee, wait for me.

393
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:44,937
Hey!

394
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,264
This morning, I talked to Aunt Pim.

395
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,224
What did you say?

396
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:01,905
I asked her to give
you some grace.

397
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:06,682
She wouldn't believe you.

398
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,447
But it's better than doing nothing.

399
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,618
You didn't wash your face thoroughly,

400
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,108
you little child!

401
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,367
Hey, it's him! This tall guy!

402
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,648
- Really?
- Yes.

403
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:47,698
What's on my face?

404
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:48,878
Nothing.

405
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:49,719
You pervert!

406
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:53,118
If you're so horny,

407
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,119
you can take it out me~

408
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,024
Kiew, you're in trouble!

409
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,198
(Must be so horny
they did this in the campus!)

410
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,044
Oh, shit!

411
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:08,505
Who recorded this?

412
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:10,764
There's only one who
can do these ugly things.

413
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,966
Kiew,

414
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,599
is in big trouble!

415
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,139
Now he's in a bad trouble for sure!

416
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,918
- You are so smart!
- Right.

417
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,779
That you came up with this idea.

418
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm a genius. That's for sure.

419
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,409
Baiwan must break up with him

420
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,720
and will be in love with me!

421
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,281
You're a super genius!

422
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,380
I put you into this situation.
And you're having a big scandal.

423
00:29:59,199 --> 00:29:59,935
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:02,121
It's not your fault.

425
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,258
It's Franc's bad tendency.

426
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,482
He doesn't know how to lose.

427
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:07,858
This scandal won't stay for long.

428
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,841
The admin will delete the post soon.

429
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,728
But everyone in the campus
recognizes me already.

430
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:16,737
We have to stop people's
misunderstanding.

431
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:19,327
Do you want to
do a live interview?

432
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,581
The evidence is so obvious.

433
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,479
Whatever you say is
like making excuses.

434
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,554
He's gonna make it worse.

435
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:33,010
Find another scandal
to distract people from Kiew's topic.

436
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:35,057
That's a brilliant idea, Baiwan.

437
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:38,216
I know how to make Franc have a scandal.

438
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,612
What do you want for dinner?

439
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,939
It's my treat.

440
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,118
- Piz..
- ..Za.

441
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,479
- Or it's gonna be Su..
- Shi.

442
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,359
He runs like a dog.

443
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,184
What is it?

444
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,208
- What is it?
- What are they laughing about?

445
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:05,091
I wonder too.

446
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:06,820
Franc,

447
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,748
are you a coward?

448
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,198
You ran like a scared dog.

449
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,299
Why didn't you tell us?

450
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:16,576
Ran like a scared dog?

451
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,188
What are you talking about, Jean?

452
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,918
Oh, you haven't watched it.

453
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:21,653
Here, take a look!

454
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,599
I'm gonna tell my daddy!

455
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:34,672
Yes!

456
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:38,900
Hey, Franc's scandal
is spreading very fast.

457
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:41,112
He must be going crazy now.

458
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:49,854
You can destroy people
at your fingertips.

459
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,155
This modern world is so crazy.

460
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,754
Anyway, I thank you two very much.

461
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:58,416
I didn't help you.

462
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,531
I just wanted to post Franc's clip.

463
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:01,843
Damn it!

464
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:06,387
Oh, I still have a lot of money left
from Franc's dad.

465
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:08,729
I'm gonna treat everyone
for dinner this evening.

466
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:11,779
Ask Moodaeng to join us too.

467
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,247
Oh, you know Moodaeng too?

468
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,331
It's Moodaeng that
we mistook for a young boy

469
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:19,795
who fooled Bamee.

470
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,998
Oh, I didn't know

471
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,929
that the boy you
talked is Moodaeng.

472
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,153
Or else you would've known the truth sooner.

473
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,091
Tell him that it's my treat as ana
apology for making him get in trouble.

474
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:36,472
Okay.

475
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,640
Here is the legendary grilled pork.

476
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,118
I'm gonna eat til I burst.

477
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:49,828
What are you waiting for?

478
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,077
Let's eat now!

479
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,885
Wait,

480
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:54,628
we should have some activity...

481
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:56,533
for this grilled pork dinner.

482
00:32:58,255 --> 00:32:59,678
Let's do it!

483
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,739
Let's do it! Let's go.

484
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:10,956
It's an eating competition!

485
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:13,149
Who can eat most will be the winner.

486
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,912
The winner can choose a personal slave

487
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,712
to serve the winner for 1 week.

488
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,583
Are you ready?

489
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,219
So ready!

490
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,098
Start!

491
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:20,639
Kiew, keep fighting.

492
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,377
Moodaeng, make our family proud!

493
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:29,921
Yup.

494
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:30,533
Take this!

495
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:31,662
Hey!

496
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:33,062
Hey.

497
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:33,670
What?

498
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,130
Hey.

499
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,645
Why isn't anyone
cheering for us?

500
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,691
Losers have to take care of themselves.

501
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,081
I can't take it anymore.

502
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:16,204
I give up.

503
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,595
2 competitors are down.

504
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:22,034
2 more to go, Plawan and Moodaeng.

505
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:25,559
Moodaeng, keep going!

506
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,105
Only you and me left!

507
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,705
It haven't filled half of my tummy yet.

508
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:37,048
Oh, wow! I ate this much already!

509
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,511
I feel like I haven't eaten anything.

510
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,110
Don't go on if you're suffering.

511
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,193
Don't use psychological
warfare on me.

512
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,614
I'm not going to be a loser.

513
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,108
I grilled a lot of meat.

514
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:29,857
Let's help eat all of it.

515
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,824
Or we will be fined for the leftovers.

516
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,587
I thought that you care
for your friends.

517
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,808
I care for everyone.

518
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:50,842
I feel like throwing up
just by smelling it.

519
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,007
You two are very hardcore.

520
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:05,221
Ew! What the hell is this?

521
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:08,989
Disgusting!

522
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,824
Oh, what bright skin!

523
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,346
Oh! No!

524
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,308
Hey!

525
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,649
Can I hug you?

526
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:38,586
When the going got rough,
you all left me!

527
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:40,696
You must love me so much.

528
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,223
Who would breathe in your puke?

529
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:45,342
Plus, everyone in the
restaurant stared at us.

530
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:48,698
We're lucky that the owner is kind

531
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,912
to let the staff to clean up after us.

532
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:52,441
Or else we have to clean up
your puke for a long time.

533
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,533
I told you!

534
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:56,882
Don't go on if you were suffering.

535
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:58,261
If you give in,

536
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,404
you don't have to embarrass
yourself in front of everyone.

537
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,718
I don't have to lose my shirt.

538
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,152
I will buy you a new one.

539
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:06,756
But it's not the same.

540
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,006
You ate a lot,

541
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,150
but threw it all up.

542
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:11,214
What a waste!

543
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,597
Then you go eat my puke!

544
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,148
Ewww, just hearing that
makes me wanna throw up now.

545
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,751
To summarize this competition,

546
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:23,288
Moodaeng is the winner!

547
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:25,539
Yay!

548
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:29,729
Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,336
Choose your slave now.

550
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:36,380
I'm your brother's friend!

551
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:40,549
Okay, then…

552
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,561
I'm your brother's friend, too!

553
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:50,480
What?

554
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,210
Am I not your brother's friend?

555
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:03,099
Plawan is the lucky one!

556
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:07,883
Why me?

557
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:10,768
Because you threw up on my shirt.

558
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:11,788
I have to take revenge.

559
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:15,224
Give me your phone number
and Line ID account now.

560
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:17,359
So, I can easily contact you
to be my slave.

561
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:19,855
This must be a tough work for sure.

562
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:22,542
Keep fighting.

563
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:23,497
Okay.

564
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:47,363
Let's get inside.

565
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,164
All of your friends are cute!

566
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,915
Plawan is a rich kid.

567
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,618
You can be harsh on him.

568
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,951
He should learn to struggle.

569
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,359
Okay!

570
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,892
You're back!

571
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:06,927
Hi, mom.

572
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,940
I prepared orange juice for you.

573
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,313
Another glass is yours, Bamee.

574
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,914
This morning, I talked to Aunt Pim.

575
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,517
What did you say?

576
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,425
I asked her to give you some love.

577
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,354
She wouldn't believe you.

578
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,941
But it's better than doing nothing.

579
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:48,943
Here, drink a lot.

580
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:51,208
Yes.

581
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:08,655
Is this your ideal stepmom, right?

582
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,385
Are you pretending to be good to me?

583
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,932
You want me to be nice to a child
who never listens to me like you?

584
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,252
- Mom!
- Stay quiet!

585
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,078
I order you

586
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,967
to not bring your friend home
ever again!

587
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:25,650
We can't trust people these days.

588
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,138
If he can't be trusted,

589
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:28,693
Uncle Prach wouldn't let Kiew stay
with him in his house.

590
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,436
That's right.

591
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,928
Kiew is also a friend of our dad

592
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,299
and Uncle Prach, mom.

593
00:41:36,113 --> 00:41:38,831
But I don't like to see someone
walking in my house.

594
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:41,242
You are so self-centered,

595
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:42,976
and irrational like always.

596
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:44,945
Hey!

597
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:47,678
We haven't finished the conversation
and you walked away?

598
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,322
When will you stop being like this?

599
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:50,894
Can you just leave me alone?

600
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,428
If you don't want me to do this,

601
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,828
then get out of this house!

602
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:54,898
But this is my dad's house!

603
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:55,796
And he's my husband

604
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,505
and Moodaeng's dad, too!

605
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,209
Have you ever thought about it?

606
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:00,878
How exhausted I have been

607
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:02,901
for raising you for more than 10 years?

608
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,878
The money that Art left for me

609
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:06,661
wasn't that much like
you thought it would be.

610
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:09,198
But it's enough for me
to finish university

611
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:11,029
without using any of your money.

612
00:42:11,149 --> 00:42:12,669
But you waste my time

613
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:15,513
to cook for you and to find places
for you to study!

614
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,468
Then, from now on, you
don't have to care about me.

615
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,605
Bamee!

616
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:49,390
Bamee! Bamee! Bamee!

617
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:11,909
He's not at the university.

618
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:15,029
He's not at places
we thought he would be.

619
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:16,988
Where is he?

620
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,426
Oh, where are you, Bamee?

621
00:43:23,586 --> 00:43:24,629
Please don't think that I curse him,

622
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,887
but have you checked
with hospitals?

623
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:29,245
I checked them all.

624
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:30,775
Couldn't find him.

625
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:32,449
So, I called you.

626
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:35,998
Then he is still fine.

627
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,419
He might turn off the phone
because he wants to be alone.

628
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:41,719
But he's never been like this before.

629
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:44,101
He tells me whenever he goes.

630
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:47,811
His battery might die.

631
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:55,859
Can you take me somewhere?

632
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:57,249
Where is it?

633
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,294
Bamee!

634
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:07,139
(Past Senger)

635
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:08,439
From what Kiew did.

636
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,444
(Next Episode)
and from what you told me,

637
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,009
I think it's for sure.
No need to investigate.

638
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:15,384
But Kiew has told me confidently that,

639
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:16,988
he's not his type.

640
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:18,604
Maybe he doesn't realize
who he really is.

641
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,213
Kiew!

642
00:46:36,283 --> 00:46:37,230
Argh!

643
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:42,684
I'm finally back! Yayyyy!

644
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,261
- I'm back!
- Kiew!

645
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:45,324
<i>I want you to know.</i>

646
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,886
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

647
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:53,577
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

648
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,459
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

649
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:59,290
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

650
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,461
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

651
00:47:01,475 --> 00:47:04,296
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

652
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:08,064
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

653
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,776
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

654
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:16,382
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

655
00:47:16,382 --> 00:47:19,296
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

656
00:47:19,297 --> 00:47:22,042
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

657
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,317
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

658
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:27,188
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

659
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:33,114
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
