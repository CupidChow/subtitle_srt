Who are you?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,580
Your boyfriend.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,369
You knew that uncle Kiew
had disappeared for a long time.

4
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,638
Why are you fooling
Uncle Prach and us?

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,310
I've never met someone
with such a strange fate.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,430
- The priest Pho Ngoen.
- Hey!

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,310
I'm here because of him?

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,919
Don't disrespect him again!

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,100
Complete your unfinished task for him.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,280
But we redeemed all the vows already.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,450
Not yet!

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,029
You haven't completed
everything that you promised to do.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,490
Think about it carefully.

Good luck, Kiew!

40
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,559
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,279
- Kiew, good luck!
- Ann!

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,849
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck, Kiew.

43
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,850
- Keng! Thank you so much.
- Good luck, my friend.

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm going now.

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,890
Kiew!

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,829
Hey, hey!

47
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,689
- Kiew!
- Hey, hey!

48
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,929
- Kiew!
- Kiew!

49
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,400
Hey!

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,450
Where is it now?

51
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,199
- What happened here?
- Hey!

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,590
Kiew, are you alright?

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
No, you can't. It's not a full team.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,750
Huh? It's not a full team?

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,690
Huh?

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,780
But, the other one has passed away.

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh, right, right.

58
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,440
Thank you.

59
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,990
What did she say?

60
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,840
Winny said

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,010
we need to find someone
to dance for Art.

62
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,410
That person has
to share the same blood with him.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,110
The same blood?

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,210
Moodaeng!

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,709
Moodaeng is too young.

66
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,160
He might not understand this.

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,320
Hey! Bamee! It's Bamee!

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,309
If we tell him that

69
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,240
we'll take Kiew back to the 90s,

70
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,619
Won't Bamee think that we're crazy?

71
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,790
Right.

72
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,890
- He knows everything.
- Hey!

73
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,310
Did he believe you?

74
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,515
At first, he didn't. But when I showed him
the messages on the pager, he believed me.

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,239
Hello.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,460
Bamee,

77
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,220
I need you to help me.

78
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,480
I'll rush to see you.

79
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,080
Hey! Hey!

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,520
Whoa, Kiew!

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,229
The time-machine door is super cool!

82
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,239
How do you feel when you got inside?

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,260
Did it hurt?

84
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,400
Nope,

85
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,079
I haven't blinked before
I got to another world,

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,859
- It's like you can vanish.
- Hey! Really?

87
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,029
- Yeah.
- Hey!

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,059
- Whoa, cool!
- I got it!

89
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,604
- We got it!
- The exact outfit as in our generation.

90
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,750
Is Bamee here yet?

91
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,109
- Nope.
- Hey.

92
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,819
Hey, Keng and I went
shopping for a long time.

93
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,200
Bamee should be here already.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,260
Can you call him?

95
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,870
That's right.

96
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,700
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah, look exactly the same.

97
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,280
Oho.

98
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,920
You made good choices.

99
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,820
Ba…

100
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,600
This is not Bamee.

101
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,620
It's hospital staff.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,629
Huh? A motorcycle crash?

103
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,630
- Hey!
- Huh?

104

(Emergency Room)

105
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,580
How is Ekkawee?

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,140
Bamee!

107
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,559
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

108
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,599
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,319
Bamee! Bamee!

110
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,790
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

111
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,660
- Bamee!
- He's still alive.

112
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,350
Oh!

113
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,859
Why did you cover him?

114
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,439
The patient has a strong headache.

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,289
The doctor gave him some medicine.

116
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,869
He's sleepy and cold.

117
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,079
So, he covered himself and slept.

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,240
- Oh.
- Right.

119
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:58,539
When he sleeps like this, he looks like a
patient. Minutes ago, he looked like a corpse.

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,750
Plawan!

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,470
Doctor said not to worry.

123
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,040
He just cracked his head
and got some wounds on his arm.

124
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,040
He'll recover in a few days.

125
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,005
Where did you guys go?

126
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,380
Why did you guys...

127
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,960
dress up in strange outfits?

128
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,590
Oh,

129
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,639
we went to a fancy birthday party
of a friend.

130
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,270
That's why we look like this.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
And what about you?

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,940
Err, I…

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,920
- He represented his dad.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,370
He brought a gift for his dad's friend.

135
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,840
Why are you so curious, Plawan?

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,359
Because, he…

137
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,559
I think it's late now.

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,939
Everyone should rest at home.

139
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,289
I'll stay with Bamee.

140
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,180
Yeah.

141
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,510
- Good.
- Good.

142
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,299
(ICU 2 / Operating Room)

143
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,080
I think the priest must be
so angry at Kiew.

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,049
We found a way to take him home,

145
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,710
but there's still obstacles.

146
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,250
Baiwan said.

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
Bamee has never
disrespected the priest.

148
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Why did he get hurt because of Kiew?

149
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,750
- Hey!
- What?

150
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,839
Maybe in the past life,

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,019
Bamee and Kiew did something wrong
to the priest.

152
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:39,224
So, they have to repay it in this
life before the priest forgives them.

153
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,279
When Bamee is released,

154
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,219
let's take Bamee and Kiew

155
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,239
to make a big merit.

156
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,289
And redeem the vows.

157
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,300
Maybe the merits will help Kiew
to get back home.

158
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,624
That's a good idea.

159
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,010
I'm here.

160
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,630
You don't have to be scared.

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
I will call mommy for help.

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,670
Don't be dramatic!

163
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,180
I was just hugging you to
comfort you after Bamee's accident.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,270
You're the most caring person.

165
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,810
So cute!

166
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,810
Let's sleep now.

167
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,560
Who are you?

168
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,219
I used this trick once.

169
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Try something else.

170
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,562
I really don't know you.

171
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,240
Can you remember me now?

172
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,130
Stay away.

173
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,520
Are you mad at me that I called you to
go out and you had an accident?

174
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,010
It's you who are
the cause of this accident.

175
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,450
Go away!

176
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,440
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,800
Bamee!

178
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,679
Here, finish them all.

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,150
You'll get well soon.

180
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,150
Thank you, Baiwan.

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
How are you?

182
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,900
The wounds still hurt a little bit.

183
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,910
Hi.

184
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,580
Your clothes are in here.

185
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,130
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,760
Here, don't eat them all up.
Share some with Kiew.

187
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,514
Who is Kiew?

188
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,660
Oh,

189
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,190
Oh,

190
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,233
you're playing this trick
of not remembering Kiew?

191
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,380
This is not a trick.

192
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,170
I mean it.

193
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,770
Bamee.

194
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,165
Bamee, how are you?

195
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,340
Mommy!

196
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,110
You are the first one I think of
when I woke up.

197
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,919
I really don't know him.

198
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,970
I feel irritated when I see him.

199
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,260
Get out of my room.

200
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,813
Don't chase him away like that.

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,290
Kiew is your friend.

202
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,750
Bamee, can't you remember
anything about Kiew?

203
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,780
No, I can't.

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
I just heard from aunt Pim,

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,610
so, I came to see you.

206
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,840
Get well soon, Bamee.

207
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,730
Thank you, Soda.

208
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,300
He can remember everyone.

209
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,270
Except Kiew.

210
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,840
Let's ask the doctor.

211
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,840
Right.

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,540
The patient's brain may be
affected from the concussion.

213
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,900
Some memories can be lost.

214
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,280
Some behaviors may change too.

215
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,910
Will he remember me?

216
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,440
He might need some time.

217
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,449
How long is some time?

218
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,840
Can you be specific?

219
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,370
1 week,

220
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,160
1 month,

221
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,650
or 1 year.

222
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,880
I can't be specific.

223
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,739
We have to check his symptoms.

224
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,610
Apart from forgetting a friend,

225
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,160
does he forget other memories or not?

226
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,640
Is there any way to make the
patient remember his friend quickly?

227
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,250
Let him experience the same things
they used to do together.

228
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,829
The patient's memories
can be restored faster.

229
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,720
We support you here. Good luck!

230
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,440
Thank you so much, Winny.

231
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,290
What did she say?

232
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,960
She only sees darkness.

233
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,359
She didn't see Bamee at all.

234
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,980
So, she doesn't know how to solve this.

235
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,100
Science takes time.

236
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,990
Black magic can't help.

237
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,320
Such big karma for Kiew.

238
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,830
If Bamee's memories don't come back,

239
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,290
and if he doesn't redeem
the vow with us,

240
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,090
Kiew can't go home.

241
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,990
His mom and Art would still die.

242
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,553
Can we let Moodaeng do it?

243
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,359
Winny said it has to be
the oldest son only

244
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,070
to represent Art.

245
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,830
Why is it only me that he can't remember?

246
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,700
I've read that

247
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,289
with brain concussion, some patients

248
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,640
forget the most special person
in their life.

249
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,210
Or,

250
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,030
deep down

251
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,540
he wants to forget you,

252
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,770
since you are going abroad soon.

253
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
Then you have to restore
Bamee's memories quickly.

254
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,150
He doesn't even look at my face.

255
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,111
How could I restore his memories?

256
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,364
He has to let you do it.

257
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,000
What's your plan? Tell us.

258
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,805
Bamee has to stay
at the condo with Kiew?

259
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,139
It's the only way, Pim,

260
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,870
for them to experience the same things
they've done together.

261
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,739
But right now, Bamee doesn't like Kiew.

262
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,250
He won't do it.

263
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,850
But, Pim,

264
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,700
you have to help us.

265
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,960
Right now,
Bamee listens to you the most.

266
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,980
Whatever you say, he'll follow.

267
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,819
Pim, there's a very important thing

268
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,319
that Bamee has to do with us.

269
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,099
If you talk nicely to him
and he still doesn't agree,

270
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,470
you can force him right away.

271
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,070
Why do you have to force me
to stay with Kiew?

272
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,359
I did it for you.

273
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,000
Please don't be stubborn. Let's go.

274
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh,

275
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,119
Let's make merit, Bamee.

277
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,700
You will feel relieved and let
go of sadness and bad luck.

278
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,940
Yes, uncle Prach.

279
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,740
Long life, good looking,
healthy, energetic.

280
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:18,110
Good luck to you all.

281
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,300
Good luck everyone.

282
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,520
Good luck everyone.

283
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,520
Priest,

284
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,260
I want to be as lucky as you wished us to be.

285
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,840
Could you tell my mom

286
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,220
to not let me stay with this guy.

287
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,711
It's not my duty to deal
with the secular world.

288
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,900
You have to deal with it yourself.

289
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm not okay.

290
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,810
I'm not as lucky as you wish.

291
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,760
Don't interfere with each other.

292
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,040
How could you remember me then?

293
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,610
Forgetting you doesn't affect my life.

294
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,530
It does.

295
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,220
Then why everyone let you stay with me?

296
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,940
Whatever you want me to do,
just take me there.

297
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,210
I don't want to suffer
to stay with you.

298
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,720
If you can't remember,

299
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,420
you can't do this important mission.

300
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,277
Damn, I'm so unlucky!

301
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:48,074
Oh, I'm about to call you.

302
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,770
They look familiar,

303
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,810
like I ate them before somewhere.

304
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,040
Here, with me.

305
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,860
Can you remember now?

306
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
Did I use to like you?

307
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,060
You and me,

308
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,550
we love each other a lot.

309
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Yeah?

310
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,690
Right now,
I don't feel it at all.

311
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,919
Stay with me,

312
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,490
you'll love me like before.

313
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,870
Come, let's eat.

314
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,510
Just seeing your face
makes me not hungry.

315
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:35,745
Seafood pizza, small size for 1 person,

316
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,699
not for sharing,

317
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,150
1 tray please.

318
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,400
Arghhh!

319
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,500
I don't understand anything.

320
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,000
Does it make sense now?

321
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,930
No!

322
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,790
Oh, what's wrong with you?

323
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,059
If Bamee forgets Kiew forever,

324
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,120
what are we gonna do?

325
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,630
They love each other very much.

326
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:14,434
They can remember each other for sure.

327
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,599
What if Bamee forgets all of us,

328
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,430
one by one,

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,170
what shall we do?

330
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,879
That's going too far now.

331
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,580
Stay in the present. Be mindful.

332
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,510
I'm out of my mind now.

333
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,610
Then mop the floor.

334
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,060
I'm stressed and you asked me
to do chores?

335
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,840
It's an exercise to get rid
of your stress.

336
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,320
No, I won't do it.

337
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,620
Come on.

338
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,880
Let's do it together.

339
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,769
Quick, I'm gonna teach you how.

340
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,760
Nope.

341
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,860
Yeah,

342
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
like this.

343
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,920
Go!

344
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,660
What about your medicine?

345
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,259
Don't you remember

346
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,600
that you don't like taking pills?

347
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
I remember,

348
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,500
but I have to force it.

349
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,479
I want to recover quickly,

350
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
so, I can separate from you.

351
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,020
Hey!

352
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,750
The doctor said
the wounds can't get wet.

353
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,900
I'm not that stupid to do that.

354
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,729
But you still have a fever.

355
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,580
The doctor told you to wipe yourself.

356
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,379
My arm is hurt.

357
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,220
It takes ages to finish cleaning.

358
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,580
I can do it for you.

359
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,509
But I don't want you to.

360
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,469
You said you want to recover soon,

361
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,050
so, you can separate from me?

362
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,200
Ouch, ouch.

363
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,360
Hey, wait.

364
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,550
Ouch.

365
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,910
Look at me.

366
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,120
Don't force.

367
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,763
If you look at me for a long time,
you might remember something.

368
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,540
I can't remember anything.

369
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,409
Finish wiping quickly.

370
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm gonna go to bed.

371
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,399
He doesn't eat

372
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
and only stays in his room.

373
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
When will he restore his memories?

374
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,850
Hey,

375
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:11,375
we have to block him
from going into his room.

376
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,850
So, he's gonna spend more time
with Kiew.

377
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,309
Brilliant, Baiwan!

378
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,400
I can take care of that.

379
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,870
What are you gonna do?

380
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,170
Trust me.

381
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,040
I have my own way.

382
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,140
Are you okay staying with
a moody person all the time?

383
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,850
I have to say okay even
when I'm not okay.

384
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,450
Where is Bamee, by the way?

385
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,980
Wanna try this?

386
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,520
It's understandable
that he can't remember me,

387
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,330
but how comes he likes Soda!

388
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,319
But Soda knows that Bamee is sick.

389
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
I think he won't take advantage of Bamee.

390
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,850
Look when Soda looks at Bamee first.

391
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,860
Yeah.

392
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,190
Hey, let's say hi to Bamee.

393
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,040
Hey, Bamee.

394
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,700
Where's your gang?

395
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,310
Ouch, ouch.

396
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,189
Hey, Franc.

397
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,100
Ouch, what's wrong with you?

398
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,240
Hey, enough now.

399
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:42,826
Don't mess with Baiwan again.

400
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,570
Hey,

401
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,950
I stopped it for a long time.

402
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,040
Besides,

403
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,640
we became friends already.

404
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,890
Yeah, do you have amnesia?

405
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,930
Yes,

406
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,110
his brain affected from a concussion.

407
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,150
It affected his memories.

408
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,880
It's not your fault.

410
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,210
Bamee doesn't like you because of me.

411
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,990
How could you say it's not my fault?

412
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,620
Bamee can't remember
about us being friends.

413
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,970
It means that apart from Kiew,

414
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,360
he might forget
about something else, too.

415
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,260
Let go of the rest.

416
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
Now we are solving Kiew's issue.

417
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:12,452
If I can help you
with anything, just tell me.

418
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,960
Don't you get mad at him?

419
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,849
Don't mind a crazy person,

420
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,620
don't mind someone with amnesia.

421
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:24,407
We're friends with him
longer than you've been,

422
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,350
we will try first.

423
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,190
You don't have to do it.

424
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,260
And if it works, I'll let you know.

425
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,480
Thank you so much.

426
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,190
Ouch, Baiwan, I still hurt here.

427
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,720
Ouch, it hurts.

428
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,280
Ouch.

429
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,540
Mobile phone.

430
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,345
You used to fool Kiew to
wait for the security guard here.

431
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,430
This photo was taken by you.

432
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,280
I took his photo?

433
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,900
At that time, you thought
I was high on drugs.

434
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,280
I asked Baiwan.

435
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,210
Come on, Bamee.

436
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,003
I don't like him, Baiwan.

437
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,735
Well, I took you here

438
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,319
and showed you this photo,

439
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,830
can you remember anything?

440
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,800
Yes, I can.

441
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,800
What is it?

442
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,290
I shouldn't have taken his photos
to waste my phone's memory space.

443
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,080
It's here. It's this room.

444
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:26,196
I practiced Judo with you guys?

445
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,439
We didn't practice.

446
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,810
Kiew taught us.

447
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,730
I could remember Plawan and Pong.

448
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,930
But you,

449
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,819
you are not important to me at all.

450
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,240
I couldn't remember.

451
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,255
Kiew is the most important person
for you, Bamee.

452
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,220
I might have pretended.

453
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,550
If it's true, I should remember him.

454
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,850
Hey, hey, ouch!

455
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,610
Don't you worry about my wounds?

456
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,180
Argh!

457
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,910
Memories are more important
than wounds.

458
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,699
I did this to make you realize that

459
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,480
I used to do this with you.

460
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,150
I can't remember anything.

461
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,650
If you push me in the pool,
I'm gonna punch you for real.

462
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,020
Damn,

463
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,659
who would do that?

464
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,160
Your wounds can't get wet.

465
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,500
We just took you here to see
if you can remember anything.

466
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,250
Oh,

467
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,150
here is the spot
where you sucked Kiew's mouth.

468
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,320
You kissed each other.

469
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,240
I can't remember that
I'm here with him.

470
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,080
Stop it, I'm tired.

471
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,880
Okay,

472
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,460
enough is enough.

473
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,110
I feel so freaking hot too.

474
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,520
Well, you are a handsome guy.

475
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,770
Hey!

476
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,720
What are you doing?

477
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,750
I don't know.

478
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,420
I feel that you are cuter
and cuter every day.

479
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,359
Do you forget

480
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,190
the relationship
between me and your brother?

481
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,270
So what?

482
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,940
Well, you already have
many people who love you.

483
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,940
It's okay.

484
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,940
I like being loved by people around me.

485
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,620
Bamee!

486
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,210
Stay focused!

487
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,440
You don't like me anymore?

488
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,129
You have amnesia

489
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,200
and now broken logic.

490
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,360
I'm not enjoying myself!

491
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,130
Shit!

492
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,040
Bamee has changed a lot.

493
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,510
I didn't think that he dared to do so.

494
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,720
Did your heart skip a beat?

495
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,990
My heart skips a beat only
when I'm with you.

496
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,050
But you used to like him.

497
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,060
I focus only on the present.

498
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,730
Don't you believe me?

499
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,440
I do.

500
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,660
But I couldn't help feeling jealous.

501
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,440
Or you want me to not feel anything?

502
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,020
Go ahead. You can feel as much
as you want to.

503
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,480
Or you can sulk.

504
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,990
I like to make it up to you.

505
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,990
Keep your word.

506
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeah.

507
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,640
Don't worry.

508
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,860
I miss you.

509
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,770
Moodaeng, I need your help now.

510
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:10,920
Let's go find something to eat.

511
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,870
No.

512
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,600
I didn't ask you.

513
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,800
You're nosy.

514
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,590
Let's go.

515
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,180
Let's go.

516
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,550
Yes, mommy.

517
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,210
I miss you.

518
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,050
Yes, okay.

519
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,890
Yes.

520
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,530
I can't go with you now.

521
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,240
My mom asked me to go with her.

522
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,890
She asked you to go with us too.

523
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,840
It can be next time.

524
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,580
What is mommy doing here?

525
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,250
You used to come here with your dad.

526
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,280
I think she wants to
restore your memories.

527
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,040
I remember.

528
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,120
Do you remember
when you came here with me?

529
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,430
Oh, have I been everywhere with you?

530
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah.

531
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,770
What is this?

532
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,600
No, I don't take it.
It's like a children toy.

533
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,960
What is he sulking about?

534
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,550
I feel sorry for Kiew.

535
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah.

536
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,950
I'm here,

537
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,870
waiting for mommy.

538
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,880
Are you home yet?

539
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,620
Please take care.

540
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,020
If Soda is sitting next to me
right now,

541
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
it would be nice.

542
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,340
Do you like him a lot?

543
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,970
He's handsome

544
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,660
and nice.

545
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,700
Hey!

546
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,169
Why did you push Kiew?

547
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,690
He's trying to touch my cheek.

548
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,480
There's an insect on your face.

549
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,160
I was about to brush it off.

550
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,140
I don't feel anything on my face.

551
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,080
You were sneaky to touch my face.

552
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,940
Mom!

553
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,949
Hello. Sorry, I'm late.

554
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,390
The traffic was very bad.

555
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,600
Why did you ask me to come here?

556
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,380
I remember everything about dad.

557
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,440
What about these photos?

558
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,830
Hey!

559
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,050
You can remember, right?

560
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,270
Not at all.

561
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,120
Then why are you shocked?

562
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,810
I'm shocked that
I took many photos with him.

563
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,250
Kiew is your real good friend, Bamee.

564
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,550
I forgot it already.

565
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,360
Now I don't like him.

566
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,689
I want to go back home.

567
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,240
Please let me go home.

568
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,380
I don't dare to disobey the doctor.

569
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,049
I miss you, mommy.

570
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,220
I want to be with you.

571
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,410
Damn,

572
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,590
because of you, I have to stay here.

573
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,810
Where is my room key?

574
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,170
Hahahaha.

575
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,459
Hey, Bamee.

576
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,160
Professor Anek called you.

577
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,800
Plawan, do it now.

578
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,610
You can sleep in my room for now.

579
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,050
I got goosebumps just thinking
of sleeping in the same bed with you.

580
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,730
I'll sleep here.

581
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,200
The sofa is small.

582
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,620
You can get hurt when you move.

583
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,210
You can sleep in my room.
I'll sleep here.

584
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,609
I don't want to sleep in your bed.

585
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,690
That's it!

586
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,860
Just do as you like.

587
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:17,693
(Past Senger)

588
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:19,216
(Next Episode)
The more I see you,

589
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,250
the more I get confused.

590
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,520
It's like…

591
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,200
I like you.

592
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,640
Bamee!

593
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,590
Ouch!

594
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,040
How could you do this to me?

595
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,860
Taking him to places
he's been to doesn't work.

596
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,649
Giving him things he's impressed with,

597
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,810
he can't remember.

598
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,939
I think we have to use
the maximum level

599
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,359
to make him remember.

600
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,780
What is the maximum level?

601
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,380
Depends on how intimate
the two of you were.

602
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,910
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

603
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,850
You can remember now?

604
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:15,247
<i>I want you to know.</i>

605
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:17,901
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

606
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:23,179
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

607
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:26,549
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

608
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,362
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

609
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,338
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

610
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:34,191
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

611
00:46:34,202 --> 00:46:37,941
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

612
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,685
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

613
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:46,357
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

614
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:49,247
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

615
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:52,083
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

616
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:54,294
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

617
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:57,232
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

618
00:46:57,243 --> 00:47:02,930
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
