00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,310
a type of herb was used

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
to temporarily suppress the poison

180
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,480

I agree with
everything that's been said.

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh, right.

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,150
We already have a suspect.

195
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
Is it Chang Xun?

196
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,360
Yes.

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,000
You sent him, so of course you know.

198
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,150
Why are you asking me?

199
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,670
You're a step too late.

200
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,390
I've already sent my men

201
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
to get Chang Xun arrested.

202
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,750
Prince Lv!

203
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,480
Prince Lv,

204
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,910
we went to arrest him,

205
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
but Chang Xun

206
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,030
has disappeared.

207
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,150
Pass the order.

208
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,030
Pass the order.

209
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,000
Search for Chang Xun in entire the city.

210
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes!

211
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,960
What kind of reversal ploy is this?

212
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm confused than ever.

213
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,870
Look for the dossier?

214
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,910
I'm a coroner looking for a dossier?

215
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,000
This is too challenging for me.

216
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,910
Yao,

217
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
don't be humble.

218
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,910
Believe that you're the best!

219
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,630
You can do it!

220
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,270
Thank you for having faith in me,
Princess Consort Lv.

221
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,630
Princess Consort Lv.

222
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Stop.

223
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,120
Stop right there.

224
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,480
Those three words

225
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,870
are like a death warrant.

226
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,080
Just call me Qing.

227
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,600
I want to live a bit longer.

228
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
Princess Consort Qing.

229
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
I don't quite get it.

230
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,550
What does finding
the dossier on Chang Xun's background

231
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,840
have to do with arresting him?

232
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,390
Know your enemy.

233
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,910
Princess Consort Qing,

234
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,080
[East Office Personnel Records]
is it the one?

235
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,750
Let me see.

236
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,080
Once I find the link,

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
I'll make sure he goes speechless.

238
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
How could this be?

239
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,670
[Creditor's Contract]

240
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,240
Chu.

241
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,150
If the Demon Poison is proven,

242
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,600
then your mother...

243
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,080
Father will decide

244
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,080
what to do about my mother.

245
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,150
How did the investigation go?

246
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,960
Crown Prince,

247
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,910
based on the records in the dossier,

248
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,150
Chang Xun was from

249
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,440
General Wei Zhao's camp.

250
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,480
He made many military contributions.

251
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,150
Due to the fact that he's a filial son,

252
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,750
General Wei transferred him

253
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,790
to East Office

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,150
and made him the Guard Supervisor

255
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,600
so that he could take care
of his bedridden old mother.

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,270
Chang Xun was under Wei Zhao?

257
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,440
Your Highness,

258
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
could the fake Xiu

259
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,550
be someone

260
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,080
working for Imperial Consort Wei?

261
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,790
Gather pictures

262
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,750
of all the maids
serving Imperial Consort Wei.

263
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,550
Let Wang Senior and Wang Junior
go through them.

264
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,630
This...

265
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
You two, take a good look.

266
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,750
Her eyes look similar.

267
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,840
No way.

268
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,870
Are you blind?

269
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,840
Her mouth is so big.

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,870
It's definitely not her.

271
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,240
This...

272
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,320
This isn't her either.

273
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,240
No!

274
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,360
It's her!

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes, it's her!

276
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
- Yes! It's her!
- It's her!

277
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,320
This is the one.

278
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,320
Your Highness.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,600
This is Imperial Consort Wei's

280
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,480
personal maid.

281
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,870
Her name is Si Yan.

282
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,550
Are you sure?

283
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,910
Your Highness,

284
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
we're sure it's her.

285
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,790
I swear on my life.

286
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Summon Imperial Consort Wei's maid,
Si Yan.

287
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes, I'm headed to the palace at once.

288
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Let's go.

289
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,550
Crown Prince, please see to this.

290
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,240
I need to get some rest.

291
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,270
Looks like this case

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,840
involves many.

293
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,240
Your Highness, don't worry.

294
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,840
Heaven is fair.

295
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,000
When the crime happened,

296
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,750
it was already destined to be solved.

297
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,320
Miss Lin, you're right.

298
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,840
I have something to ask you.

299
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,000
Princess Consort Qing!

300
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll leave you guys to it!

301
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,840
This Qing...

302
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,360
I never know

303
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,510
what's

304
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,510
in her mind.

305
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,550
Indeed.

306
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,390
Qing is indeed

307
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,270
bold and imaginative.

308
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,270
Oh, the main couple from my novel.

309
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,750
It's so difficult

310
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,150
to create space for you

311
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,670
to develop your relationship.

312
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,440
Princess Consort Qing.

313
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,320
Princess Consort Qing.

314
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,270
I'm just a secretary.

315
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,390
I won't be able to answer

316
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,790
any deep questions.

317
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,240
You're off work.

318
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,080
Thank you, Princess Consort Qing.

319
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
It's as difficult

320
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,790
to be a public servant in ancient times.

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,080
[Ning'an Palace]
I've been asked

322
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,630
to summon Ning'an Palace's maid, Si Yan.

323
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,870
Imperial Consort Wei, please allow it.

324
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,270
My maid stays within the inner palace,

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,750
how can someone from outside the palace

326
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,910
summon her as they wish?

327
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,960
Imperial Consort,

328
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,670
while investigating Liu Xiang's murder,

329
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,600
a witness has pointed out

330
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,670
that your maid, Si Yan,

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,150
is related to this case.

332
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,630
Impossible.

333
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,630
My maid lives
within the imperial palace.

334
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
How could she be related to a murder?

335
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,630
The truth will be revealed

336
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,510
once Si Yan follows me
to the East Office

337
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,510
for investigation.

338
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
It's obvious

339
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,440
that someone is trying to set her up!

340
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm just doing my job.

341
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,960
Imperial Consort,
I hope you will not put me in a spot.

342
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,080
I'm not trying

343
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,670
to make things difficult for you.

344
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,240
It's just

345
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,670
that Si Yan cannot leave the palace.

346
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,760
[Liu Residence]

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh, Xiang.

348
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,200
How could you leave the world

349
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,840
before your father?

350
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,510
My Xiang.

351
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,080
My Xiang.

352
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,550
Oh, Xiang.

353
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,200
Guard Xiao,

354
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,240
Si Yan developed a heat rash
two days ago,

355
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,150
and she has been sick.

356
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,240
She can't leave the palace.

357
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,870
The imperial physician

358
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,960
can also confirm this.

359
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,240
I think

360
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,750
there must be a misunderstanding.

361
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,670
Let me report back to His Highness

362
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,870
before making a decision.

363
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,320
It's finally over.

364
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,200
Luckily,
Her Highness was one step ahead.

365
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,200
Miss,

366
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,350
you've suffered.

367
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,350
I've brought

368
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,920
your favorite snowflake cake.

369
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,400
Please have some.

370
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,480
Your Highness,

371
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,070
I've seen to the matter.

372
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,070
Take this and pretend to be sick.

373
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,320
[Ning'an Palace]

374
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,240
Miss Lin.

375
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,200
What are the results of your autopsy

376
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,160
on Liu Xiang's body?

377
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,960
The Vajra Weapon hit her heart

378
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,440
and she died on the spot.

379
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,000
Wasting their time alone.

380
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,350
Stop being a workaholic.

381
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,030
Please pay attention
to your love life as well,

382
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,030
okay?

383
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,110
Look at this dossier.

384
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,240
What are you doing?

385
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,640
Go!

386
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,680
[East Office]
Why are you back here

387
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,790
at this hour?

388
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,110
Why?

389
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,310
Can't I come back?

390
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,830
Of course you can.

391
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,200
Your Highness,

392
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I apologize.

393
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,750
I was unable to bring Si Yan back here.

394
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,270
Imperial Consort Wei said
she is bedridden

395
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,400
from a heat rash.

396
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,110
She's clearly pretending to be sick
to cover up the crime.

397
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,480
Just as I expected.

398
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,750
Let's call it a day.

399
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Qing,

400
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,400
you've worked hard today.

401
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Let me send you back to the study room.

402
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,790
No need.

403
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,240
It's all for the characters...

404
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,160
Service!

405
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,550
Let's send Yao back first.

406
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,510
After all, she gets lost easily.

407
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,640
Alright.

408
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,240
Let's go.

409
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's go!

410
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,960
Come.

411
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,200
Miss Lin,

412
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,440
did the poison

413
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,350
only show for a while?

414
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,160
Yes.

415
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,350
If poisoned,

416
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,240
one will have

417
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,680
short effects
like change of eye pupil color,

418
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,070
and hair growth.

419
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
They'll be like a demon.

420
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,680
Once the effects are over,

421
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,030
they will turn back to normal.

422
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,480
This is what people call

423
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,640
a common language, right?

424
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,480
Well, will they develop feelings
for each other

425
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
soon?

426
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,350
I wonder

427
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,920
what nice dream

428
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,750
Qing is having again.

429
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,160
Yes,

430
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,240
Qing is always

431
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,480
this carefree.

432
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,200
Why are you talking about me?

433
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,590
I'm making myself

434
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,750
look less like a third wheel.

435
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,110
Hurry up and start dating, okay?

436
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,880
Go and assist East Office

437
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,880
with Chang Xun's arrest.

438
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,160
We have to quickly bring him in.

439
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,160
Understood.

440
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,030
Go.

441
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,550
Your Highness!

442
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,550
Bad news!

443
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,110
Liu Mingsheng has been killed.

444
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,440
What?

445
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,880
The deceased, Liu Mingsheng,

446
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,400
has a fatal knife wound on his neck.

447
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,070
There are no signs of a struggle

448
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,200
before his death.

449
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,830
He was killed in one strike.

450
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,240
His time of death was
at around 11:00 PM.

451
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
I never wrote
about Liu Mingsheng's death

452
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,750
in the novel.

453
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,750
If Ji Chu killed Liu Xiang

454
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,440
to invoke the conflict

455
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,830
between the Wei Family
and Liu Mingsheng,

456
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,830
Liu Mingsheng's death

457
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,030
should be

458
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,960
a result of the internal conflict
with the Wei Family.

459
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
[Meet me quickly at the secret place]

460
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,550
Whoever asked
to meet Liu Mingsheng secretly

461
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,240
could be the murderer.

462
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,510
Master!

463
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
Master!

464
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,110
Master, you had such a tragic death!

465
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,000
Master!

466
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,070
Liu Er,

467
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,000
who did your master meet here

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,790
last night?

469
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't know.

470
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,160
Master just asked me

471
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
to bring him nearby this place

472
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,240
before asking me to leave.

473
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,920
I only found out about his death
this morning.

474
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,640
Then,

475
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,350
before he left for the rendezvous,

476
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,270
was there anything strange?

477
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,440
Did you see anything

478
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,110
or anyone?

479
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,590
Well...

480
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Well...

481
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,270
Well...

482
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,640
Last night, Master...

483
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Why are you hesitating?

484
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,510
Could it be

485
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,640
that there's something you can't say?

486
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,880
No.

487
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,960
No, no!

488
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,640
Before Master left the residence,
he only met...

489
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,110
Prince Lv.

490
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,070
Prince Lv!

491
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,920
Master...

492
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,920
Master cannot see anyone now.

493
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,830
Prince Lv.

494
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,790
You may go.

495
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,240
Yes.

496
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,880
He only met...

497
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,350
Prince Lv.

498
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,880
[East Office]

499
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,920
Why did Chu

500
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,070
go see Liu Mingsheng
on his own last night?

501
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,640
I went to see him

502
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,590
for my own reason.

503
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,750
Chu, did you know Liu Mingsheng

504
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,510
that Liu Mingsheng has been killed?

505
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,200
I found out on the way here.

506
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Do you suspect me

507
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
of killing him?

508
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,240
I don't.

509
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,070
I'm just wondering

510
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,590
why you went to see him.

511
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,550
If you don't explain yourself,

512
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,550
people will naturally talk

513
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,240
and suspect you.

514
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,400
Ji Chu must have gone
to see Liu Mingsheng

515
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,070
to incite him

516
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,200
to be a witness

517
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,920
for this case.

518
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Maybe before he could do so,

519
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,830
Liu Mingsheng was silenced?

520
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,920
You're quiet today.

521
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,680
Why?

522
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,790
Do you think I'm involved

523
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,310
in Liu Mingsheng's death too?

524
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
No.

525
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,480
You won't benefit

526
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,350
from his death at all.

527
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,880
You would want to protect him.

528
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,070
I see that you're not dull.

529
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,880
Miss Lin,

530
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,790
can Liu Mingsheng's body

531
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,880
help us find out who did it?

532
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,830
No.

533
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,880
However, from the wound,

534
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
the culprit has fierce swordsmanship,

535
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,240
is well versed in martial arts,

536
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,350
and is left-handed.

537
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,270
Left-handed?

538
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,510
Well...

539
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Isn't Chang Xun left-handed?

540
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
The reward is so high.

541
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
The one wearing the hat, stop.

542
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,880
After him!

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Chang Xun?

544
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,400
Take him away.

545
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,920
Move!

546
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,440
Chang Xun,

547
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,240
as the Guard Supervisor
of the East Office,

548
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,880
you violated the law.

549
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,790
How should we punish you?

550
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,750
Since I've been caught,

551
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,160
you may punish me

552
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,440
as you deem fit.

553
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,790
Chang Xun, answer me.

554
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,640
You have no grudges

555
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,920
with Liu Mingsheng and his daughter.

556
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,960
Why did you kill them?

557
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,310
Did someone tell you to do so?

558
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,550
There's no one.

559
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,070
I did it all on my own.

560
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,830
The dossier on your background shows

561
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,310
that you were

562
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,200
from General Wei Zhao's camp

563
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,480
before transferring to the East Office.

564
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,590
Looks like the mastermind

565
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,240
is either General Wei

566
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,750
or Imperial Consort Wei.

567
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,270
There's no mastermind.

568
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,960
I did it all on my own.

569
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Chang Xun!

570
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,200
What's your motive?

571
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,480
To repay a favor.

572
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,070
General Wei did me a favor

573
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
and that demoness, Liu Xiang,

574
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,680
wanted to marry Prince Qi.

575
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,070
I had to kill that demoness.

576
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,400
Then what about Liu Mingsheng?

577
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
The old scoundrel, Liu Mingsheng,

578
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,110
had a demoness, Liu Xiang.

579
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,270
There's no way he was a good person.

580
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,270
To make sure he didn't
cause trouble for Prince Qi,

581
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,510
I just

582
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,960
killed them all.

583
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,070
You keep calling her a demoness.

584
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,440
Liu Xiang was not a demon!

585
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,030
I've already killed them.

586
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,550
I'll just pay for it with my life.

587
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,550
Say no more!

588
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,750
How stubborn.

589
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,790
Take him away.

590
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,750
Life imprisonment.

591
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,960
Take him away.

592
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,640
They've already caught him?

593
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,440
Yes.

594
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,070
He stuck to the statement.

595
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,550
They don't have

596
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,960
any evidence.

597
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,110
Very good.

598
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,030
Now, I'll be

599
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,790
free of worries.

600
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,270
Imperial Consort Wei is really sly.

601
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,750
She got herself

602
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,110
a loyal scapegoat.

603
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,400
This way, there are no more witnesses

604
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,160
for Imperial Consort Xian's case.

605
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,240

What do you think?

608
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,790
Don't worry, Crown Prince.

609
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,240
Wait.

610
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,880
Wait for what?

611
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,310
Just wait.

612
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,160
The party concerned
isn't even worried.

613
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,240
Why should I?

614
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,000
Prince Lv!

615
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,270
Prince Lv!

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,960
I need to see Prince Lv!

Prince Lv,

621
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,830
Liu Mingsheng's personal servant

622
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,160
is demanding to see you.

623
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,190
Let him in.

624
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,200
Yes.

625
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Let him in.

Master told me that

629
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,920
if he didn't return in a day,

630
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,680
I should take

631
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,200
the wooden box in the Buddhist hall

632
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,830

634
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,880
this is all the evidence

635
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,030
regarding your daughter's death.

637
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,750
for her,

638
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm sure you'll know what to do

639

"I, Liu Mingsheng,

642
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,510
was instructed by Imperial Consort Wei

to administer Imperial Consort Xian

with Demon Poison, causing her death
15 years ago.

645
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,480
From then on, I rose through the ranks

646

of Head Imperial Physician.
