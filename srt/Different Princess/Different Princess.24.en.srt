[Different Princess]

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
[Episode 24]

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,400
Everyone knows

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,950
Chu was sent to Nanjing

16
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,000
as a hostage.

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,680
A few years later,

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
he was able to overthrow Nanjing

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,560
with his own power

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and overturned his fate.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
But no one knew

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,310
the bitterness and humiliation
he had to endure.

23
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,280
Ji Chu was abused

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
in Nanjing.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
Ji Chu was never treated

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
as a hostage prince,

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,430
but more of a prisoner
who had committed grave crimes.

28
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,190
He was locked in
a dilapidated wooden shed

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,120
and given spoiled food.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,030
Later, he managed to escape

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,910
from the palace somehow.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,310
We met by chance

33
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,280
outside the palace.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,190
But we were captured

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,560
and taken back to the palace.

36
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,910
Their methods worsened.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
They tortured him more and more
every day.

38
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,590
If you hadn't

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,080
stood up for me,

40
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,360
you wouldn't have gotten a beating.

41
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,120
If you hadn't been
brought to palace with me,

42
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,910
you wouldn't need to suffer like this.

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,120
I can't take it anymore.

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
Calm down.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
It's not time yet.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,190
We found out that it was

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,030
Imperial Consort Wei

48
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,360
who had intervened.

49
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,840
She gave the chief eunuch the go-ahead.

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,470
Nanjing couldn't care less

51
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,560
about the fate of a hostage.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,150
Wang Chuanzhi,

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,240
your days are numbered.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,360
Cut off

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,240
his finger.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
No!

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Chu!

58
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,070
Chu!

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Chu!

60
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,510
Fortunately, I had mastered

61
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,630
my healing skills,

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,240
and we managed to reattach his finger.

63
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,040
However, the scar

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,630
remained permanently.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Why do you always wear

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,870
this strange ring?

67
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,920
Is there a story behind it?

68
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,040
No.

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,070
Just a habit.

70
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,160
(It's all my fault.)

71
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,000
(I'm the one
who subjected Ji Chu to all this.)

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
And then?

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,000
As Ji Chu said,

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
Wang Chuanzhi met a tragic end.

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,630
Given Ji Chu's temperament,

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,750
he wouldn't have spared him.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,040
After that,

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,120
Ji Chu took advantage of the rivalry

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,310
between the princes of Nanjing

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,040
to remove all obstacles

81
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,360
and gained control
over Nanjing's politics.

82
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,680
I had no idea

83
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,750
he had gone through so much.

84
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,310
Ji Chu had such a tough time,

85
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,480
and he even found Pumpkin.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
You'll have to ask him
about that yourself.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,870
I'm telling you all this

88
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,600
to let you know

89
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,560
that Ji Chu carries burdens of pain

90
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,480
that are far more

91
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,480
than an ordinary person can bear.

92
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,600
So, a lot of times,

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,750
the person you see

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,240
is not the real him.

95
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,270
[Anxiang Hall]

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,120
What did the crown prince

97
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
say to Qing when he met her?

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,310
I do not know.

99
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,630
He must have told her

100
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,190
about the matter of him
marrying Lin Xiyao.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,920
But why did Qing not return promptly

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
after talking to him?

103
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,390
I do not know.

104
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,310
Perhaps she went

105
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,680
to congratulate Lin Xiyao.

106
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,070
Right.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Did His Highness

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,920
run into Pumpkin today?

109
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,430
Young Master's personal maid reported

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,830
they bumped into each other.

111
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,600
Where have you been?

112
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,800
Why have you been upset

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
since meeting the crown prince?

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,510
Ji Chu,

115
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,160
even though I'm your stepmother,

116
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll be good to you

117
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,390
from now on.

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,360
By your definition of stepmother,

119
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,270
you should be Pumpkin's stepmother.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,430
Why are you my stepmother?

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,510
I know.

122
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm sorry you've had

123
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,600
to spend so much time

124
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,190
with Pumpkin.

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
I don't mind.

126
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
With my Hua family's

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
parenting methods,

128
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,160
a balanced approach of firmness

129
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,600
and gentleness,

130
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,270
I can handle Pumpkin.

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,190
It's...

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
just...

133
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,360
You have no children.

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
How do you know these parenting methods?

135
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,750
Well, I can be gifted, can't I?

136
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,600
That's not the point.

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,240
No.

138
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,310
It is the point.

139
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,360
When the time is right,

140
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,360
I'll tell you about Pumpkin.

141
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,440
It's all right.

142
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,360
Regardless of your past,

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
in the future...

144
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll be good to you.

145
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,440
How will you be good to me?

146
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,960
I will do everything you say

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,030
and everything you want.

148
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,390
If you say east, I won't say west.

149
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,440
I'll cherish you and hold you gently

150
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,200
in my palms.

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
I will be good to you.

152
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,240
That's what you said.

153
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,390
That's what Hua Qingge said.

154
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,440
What are you doing?

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,480
Who said she would do everything I say

156
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,550
and everything I want?

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,000
I did.

158
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,200
Old witch, are you in there?

159
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm here!

160
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,200
That's what happened that day.

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,390
I told Qing everything

162
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,670
about you.

163
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,750
No wonder she came back and said

164
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,390
she wanted to be good to me.

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,000
It's fine.

166
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,670
Letting her know some of your past

167
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
is not entirely a bad thing.

168
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,790
Now that I've gotten my revenge,

169
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,030
I would like to tell Wan'er

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,030
my past as well.

171
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Chu,

172
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,870
I wish to marry Wan'er.

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
What do you say?

174
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,510
Her Majesty...

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,240
The Su family...

176
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,870
Demon Poison...

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,270
(If it's true that the events
15 years ago)

178
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,320
(are connected to the empress,)

179
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,550
(then Wan'er's birth mother)

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,960
(would've been the one
who murdered Qi's father.)

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,550
This matter needs careful consideration.

182
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,510
Why?

183
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,360
You don't think I'm good enough

184
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,200
for your sister?

185
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,270
Even if you object,

186
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,030
I will still ask
for Wan'er's hand in marriage.

187
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,320
Gongye Qi.

188
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,510
Wan'er,

189
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,270
what's with the arrangement?

190
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,840
Well,

191
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,120
you like to fish

192
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
in your rocking chair.

193
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,870
With this,

194
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,440
you can fish

195
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
while I read and keep you company.

196
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
That sounds wonderful.

197
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,790
So, this means
I'll be living a life of leisure

198
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
ahead of schedule.

199
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,480
In that case,

200
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
perhaps we can merge Jingzhi Library

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
and Mystic Medicine House.

202
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,080
Books on one side,
medicines on the other,

203
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,870
and we can call it Xuanjing Abode.

204
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
It would be the perfect place

205
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,600
to heal the body and mind.

206
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,600
My Wan'er is smart.

207
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,630
That's right.

208
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,000
I heard from He Tong

209
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,320
that you went to see Chu.

210
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,270
Is there something going on?

211
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,670
Wan'er,

212
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
you've always been understanding

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
and never asked about my past.

214
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,080
Are you not curious, or...

215
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,270
Of course, I'm curious.

216
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,150
When you like someone,

217
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,910
you want to know everything about them.

218
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,080
That's why I've been waiting for you

219
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,910
to tell me everything.

220
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,270
Wan'er,

221
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,120
my past is one drenched in blood.

222
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,080
I don't know if you...

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,120
Regardless of your past,

224
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,550
I accept all of you.

225
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,150
I come from a family of physicians.

226
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,000
My father was kind-hearted

227
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,510
and skilled in developing
extraordinary medicines.

228
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,790
And his skills were precisely

229
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,910
what brought about

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,030
his own downfall.

231
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,360
Your Highness,

232
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,150
I regret that I can't comply
with your request.

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,550
I cannot hand over this medicine to you.

234
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
I only wish

235
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,080
to save lives and heal the sick.

236
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,240
I cannot partake in harming others.

237
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,750
Physician Su,

238
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll give you a day to reconsider.

239
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,390
If I don't get a satisfactory answer,

240
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,630
I have my ways

241
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,240
of purging

242
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,150
the Su Residence.

243
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,750
Imperial Consort Wei.

244
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,440
Your family was implicated
in the Demon Poison case

245
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,270
15 years ago too.

246
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,030
Exactly.

247
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,510
My father developed the Demon Poison.

248
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,150
Originally intended
as an anti-aging remedy,

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,440
a mistake in ingredient proportions

250
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,870
accidentally revealed its ability

251
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,840
to temporarily transform people
into demons.

252
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,790
My father intended
to destroy the formula,

253
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,270
but his colleague,

254
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,000
Liu Mingsheng,

255
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
wanting to curry favour
with Imperial Consort Wei,

256
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,360
told her about it.

257
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,120
So, that's how
the Demon Poison came to be.

258
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,510
Imperial Consort Wei forced my father

259
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
to concoct it for her.

260
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,600
When my father

261
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,000
firmly refused,

262
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,120
she worried

263
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,870
he might expose her intentions,

264
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,870
and deliberately plotted against us,

265
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,120
and led to the execution
of my entire family.

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
I was spared thanks to an old servant

267
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,960
who escorted me away.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Imperial Consort Wei

269
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,080
is truly evil.

270
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,390
Your entire family, dozens of lives,

271
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,750
died in vain all because of her.

272
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,120
Now she's met a deserving end.

273
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,270
She got what was coming to her.

274
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,200
Her death is not regrettable.

275
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,200
Wan'er,

276
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
this is the first time

277
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,120
I've heard you talk about
life and death like this.

278
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,000
That's because...

279
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,510
because I feel sorry

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,790
that you had to go through all of this.

281
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,450
♪The moon is shining above
the broken bridge, and the lake ripples♪

282
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,150

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,320

♪With all sorts of feelings♪

285
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,870
In the first half of my life,
I was fixated on revenge.

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,670
For the rest of my life,

287
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,630
I have only you.

288
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,390
From now on,

289
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,240
as long as Ji Wan'er is here,

290
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,200
Gongye Qi won't suffer

291
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
any more injustices.

♪Against demons and chaos,

You've said everything

294
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,910
I wanted to say.

295
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,670
What am I supposed to say, then?

296
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,110
Wan'er,

297
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,960
no matter how many obstacles lie ahead,

298
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,110
I will marry you, proudly.

299
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,240
Your Highness,

300
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,750
I have arranged the bath.

301
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,880
I'm just curious

302
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,750
why you wanted petals in the bath today?

303
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,200
You have no children.

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,110
How do you know these parenting methods?

305
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,480
Well, I can be gifted, can't I?

306
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,000
That's not the point.

307
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,030
Yesterday,

308
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
my princess consort mentioned

309
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,270
parenting methods to me.

310
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,960
Parenting methods?

311
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
Could it be that Her Highness

312
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,550
wants to have children
with Your Highness?

313
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,880
That's my interpretation as well.

314
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,030
Considering the current climate,

315
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,830
if Qing becomes pregnant

316
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,070
with my child,

317
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,550
even if the empress

318
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,640
were to act again,

319
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,790
no one would dare to lay a hand on her.

320
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
Your Highness is right.

321
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,070
Tell my consort

322
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,400
to come to Lanting Pool.

323
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes.

324
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,310
(Strange.)

325
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
(Why did he ask me to bring a towel?)

326
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,310
(Couldn't he just have a servant do it?)

327
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,440
Is it you, Qing?

328
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,400
It's me.

329
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,480
I've placed the towel here for you.

330
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,920
Get it yourself when you're done.

331
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,790
(What is Ji Chu up to now?)

332
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,350
Hurry up and come in.

333
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,110
Didn't you say you'd listen
to me obediently?

334
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,400
Coming.

335
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,030
Will you bathe with me?

336
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,550
(Is this the rumored beauty trap?)

337
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,110
Bathing together is so dull.

338
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,830
Why don't I give Your Highness

339
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,960
a massage?

340
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,550
A massage?

341
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,880
This medicine

342
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
has a whitening effect

343
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,310
and moisturizes the skin.

344
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,000
Give it a try.

345
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,590
Come on.

346
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,640
Come here.

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,790
Sit tight.

348
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,880
I haven't started yet.

349
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,200
What are you doing?

350
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,590
Don't run away.

351
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm not done with you yet.

352
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,590

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,030
Neither is my heart.

Ji Chu,

359
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,750
what spell

360
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,310
did you put on me?

361
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,590
Why can't I get you out of my mind?

362
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,440

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,790
Here.

364
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,200
Legends and fables.

365
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,310
These are...

366
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,110
romance novels.

367
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,750
You've never read romance before this.

368
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,400
Why the sudden interest?

369
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,270
If one doesn't understand
the ways of love,

370
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,440
how can they engage
in romantic conversations?

371
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,440
You have no need for that,

372
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,510
for we are already in love.

373
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,550
If we could spend

374
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,270
the rest of our lives

375
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,790

growing old together,

377
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,880
it would undoubtedly be

378
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,310
the most wonderful thing to happen.

379
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,510
Your Highness,

380
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,440
I heard about your unsuccessful attempt

381
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,160
with Her Highness

382
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,030
last night.

383
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,200
But

384
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,880
I have an idea.

385
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I believe

386
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,200
Her Highness was just shy.

387
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,240
Your Highness must take the initiative.

388
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,440
Go on.

389
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,440
What is this?

390
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,830
This is a good find

391
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,830
from the ghost market.

392
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,240
The vendor called it

393
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
the Child Bearing Pill.

394
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,550
If a man takes it,

395
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,000
his wife will be able
to conceive as desired.

396
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,750
Xiao Yan,

397
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,680
this is your "good" idea?

398
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,400
Leave.

399
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,920
Yes.

400
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,590
Child Bearing Pill...

401
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,270
Ji Chu has been running around my mind

402
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,000
all day.

403
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,790
How did I not realise

404
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,880
he was such an athlete?

405
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,070
Help me...

406
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,240
I'm doomed.

407
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,640
What's the matter with you?

408
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Are you drunk?

409
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,920
I don't smell any alcohol on you.

410
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,310
What are you doing?

411
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,510
Pervert!

412
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,400
Put me down!

413
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,160
I... I didn't expect

414
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
the Child Bearing Pill

415
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,480
to be an aphrodisiac.

416
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,480
Child Bearing Pill?

417
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,550
Aphrodisiac?

418
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,160
You knew it was an aphrodisiac,
yet you took it?

419
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,350
Because I thought

420
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,240
you wanted to have children.

421
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,590
When did I say

422
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,550
that?

423
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,310
You brought it up yourself.

424
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,240
Parenting methods.

425
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,270
That's a misunderstanding.

426
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,960
This is all a misunderstanding.

427
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,350
You're the one clearly trying

428
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,160
to take advantage of me.

429
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,070
What about you?

430
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,350
Do you

431
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,920
have affections for me?

432
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,960
Wait, wait...

433
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,880
No, no, no...

434
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,350
Ji Chu.

435
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,030
Ji Chu.

436
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,590
Let's find something else

437
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,070

438
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,310
