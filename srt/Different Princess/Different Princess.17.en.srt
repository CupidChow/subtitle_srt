[Episode 17]

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,480
Come on.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,200
Let's go.

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,070
Split up.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Miss Lin.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,910
As long as we find

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,750
the blueprint of this place,

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,560
we can locate

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,280
the prison.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Your Highness.

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,560
There is

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,800
a camp soldiers' roster here.

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,560
With so many soldier rosters,

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,150
it shows that it's more than

27
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,400
illicit firearms manufacturing.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
They likely raise an army.

29
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,190
Is the Wei family planning to rebel?

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,630
We need more evidence.

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,910
Keep searching.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
How dare you

33
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,190
slack off.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
It's my fault.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,470
I had a stomach pain.

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,150
It's my fault.

37
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,080
Focus on what matters.

38
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,470
Hurry, open the door.

39
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,870
Must get rid of everyone

41
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,630
in the military camp immediately.

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,310
I've already sent someone

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,840
to tamper with the food.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,430
It should be resolved on cat paws.

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,310
Also,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
all weapons

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,120
must be immediately buried on site.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
I'll send someone to do it right away.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
This matter is of great importance.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,150
We cannot delegate it to others.

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,430
I'll go with you. Overseeing it myself.

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,190
Open the door.

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
Isn't General Wei

54
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,160
Prince Qi's uncle?

55
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,190
Why does he want to arrest Prince Qi?

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,870
They must have

57
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,630
the intention to rebel.

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,360
Could it be

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,270
that Prince Qi

60
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,680
knows this secret,

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
so he was imprisoned here?

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,950
It's possible.

63
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,630
I heard General Wei saying

64
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,950
that he wanted to silence everyone.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Doesn't that mean

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,190
Qing and Prince Qi are in danger?

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,750
Is your plan working?

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
It's been so long,

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
and no one came to our rescue.

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,630
Can you stop wandering around?

71
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,600
It's making me dizzy.

72
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,120
Is there no hope for us?

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
Don't worry.

74
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,870
Your buddies

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
will definitely come to rescue us.

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,190
If I can

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,070
safely return this time,

78
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,310
I will definitely make amends to them.

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,870
Cheer up.

80
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,560
There are always more solutions
than difficulties.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,190
Do you have any other solutions?

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,190
Come over. Keep watch for me.

83
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,950
I'll give it a try.

84
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,190
Let me do it.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,270
Don't waste your effort anymore.

86
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,480
Open the door.

87
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
Hua Qingge.

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,190
You must hold on.

89
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,560
So you're not blind after all.

90
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
I didn't expect

91
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,360
that all of this
was just an act you put on.

92
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,190
Blind...

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
You're the one who's blind.

94
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,920
Okay.

95
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,310
Then today,

96
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,920
let me kill both of you myself.

97
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Qing. Feng.

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,920
Are you all okay?

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,560
Yun.

100
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,310
You all finally came.

101
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
I'm glad that you're okay.

102
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,190
Yao.

103
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,920
It's okay.

104
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Yao.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,480
We found

106
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,630
the clues Qing left behind,

107
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,000
which led us to the prison.

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
Yao, you are awesome.

109
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,680
If it weren't for me,

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,750
Your Highness
might have found you faster.

111
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,120
You arrived just in time.

112
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,190
It's not safe here.

113
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,680
We'd better leave.

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,870
Let's go.

115
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,000
What happened to your foot?

116
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,950
I hurt myself from a fall.

117
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,920
Let me take a look.

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,190
I'll carry you on my back.

119
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,600
Be careful.

120
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,480
My shoes...

121
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
Who are you here to rescue exactly?

122
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,750
Stop.

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't run.

124
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,600
Stop.

125
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,560
Stop.

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,270
Let's split up.

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,190
I'll lead the pursuing troops away.

128
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,360
I'll go with you.

129
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,040
You alone

130
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,310
are enough to attract attention.

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,390
Okay.

132
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
Be sure to stay safe.

133
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,240
I'll notify Fang Cheng now

134
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
to lead troops for support.

135
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,360
We'll

136
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,870
meet outside this mountain later.

137
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,630
You both should leave quickly.

138
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Let's go.

139
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,750
Stop.

140
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,870
Don't run.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,790
Quick, this way.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:42,870
Come.

143
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,200
Stop.

144
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Over there, over there.

145
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,200
Hurry.

146
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,670
Stop.

147
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,630
How long until we can escape?

148
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
Once we climb over this mountain,

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,390
we should be safe.

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,510
Let's hurry up.

151
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,750
Hold... Hold on.

152
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
You really are troublesome.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,150
Has everything been cleared off?

154
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,600
There were two who escaped.

155
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,510
I've already sent someone
to silence them.

156
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,320
General.

157
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
The camp is surrounded by troops.

158
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,200
They're about to break through

159
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,150
the gate.

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Whose troops are these?

161
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,200
They arrived so quickly.

162
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,080
Ji Feng.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,360
Chu.

164
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,030
Chu. You are here.

165
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,270
Chu.

166
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,550
Chu.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,870
Chu.

168
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,510
Princess Consort Lv said

169
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,870
you would come to rescue me.

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
She didn't lie to me.

171
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,000
I...

172
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
I'm very happy

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,670
that you came.

174
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
It shows that you still consider me
as your second brother.

175
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,670
I remember

176
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,510
that you liked

177
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,030
to follow me around
since you were a child.

178
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,840
But since coming back
from the southern border,

179
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
you've never called...

180
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
Never called me

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,550
"second brother" again.

182
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,960
I know.

183
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,510
I know my Mother owes you.

184
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,600
Making you live in pain

185
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,360
every day for over a decade.

186
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,240
Chu.

187
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,000
How about

188
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,360
I pay back for her with my life today?

189
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,360
Feng.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,790
I'm done, let's go.

191
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,550
Chu sent you to rescue me, right?

192
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Qing.

193
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,600
It's all my fault.

194
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,030
In the past, as an older brother,

195
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,840
I didn't treat him well.

196
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,840
I owe him.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
Going through these hardships,

198
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,390
I have come to understand a lot.

199
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,480
If I can

200
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,150
safely return this time,

201
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,200
I will definitely make amends to them.

202
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,030
Why?

203
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
Ji Feng. Why?

204
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
Stop.

205
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,120
Go, quickly.

206
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
Let go of me.

207
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,630
Why did you kill him?

208
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,150
Go.

209
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,320
Let go of me.

210
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
Ji Feng.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,750
Be careful.

212
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,670
Stop.

213
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,790
Hurry.

214
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,270
Stop.

215
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:08,840
Your Highness.

216
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Be careful.

217
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,030
How are you?

218
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Your injuries need prompt treatment.

219
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,120
Your Highness.

220
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,440
Are you okay?

221
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,150
I'm fine.

222
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,510
Miss Lin is injured.

223
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,200
Quickly take her for treatment.

224
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,360
But, Your Highness, you...

225
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,200
I still need

226
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,360
to rescue Qing and Feng.

227
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Your Highness.

228
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,550
Let me go and rescue them.

229
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,550
It's okay.

230
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,270
I have to

231
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,000
bring them back unharmed myself.

232
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,750
I'll leave everything here to you.

233
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,670
Sure.

234
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,360
Your Highness.

235
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,670
You must come back safely.

236
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,000
Let go of me.

237
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,200
Let go of me.

238
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,030
You murderer.

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,750
Let go.

240
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,670
Get away from me.

241
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,630
Stop screaming.

242
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,870
See if it still hurts.

243
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,440
It's just dislocated.

244
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,790
I've set it back in place.

245
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,200
Let go of me.

246
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
How much farther

247
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,030
do you think your feet can walk?

248
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,360
Over there.

249
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,080
Feng.

250
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,080
Feng!

251
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,550
Why?

252
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,870
Why?

253
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,600
Why did this happen?

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
Who did it?

255
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,630
Who did it?

256
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,630
Who did it?

257
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,080
Feng.

258
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Feng.

259
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,200
Feng.

260
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,670
Ji Chu.

261
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,030
Stop.

262
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,200
Over here.

263
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,510
Stop.

264
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,790
Quick.

265
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,240
Stop.

266
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,880
Stop.

267
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,640
Quick.

268
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,920
Stop.

269
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,110
What should I do?

270
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,270
Is my life

271
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,680
going to end here today?

272
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,030
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,480
You can't escape.

274
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,310
Just accept your fate.

275
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,030
Wei Zhao.

276
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
How dare you attack the prince.

277
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,030
Are you trying to rebel?

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
At this point,

279
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,550
even if I have to die,

280
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,960
I'll have a prince to die with me.

281
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,030
Duke.

282
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,590
I've searched the entire weapon camp.

283
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,200
There is no sign
of the traitor Wei Zhao.

284
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,350
He can't run far.

285
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:06,960
Get him.

286
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,480
Yes.

287
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,270
Go.

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
We are outnumbered.

289
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,070
Playing hardball will inevitably

290
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,790
fail to keep her safe.

291
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,240
Shoot.

292
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Wei Zhao.

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
I just sent Prince Lv away.

294
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,350
And Your Highness
has graced us with your presence.

295
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,480
What did you do to Prince Lv?

296
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,440
I think that by now, he's already

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,830
a pile of bones beneath the cliff.

298
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,400
I will now send you to meet your brother

299
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,030
down there.

300
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,030
Go!

301
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,160
Duke.

302
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,160
Your Highness.

303
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,790
I've failed to serve you on time.

304
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,960
Duke, please rise.

305
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,200
Wei, the traitor.

306
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,750
How dare you!

307
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,350
Raised an army.

308
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,550
With the intention to rebel.

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Fleeing with guilt.

310
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,030
And now, you have caused
the death of the prince.

311
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,590
I am here by the command of His Majesty

312
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,240
to apprehend you.

313
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,030
I entrust this matter to you, Duke.

314
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,350
I need to rescue them from the cliff.

315
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,310
Your Highness, don't worry.

316
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,480
Kill without mercy.

317
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,750
Kill!

318
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,200
Leader.

319
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
My identity is at risk of exposure.

320
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
I better not show up again.

321
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,270
Quickly search below the cliff
for Ji Chu.

322
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,790
Be sure to silence him.

323
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,920
Yes.

324
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,160
Wake up.

325
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,160
Ji Chu.

326
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,640
Wake up.

327
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,790
Ji Chu.

328
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't let anything escape.

329
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
Find Ji Chu and kill without mercy.

330
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
The devil killed Ji Feng disregarding

331
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,960
brotherhood.

332
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,590
Should I save him?

333
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Search carefully.

334
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
Including the trees and the bushes.

335
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,880
I must be crazy to save you.

336
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,720
[Mystic Medicine House]

337
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't know if Qing

338
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,270
and the others have found Feng or not.

339
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,960
I've been feeling restless
these past few days.

340
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,160
Princess.

341
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,030
You'll feel relieved when you see Gongge

342
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,510
in a moment.

343
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,960
Do not speak nonsense.

344
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,240
Stop.

345
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,960
Xiyao.

346
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,240
- Xiyao.
- Princess.

347
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,480
What happened?

348
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,400
Why were you injured?

349
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,000
Hurry, come in.

350
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Hurry, call your House Master.

351
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,350
Xiyao is injured.

352
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
House Master is not in.

353
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,960
I can help Miss Lin

354
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
with her injuries.

355
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,310
Not here?

356
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,400
Where did he go?

357
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,030
House Master

358
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
went to attend to some matters.

359
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,200
Right. This way.

360
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
Hurry.

361
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,440
Gongge.

362
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,240
Prince Lv and Miss Qing

363
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,550
had fallen off the cliff.

364
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,680
His Highness has dispatched

365
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,640
search and rescue teams.

366
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,110
There may be unforeseen circumstances.

367
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Quick.

368
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,590
Let's join the search and rescue.

369
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,400
She saved me.

370
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,270
What do you mean by this?

371
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,200
Are you awake?

372
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,480
I can't stand by and watch someone die.

373
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
I've decided to take you back.

374
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,550
You tell the truth,

375
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,350
and let the law decide.

376
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,550
The truth?

377
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,750
Do you think what you saw

378
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,070
is the truth?

379
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,110
You...

380
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
What do you mean?

381
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,350
Never mind.

382
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,310
Have something to eat.

383
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,960
It will give you the energy to move on.

384
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,830
Are you feeding me this?

385
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,510
This...

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,110
What's wrong with this?

387
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
This is what Lord Bei eats

388
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
during his adventures.

389
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,480
They provide rich protein.

390
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,160
Besides, we cannot light a fire.

391
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,240
What if it attracts

392
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,270
those who are chasing you?

393
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,440
What should we do then?

394
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,400
Take them away.

395
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,880
Forget it.

396
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,550
I command you

397
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,310
to untie me.

398
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,960
You better get things clear.

399
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,790
The power of life
and death is in my hands now.

400
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,270
Don't try to be arrogant here.

401
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,240
What's wrong with you?

402
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,200
It's hot to the touch.

403
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,790
It must be around 39 degrees.

404
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
Could it be that the wound is infected

405
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,750
and causing a fever?

406
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,750
Fortunately, I gained some knowledge

407
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,880
of traditional Chinese medicine

408
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,000
when writing the chapters
of Mystic Medicine House.

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,000
If Ji Yun and the others

410
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,240
meet up with Fang Cheng,

411
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
they'll surely find a way to rescue me.

412
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,270
I need to leave some marks for them.

413
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,830
Please.

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,350
I hope their protagonist halo

415
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
can shine on me.

416
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,070
Who's there? Stand still.

417
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,350
Stop.

418
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,200
Stop running. Quick.

419
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,750
Stop.

420
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,550
Get her.

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,480
Hurry.

422
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Where you're running to?

423
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,920
Speak.

424
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,110
Where is Prince Lv?

425
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,200
Be sensible.

426
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,350
Lead us there quickly.

427
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,270
I... I don't know.

428
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,920
He might be dead.

429
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm not really associated with him.

430
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,750
Then there's no use keeping you alive.

431
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
Wait, hold on.

432
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,240
I...

433
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,510
It's not that I don't want
to go with you.

434
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,830
When I was escaping just now,

435
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,160
I broke my leg.

436
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,400
I can't walk.

437
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,790
Then

438
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,070
draw us a map

439
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,510
of where Prince Lv is hiding.

440
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,200
I can draw it for you.

441
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,110
But you have to promise not to kill me

442
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,510
after I finish.

443
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,790
Hurry up.

444
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,680
Why is the bamboo forest
covered with fog?

445
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,270
Why do I feel something is not right?

446
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,070
Gongge.

447
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,440
[Cottage]

448
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
The map I drew for them

449
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,350
is a detour.

450
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,920
It can only buy me some time.

451
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,830
I need to leave as soon as possible

452
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,240
to rescue Ji Chu

453
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
before them.

454
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,590
Your Highness.

455
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,920
I've failed to serve you on time.

456
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,550
Your Highness.

457
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,510
Here you go.

458
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
Take it slowly, Your Highness.

459
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,550
It's due to the deterioration
of the wound.

460
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,240
Quick.

461
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,640
Let's get him out of here quickly.

462
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay.

463
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,200
Let's go, Your Highness.

464
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,640
Hold on.

465
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,000
I have to wait for Qing.

466
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,310
Don't mention that

467
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,510
ungrateful woman again.

468
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,030
Do you know

469
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,160
how we found you?

470
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,400
Chu.

471
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,510
You disregarded the plan for her.

472
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,310
And now you're in danger yourself.

473
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,310
Yet, she has betrayed you,

474
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,240
and you don't even know.

475
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,960
Now

476
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,590
you can see her true intentions.

477
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,270
No.

478
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,510
