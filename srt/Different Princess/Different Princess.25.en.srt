00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,790
It's so troublesome.

196
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,030
I sneaked you out

197
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,240
of the palace.

198
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,750
It's a huge responsibility.

199
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,870
I didn't know it'd be so boring.

200
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
Pumpkin.

201
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,960
Tell me something.

202
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Why do you hate me so much?

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,510
Isn't it obvious?

204
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
Come on. Tell me.

205
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,150
My father

206
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,080
has already found his love

207
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
in Nanjing.

208
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
She is

209
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,120
the only one worthy of
being with my father.

210
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,390
Ji Chu had a girlfriend

211
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,270
in Nanjing?

212
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,910
Who is this woman?

213
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,030
Why should I tell you?

214
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,320
She is beautiful like the flowers
and gorgeous like the Moon.

215
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,630
She is a mistress of elegance and grace.

216
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,910
Only she is worthy
of being with my father.

217
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,550
And you?

218
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,670
Forget it.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,870
I'm not going to

220
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,080
argue with a child.

221
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,960
You may act like an adult,

222
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
but you're a kid at heart.

223
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Miss, browse around.

224
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,320
I'll take that.

225
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,150
Here you go.

226
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,270
How much was that?

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,000
Only ten wen.

228
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
I didn't ask for this.

229
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,270
Here you go.

230
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,200
You're welcome.

232
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,320
You don't say it out loud,

233
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,200
but you certainly act like you love it.

234
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,240
I want that!

235
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,270
Something is wrong.

236
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,240
Where did they go?

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,390
Run!

238
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550
Who are you?

239
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,630
Did Prime Minister Li send you?

240
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,910
Pumpkin!

241
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,510
Your Highness!

242
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Take him away.

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,840
Take him back.

244
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,440
Yes.

245
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,510
Father.

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
How did you know we were here?

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
The secret guards informed me.

248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,030
You were too reckless

249
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,240
to bring Pumpkin out of the palace.

250
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,790
Sorry.

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,390
I asked her

252
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,840
to sneak me out.

253
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,240
That's more like it.

254
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,270
I'm glad you're both all right.

255
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,910
Let's go back.

256
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,550
Pumpkin!

257
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,440
Your Highness.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
The assassin we captured

259
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
would not budge

260
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,390
no matter what we did.

261
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,510
Keep interrogating him.

262
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,840
We must track down the mastermind.

263
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,750
Yes.

264
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,870
Ji Chu!

265
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,000
I have a question...

266
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,910
Had I not been there,

267
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,510
it could've gone so much worse!

268
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,870
It was my mistake.

269
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,870
I didn't think

270
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,320
the assassin would hurt Miss Qing.

271
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,200
It must never happen again.

272
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,200
Yes.

273
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,750
It gets more confusing
the more I think about it.

274
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,790
Why would an assassin

275
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,360
go after Pumpkin?

276
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,390
Who is he anyway?

277
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,240
When I asked Gongye Qi,

278
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,840
he didn't give a straight answer.

279
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,550
Pumpkin's true identity

280
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,240
must be more complicated.

281
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,270
He's not

282
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,200
your son,

283
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,200
am I right?

284
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,200
You are right.

285
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,550
But who is he anyway?

286
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,960
Why did you take him in?

287
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,440
After that attack earlier,

288
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,150
it's time I tell you

289
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,960
the whole story.

290
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,790
He is the emperor of Nanjing,

291
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
Wei Nanqing.

292
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,840
The emperor of Nanjing...

293
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,750
I thought he'd come
from a well-off family,

294
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,960
but this is

295
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
way beyond my imagination.

296
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,960
We didn't want to

297
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,150
keep it a secret from you.

298
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,240
It was safer

299
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,390
if fewer people knew.

300
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,870
But at this point,

301
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,080
his identity has been compromised.

302
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,600
We must be even more cautious.

303
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,790
Did Prime Minister Li send you?

304
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,480
Did the prime minister

305
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,240
of Nanjing

306
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,960
send the assassin?

307
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,110
No.

308
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,070
Prime Minister Li's men

309
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,960
wouldn't have saved you.

310
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,640
Who else could it be?

311
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,480
I will get to the bottom of this.

312
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,880
Remember,

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,070
do not take Pumpkin
out of the palace again.

314
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,240
I wouldn't dare.

315
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,160
We could've avoided this

316
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
had you told me sooner.

317
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,240
Why go through the trouble

318
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,310
of making him your son?

319
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,000
Pumpkin lost his father at a young age.

320
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,200
He grew up with me,

321
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,310
calling me his father.

322
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm used to it.

323
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,750
What about your lover in Nanjing?

324
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
Is that Pumpkin's mother?

325
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,200
What's wrong?

326
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,200
Are you jealous?

327
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,880
No, I'm not.

328
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,070
It's written all over your face.

329
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,750
I like it better when you act like

330
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
last night.

331
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,070
Qing?

332
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,550
Last night...

333
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,750
Did you mean

334
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,000
what you say?

335
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
Do you like me?

336
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,880
What do you mean?

337
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,310
I don't remember.

338
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,440
You're in the royal family.

339
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,000
You must abandon all of

340
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,830
your old habits.

341
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,070
At the crown prince's wedding,

342
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,550
your very behaviour and actions

343
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,830
must reflect
the royal family's standards.

344
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Walk with smaller steps.

345
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,240
Turn around.

346
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,200
Straighten your back.

347
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,240
Eyes to the front.

348
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,680
Turn around.

349
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes.

350
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,400
That's more like it.

351
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,750
That's all
for your posturing lesson today.

352
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,030
These are the books you must read

353
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,790
before the wedding day.

354
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,550
These are rules for the palace

355
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
and the women here.

356
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,440
Rules for women?

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,350
Yes.

358
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,270
Not just the noblewomen.

359
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,830
Even the commoners

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,680
must read this book.

361
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,070
Rule one:

362
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,110
never disrespect your husband

363
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,000
or go against his will.

364
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,270
Rule two:

365
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
never show yourself outside.

366
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,750
Stay within the house

367
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
and adhere to the etiquette.

368
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,510
Rule three...

369
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,880
Wait.

370
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,590
Why should a woman stay in the house?

371
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,750
Women should

372
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,160
form their own opinions

373
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,920
and do what they want.

374
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,270
They shouldn't be caged.

375
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,550
I will read the rules.

376
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,480
But not the rules for the women.

377
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,920
You may be

378
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,510
the Duke's daughter,

379
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,240
but a coroner does not

380
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,510
belong in the royal family.

381
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,480
Do you want the crown prince

382
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,160
to be mocked by the people?

383
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,030
I am a coroner.

384
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,440
But I don't see

385
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
how that is a problem.

386
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,310
Do not use it as an excuse.

387
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
I will read this.

388
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
But I am only doing it

389
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,880
for the crown prince's sake.

390
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,920
You asked for me.

391
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,240
Xiyao.

392
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,880
It seemed I was rash

393
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,240
about our marriage.

394
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,680
How so, Your Highness?

395
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,200
I proposed rashly

396
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,310
without considering your feelings.

397
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,590
Secondly,

398
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,480
after you become the crown princess,

399
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
you can work as a coroner.

400
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,590
That is not fair to you.

401
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,110
If this is against your will,

402
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,350
I'll inform my father

403
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,480
to call off the marriage.

404
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,750
I will take

405
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,960
full responsibility.

406
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,750
Do you regret proposing?

407
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,350
No.

408
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,830
I know you are a great person.

409
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,960
This is my decision.

410
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,200
You need not be concerned.

411
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,510
Is this choice

412
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,030
really worth it?

413
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,640
There are things

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,070
that can't be quantified this way.

415
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,550
I only know that

416
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,270
I must move forward
now that I've made my choice.

417
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,590
There's no time to regret.

418
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,790
You are an unusual girl indeed.

419
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
I know your heart
belongs to someone else.

420
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,480
But there is a chance

421
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,750
I will have it one day.

422
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,160
I believe that

423
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,200
the day will come for me.

424
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,750
I know it.

425
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,030
Will you

426
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,830
walk down this path with me?

427
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,480
Sure.

428
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,890
[Prince Lv Residence]

429
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,000
Master,

430
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,750
you must never

431
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,880
sneak out again.

432
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,830
I was worried sick

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,920
when I heard you had

434
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,310
run into an assassination.

435
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,550
You are too timid.

436
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,640
You'd panic because
of the slightest thing.

437
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,200
Master, your fruit tea.

438
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,240
Leave it here.

439
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,590
Yes.

440
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,240
You brought up your father

441
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,640
every chance you got.

442
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,440
Oh, Wei Nanqing.

443
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,480
You certainly had me fooled.

444
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,750
Did Father tell you everything?

445
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,350
Stop calling him that.

446
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,590
You are trying to

447
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,880
sabotage my relationship.

448
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,790
You could tell?

449
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,790
Do I look like a fool to you?

450
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
Seeing risked your life

451
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,270
to save mine yesterday,

452
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,200
I won't

453
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,240
pick on you again from now on.

454
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,310
Let's talk business.

455
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,200
Is Ji Chu's lover in Nanjing

456
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,510
actually...

457
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,070
It's my older sister,

458
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,000
the First Princess of Nanjing,

459
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,350
Wei Nanyi.

460
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,440
The First Princess?

461
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Are these two...

462
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,480
They have feelings for each other.

463
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,510
Without my sister, Wei Nanyi,

464
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,440
Father would've died

465
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,160
in Nanjing.

466
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,680
In that case,

467
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,750
my sister actually

468
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,440
saved my father!

469
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,440
You can't beat my sister,

470
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,480
so you beat me to my fruit tea.

471
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,400
This is strange.

472
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,440
This thing

473
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
tastes funky.

474
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,510
When a person is upset,

475
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,030
everything will taste bad.

476
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,160
I am not

477
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,920
your stepmother anymore.

478
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,920
I can teach you a lesson.

479
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,680
Master, stop.

480
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,310
Stop right there!

481
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,640
You could hurt yourself.

482
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,160
Why you...

483
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,920
Stop...

484
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,030
Don't play dead now.

485
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,240
Old witch?

486
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,440
Old witch?

487
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,830
Wake up!

488
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Old witch?

489
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,510
Your Highness,

490
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,400
the assassin died

491
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,440
from the torture.

492
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,350
It seems there will be
another assassination attempt.

493
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,200
Your Highness!

494
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,270
What is it?

495
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,270
A report came in.

496
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,880
Someone tried to poison the boy.

497
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,270
The Princess Consort
accidentally took the poison.

498
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
What?

499
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
This poison is powerful.

500
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,640
Without the antidote,

501
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Qing might not see another day.

502
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,200
No.

503
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,510
I must save her.

504
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,000
Every poison has a specific antidote.

505
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,110
We don't know
how the poison was formulated.

506
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,510
It will take a long time

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,750
to come up with a viable antidote.

508
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,510
I will do my best.

509
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,240
Go!

510
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,240
Your Highness.

511
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,790
I've failed you.

512
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,030
Now is not the time for this.

513
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,200
Have you found the one responsible?

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,640
The servant who spiked the wine

515
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,200
took her own life.

516
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,070
How did Qing end up getting poisoned?

517
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,550
We don't know.

518
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,160
Send them the antidote.

519
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,790
But if we did,

520
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,750
Prince Lv would suspect more foul play

521
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,240
and would never use it.

522
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,440
I'll send it myself.

523
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,440
Your Highness.

524
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,830
Doing so

525
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,270
will compromise our plan.

526
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,550
Qing's life

527
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,240
comes before anything.

528
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,750
Your Highness.

529
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,920
If you want to go,

530
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
you'll need an excuse.

531
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,070
We go to the Duke's residence.

532
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,200
Qing...

533
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,160
We are looking for an antidote.

534
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,680
You will be fine.

535
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,200
Your Highness.

536
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,880
The crown prince and the coroner

537
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
came to deliver a wedding invitation.

538
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,550
The crown prince...

539
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,960
Why now?

540
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,660
[Anxiang Hall]

541
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,030
You are delivering
the invitation personally.

542
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,310
I am genuinely surprised.

543
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,070
Don't mention it.

544
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Xiyao and Qing

545
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,200
are very close.

546
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,960
She wants to
meet her before our wedding.

547
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,240
Prince Lv,

548
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,960
where is Qing now?

549
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,030
Now is not the time.

550
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,590
Qing accidentally
drank some poisoned tea.

551
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,920
She is in a coma.

552
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,790
How can this happen?

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
Who is after Qing's life?

554
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,550
How is she now?

555
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
Is it bad?

556
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,070
Unless we find the antidote,

557
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
we could lose her.

558
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,920
This is an antidote

559
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,270
from the Healer Sage.

560
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,750
It's said to cure any poisoning.

561
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,640
Take it to Qing now.

562
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,750
