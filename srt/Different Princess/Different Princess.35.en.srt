00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,110
What very important thing is it?

193
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,150
Do you want to know?

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,550
Miss,

195
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,840
why don't you spend some time with me?

196
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,790
Sure.

197
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
You're so sensible.

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
Darling,

199
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,270
where did you get that knockout powder?

200
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,960
I took it from your medicine kit.

201
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
What if someone

202
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,240
tries to

203
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,080
do something to me when I'm out?

204
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
Of course I have to think of ways

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,240
to protect myself

206
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,840
and him.

207
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,200
You're awesome.

208
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,240
Dingguo Army is all over the city,

209
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,150
so I think

210
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,440
there's a mutiny in the palace.

211
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,440
It's likely that Yun is reigning.

212
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,600
But I don't think he'd

213
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,150
take the initiative.

214
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,840
So I think it's Mother

215
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,200
who started it.

216
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,030
If that's the case,

217
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,080
Chu may be in danger.

218
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,480
Darling,

219
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,270
I think it would be easier

220
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
for you to walk around

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,550
in this man's uniform.

222
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,910
Darling.

223
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,550
You and Chu are close friends.

224
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,670
I know

225
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,000
you wouldn't leave him alone

226
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,150
if anything happened to him.

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Go.

228
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,200
What about you?

229
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,030
Our baby and I will be waiting
for you to come home.

230
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,240
Let me send you

231
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,150
to Jingzhi Library.

232
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,000
It's all right.

233
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,440
Look,

234
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,630
I can protect myself.

235
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,360
I seem to have slept for a long time.

236
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,240
Where are we?

237
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,030
We're out of the city?

238
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,000
Are we going to the border?

239
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,910
No.

240
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,390
Where's my box of jewellery?

241
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,670
I...

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,200
Where are we going?

243
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Where is Ji Chu?

244
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,030
A divorce letter?

245
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,240
Yes.

246
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,480
His Highness has ordered us

247
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,120
to escort you to wait at the border.

248
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
And then?

249
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,240
His Highness will go to the border
to look for you

250
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,840
after he's finished
with his business in Shengjing.

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,080
If he can't,

252
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
you'll be free

253
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
with this letter

254
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,150
of divorce.

255
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,200
So?

256
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,960
His Highness left

257
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,910
this letter of divorce

258
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
and a box of jewellery for you.

259
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,910
This man is hilarious.

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,390
He just wants

261
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,600
to dump me without saying a word.

262
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,000
His Highness is doing this
for your sake.

263
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,910
For my sake?

264
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,750
Did he ask me

265
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,750
for my thoughts?

266
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,550
Turn around! Back to the city!

267
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,480
Well...

268
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,440
Not only the coachman has bad skills,

269
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,310
he also has bad ears.

270
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,480
His Highness has ordered us

271
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,400
to take you out

272
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,160
of Shengjing at all costs.

273
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,960
Fine.

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,350
Mo Yu,

275
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,310
if the coachman won't listen to me,

276
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,510
he'll listen to you.

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,830
Tell him

278
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,240
to take me back to Shengjing.

279
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,880
Or I will...

280
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,240
I'll stab myself

281
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,240
in the throat with this hairpin.

282
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll kill myself.

283
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
His Highness said

284
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,000
that you're not only scared of death,

285
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,240
but also very spoiled,

286
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,200
so you won't hurt yourself.

287
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't need to be scared
by your threats.

288
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,350
He looks down on me.

289
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,400
I'm telling you, if I'm desperate,

290
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,880
I'll do anything.

291
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,480
Look.

292
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,510
Can you take me back now?

293
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,000
What are you doing?

294
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,400
Your Highness,

295
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,880
if you try to harm yourself

296
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,270
in the slightest,

297
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,440
I will die

298
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,400
before you do.

299
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
Mister, slow down.

300
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,550
It's too bumpy.

301
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,790
Your Highness, everything is ready.

302
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,510
Attack.

303
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,110
Gongge?

304
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,480
Why are you here?

305
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,550
Of course I'm here to watch the fun.

306
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,310
Where's Wan'er?

307
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,480
She's at Jingzhi Library.

308
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,480
You shouldn't have come here.

309
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,590
Wouldn't things

310
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,920
work out better for you with me?

311
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,160
Even if I enter the palace,

312
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,830
Hua Yunni will still

313
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,000
send men to set up an ambush

314
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,270
on Tianhua Street.

315
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,440
I'll take Tianhua Street for you.

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,270
You take another route.

317
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm the one Hua Yunni wants to kill.

318
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,880
I'm the only one who can

319
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,270
get her attention.

320
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
What's the use of you?

321
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,830
Prince Lv is so amazing.

322
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,310
But now that I'm here,

323
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,070
I have to do something.

324
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,750
Since you insisted
on getting involved...

325
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,640
Xiao Yan.

326
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,920
Yes.

327
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,590
Give the letter to Qi.

328
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,680
I see.

329
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,590
Hua Yunni

330
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,550
must be killed by me personally.

331
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,400
I'll avenge your family's death for you.

332
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,310
Go to Xuanze Hall for me

333
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,640
to rescue Father

334
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,110
and use your medical skills

335
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,550
to cure him

336
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
so that he can regain
consciousness as soon as possible.

337
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,750
This is the best possible ending.

338
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Do it for Wan'er.

339
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,270
Okay.

340
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,550
I got it.

341
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,880
Xiao Yan,

342
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,590
lead a group of men

343
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,240
to disguise as Dingguo Army

344
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,920
and enter through Anfu Gate

345
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,310
take a detour

346
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,750
through Yongning Street

347
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,440
and enter Xuanze hall

348
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,640
to rescue Father in coordination

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
with Qi's third route.

350
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,070
Yes, Your Highness.

351
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,920
Your Majesty,

352
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,510
you're a retired emperor now.

353
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
When everything is over tonight,

354
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,590
I'll accompany you to Xing'an Palace.

355
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,550
It's time to leave
everything here to Yun.

356
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,440
Your Highness,

357
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,790
Duke has arrived.

358
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,110
Greetings, Your Highness.

359
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,920
Duke, please rise.

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,750
What's the situation now?

361
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,920
As you expected,

362
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Prince Lv has brought his men

363
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,830
to Tianhua Street.

364
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,070
I've ordered the gate to be closed.

365
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,000
The street has become a trap.

366
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,240
Prince Lv is trapped,

367
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,480
waiting to be killed.

368
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,440
I wanted to kill him,

369
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,920
so he broke into my trap.

370
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
He's got some guts.

371
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Anyway,

372
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,030
it's not uncommon
to take action while distracting

373
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,400
the enemy.

374
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,070
He must have sent another team

375
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,400
to infiltrate the palace.

376
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,920
You'll have to order your men
to be on guard

377
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
and search carefully.

378
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,070
Yes.

379
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,160
Well,

380
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
when should I return
the commander's token to His Majesty?

381
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,960
You can give it

382
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,030
to Yun

383
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,480
after Ji Chu dies tonight.

384
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,920
I understand.

385
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,960
Xi Yao, put this away for me.

386
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,200
Your Majesty, don't worry.

387
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,960
Your Highness.

388
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,160
What's the matter?

389
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,110
Replaying to Your Highness,

390
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,350
His Majesty invites you to Grand Hall.

391
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,310
I'm aware of that.

392
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,960
Empress Dowager has arrived.

393
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,110
Mother.

394
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Greetings, Mother.

395
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,790
Rise.

396
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,550
Thank you, Mother.

397
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,680
Yun,

398
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,310
what do we have to talk about here?

399
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,310
I suddenly remembered

400
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,830
that I haven't eaten with you

401
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,680
for a long time,

402
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,510
so I invited you to come.

403
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
That's so sweet of you.

404
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,310
Please have a seat.

405
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,110
I'll order the food to be served.

406
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,590
The two of you,

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,480
stop there.

408
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,590
Sir, what can I do for you?

409
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
Which palace are you two from?

410
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,070
We are from Fengyi Palace,

411
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,550
serving the empress dowager.

412
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,200
You work for the empress dowager?

413
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,070
Yes.

414
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,030
We've got a strong backing.

415
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,790
Take these two women down.

416
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,030
Are you tired of living,

417
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,510
how dare you hurt
the empress dowager's men?

418
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,440
The empress dowager has instructed

419
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,240
that anyone pretending
to be a palace maid

420
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,310
should be killed.

421
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,270
Which... Which one of your eyes can tell

422
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,310
we're fake?

423
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,790
If you're not fake,

424
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,550
why do you resist?

425
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
You're lying to us

426
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,790
when you said you can't tell

427
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,240
we're fake.

428
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,400
Are all the henchmen

429
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,070
so smart now?

430
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,830
Don't worry, Your Highness.

431
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,400
I'll protect you.

432
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,160
You...

433
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,550
Why?

434
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,750
My hand slipped.

435
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,510
Gongye Qi.

436
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
Why... Why are you here?

437
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,110
Where is Wan'er?

438
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,030
My wife is at Jingzhi Library.

439
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,750
I know

440
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,350
you usually love to join in the fun.

441
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,440
But it's not really the right occasion

442
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,350
for you to be here today.

443
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,680
Leave now. Quick.

444
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,110
I'm not here to kill Hua Yunni.

445
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,920
Then, what are you doing here?

446
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,070
I've been ordered by Prince Lv

447
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,590
to save the retired emperor.

448
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,640
Are you going to Xuanze Hall?

449
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,070
I think so.

450
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
But what are you doing here?

451
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,030
According to Chu's nature,

452
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,880
he should have

453
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,880
sent you out earlier.

454
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,790
How could

455
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,750
he let you risk your life here?

456
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,640
Mo Yu,

457
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,350
put the knife down.

458
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,110
Let's talk this over.

459
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,830
Mo Yu,

460
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,000
you can't do that anymore.

461
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,790
Look,

462
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,200
what if you hurt yourself?

463
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,310
My mission

464
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,310
is to protect you.

465
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
You can't say that.

466
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,750
Your life matters too.

467
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,510
Your Highness,

468
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,550
you...

469
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,240
Now that you've seen it,

470
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,480
I'll be honest with you.

471
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,750
My time in this world

472
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,240
is running out.

473
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,880
I want to spend the rest of my time here

474
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,310
with Ji Chu.

475
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,750
Mo Yu,

476
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
you're so kind.

477
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,680
You'll grant me

478
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
this little wish,

479
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,960
right?

480
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,510
Mo Yu adores me the most.

481
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,960
You must protect Qing well, then.

482
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,960
Now, she's

483
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,440
the apple of Ji Chu's eye.

484
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,920
If she gets hurt,

485
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,790
Ji Chu will resent you.

486
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Don't spout nonsense.

487
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,110
It's not that serious.

488
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,240
Don't worry, Gongge.

489
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,030
I'll protect Princess Consort Lv well.

490
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,480
The fact that you're here today

491
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,680
means

492
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,920
that Ji Chu gave you
the secret route map.

493
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,920
Take it.

494
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,750
If you follow the route
on this paper to the palace,

495
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,790
it's been handled

496
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,070
so it's very smooth.

497
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,350
But the rest of the route

498
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,240
will be a bit more difficult.

499
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,310
Where are you going?

500
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Let me escort you.

501
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,750
It's all right.

502
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,550
With Mo Yu here,

503
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm safe.

504
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,000
You'd better go
and save the retired emperor.

505
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,400
We're going to look for Ji Chu.

506
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,270
