Look, listen, question
and feel the pulse.

You wouldn't come to me,

181
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,200
so I had to come in person.

182

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,270
I hope you can take this opportunity

190
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,030
to break through all the obstacles.

191
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,750
Go for it,

192
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,480
Wan'er.

193
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,440
As long as Gongye Qi
has love in his heart,

194
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,840
there's still hope.

195
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,750
You've just had a bit of a shock

196
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,840
and are upset.

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Nothing serious.

198
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
How can it be nothing serious?

199
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,390
Can't you see

200
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm not feeling well

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
everywhere?

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,030
You're not a quack, are you?

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
I'm a quack?

204
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
No.

205
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,750
Her Highness has just been left

206
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,790
with some trauma,

207
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,080
and she's starting to talk nonsense.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,150
You'd better

209
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,270
check on her from all aspects.

210
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,320
Physician!

211
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,840
Physician!

212
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,080
Help, Physician!

213
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Physician!

214
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:14,870
Gang!

215
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,840
Gang!

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,910
Physician!

217
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,510
Help!

218
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,960
What's wrong with him?

219
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,960
Physician,

220
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,200
please save my younger brother.

221
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,840
He suddenly went crazy today

222
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,030
and couldn't be stopped.

223
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,840
The physicians in the city
say there's no cure to it.

224
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,320
I have no choice
but to ask you for help.

225
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,750
Gang!

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,480
Gang!

227
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,440
Gang!

228
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,550
Physician, this...

229
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,600
Carry him inside.

230
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,270
[Excellent Medical Skills]
Drink the medicine and he'll be cured.

231
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,030
Thank you, Physician.

232
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,790
Nangong Physicians
are highly skilled indeed.

233
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,870
Someone just said he's

234
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,840
a quack.

235
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,910
Did I?

236
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,200
You must have heard wrong.

237
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,440
Physician,

238
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
why isn't my brother waking up

239
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,270
even though he's been given medicine?

240
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,360
He's poisoned.

241
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
This poison is contained

242
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,200
in a poisonous herb
called Mind Confusing.

243
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,750
Once the victim

244
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,670
is stimulated by the outside world,

245
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,600
he'll

246
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,270
lose his mind and become violent.

247
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,030
Luckily, your brother
wasn't deeply poisoned,

248
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,390
or even the gods couldn't save him.

249
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
He's poisoned?

250
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,510
How could my brother be poisoned?

251
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Has he taken

252
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,120
something special recently?

253
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,550
Something special?

254
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,670
Does horse meat count?

255
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,630
Horse meat?

256
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,870
Horse meat?

257
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,510
It's strange that the horse

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,150
got spooked today.

259
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,270
I suspect someone did it on purpose.

260
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,840
Gang.

261
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,000
Gang.

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,030
Are you feeling better?

263
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,390
Gang.

264
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,150
Brother,

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
what's wrong with me?

266
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,550
Where am I?

267
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,440
Look at you.

268
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,750
You nearly died

269
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,320
for a mouthful of horse meat.

270
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,320
Luckily, this great physician

271
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,320
saved your life.

272
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,320
Did you pick up a horse

273
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,840
and kill it for meat?

274
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,480
No.

275
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,670
I bought it myself.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
You're so bold, Liu Gang.

277
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
Before Prince Lv,

278
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,960
you'd better tell the truth.

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I'll tell you.

280
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,390
I'll tell you.

281
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,790
I'll tell you everything!

282
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,910
Someone gave me ten taels of silver

283
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,150
to stop an exhausted horse

284
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,200
at the end of a lane

285
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,910
and kill it.

286
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,670
The horse looked good,

287
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,960
so I had a craving.

288
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,390
I cut off a piece of horse meat

289
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,510
and stewed it at home. I...

290
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,600
I really didn't know

291
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,960
it was poisoned.

292
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,630
Otherwise,

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,790
I wouldn't dare to eat it,

294
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,510
Your Highness.

295
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,080
Who ordered you to do it?

296
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,790
I really don't know about this.

297
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,960
But I know

298
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,030
that person

299
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
is from the palace.

300
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,320
Someone from the palace?

301
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,200
Could it be Imperial Consort Wei?

302
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,910
It seems that I have to

303
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,390
deal with the Wei family
as soon as possible.

304
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,840
Did you get everything done?

305
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,270
Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
Today, Hua Qingge and Princess Wan'er

307
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,390
were both in shock.

308
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,630
But they were

309
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,390
saved by Prince Lv,

310
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,240
so they're not hurt.

311
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,480
Fine.

312
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,360
If someone dies,

313
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,440
given Ji Chu's nature,

314
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,750
he'll get to the bottom of it.

315
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,630
How is Feng?

316
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
Prince Qi

317
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,200
still won't enter the palace to see you.

318
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,120
How unfilial.

319
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,560
[Jingzhi Library]

320
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,150
The lead to the person who paid Liu Gang

321
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,000
was cut off at the palace.

322
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,000
Who's trying to hurt me?

323
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,120
I wish I knew

324
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,360
what was going to happen next.

325
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
But I

326
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
can't remember anything right now.

327
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,150
It's my fault for writing

328
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,390
so many mindless plots

329
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,630
to make up the word count.

330
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm truly

331
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,750
the most miserable person
in the literary world.

332
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
I've written it,

333
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,440
and I still have to take care
of the after-sales service.

334

Qing.

335
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,270
It's rare to see you writing.

336
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,390
What are you writing?

337
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,000
Nothing.

338
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,030
I'm drawing randomly.

339
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,030
You're so mysterious.

340
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,080
All right.

341
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,480
I'll leave you

342
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,670
to your work, then.

343
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,240
What nonsense is this?

344
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,670
Give it to me.

345
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,270
I'm just trying to produce something.

346
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,320
It's just that it hasn't been done yet.

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,630
You've been in and out of the library

348
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,630
every day,

349
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,270
so you should be improving.

350
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,750
Forget it.

351
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,510
I'm considered

352
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,030
a literary person in my homeland,

353
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,960
just in a different region.

354
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,790
I know you've got a point,

355
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,670
but when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

356
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,750
Stop.

357
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,240
That's enough.

358
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,200
You didn't come to see me

359
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,550
just to make fun of

360
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,480
my low level of literacy, did you?

361
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,600
Of course not.

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,910
I've almost forgotten

363
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,270
the important thing
when you interrupted me.

364
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,200
Come with me.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
Where are we going?

366
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,670
Let's go.

367
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,080

368
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,000
here

369
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,960
but shuts us out.

370
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
What is she up to?

371
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
Princess Wan'er is too smart

372
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,030
to do anything out of the ordinary.

373
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,310
We shall just wait here.

374
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,880
Don't you wonder

375
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,960
what she's been doing in there

376
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,830
all this time?

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,880
you're getting less cute by the minute.

381
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,200
It's your turn now.

382
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,310
What do you want?

383
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
Take off your clothes.

384
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,880
Why do we have to take off our clothes
in the middle of the day?

385
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,310
Take it off.

386
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,110
No.

387
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,400
- Should I take it off too?
- You let her take it off first.

388
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,160
Both of you have to take it off.

389
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,880
No.

390
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,000
Well...

391
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,310
What are we doing

392
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,750
dressed up like this?

393
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm hosting a banquet today,

394
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,400
so of course we have to dress up.

395
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,830
Hosting a banquet?

396
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,680
What banquet?

397
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,750
It's a premium rice wine.

398
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,880
Come and take a look.

399
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,920
Mister, please come in.

400
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,310
I'm hosting a banquet here today

401
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,160
to thank

402
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,030
Gongye Qi

403
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,880
for curing me of my shock.

404
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,510
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

405
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,830
The villain is

406
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,200
a real spoilsport.

407
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,510
Why are you so careless?

408
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,310
Here.

409
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Have some tea.

410
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,270
Here you go.

411
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,640
Wipe it off

412
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,160
before it rubs on me.

413
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,070
It's your fault.

414
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,440
Don't you know that we should speak

415
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,160
when we eat and sleep?

416
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Your Highness,

417
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,920
may I borrow your handkerchief?

418
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,830
Miss Lin,

419
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,200
here you go.

420
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,790
You should smile

421
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
more often like this.

422
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,550
I thought I invited Feng.

423
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,160
Why isn't he here yet?

424
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,110
Stop.

425
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,680
Your Highness,

426
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,110
we've been circling the library

427
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,830
for more than ten times.

428
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Should we go in or not?

429
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,240
I'll go in if I want to,

430
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,790
or I won't.

431
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,590
It's not your place to say anything.

432
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,190
I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.

433
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,070
There's no one at the door

434
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,550
to invite me

435
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,440
to the banquet.

436
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
Obviously, she's not sincere.

437
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,240
I don't want to go.

438
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,240
Let's go to Rumeng House.

439
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,550
Ru...

440
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,270
Rumeng House.

441
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,830
Your Highness.

442
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Ji Feng...

443
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,510
No way.

444
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,310
Is this villain going
to do something again?

445
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,030
What is he

446
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,200
planning to do?

447
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,590
Come on, give me a hint.

448
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,550
Don't keep me

449
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,590
guessing the plot here, okay?

450
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,920
Your Highness.

451
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,640
[Rumeng House]
I've heard

452
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,880
that business at Rumeng House
has been declining

453
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,070
since

454
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Lady Wuxue's suicide.

455
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,270
There's also a rumor

456
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,240
that Lady Wuxue's spirit
is still around,

457
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,030
and she's hunting for men
to keep her company.

458
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,440
Many men have disappeared

459
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,590
in this town.

460
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,550
Is there such a thing?

461
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,240
Well, Your Highness,

462
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,200
you're of noble birth.

463
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,240
Why don't you go somewhere else?

464
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,510
Your Highness.

465
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,400
Uncle.

466
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,790
Your Highness,

467
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,480
your mother is ill because of you,

468
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,310
and you're still hanging out

469
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,400
in this undignified place?

470
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,000
My mother is ill?

471
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,270
She was fine two days ago.

472
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,590
How long has it been

473
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,830
since you've been to the palace?

474
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,000
Uncle,

475
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
is my mother seriously ill?

476
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
If you're filial,

477
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,590
you should visit her at the palace.

478
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,880
[Ning'an Palace]

479
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,640
Imperial Consort Wei,

480
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,590
Prince Qi has come to visit you.

481
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,350
He's waiting outside.

482
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,200
Feng's here.

483
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
Tell him I won't see him.

484
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,640
Your Highness, what do you mean?

485
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,960
You've been waiting for Prince Qi

486
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,070
for days.

487
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,000
Now,

488
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,550
why don't you want to see him?

489
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,200
This unfilial son,

490
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,000
I've always been looking out for him

491
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,790
and planning for him.

492
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,680
But he

493
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,480
believed in outsiders

494
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,070
and tried to fall out with me.

495
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,640
Your Highness.

496
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,960
Your Highness, calm down.

497
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,880
Don't get angry.

498
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,790
Siyan,

499
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
pass on a message to him for me.

500
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,480
Is my mother willing to see me?

501
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,200
Your Highness, please go back.

502
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,880
Her Highness isn't feeling well

503
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,070
and won't see anyone.

504
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,680
Is she very sick?

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,880
What did the imperial physician say?

506
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,070
The imperial physician has diagnosed

507
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,960
that Her Highness is suffering
from depression.

508
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,790
She needs to rest and recuperate,

509
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,270
and that she should not get angry again.

510
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,750
If Mother is still angry with me,

511
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I'll come back another day.

512
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,030
Your Highness,

513
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,960
Her Highness

514
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,440
has asked me to pass on
a message to you.

515
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,790
You should come back to see her

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,640
when you've thought it through.

517
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,960
What's it?

518
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,880
Her Highness said,

519
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,110
"Without Mother,

520
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,790
without the Wei family's support,

521
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,960
how can you

522
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
compete

523
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,160
in this bloodthirsty palace?"

524
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,070
But I don't want to compete.

525
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,380
[Rumeng House]

526
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,920
Your Highness,

527
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,070
shall I play you a song

528
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,350
to cheer you up

529
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,160
while you're drinking wine?

530
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,680
Cut the crap.

531
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,590
Get out!

532
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,480
Get lost now!

533
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,830
Well...

534
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,790
Your Highness,

535
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,680
this is an undignified place.

536
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,550
We

537
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,400
shouldn't stay here for long.

538
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,920
Why don't we just...

539
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,200
Go away!

540
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm of royal blood.

541
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,830
I'm not afraid of anything.

542
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,830
But...

543
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,590
Shut up!

544
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,880
Get lost,

545
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,920
or I'll kill you.

546
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,160
Quick.

547
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,000
Get out!

548
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,270
Okay, I'll go out now.

549
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,590
Right away.

550
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,830
Without you,

551
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,830
I'm more relaxed

552
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,440
and happy.

553
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,350
It's no fun

554
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,920
to sit around drinking

555
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
at such a wonderful time.

556
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,790
Why don't we play a drinking game?

557
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,310
I don't have a problem with that.

558
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,310
Crown Prince, are you okay with it?

559
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm really not good at this.

560
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,750
That's true.

561
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,550
The crown prince is so busy
with the government affairs

562
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,550
that he seldom has a chance
to have fun with others.

563
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,110
It's no fun playing a drinking game.

564
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,310
Why don't we play

565
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,750
something new and exciting?

566
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,920
What's new and exciting?

567
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,590
New and exciting?

568
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,070
In my heart,

569
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,240
killing is the only thing

570
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
that can arouse such feelings.

571
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,030
He's evil.

572
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,680
He's so evil.

573
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,240
I've worked so hard

574
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,590
to touch him with love and warmth.

575
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,920
But my efforts

576
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,920
ended up being in vain.

577
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,830
Chu,

578
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,400
don't scare Qing.

579
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
You know, she's a scaredy cat.

580
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,960
She's a scaredy cat?

581
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,270
I think you've got the wrong idea

582
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,070
about being a scaredy cat, don't you?

583
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,640
Why don't we hear

584
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,160
what Qing has in store for us?

585
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,960
Yes.

586
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
Qing always has

587
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,830
some strange ideas.

588
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,550
Maybe she will

589
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,960
surprise us again.

590
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,240
Then, as Prince Lv wishes,

591
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
we'll play a different kind of

592
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,920
killing game today.

593
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,480
This is basically how the killing game

594
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,640
is played in my hometown.

595
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,550
Do you all understand now?

596
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,400
So let's get this game started.

597
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm the Judge.

598
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,240
One for each of you, please.

599
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,960
Please close your eyes when it is dark.

600
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,640
Killer, please open your eyes.

601
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,240
Killer, please kill.

602
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,510
Killer, please close your eyes.

603
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,640
Constable, please open your eyes.

604
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,350
Fine.

605
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,790
Game over.

606
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,310
Everyone, please open your eyes.

607
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,400
Qing,

608
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,510
why is the game over

609
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,110
before I've identified the killer?

610
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,680
The killer

611
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,000
killed the constable right away,

612
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,310
how can we go on?

613
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,400
You're the killer?

614
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,510
Yes.

615
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,350
Why did you kill me?

616
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,310
Do I

617
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,790
need a reason to kill someone?

618
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,880
Who are you?

619
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,750
Don't try to play the fool

620
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
in front of me!

621
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,590
Lady Wuxue!

622
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,550
Leave me alone.

623
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,640
Leave me alone!
