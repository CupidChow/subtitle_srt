Those who

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,640
flattered and fawned over you
in the past

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,430

the grand wedding of His Highness.

18
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,870
No one remembers it was your birthday.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,590
I'm sorry for letting you down.

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
It's all my fault.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,560
I cannot avenge and vindicate for you.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,310
Your spirit in heaven,

24
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,120
please do not blame me.

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,310
I had long seen

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,240
that you were playing the fool.

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,470
You...

How could you...

As long as you cooperate with me,

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,910
you can avenge Ji Feng.

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,360
You've caused me to end up like this,

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
and now you want me
to cooperate with you?

Don't you want to know

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,310
Isn't that you?

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,870
Of course, it's not me.

39
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,030
The East Office has
investigated this case.

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,910
The murderer

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
is Du Hui, the East Office's Secretary.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
And Du Hui

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,870
is the leader of Tiger Totem
assassination group

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,190
from Fuyu,
which has infiltrated our country.

Who is giving orders
behind the scenes...

46
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,150
Your Highness.

47
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,910
It is self-evident.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,190
Could it be Empress?

49
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,680
Why would she want to harm Feng?

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,800
Kill two birds with one stone.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360

a third runs away with it.

This treacherous woman
in sheep's clothing.

I will kill her to avenge my son.

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
- Let go of me.
- Not only that.

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,190
It seems

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,430
that my mother's Demon Poison case

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,080
15 years ago is also related to her.

59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,840
What?

60
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,630
Fifteen years ago?

61
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,910
Do you still remember
the circumstances back then?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
Could it be...

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,070
This is absurd.

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,680
How dare that temptress,

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Imperial Concubine Xian
walk all over me.

66
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,160
Your Highness, please calm down.

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,430
Imperial Concubine Xian
is just an orphan

68
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,750
without a powerful family background.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,630
His Majesty is merely swayed

70
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,000
by her momentary charm

71
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,870
and thought of

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,480
promoting her to the Imperial Consort.

73
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,750
No.

74
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,680
I will never allow her
to be promoted to Imperial Consort.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,430
Never.

76
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,510
Your Highness.

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,510
Not only are you
displeased with this matter,

78
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,630
but Empress is also
likely to be unhappy about it.

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,190
Empress is usually

80
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,430
standing aloof from worldly affairs.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't believe

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,950
she can sit still at this moment.

83
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,950
What?

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,510
Can this poison cause someone
to demonize?

85
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,430
Physician Su unexpectedly discovered

87
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,190
that this Demon Poison

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,190
can temporarily cause rapid hair growth,

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,360
giving a monstrous appearance.
It's quite terrifying.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,310
If this poison were discreetly

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,070
administered to
Imperial Concubine Xian...

92
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
No.

93
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,630
This poison is eerie and powerful.

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830
It must not spread within the palace.

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,560
The consequences would be unimaginable.

96
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,800
Hurry, find someone to destroy it.

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
Yes.

98
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,870
Demon Poison?

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,870
Your Highness.

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,430
Empress revealed the matter
of the Demon Poison to me,

101
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,750
taking advantage of my jealousy

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
towards Imperial Concubine Xian.

103
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,270
His Majesty, bewitched by beauty,

104
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,560
wants to promote Imperial Concubine Xian
to Imperial Consort.

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,070
She's a lowly dancer

106
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,600
with no virtue or merit.

107
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,920
Calm down.

108
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,160
His Majesty has his own plans.

109
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,430
Neither you nor I can stop it.

110
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,070
Just listen.

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,630
It must not happen.

112
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,920
If she is promoted to Imperial Consort,

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,560
she'll surely seek to replace you
in the future

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,950
and become a great menace to the palace.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wei.

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,560
I advise you not to focus solely on

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
jealousy and rivalry.

118
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,800
Spend more time with Feng instead.

119
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,870
Your Highness.

120
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,750
What do you mean by this?

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,480
I shouldn't have revealed this matter.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
But as a fellow mother,

123
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,270
I empathize with your situation.

124
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,430
Your Highness.

125
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,680
Hurry, tell me, please.

126
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,750
Recently, our country has been
engaging in peace talks with Nanjing

127
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,630
and will be sending an envoy to Nanjing.

128
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,680
His Majesty

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
has decided to send Feng
for the mission.

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,430
What?

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
Why choose Feng for this mission?

132
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,190
No.

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,920
I will not allow Feng

134
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,190
to suffer.

135
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,190
The Imperial Consort has
truly gone to great lengths

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,750
for His Majesty's birthday.

137
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,800
The fun has just begun.

138
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,800
Great!

139
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,560
A clever move,
using someone else to do the dirty work.

140
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,430
So you also framed

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,430
the Su family?

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
The Su family.

143
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,190
How could I

144
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,160
frame the Su family?

145
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,160
I remember

146
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,920
I was pregnant
with another prince back then.

147
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,510
Empress sent me the medicine

148
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,630
prescribed by Physician Su.

149
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,800
But unfortunately, I had a miscarriage.

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
Empress insisted right in front of me

151
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
that there was

152
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,160
something wrong with
the medicine prescribed by Physician Su.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,510
Later on...

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,160
Later, His Majesty killed the Su family.

155
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,830
Was everything

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
you said true?

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
I pledge with the life of the Wei family

158
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,390
that there were no lies
in anything I said.

159
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,030
I'll try to arrange for you to meet

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
with Father again.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,790
But

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,670
you must say exactly

163
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,960
in all honesty.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,510
Certainly.

165
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,440
I will.

166
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,360
For real.

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,120
Yes.

169
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
I'm sorry for your Mother.

170

In consideration of Feng's

171

long-standing brotherhood with you,

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,750
avenge Feng's death.

173
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,200
Avenge Feng's death.

Bloodshed on His Highness's wedding.

178
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,200
You've committed a major taboo.

179
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,120
You pleaded earlier to spare Wei's life.

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,670
Are you just waiting for this day

181
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,150
to cause trouble for me?

The assassination of Wei

184
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,630
was not my doing.

185

However,

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
the assassin has escaped,

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000

190
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,480
There must be a misunderstanding
in this matter.

191
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,480
What do you mean?

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,550
Chu may resent Wei,

193
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,030
but he wouldn't dare to act so boldly

194
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
in broad daylight

195
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,870
at Changhan Palace.

196
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,750
There is something unusual about this.

197
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,510
Your Majesty,
please investigate thoroughly.

198
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,150
I will forgive you

199
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,120
for the sake of Empress.

200
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,550
Since Prince Lv

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,870
cannot be let off the hook,

202
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,510
being the Judge of the East Office

203
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,750
may be hardly convincing.

204
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,550
Today,

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,270
I will dismiss your position
in the East Office.

206
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,200
Be more cautious in your actions

207
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,320
from now on.

208
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,840
Do you understand?

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,200
I will comply.

210
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,600
Everyone, please withdraw.

211
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,120
Mother.

212
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,790
Thank you, Mother, for pleading for me.

213
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,750
Chu.

214
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
There's no need for such formality

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,630
and politeness between us.

216
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,510
Mother.

217
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
I will go back to the East Office first

218
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,360
to hand over my duties.

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll come to greet you later.

220
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,240
Go ahead.

221
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,910
Visit the palace often in the future
to see me.

222
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,630
Yes.

223
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,120
Your Highness.

224
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,600
Why did you speak up
for Prince Lv just now?

225
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,200
Seeing that His Majesty
wasn't truly intent

226
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,120
on holding Ji Chu responsible.

227
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,080
I took advantage of the situation

228
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,390
to provide His Majesty with a way out.

229
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,270
It also earned me some goodwill.

230
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,030
Why not take advantage of the chance?

231
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,750
Your Highness, you are wise.

232
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,200
Your Majesty.

233
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,790
You clearly know that Prince Lv

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,120
wouldn't commit such a rash act.

235
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,030
Dismissing Prince Lv's position

236
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,910
is because you're concerned
about his loyalty, isn't it?

237
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,510
If he retains control of the East Office

238
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,550
and possesses the Fish-shaped Token,

239
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,150
I am concerned

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
that it would be challenging
to control the situation in the future.

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
Then

242
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,200
as for Wei's corpse,

243
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,200
how should it be handled?

244
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,910
Regardless of the circumstances,

245
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,150
she is Feng's birth mother.

246
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,360
Give her a proper burial.

247
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes.

248
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,640
[Crown Prince Residence]

249
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,750
Your Highness.

250
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:01,870
I...

251
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,390
Your Highness, there's an urgent matter.

252
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,840
I think it'll take quite a while.

253
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,150
You don't need to wait for me.

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,270
Rest early.

255
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,030
Your Highness.

256
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,790
That's all I heard.

257
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,630
Is what you said true?

258
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
I dare not deceive you, Your Highness.

259
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,150
Later,

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
when Prince Lv intended
to bring Wei to meet His Majesty,

261
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,200
I took the opportunity to eliminate her.

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,510
Prince Lv's men were after me.

263
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,390
Fortunately,

264
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,600
I am familiar with the palace routes.

265
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,120
And so, I wasn't caught.

266
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,630
[Zhaochun Pavilion]

267
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,960
So

268
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,630
Wei was just a scapegoat.

269
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,150
The true mastermind behind this

270
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,750
is Empress?

271
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,030
Chu.

272
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
You have been dismissed.

273
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,440
What are your plans moving forward?

274
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,200
The person behind Wei's murder

275
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,240
must be Empress.

276
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,910
She may strike again.

277
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,670
Empress colluded
with foreign powers,

278
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,600
harmed the prince,

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,510
and framed the consorts.

280
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,960
Any of these charges
would be enough to hold her accountable.

281
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,670
Once I find solid evidence,

282
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,670
it'll be the death of
Empress and her family.

283
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
Your Highness.

284
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,600
What's the matter?

285
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,630
The Princess has sent a message.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
She invites you to a meeting
in the palace tomorrow.

287
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,960
I got it.

288
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,080
Why haven't I heard

289
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,440
you mention this princess before?

290
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,120
This princess

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,480
is Gongye Qi's beloved.

292
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,870
Her name is Ji Wan'er.

293
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,960
She is born to Empress.

294
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,360
What?

295
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,510
Qi is infatuated with the daughter

296
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,910
of the man who killed his father?

297
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,200
[Anxiang Hall]

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,120
I know Ji Chu resents
Imperial Consort Wei.

299
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,150
But why did he choose

300
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200
this critical moment to take action?

301
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,390
I need to go and ask.

302
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,270
Princess Consort Lv.

303
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,960
First Princess.

304
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,110
She came from Xuanyu Hall.

305
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,200
Yun.

306
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
So you come.

307
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,640
You sent someone to assassinate

308
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,790
Imperial Consort Wei, right?

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,590
Yun.

310
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,830
You have finally made progress.

311
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,790
Mother.

312
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,200
Is being ruthless and merciless
considered progress?

313
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,830
Did Imperial Consort Wei

314
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,440
say something?

315
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
I have already learned about

316
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,790
what happened 15 years ago.

317
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,310
Your Highness.

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,750
Yes.

319
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,440
The events from 15 years ago

320
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,310
were my doing.

321
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,920
Mother.

322
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,590
I thought

323
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,030
you sent someone to assassinate Feng

324
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,590
just because you got strayed.

325
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,960
I never expected

326
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,030
that 15 years ago,

327
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,880
you already committed

328
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,550
such a heinous crime.

329
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,200
It's all right.

330
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,550
I have only myself to blame.

331
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,510
Mother.

332
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,270
For these 15 years,

333
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,030
I have struggled to sleep at night.

334
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,200
All because

335
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,830
of the irreparable mistake I made.

336
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Your Highness.

337
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,750
Mother.

338
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,590
Why did you

339
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,350
do it back then?

340
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,070
Why?

341
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,680
It was all for you.

342
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,160
I had to secure my position
as Empress.

343
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,480
Only then could the position

344
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,110
in the East Palace firmly

345
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,960
fall into your hands.

346
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,550
I was planning for your future.

347
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,640
But I never cared about

348
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,350
the position in the East Palace.

349
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,510
That's because you have it.

350
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,240
So you say you don't care.

351
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,200
How many people lust for

352
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,830
the throne of the emperor?

353
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,200
You don't understand.

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
I know

355
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,480
you don't comprehend

356
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,310
my actions.

357
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,000
You can go and confess this matter

358
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,200
to His Majesty.

359
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,440
So I

360
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,110
won't have to suffer every day.

361
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,550
Your Highness.

362
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,750
You did it all for Your Highness.

363
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,070
Your Highness.

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,160
You are my Mother.

365
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,440
You know

366
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
that no matter what happens,

367
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,880
I will always protect you.

368
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,550
The day I feared the most

369
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
has come.

370
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,000
Your Highness.

371
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,350
His Highness

372
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,270
will understand you sooner or later.

373
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,640
If Yun is aware of this matter,

374
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,350
then Ji Chu must also know.

375
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,750
What should we do now?

376
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,400
Ask Qing to meet up tomorrow.

377
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,790
Yes.

378
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,550
Young Lady.

379
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,480
I cannot

380
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
bear the sight of
that Princess Consort Lv.

381
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,590
She is truly unruly.

382
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,590
Su Ju.

383
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,750
Don't say this again.

384
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,480
But Young Lady.

385
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,640
Clearly, you and Prince Lv

386
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,160
are the most well-matched.

387
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,030
Su Ju.

388
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,200
Chu and Princess Consort Lv
have an affinity with each other.

389
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,590
If I want to marry Chu,

390
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,510
I must first get along

391
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,550
with Princess Consort Lv.

392
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,610
[Anxiang Hall]

393
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
Ji Chu and Wei Nanyi

394
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,270
seem to be soulmates

395
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,030
who share everything with each other.

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,550
Princess Consort Lv.

397
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,680
First Princess.

398
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,920
Come, have a seat.

399
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,510
Calling me First Princess
sounds too distant.

400
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,270
Just call me Nanyi.

401
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,880
Nanyi.

402
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,680
Is there something you need from me?

403
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,160
No, nothing.

404
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,350
Just came to see you.

405
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,510
See me?

406
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,550
What's there to see?

407
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,160
Can the ex and current

408
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,310
be friends?

409
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,790
You're just as Chu described.

410
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,830
Straightforward.

411
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,920
Interesting.

412
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,550
He meant to say I'm offhand, right?

413
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,550
Being Princess Consort Lv

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,070
must be challenging.

415
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,880
It was indeed not easy at the beginning.

416
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,110
But later,

417
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,680
without the fear for my life,

418
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
it became much more comfortable.

419
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,920
How did you and Ji Chu meet?

420
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
I was eight years old.

421
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,070
The arrival of Liang's envoy

422
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,310
created quite a stir in the palace.

423
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,510
Out of curiosity,

424
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,590
I went to Chu's courtyard.

425
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,030
Remove his legs

426
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,550
and see how he can still run.

427
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,510
Yes.

428
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,400
Stop.

429
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,270
First Princess, why are you here?

430
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,640
I heard a commotion

431
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,550
from a distance.

432
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,550
Sure enough,

433
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,070
it was General Wang

434
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,830
throwing his weight around here.

435
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,270
Are you the envoy from Liang?

436
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,680
If you treat an envoy like this again,

437
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,400
I will hold you accountable.

438
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes.

439
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,310
Why don't you leave now?

440
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Yes.

441
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,830
Are you okay?

442
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,310
I didn't expect

443
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,590
the first time I met Chu

444
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,790
to be in such a terrible predicament.

445
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,830
Pumpkin is right.

446
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,750
If it weren't for Wei Nanyi,

447
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
Ji Chu's situation in Nanjing

448
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,550
would have been even more difficult.

449
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Wan'er.

450
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,030
What's the matter?

451
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,590
Chu.

452
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,680
On the day of Yun's marriage,

453
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,310
I took Gongye Qi to see Mother.

454
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,200
Did they meet?

455
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,400
But Mother

456
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,880
used the excuse of my arranged marriage

457
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,070
to indirectly reject

458
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,830
the idea of me marrying Gongye Qi.

459
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,310
So Gongye Qi and I discussed

460
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,200
that today at Zi hour,

461
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,000
we will meet

462
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,070
at the Jingzhi Library.

463
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,830
This...

464
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,310
Are you planning to elope?

465
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,480
Chu.

466
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,350
I know

467
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,200
only you can help me
escape from the palace.

468
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,400
Please.

469
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,200
Can you help me?

470
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,110
I won't help.

471
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,830
Why?

472
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,270
I can accommodate

473
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,110
in other matters,

474
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,200
but not

475
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,440
in this one.

476
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,240
Chu.

477
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,310
Chu.

478
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,510
I'm begging you.

479
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,270
Please, help me, okay?

480
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,550
Chu.

481
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,590
Chu.

482
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,440
Chu.

483
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,200
Chu!

484
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,830
Chu!

485
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,240
Qi.

486
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,000
Long time no see.

487
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,960
You are

488
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,000
still breathtakingly beautiful.

489
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,440
Aren't you also a silver tongue,

490
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,000
traveling to the ends of the earth?

491
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,030
I've been in Liang for a few days now

492
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,590
but haven't seen you.

493
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,160
What have you been busy with lately?

494
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,590
After settling the score,

495
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,830
I can follow my heart to pursue my love.

496
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,400
The status of you and the princess
are vastly different.

497
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm sure you'll face
many difficulties ahead.

498
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,510
So what?

499
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
Wan'er is the one I love.

500
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,310
Even if the road ahead is difficult,

501
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I will do everything

502
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,240
to make her happy.

503
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,200
Furthermore,

504
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,590
tonight we are leaving.

505
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,200
Leaving?

506
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,680
I want to take Wan'er

507
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,830
to the most lovely place in the world,

508
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,510
to live a life

509
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,240
free from worldly concerns.

510
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,270
Qi.

511
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,830
There's one thing

512
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,750
I must remind you of

513
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,350
to prevent you from
falling into an abyss

514
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,240
