00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,510
shouldn't ruin his reputation

194
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,240
by getting involved

195
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,440
[Emperor Xuanqi]
with a dancer.

196
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,550
Your Majesty, you're right.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,750
But...

198
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,600
Your Majesty,

199
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,240
Your Highness,

200
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,360
Imperial Consort Wei

201
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,030
and Prince Qi have arrived.

202
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,320
Summon them in.

203
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

204
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,950
[The Empress of Liang, Hua Yunni]

205
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,270
Greetings, Your Majesty,

206
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,270
Your Highness.

207
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,120
Greetings, Your Majesty
and Your Highness.

208
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Have a seat.

209
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

210
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,480
Feng, rise.

211
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
Thank you, Your Majesty
and Your Highness.

212
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,480
I assigned the crown prince
to East Office

213
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,030
to take charge of all the criminal cases

214
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,000
in Liang

215
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,790
so that he can build up

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,510
an image of justice

217
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,910
and be acknowledged by all.

218
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,320
But now,

219
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,790
he knowingly violated the law.

220
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,840
Not only is he suspected of murder,

221
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,030
but he's also involved with a dancer

222
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,240
from Rumeng House.

223
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,630
I'm truly disappointed in him.

224
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,750
What Ji Yun did

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,270
is disappointing.

227
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,360
Your Majesty,

228
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,750
please calm down.

229
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,910
Don't let this upset you.

230
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
It's bad for your health.

231
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

232
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't let it affect your health.

233
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,440
Now that it has come to this,

234
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,240
it's better to get to the bottom of this

235
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,360
and clear

236
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,030
the crown prince's name.

237
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
The crown prince

238
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,240
is the head of East Office.

239
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,840
Now that the crown prince
has committed a crime,

240
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,150
someone should

241
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,910
take over the post of
the head of East Office.

242
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,910
Anyway, don't worry, Your Highness.

243
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
When the truth is found out,

244
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,630
if the crown prince is wrongly accused,

245
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,080
East Office

246
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,790
will still be handed over
to the crown prince.

247
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,320
I'm not worried about that.

248
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,150
As a mother,

249
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,630
I know

250
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,750
the crown prince's character very well.

251
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,960
It's good that you're so confident.

252
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,510
So who do you think

253
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,320
should handle this case?

254
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,150
I think

255
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,270
as Prince Qi of Liang, Feng

256
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,960
should help you to relieve
your worries, Your Majesty.

257
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

258
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm willing to share your worries

259
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,080
by finding out the cause
of Lady Wuxue's death

260
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,870
and clearing Ji Yun's name.

261
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,670
Your Majesty,

262
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,630
Feng's grown up

263
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
and has become more sensible.

264
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
Why don't we let him try it out?

265
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,360
All right.

266
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
It's time to see

267
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,120
how you've improved.

268
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

269
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,480
I'll get to the bottom of this
as soon as I can.

270
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

271
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,390
I'm here to interrogate
the crown prince.

272
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
Please, Your Highness.

273
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,000
Feng.

274
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,150
You're here.

275
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,240
Yun,

276
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,870
all are equal before the law.

277
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Since you've made a mistake,

278
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,320
I should put you

279
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
in the prison of East Office.

280
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,960
But you're my elder brother.

281
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
If I really put you in the prison,

282
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,120
I'll be the one who will be disgraced.

283
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,200
Therefore,

284
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,910
until the case is cleared up,

285
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,550
please stay in your residence

286
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,120
and don't step out again.

287
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,870
Feng,

288
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,150
I'm happy for you that you've become

289
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
the acting judge.

290
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,150
Make sure you do a good job on the case.

291
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
I don't need you to lecture me,

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,270
Yun.

293
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
You look noble on the outside,

294
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,440
but you secretly got involved

295
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
with Lady Wuxue.

296
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,600
Take him away.

297
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

298
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,870
Your Highness,

299
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,360
please.

300
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,000
Miss, come and take a look.

301
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,240
It's home made.

302
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,240
It's very useful.

303
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,550
Please buy one.

304
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,840
(The crown prince has
really been taken away.)

305
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,080
(In the novel, Ji Chu
used this opportunity)

306
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,200
(to steal the crown prince's post.)

307
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,790
(If I want to change the ending
and return to the modern world,)

308
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,870
(I have to help
the crown prince clear his name)

309
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,910
(and prevent Ji Chu from succeeding.)

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,390
(Right,)

311
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,200
(in my novel,
it's the female lead, Lin Xiyao,)

312
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,440
(who's in charge of this case.)

313
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,030
(I have to team up with her.)

314
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,670
But I've searched everywhere

315
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,000
and I haven't seen anyone
like the female lead,

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Lin Xiyao.

317
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,600
I haven't even seen a coroner.

318
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,360
Hello.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,870
Who are you?

320
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,240
I'm a servant from Rumeng House.

321
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,630
Rumeng House?

322
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,960
Didn't they take all the people

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,910
from Rumeng House
away for interrogation?

324
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,670
Maybe I'm the one

325
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,200
that got away.

326
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
What are you doing?

327
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,150
I really don't know anything.

328
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,030
I'm just

329
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,870
the note taker.

330
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,240
I want to ask you about someone.

331
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,960
Who's it?

332
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,510
The most outstanding coroner
from East Office,

333
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,600
Lin Xiyao.

334
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,390
Why are you asking about her?

335
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,200
Such a big case came up

336
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
and she didn't even show up?

337
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,750
My foot.

338
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,030
As soon as she heard there was a body,

339
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,390
she ran faster than anyone else.

340
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,270
And she didn't wait for me.

341
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
She left four hours ago.

342
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,750
But who knows

343
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,600
she hasn't arrived yet?

344
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,360
Four hours?

345
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,390
How long does it take to get from

346
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,240
East Office to Rumeng House?

347
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,360
An hour at most.

348
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,440
Could something have happened to her?

349
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,600
Is someone trying

350
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,320
to stop Lin Xiyao
from working on the case

351
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,600
so they're putting her in trouble?

352
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,630
When can I finish

353
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,320
all my work?

354
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,120
I can't eat well,

355
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,550
and I have nightmares every night.

356
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,750
Besides, Miss Lin

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,030
has no sense of direction,

358
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,680
but she left me behind.

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,110
Why did she have to
rush here on her own?

360
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,480
She has no sense of direction?

361
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,160
I remember now.

362
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I made her

363
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,510
someone who has no sense of direction

364
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,550
at the time

365
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,110
to make the character more interesting.

366
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,070
It seems she's not being put in trouble,

367
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,200
but

368
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,790
she's lost.

369
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,640
I feel

370
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
the aura of the female lead.

371
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,790
Yao!

372
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,070
Are you Yao?

373
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,590
Yao.

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Who are you?

375
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,480
I...

376
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,590
I'm a friend of the crown prince.

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,000
You probably never met me.

378
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's go.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,400
Let's go home and have a drink.

380
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,160
Hurry up.

381
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,030
Come on.

382
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,000
Miss Qing is a man?

383
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,960
No,

384
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,240
she's a woman.

385
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,310
I'm glad you're here.

386
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
From now on,

387
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,750
let's work together.

388
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,590
Are you Miss Qing?

389
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,920
You know about me?

390
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,240
Well, that makes things easier.

391
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,110
I'm going to the dance room.

392
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm coming with you.

393
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,310
How come it's you again?

394
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,680
Could you be involved in this case?

395
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Last night, you snuck
into Lady Wuxue's room

396
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,000
and she died there.

397
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,880
Do you think it's a coincidence?

398
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,750
It's you, Handsome.

399
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,030
You were there last night, too,
weren't you?

400
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,000
Could you be involved in this case, too?

401
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,270
How ridiculous.

402
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,640
That's right.

403
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
What do we have to do with this case?

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,790
Handsome,

405
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,240
since we're destined to meet again,

406
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,640
may I ask what your name is?

407
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,590
Let go of His Highness.

408
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,880
His Highness?

409
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Let go.

410
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,830
I'm so nervous about meeting you,

411
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,680
my hands are sweating again.

412
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,960
(I remember Ji Chu is a germaphobe)

413
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,030
(and hates to be touched.)

414
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,750
(You're always scaring me.)

415
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,110
(I'll disgust you this time.)

416
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,920
There are three princes in Liang.

417
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,350
The crown prince is of noble character,

418
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,000
Prince Qi is naive and innocent,

419
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,520
and Prince Lv is as handsome as ever.

420
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,000
Handsome,

421
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
you're so good-looking.

422
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,880
You must be the well-known

423
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,750
Prince Lv.

424
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,550
Of course.

425
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,590
My master...

426
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,480
Let's go.

427
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,240
Yes.

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,960
Wait, Your Highness!

429
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,000
My name is Qing.

430
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,310
Color-wise,

431
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,640
green and cyan have a strong affinity.

432
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,070
Your Highness!

433
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm not scared at all.

434
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,750
I'm sure I can overcome
my fear of Ji Chu.

435
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,680
Your Highness,

436
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,920
are we going to

437
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,200
let her off the hook just like that?

438
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,310
She'll be coming.

439
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,510
I'm a little worried.

440
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,960
What are you worried about?

441
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Her name is Qing

442
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
and she suddenly appeared
by the crown prince's side,

443
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,200
I can't find out where she's from.

444
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,480
She might be

445
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,640
the missing Hua Qingge.

446
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,030
If she tells

447
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,160
those two in the palace

448
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,790
that you're after her,

449
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm afraid they'll turn against you.

450
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
I killed Hua Qingge

451
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,550
to break the peace

452
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,960
of marriage tie

453
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,110
between Liang and Fuyu.

454
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
But ever since Hua Qingge disappeared,

455
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,350
everyone has been turning a blind eye

456
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,590
to her disappearance.

457
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,440
What does that mean?

458
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,240
It means that those two in the palace

459
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,400
not only won't blame you,

460
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,440
but will spare no effort

461
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,960
to hide this matter

462
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,000
in order to maintain

463
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,830
the relationship between Liang and Fuyu.

464
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,790
That's right.

465
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
Hua Qingge is

466
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,070
one of their pawns,

467
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,270
and a discarded one.

468
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,310
Well,

469
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,070
shall we expose Hua Qingge?

470
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,960
She wants to save Ji Yun,

471
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,920
so let her investigate.

472
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,160
We can kill two birds with one stone.

473
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,960
Yes.

474
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,680
It's a piece of cake

475
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,790
for Ji Chu to kill me.

476
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,030
It all depends on his mood.

477
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,200
I have to help

478
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,160
Lin Xiyao to save Ji Yun quickly

479
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,070
so we can form

480
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,070
Good Men Live A Safe Life Union.

481
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,200
We must unite

482
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,640
against Ji Chu.

483
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,920
Miss Lin,

484
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,000
you're finally here.

485
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,590
Prince Qi does not allow male coroners

486
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,640
to examine Lady Wuxue's body

487
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,550
and you're the only female coroner

488
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,440
in East Office

489
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,200
so we're all waiting for you.

490
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,030
Miss Lin.

491
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,200
Miss Lin,

492
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,750
you must be lost again.

493
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm sorry.

494
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm in a hurry.

495
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm in a hurry.

496
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,240
Why did you come out alone?

497
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,160
If you'd waited for me

498
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,960
to finish that biscuit

499
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,000
and come with you,

500
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,070
you wouldn't have been lost

501
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,070
for so long.

502
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,440
Stop!

503
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,590
I'm Miss Lin's friend.

504
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,480
I came with her.

505
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,590
Miss Lin,

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,680
do you know this person?

507
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,680
Yao,

508
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,880
I can help.

509
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,830
Please give me a chance.

510
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,880
I don't know her.

511
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,750
You...

512
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,790
Yao, believe me!

513
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm sure we'll

514
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,960
be good friends!

515
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,830
You're not from East Office.

516
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,070
How did you come in?

517
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,920
Yes.

518
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,030
Greetings, Your Highness.

519
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,270
I'd like to take a look inside.

520
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,400
Your Highness, please.

521
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,440
Your Highness, please take me with you.

522
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,310
Please...

523
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,310
I'm Prince Lv's friend.

524
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,880
You just said

525
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,030
you're Miss Lin's friend.

526
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,680
And now, you said

527
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,640
you're Prince Lv's friend.

528
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
You have a death wish, don't you?

529
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,510
Yes, I have

530
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,880
a death wish.

531
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,590
Let's fight.

532
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,240
Let's fight.

533
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,350
Come on.

534
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,790
I...

535
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,640
How dare you?

536
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,030
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,310
It's all that brat's fault!

538
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,880
I never thought you'd save me.

539
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
If I didn't save you,

540
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,310
what would you do?

541
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,920
No...

542
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,550
Nothing.

543
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,240
Were you going to push me out

544
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,160
to protect you from the stabbing?

545
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,200
Of course not.

546
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,310
I think you're smart and cool,

547
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,270
and you may give me,
the beauty, a chance

548
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,750
to be saved by a heroic man.

549
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,200
Do you want me to

550
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,550
give myself to you?

551
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,310
I have my own principles.

552
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,440
A man should know his place.

553
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,440
What does it mean?

554
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,640
I am indeed smart and cool,

555
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,030
but

556
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,960
you are not considered a beauty.

557
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,640
I'm so angry,

558
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,240
but I don't dare to speak out.

559
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,960
Just don't speak out, then.

560
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

561
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,270
I'm Chang Xun,

562
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,310
the command of the guards
from East Office.

563
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,590
By order of Prince Qi,

564
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,310
I'm here to guard Lady Wuxue's body.

565
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,920
Your Highness, this way, please.

566
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
This is the dance room

567
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,960
where Lady Wuxue's body

568
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,640
was first found.

569
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,480
