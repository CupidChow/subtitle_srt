16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Come closer

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,480
and let me have a look.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,310
Quick.

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,190

20

Sir, please spare me.

21

Sir, please spare me.

22
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,430
I'm sorry I bumped into you.

23
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,520

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,240
No.

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,870
I can't die yet.

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,360
Alright.

27

According to the mark left by Qing,

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,750
she should have entered here.

so you'll live a long life.

52
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,190

What's wrong with your pulse rate?

61
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,070

Of course not.

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,600
Good.

193
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,750
Stick to the plan.

194
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,320
Yes, Your Highness.

195
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,630
This is the Wei family's weaponry.

196
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,000
Is it possible that this weapon camp

197
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,510
belongs to the Wei family?

198
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,510
The iron is of very poor quality.
It's an inferior weapon.

199
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,030
If all of Liang's soldiers

200
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,270
use such inferior weapons

201
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,630
to fight,

202
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,790
there will be a lot of

203
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,150
innocent casualties.

204
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Such greed can't be tolerated.

205
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Your Highness,

206
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
Aren't the weapons of the Liang army

207
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,670
always

208
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,200
supplied by the government?

209
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,670
Why would there be a private production?

210
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,150
It's all about profit.

211
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,440
They're making inferior weapons

212
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,000
to replace official ones.

213
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,750
The profits are huge.

214
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,960
Every year, large sums of military funds

215
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,080
go into

216
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
their own pockets.

217
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,790
Ordinary people can't do it,

218
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,840
but with the Wei family's power,

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,270
it's possible.

220
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,960
Who are you? What are you doing here?

221
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,150
Sirs,

222
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,510
we accidentally

223
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,960
got wet carrying water,

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,030
so we're drying our clothes by the fire.

225
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,360
I hope you can make it easier for us.

226
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,480
Don't you know

227
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
we're not allowed to enter

228
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,960
the foundry at night?

229
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,440
Sirs, here's the thing.

230
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,630
We're new.

231
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,390
We don't know a lot of the rules yet.

232
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,200
Please forgive us.

233
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,870
If that's the case,

234
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,960
you two are coming with me

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,910
to the supervisor's office
to receive your punishment.

236
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,510
Come on.

237
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,200
Let's go.

238
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,750
Yes.

239
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,910
I can't believe it's you.

240
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,150
Chu sent you to rescue me, right?

241
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,870
Silly boy,

242
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
can I say

243
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
it's all the work of your third brother?

244
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,630
Fine.

245
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,670
Brotherly harmony is the way to go.

246
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,790
Yes.

247
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,790
Prince Lv sent me here.

248
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,600
He always speaks with forked tongue.

249
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,910
You know that.

250
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,030
I know.

251
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,390
It's all my fault.

252
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,150
In the past, as an elder brother,

253
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,080
I didn't treat him well

254
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,270
and I let him suffer.

255
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,870
I've learned a lot

256
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,200
from my ordeal this time.

257
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,320
Congratulations,

258
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
you've finally matured.

259
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,640
Has Chu surrounded this place

260
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,310
with his men?

261
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,680
Let's send a signal

262
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,880
to level this place

263
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,880
and arrest

264
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,070
these crooks.

265
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,680
Arrest them all.

266
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,880
Your Highness,

267
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
you're really overthinking this time.

268
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,830
Now...

269
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,790
Now,

270
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,310
I'm the only one who got in.

271
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,550
How are we going to get out of here?

272
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,200
I don't want

273
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,750
to be here a moment longer.

274
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,550
Don't worry.

275
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,110
I've got a plan.

276
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,550
I've been asking around.

277
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,440
They take these

278
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,070
swill buckets out every day at 1 AM.

279
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,240
If we hide in two of them,

280
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,960
we'll make it out.

281
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,110
You want me to go into the swill bucket?

282
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,880
No.

283
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,550
It's a disgrace.

284
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,110
So you mean you're

285
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
not leaving?

286
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,000
Where have

287
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,680
you two been?

288
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,270
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

289
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,270
Chen,

290
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
are they your men?

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,240
Yes, they're new.

292
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,310
They're slow in their work.

293
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,790
Come with me.

294
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
There's still a lot of work.

295
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Alright, get back to your work.

296
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,350
You'll be punished severely
the next time

297
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,270
you wander around.

298
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,030
All right.

299
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,590
Let's go.

300
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,750
No way.

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,070
I can't stand it.

302
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,480
If this goes on,

303
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,200
we'll be caught for sure.

304
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,110
Wait.

305
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,200
Wait a minute.

306
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,960
I'll help you out.

307
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,070
How?

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,270
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

309
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,790
But we staying alive
is all that matters.

310
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,550
You two,

311
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,030
go to the back kitchen of the restaurant

312
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,000
and pull a few buckets of swill.

313
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,440
Those laborers

314
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,270
will have to

315
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,200
live on that swill tomorrow.

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,310
Yes, we'll get going now.

317
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,590
It's the crown prince.

318
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,830
That's great.

319
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,200
Thank God for that.

320
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,240
My plan is perfect now.

321
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,070
Your Highness,

322
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,510
we've been looking
into this for so long,

323
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,240
we're just going to give up now?

324
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,830
Let's find a place

325
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
to dump the swill wagon.

326
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
Come on, get on the wagon first.

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,480
There seems to be
someone in the bucket.

328
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,880
We should be out of the camp soon.

329
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,070
Victory is in sight.

330
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
There are people in the buckets.

331
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,550
It's you.

332
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,680
No.

333
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,880
Save your strength

334
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
and come back for us.

335
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,590
Don't move.

336
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,960
You'll never see the light of day

337
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,790
working for the Wei family,

338
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,000
let alone achieve great things.

339
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,310
The Wei family has lost its power.

340
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,920
A wise man submits circumstances.

341
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,110
If you want to live,

342
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,440
Prince Lv will spare your lives.

343
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
If you want to die,

344
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,350
I'll fulfill your wish.

345
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,070
I failed to save you,

346
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,310
and I've put my own life

347
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,960
on the line.

348
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,350
Why am I so unfortunate?

349
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
How dare you say that?

350
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
You have a lot of nerve, huh?

351
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
How dare you attack me?

352
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,920
If it wasn't for saving you,

353
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,110
I wouldn't be here

354
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,680
suffering for nothing.

355
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,030
Now,

356
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,480
I can't even use my escape skills.

357
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,990
[Wanshou Hall]

358
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,030
Duke,

359
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,350
why did you enter Xuanze Hall

360
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,110
when you weren't summoned?

361
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,310
Your Majesty,

362
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,000
I've found out
the whereabouts of Prince Qi.

363
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,830
Where's Prince Qi?

364
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,440
Your Majesty,

365
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,920
Prince Qi is currently imprisoned

366
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,830
in Wei Zhao's secret camp.

367
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,590
Wei Zhao is Feng's uncle.

368
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Why would he imprison Feng?

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Your Majesty,

370
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,400
Wei Zhao is holding Prince Qi hostage

371
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,590
with the intention of rebelling.

372
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,310
Audacious!

373
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
Your Majesty, please calm down.

374
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,880
I have solid evidence that Wei Zhao

375
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,400
is making private weapons
and training his own soldiers.

376
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
The crown prince is now investigating

377
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,200
in the Wei family's weapons camp.

378
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,200
The crown prince is there too?

379
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,830
Your Majesty, please make a decision
as soon as possible

380
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,960
to save two princes from danger.

381
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,480
Your Highness,

382
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,960
all of the spies

383
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,880
sent by the Wei family

384
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,200
have been taken under control.

385
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,200
Duke has also

386
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,590
gained His Majesty's trust.

387
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,070
Your Highness,

388
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,200
shall we immediately conduct a siege?

389
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,920
Be patient.

390
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,440
Let's wait for a little longer.

391
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,680
How much longer do we have to wait?

392
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,160
Till the terrified man

393
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,480
struggles.

394
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,440
What did you say?

395
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,310
The teams of spies

396
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,030
we sent out have all gone missing?

397
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,310
How reckless!

398
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,440
You're too reckless.

399
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,200
Why are you here?

400
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,160
Sister,

401
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,590
have you ever thought
about the consequences

402
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,350
of deploying men behind my back?

403
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,160
I couldn't care less!

404
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,310
I must find Feng

405
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,040
immediately!

406
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,790
You...

407
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,200
Feng's disappearance is strange,

408
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,200
and now, all our spies

409
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,160
have disappeared.

410
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,030
We must have

411
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,440
fallen into a trap.

412
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,270
Well,

413
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,640
what should we do now?

414
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,440
I've given orders

415
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,550
to make sure

416
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,200
no one enters or leaves the camp.

417
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,030
Sister,

418
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,160
don't act rashly again.

419
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,590
I'm going back to the camp

420
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
to erase all traces.

421
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,350
You... You mean...

422
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,440
Destroy all evidence

423
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
and leave no witness alive.

424
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,440
I have one more thing to report.

425
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,590
The crown prince and Miss Lin

426
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,550
have found evidence

427
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,270
of the Wei family's

428
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,030
illicit weaponry at the weapons camp.

429
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,830
The crown prince is really

430
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,440
swift at what he does.

431
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,880
Besides,

432
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,110
in order to save Prince Qi,

433
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,510
Miss Qing's captured as well.

434
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,510
Qing?

435
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,920
Why is she involved in this?

436
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,790
Wherever there's trouble,

437
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,960
there she is.

438
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,550
That's good, too.

439
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
From now on,

440
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,680
no one

441
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,270
will be able to spoil our plans.

442
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,640
Order Duke to lead the troops
to surround the camp.

443
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,910
I'll go first.

444
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,830
Ji Chu,

445
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
you should know

446
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,310
that if you take action in advance,

447
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,790
we may not be able
to get rid of the Wei family.

448
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,070
Are you going to disregard

449
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,270
our revenge plan for a woman?

450
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,310
Qing is my woman.

451
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,070
No one can hurt her.

452
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,480
Calm down.

453
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
Is it worth

454
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,030
destroying our years of planning

455
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,550
for a woman?

456
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,110
You know Qing is my wife.

457
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,790
So what?

458
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,510
She was supposed to die!

459
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,310
Say no more.

460
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,070
I know what I'm doing.

461
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Ji Chu!

462
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,830
Gongge.

463
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,680
Chu,

464
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,200
for her,

465
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,030
you hurt me

466
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,680
regardless of our brotherhood.

467
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,510
A bit higher.

468
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
A little bit higher.

469
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,790
Will you hurry up?

470
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,830
If I hadn't hurt my foot,

471
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,830
I wouldn't need you.

472
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,200
It's such a huge disgrace.

473
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,440
I've

474
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,790
never been stepped on.

475
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,590
Cut the crap.

476
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,830
Give me the red beans.

477
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,880
Red beans.

478
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
Everyone is equal before death.

479
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,550
We need to find a way
to get out of here.

480
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,590
Oh, no.

481
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,200
My foot's really broken this time.

482
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,550
Are you okay?

483
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,270
I'm still alive.

484
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,270
Who are you?

485
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,070
This is a restricted area.

486
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
You can't enter.

487
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm from the kitchen

488
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,960
to deliver preserved fruit
to Manager Wang.

489
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,160
Leave the preserved fruit here.

490
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
You can go now.

491
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,510
It's good. Let's have one more.

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,830
Miss Lin,

493
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,960
why do you

494
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,350
carry laxatives around?

495
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,480
It's required for my job.

496
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,350
I've got a few more drugs here

497
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,750
in case we need them.

498
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,550
Even though the preserved fruit
was coated with laxatives,

499
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,310
how could you be sure

500
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,480
they'd eat it?

501
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
I wasn't sure.

502
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,350
Seeing how hard they work,

503
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,400
so I just gave it a shot.
