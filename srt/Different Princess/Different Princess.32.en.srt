[Episode 32]

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,840
Ji Chu.

15
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,350
His Majesty has offered
such favorable terms.

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,200
Why are you still unwilling?

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,230
If Her Highness is not dead,

18
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,870
when Ji Yun ascends to the throne,

19
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,680
he will sooner or later rescue her.

20
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,280
By that time,

21
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,430
she'll still engage in doing evil deeds.

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Your Highness.

25
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,590
How dare Ji Chu

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
plot against me.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,400
He made me expose myself
in front of everyone.

28
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,430
Your Highness.

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,470
What should we do now?

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,910
With Yun by my side,

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm not afraid.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,880
Your Highness, are you awake?

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,310
How is Mother?

34
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,240
Mother

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,080
was put under house arrest by Father.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,360
No.

37
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,310
I must go see Mother.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,240
Your Highness.

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Highness.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,240
The physician said
you need to rest for a few days.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Don't worry, Your Highness.

42
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,240
Mother will surely be fine.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
Have I hurt you?

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
You didn't hurt me.

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Even if you were affected
by Demon Poison,

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,910
you haven't completely lost your sanity.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Demon Poison?

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,430
How could they be so wicked?

49
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,910
Is this

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,750
getting a dose of my own medicine?

51
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,470
You didn't do it,

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,360
so you won't be getting a dose of it.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,630
Mother's actions

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,630
are all because of me.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,030
I would

56
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,310
rather have Chu kill me today.

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,000
I failed to persuade Mother

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,750
and couldn't protect Wan'er.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,950
Your Highness.

60
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,800
I have discovered

61
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,240
something suspicious
about today's event.

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,240
What's suspicious?

63
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,630
Based on my past experience,

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,310
it doesn't seem like

65
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,800
a corpse that has been dead
for only three days.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
Moreover, the peach-shaped scar

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
on the sole of the foot

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,160
looks like it was just inflicted.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I heard

70
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,240
that the scar

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
is from Wan'er's childhood.

72
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,040
What you heard is correct.

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Wan'er was

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,600
only five years old.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Mother accidentally injured Wan'er

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,000
while burning incense.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,390
So it seems

78
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,870
that might not be Wan'er's corpse.

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,830
It is Chu.

80
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,920
Perhaps Prince Lv

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,430
wanted to give Wan'er freedom,

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,630
not wanting her
to marry Prime Minister Li.

83
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,040
Keep this matter under wraps.

84
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,190
Do not spread a word.

85
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,750
After efforts for more than a decade,

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,120
now that the great revenge
has been achieved,

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,600
why there is no slightest sense
of satisfaction?

88
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,800
Who is invading Yinyue Residence?

89
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,830
Wan'er.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,390
Are you still alive?

91
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,240
Wan'er.

92
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,240
Wan'er.

93
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,270
How did you manage to escape?

94
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,920
That day,

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,270
the wedding procession

96
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,560
arrived in a forest.

97
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,870
Your Highness.

98
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,000
There were bandits.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,190
What?

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,920
Your Highness, be careful.

101
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't hurt Her Highness.

102
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,240
Ru Jiao.

103
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,510
Ru Jiao.

104
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,510
Who sent you?

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Your Highness.

106
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,390
We were sent by Prince Lv

107
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,070
to rescue you.

108
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,040
Rescue?

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,310
How to rescue me?

110
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
This is a corpse we obtained,

111
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,190
similar in stature and age

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
to you.

113
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,270
Please get changed, Your Highness.

114
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,830
I have made up my mind

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,750
to marry into Nanjing

116
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,310
and not look back.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
His Highness expected your decision

118
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
and asked me to convey a message to you.

119
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,070
His Highness said

120
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,560
that if given another chance at rebirth,

121
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,270
would you choose to live freely

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,950
or become a caged bird?

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
What about Ru Jiao?

124
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,430
What about Ru Jiao?

125
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,870
Your Highness, don't worry.

126
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
She is safe and sound.

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Prince Lv instructed us

128
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,190
to send a maid

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,190
known to Emperor and Empress

130
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,390
back to report the news.

131
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,870
Don't forget to burn a peach-shaped mark

132
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,750
on the sole of the corpse's foot.

133
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,390
Yes.

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,630
So

135
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,150
I followed their procession

136
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,630
back to Liang.

137
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,390

138
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,840

to leave me the other day.

167
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,240

I once lost you,

177
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240

that nothing

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,360
Okay.

193
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,840
Since you have made up your mind,

194
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,670
I will support you

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
no matter what.

196
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Nanjing is temporarily stable now.

197
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Prime Minister Li is also
on his last legs.

198
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,960
In a few days,

199
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,360
we can send you and Pumpkin back.

200
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,630
To prevent Father from
harboring suspicions

201
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,870
and stirring up trouble.

202
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,870
Okay.

203
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,480
After returning,

204
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,030
I will lend you my support.

205
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,200
After you return,

206
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,510
swiftly eliminate any remnants,

207
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,080
manage the official affairs,

208
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
and don't worry too much about me.

209
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,320
But you are in great danger.

210
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,150
Your Highness.

211
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,480
Everything is ready.

212
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,840
Xiao Yan.

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Send this Fish-shaped Token

214
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,270
to Nanjing discreetly.

215
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,000
Quickly deploy troops in Nanjing.

216
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,120
Gather at the border.

217
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,390
Wait for orders.

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,790
I'll carry out the orders.

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,750
Hold on.

220
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,670
With the Fish-shaped Token,

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,510
you can only mobilize
half of the forces.

222
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,150
Only a member of the royal family

223
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,750
can command the entire force.

224
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
You can announce Chu

225
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
as the First Princess's Prince Consort

226
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,120
to gather the troops.

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,870
This...

228
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,840
Not necessary.

229
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
Why?

230
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
It's not like I'm asking you
to actually marry me.

231
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,870
It's just

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,080
a false title.

233
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,510
No need for a false title either.

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,240
Half of the troops will be sufficient.

235
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,600
Do you realize

236
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,910
what you're doing?

237
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,030
This is

238
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,200
nothing short of taking a risk.

239
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,600
If the forces are insufficient,

240
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,320
how will you contend
with the Dingguo Army?

241
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,600
What are you up to, Ji Chu?

242
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,000
Qing.

243
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Because of you,
Ji Yun was publicly demonized,

244
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,000
and Empress
was put under house arrest.

245
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Isn't that enough

246
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
to quench your hatred?

247
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
I didn't mean to...

248
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,870
Don't try to argue your way out of this.

249
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,600
I heard everything just now.

250
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,750
Why is it that no matter how hard I try,

251
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,390
you still choose the path

252
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,910
of rising in revolt?

253
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,910
Even if I spare them,

254
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,910
will they spare me?

255
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,270
I must take control of the driving seat

256
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,870
to gain the upper hand.

257
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,200
Qing.

258
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,840
Chu.

259
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,600
You should calm down.

260
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,000
Both of you

261
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
are in a temper right now.

262
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,240
It's easy to say

263
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,240
things that would hurt each other.

264
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,150
Your Highness.

265
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,120
Do I still need to mobilize the troops?

266
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,750
Yes.

267
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,330
I've tried so hard,

268
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,960
but I can't change this ending.

269
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,670
Anyway, I'm leaving soon.

270
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,910
I can't do much anymore.

271
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,390
Qing.

272
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,000
Chu must need a swim
that is held up by the chin.

273
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,360
So you can understand his predicament.

274
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,960
I can't, right?

275
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,270
I didn't mean that.

276
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,910
I can see

277
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
that Chu cares deeply about you.

278
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,630
For you,

279
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,750
he said no to the title

280
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,440
of Prince Consort.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
He'd rather risk being outnumbered.

282
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,240
Isn't that enough?

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,720
So if someone killed Pumpkin

284
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,240
and claimed their love for you,
would you believe it?

285
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,240
I...

286
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,510
Do not criticize others' actions

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,240
without experiencing

288
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,320
their hardships.

289
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,480
Put away your hypocritical facade.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,270
You are simply unreasonable.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,870
Why would Chu fall for someone

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,150
as radical as you?

293
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,240
Right.

294
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,030
Chu should only like

295
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,670
a high

296
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,390
and noble princess like you, right?

297
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,960
I have never

298
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,670
forced anything upon Chu.

299
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,170
Don't talk so self-righteous.

300
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,200
Do you dare to say
that this time coming to Liang,

301
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,750
you didn't have the intention

302
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
of making Ji Chu the Prince Consort

303
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,630
and taking him back with you?

304
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,480
I did have that idea at first.

305
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
However, after seeing

306
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
Chu's feelings for you,

307
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,510
I gave up on it.

308
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,550
Such a fool.

309
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,240
Emotionally,

310
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,750
you've liked him for so many years.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Politically,

312
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,840
he can help you.

313
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,150
You've been childhood friends.

314
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,150
If I were you,

315
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,670
only a fool would give up.

316
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,240
What are you trying to say?

317
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,790
I don't want Ji Chu anymore.

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,910
I'll give you a chance.

319
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,670
Shut up.

320
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,630
You're so disrespectful
to Chu's feelings.

321
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,270
You're not worthy of him.

322
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,440
Let me be the bad person in this case.

323
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,160
I don't have much time left.

324
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
It's better to end the pain quickly.

325
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,400
Chu.

326
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,550
Are you okay?

327
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,110
This is absurd.

328
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,110
Empress has quite the audacity.

329
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,640
Father.

330
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,550
The assassin
who tried to kill me yesterday

331
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,550
and the one who killed Prince Qi

332
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,030
both belong to the mysterious
assassin organization,

333
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,400
Tiger Totem from Fuyu.

334
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,030
The criminal has confessed.

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,160
They were all
acting under Empress's orders.

336
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,310
It seems that apart
from the crown prince,

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
Empress wants to eliminate

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
all the princes of Liang.

339
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,200
I have restricted her movements,

340
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,160
yet she still shows no remorse.

341
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,030
Father, you are merciful,

342
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,750
but such a vicious woman

343
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,750
will not appreciate it.

344
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,680
Li De.

345
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes.

346
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,550
Convey my decree.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,510
All right.

348
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,480
Your Highness.

349
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,440
The guards at the door are vigilant.

350
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,680
I can't

351
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
pass the message to His Highness.

352
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,240
No problem.

353
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,000
Just wait a little longer.

354
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,400
The assassination order

355
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,920
for First Princess of Nanjing
has been issued.

356
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,590
I don't know if it was successful.

357
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,310
If it succeeded,

358
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,440
Ji Chu

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
would break off support from Nanjing

360
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,000
and won't be able to contend with Yun.

361
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,510
The decree has arrived.

362
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,960
Your Highness.

363
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,030
Your Highness, please slow down.

364
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,920
Your Highness, slow down.

365
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,750
Li De.

366
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,310
I have been wrongly accused.

367
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,000
I want to see His Majesty.

368
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,030
Your Highness.

369
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,790
Take the decree.

370
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,200
Your Highness.

371
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,070
It's God's blessing
and Emperor's command

372
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,110
that Empress Hua
has committed grave misconduct,

373
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,790
causing chaos in the imperial harem
and harming the princes.

374
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,480
Considering that Hua

375
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,680
has accompanied me for over 20 years,

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
I pardon her from death.

377
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,110
Although the death penalty is spared,
but not the punishment.

378
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,070
Hua is deposed from
the position of Empress.

379
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,110
She will be confined
to the sleeping chamber for life,

380
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,550
forbidden to step outside.

381
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,400
That's all from Emperor.

382
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,440
Your Highness.

383
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,920
Hua.

384
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,400
Accept the decree.

385
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Your Highness.

386
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,510
It's impossible.

387
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,240
This can't be.

388
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,350
His Majesty wouldn't treat me like this.

389
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,750
I must see His Majesty.

390
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,200
Right.

391
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,110
His Majesty also has another edict.

392
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,350
He asked me to convey it to you.

393
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,880
Imperial Consort Xian
is a woman of virtue and integrity.

394
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,830
Posthumously titled
Imperial Concubine Tai Ming.

395
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,440
It is also granted that after 100 years,

396
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,790
she may rest with me
in the Imperial Tomb.

397
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,440
This is absolutely impossible.

398
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,110
You...

399
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,830
As long as I am alive,

400
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
Imperial Consort Xian will never
be allowed to enter the Imperial Tomb.

401
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,160
Your Highness, calm down.

402
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,440
Your Highness, please calm down.

403
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,350
The decree has been delivered.

404
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,350
Let's part ways here.

405
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
Your Highness.

406
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,680
Calm down.

407
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,000
Pin Yan.

408
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm here.

409
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,440
His Majesty...

410
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,030
He doesn't want me anymore.

411
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,790
He doesn't want me anymore.

412
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,750
Your Highness.

413
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,310
I will always

414
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,920
be by your side.

415
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,790
Your Highness.

416
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,440
Your Highness.

417
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,440
Imperial Consort Xian.

418
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,350
I can

419
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,790
finally

420
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,270
see you openly.

421
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,920
No more pretending

422
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
to Empress.

423
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,310
Finally.

424
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,480
All of this is over.

425
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,960
Chu is smart, alert,

426
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,000
and courageous.

427
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
He has the innate qualities
of an Emperor.

428
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,350
His Majesty.

429
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,550
The eldest prince

430
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,550
is the indisputable candidate
for the East Palace.

431
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,000
My beloved.

432
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,070
Do you not want Chu

433
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,240
to ascend to the throne in the future?

434
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,350
The position everyone vies for,

435
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,240
but they don't realize
how lonely it is at the top.

436
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,240
I see

437
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,960
all your hardships.

438
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,350
I don't want Chu to be bound by

439
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
the obligations of the land after this.

440
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,790
I only wish

441
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,240
that he could live

442
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,960
his entire life peacefully and happily.

443
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,240
You still understand me the most.

444
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,310
It's also you

445
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,240
who is the most insightful.

446
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,270
Your Majesty.

447
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,200
Can you promise me?

448
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,790
All right.

449
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,200
I promise you.

450
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,310
I've done

451
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,480
what I promised you.

452
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,510
Chu.

453
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,030
Don't be mad at me anymore, okay?

454
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,310
Being angry is bad for your health.

455
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,310
How about I prescribe you

456
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,640
some more doses of tonic?

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,510
Go away.

458
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,030
If you promise not to get angry with me,
I'll leave.

459
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,240
Do you feel like

460
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,350
I haven't been hurt deeply?

461
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,240
Don't even mention it.

462
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
The other day, we exchanged a few moves.

463
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,110
My body

464
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,110
feels as agile as scratching an itch.

465
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,000
How about you?

466
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,590
You didn't suffer any internal injuries,
did you?

467
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,640
Otherwise,

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
you wouldn't have failed
to dodge an assassination.

469
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,790
Just did it on purpose.

470
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,680
Saving a damsel in distress?

471
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,070
Pretending to be in distress?

472
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,590
Just kidding.

473
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,240
But Chu.

474
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,110
Thanks for bringing Wan'er

475
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
back to me.

476
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,440
Be good to her.

477
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,350
Of course.

478
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,830
Wan'er.

479
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,110
Is Wan'er still alive?

480
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,030
Qing.

481
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,480
Let's go, take me to her.

482
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,270
Qing.

483
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,350
Now is not the time yet.

484
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,270
No.

485
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,550
Qing.

486
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,680
Chu didn't hide it from you on purpose.

487
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
He didn't want you to know

488
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,310
because he thought

489
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,310
the fewer people who knew about this,

490
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,510
the safer it would be.

491
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,030
So it seems like you

492
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,510
consider me a potential liability.

493
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,240
Never make, always break.

494
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
What's going on

495
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,110
with the two of you?

496
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,750
Nothing's going on.

497
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,830
What's going on with you and Wan'er?

498
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,350
I came this time

499
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
specifically to bring you

500
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,040
our wedding invitation.

501
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
Wedding invitation?

502
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,480
Have you given up on revenge?

503
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,590
Have you finally let go?

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,510
I've figured it out.

505
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
For Wan'er,

506
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,510
I can let go of anything.

507
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,510
However, I don't want her

508
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,830
to know about this matter.

509
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,110
I just want her

510
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,590
to live a happy and carefree life.

511
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,550
It's a pity that some people
can't move on.

512
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,110
Gongye Qi.

513
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Leave your wedding

514
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,160
to me.

515
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,000
I promise to make it

516
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,640
unforgettable for a lifetime.

517
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,350
Today is the day

518
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,750
Gongye Qi and Ji Wan'er get married.

519
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,110
Gongye Qi.

520
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,350
Do you take Ji Wan'er to be your wife?

521
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,440
For richer, for poorer,

522
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,160
in sickness and in health,

523
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
to love her

524
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,160
and to honor her

525
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,880
until death do you part?

526
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
I do.

527
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,200
Ji Wan'er.

528
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,790
Do you take

529
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,750
Gongye Qi to be your husband?

530
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,790
For better,

531
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,160
for worse, in sickness and in health,

532
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,240
to share a married life with him?

533
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,510
I do.

534
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:18,790
Great.

535
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,310
I now pronounce

536
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,960
Gongye Qi and Ji Wan'er

537
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,920
as man and wife.

538
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,550
Wan'er.

539
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,350
I once had

540
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,920
a very dark period in my life.

541
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,960
I thought I would live in darkness

542
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,960
without any expectations

543
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,640
for the rest of my life.

544
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,920
Until you appeared

545
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,240
and pulled me out of

546
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,590
the never-ending darkness.

547
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,550
You let me see hope again

548
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,590
in life.

549
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,510
From that moment on,

550
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,790
I knew what I wanted.

551
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,270
Wan'er.

552
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,510
I want to give you

553
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,070
the best of everything in this world.

554
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,110
From now on,

555
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,400
let me take care of you.

556
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,750
Okay?

557
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,070
Okay.

558
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,640
From now on...

559
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,200
From now on, be honest with me.

560
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,550
Don't leave me again.

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,350
