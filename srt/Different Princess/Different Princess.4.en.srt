00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,920
Your Highness,

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,680
we've received news from Rumeng House.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
The female coroner has examined

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,640
Lady Wuxue's corpse.

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,520
How did it go?

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,750
Can she prove that the crown prince

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
is the murderer?

23
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,870
About that,

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,310
I don't believe so.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,800
You fool!

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
How could you not solve this case
when it was that easy?

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
However, according to
the current conclusion,

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Lady Wuxue died by inhaling
the smoke of charcoal.

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,840
We still don't know

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
who did it

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
and why they did it.

32
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,560
Go and investigate the case, then!

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Investigate the case?

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,190
But this case concerns the crown prince.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,280
You have to lead the case.

36

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
You want me to lead the case?

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,840
Do you think I know what to do?

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,430
You just need to monitor the scene.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,360
Monitor the scene?

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,150
Doesn't that mean

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,400
I'll see Lady Wuxue's corpse?

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,400

Lady Wuxue's corpse

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,630
looked just like when she was alive.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,150
They said she looked very beautiful.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,560
It's still a corpse, no?

49

and I can't sleep at night?

51
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,750
Yes.

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,800
This is too troublesome.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,080
The room beside us
is Lady Wuxue's lounge.

There's a pot of burning charcoal
in the room.

55

And, the door and windows
are sealed with cotton.

According to my deduction,

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,630

Lady Wuxue's body to the dance room

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,270
Lady Wuxue joined Rumeng House
when she was 15.

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,830
If you go lenient on her today,

87

pester you in the future.

Naturally, physicians do good deeds.

178

However, they can also kill
without leaving a trace.

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
Your imagination is pretty wild, huh?

180
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,120
Kill without leaving a trace?

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,870
That's a great idea.

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,960

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,910
Are you Gongye Qi?

187
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,960
You're right.

188
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,200
Miss Qing?

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Miss Qing?

190
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,030
How is she?

191
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,960
She's troubled,

192
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,630
and she worries too much.

193
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,630
She shows signs of fatigue too.

194
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
That's why she fainted.

195
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,600
Miss Lin, you don't need to worry.

196
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,750
She has a great constitution.

197
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,320
She just needs to rest

198
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
and recuperate for a few days.

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,120
What is this?

200
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,320
Gongge,

201
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,240
I'm here to ask you

202
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
about these medicinal dregs.

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,670
This is...

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,910
You found it?

205
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,940
[Ji Wan'er, Princess of Liang,
Owner of Jingzhi Library]

206
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,270
So, this herb is known as Yinbing.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
It can preserve one's beauty

208
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,480
and delay the aging of skin.

209
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,240
That sounds

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,550
too good to be true.

211
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
If it does exist, all women in the world

212
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,750
won't need to fear aging again.

213
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,220
[Yinbing]

214
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,630
Naturally, it's not true.

215
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,790
According to the records,

216
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,390
this herb is extremely rare.

217
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,870
It only grows on damp wild mountains

218
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,600
in Nanjing.

219
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,150
Its nature is extremely cold.

220
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
And, it's mildly poisonous.

221
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,150
Although it can delay aging,

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,630
if one consumes it for a long time,

223
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
cold qi will gather in the body.

224
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,440
Once enough time has passed,

225
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,790
it may kill the consumer.

226
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,440
I knew it.

227
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,600
That sounded too good to be true.

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,200
You're right.

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,030
Aging and dying are the norm.

230
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,550
I don't know why

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,630
Big Brother

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,480
wants me to research this herb
out of the blue.

233
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,630
His Highness

234
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,240
always does things for a reason.

235
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,480
I think this might be related

236
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,270
to Lady Wuxue's case.

237
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,240
Second Brother is handling the case.

238
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,790
I'm not worried about it at all.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Indeed.

240
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,030
Your Highness,

241
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,320
are you not returning
to the palace tonight?

242
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,870
You'll be reprimanded again

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,270
if Her Majesty finds out.

244
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,150
Big Brother was placed
under house arrest.

245
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,320
I have

246
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
to back him up.

247
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,910
I have to investigate the case
and clear his name.

248
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,360
So what

249
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,120
if I'm reprimanded?

250
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,750
You were pretending to be unconscious?

251
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,440
No.

252
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,750
At first, I did fall unconscious.

253
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,360
After that, I regained consciousness.

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,240
Miss Lin,

255
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,670
have you discovered any leads

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,480
related to Lady Wuxue's case

257
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,270
after meeting Gongye Qi?

258
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,750
According to what Gongge had said,

259
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,960
purple spots will only appear
on a woman's body

260
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
if she consumes Yinbing soup
for over a decade.

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240
And, there were purple spots

262
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
on Lady Wuxue's body.

263
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
(That means)

264
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,320
(she already consumed Yinbing soup
for many years.)

265
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,000
(That made me perplexed.)

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,200
Lady Wuxue is 23 this year.

267
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,670
She was only 13

268
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,150
a decade ago.

269
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,030
She was in the prime of her youth.

270
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,870
Why would she take Yinbing soup

271
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,390
to preserve her beauty?

272
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,150
That's a curious question indeed.

273
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,030
(How should I explain)

274
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,030
(Xue's actual age to her?)

275
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Besides,

276
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,390
(when I examined Lady Wuxue,)

277
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,200
(I saw crow's feet.)

278
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
She's only 23,

279
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,480
and she consumes the anti-aging

280
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,240
Yinbing soup often too.

281
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,670
How could she develop crow's feet?

282
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah.

283
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,360
What exactly is going on?

284
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,150
I was thinking

285
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,320
that the victim

286
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,080
might not be Lady Wuxue at all.

287
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,240
Miss Lin,

288
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,480
I know thinking is good,

289
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,790
but we mustn't overthink things.

290
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,670
Am I overthinking things?

291
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,550
There are many secrets

292
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,030
that the victim is hiding indeed.

293
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,360
However, the victim is Lady Wuxue.

294
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,390
Right now, we have

295
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,080
to investigate the cause of her death,

296
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,630
not her identity.

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,000
But every

298
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,150
minor lead

299
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,750
might lead to the truth

300
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,790
behind the case.

301
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,480
Right now, the crown prince
is our suspect.

302
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,480
We have to clear his name first.

303
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,080
Don't you

304
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
think so?

305
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,240
If so,

306
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,750
where do you think we should start?

307
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,080
I think we neglected

308
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
a key figure.

309
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,030
Who is it?

310
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,150
You see,

311
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,510
this morning,

312
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,630
when I was leaving from
Melodious Serenity Abode,

313
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,910
(I saw Nuo.)

314
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,270
(She was rushing to leave.)

315
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,750
(I thought something was off.)

316
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,630
(And, Nuo was the one who accused
the crown prince for being the murderer.)

317
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,360
There's a murderer!

318
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,360
His Highness killed Xue!

319
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,910
Now that I think about it,

320
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,150
I think she's hiding

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,240
some unspeakable secrets.

322
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,240
(Nuo went missing)

323
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,920
after Lady Wuxue was found dead.

324
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,110
Manager Chang is looking for her.

325
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,750
Therefore, we have to
locate her before him.

326
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,830
Miss Qing,

327
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,350
you look sure and determined.

328
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,030
Could it be

329
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,350
that you know where Miss Nuo is?

330
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,680
Nuo?

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,310
Nuo!

332
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,070
(Why is Nuo nowhere to be found?)

333
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,480
(According to my novel,)

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,070
(she's hiding)

335
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,830
(in this ruined temple.)

336
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,640
The charcoal is still warm.

337
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,640
That means it was put out not long ago.

338
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,920
Seems like someone was here before this.

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
Maybe

340
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,070
she went somewhere else.

341
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,620
[Prince Lv Residence]

342
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,680
Miss Qing,

343
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,240
do you suspect

344
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,270
that Nuo is inside
the Prince Lv Residence?

345
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,110
Ji Chu

346
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,110
is the only person

347
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,790
who'll go against me.

348
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,750
Your Highness.

349
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,440
I've brought her here.

350
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,550
Who are you?

351
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,790
Who are you?

352
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,590
What are you trying to do?

353
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,790
Miss Lin, you have to be sneaky

354
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,310
when you're sneaking a peek.

355
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,680
Why are you sneaking a peak?

356
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,960
I remember you said you served Prince Lv

357
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
when we were in Rumeng House.

358
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,480
Could it be that you couldn't tell

359
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,400
why I said

360
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,110
I was serving

361
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,830
Prince Lv?

362
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,070
Why?

363
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,750
Don't tell me you're trying
to frame Prince Lv

364
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,070
for the dirty deeds you did?

365
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,400
[East Office]
If I must say,

366
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,000
I think the crown prince killed
Lady Wuxue out of love.

367
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,960
This is truly unexpected.

368
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,000
That means they have
an unusual relationship.

369
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,640
What's the relationship

370
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
between the crown prince
and Lady Wuxue, then?

371
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,550
I'm sure they're related somehow.

372
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,000
If not, why would
the crown prince be there

373
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,480
[Lady Wuxue, what is love?]
when Lady Wuxue was found dead?

374
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:48,960
Precisely.

375
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,160
Come!

376
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,550
This is the latest news.

377
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,270
It's utterly shocking.

378
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,550
Do you guys know what this is?

379
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,880
What is it?

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
It's the love poem that Prince Lv

381
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
had written for Lady Wuxue.

382
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,000
Love poem?

383
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,400
Why would you have the love poem

384
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,350
that was written by Prince Lv?

385
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:03,880
Precisely.

386
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,270
Yeah.

387
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Why would you have it with you?

388
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,400
You must be spouting nonsense.

389
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,480
The arrogant

390
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,830
Prince Lv

391
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,270
actually fancies Lady Wuxue?

392
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,640
Prince Lv actually fancies Lady Wuxue?

393
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,510
We have to be united.

394
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,240
I have no idea.

395
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,550
We must announce Prince Lv's devotion

396
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,750
to the world.

397
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,440
We must make the entire capital

398
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,160
shed tears

399
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
from his devotion.

400
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,550
Prince Lv actually fancies Lady Wuxue?

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,200
If so, what's the relationship between
the crown prince, Lady Wuxue,

402
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
and Prince Lv?

403
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,270
Are the brothers love rivals?

404
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Of course not.

405
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Prince Lv has a crush on Lady Wuxue.

406
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,310
There's nothing

407
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,480
between Lady Wuxue

408
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,270
and the crown prince.

409
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,000
Why should we believe you?

410
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,960
You don't believe me?

411
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,440
Do you know who I am?

412
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,480
Do you know who's behind me?

413
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,310
Who are you?

414
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,920
Who is it?

415
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,590
Who are you?

416
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,350
Yeah.

417
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,070
Who are you?

418
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,790
It's of course Prince Lv.

419
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,200
Prince Lv?

420
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
You think we'll believe you?

421
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
Prince Lv is my master.

422
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,440
This is inside information.

423
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
She serves Prince Lv?

424
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
If so, I think she's speaking the truth.

425
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,440
I think she's a liar.

426
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,400
She serves Prince Lv, you know?

427
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,070
I'll make a good master.

428
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Miss Lin, this is great.

429
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,550
You brought a friend with you

430
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,830
today.

431
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,350
Please enjoy your meal.

432
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,480
Now, we've managed

433
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,000
to shift the people's attention
on the crown prince

434
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
to Ji Chu.

435
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,720
But how should we

436
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,000
find Nuo?

437
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,790
Let's eat first.

438
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,480
Miss Lin.

439
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,160
I knew you would be here.

440
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,510
Secretary Du?

441
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
Madam,

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,350
give me a huge bowl of wontons.

443
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,240
All right.

444
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,750
Please wait a moment.

445
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,270
Were you looking for me?

446
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,480
Miss Lin,

447
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,350
you have to buy me a meal.

448
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,070
But why?

449
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,550
You guys are looking for Nuo, right?

450
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,510
How did you know?

451
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,830
It's my treat.

452
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,000
(This morning,)

453
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,790
(someone saw Nuo)

454
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
(fainting on the street)

455
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,440
(near the East Office.)

456
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,310
Help!

457
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,750
Someone fainted!

458
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,550
Miss!

459
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,550
Miss!

460
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Miss! What's wrong?

461
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,110
(She was sent)

462
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,830
(to the East Office.)

463
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,000
Right now, she's in prison.

464
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,070
She actually returned
to the East Office?

465
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,680
Let's go and check it out.

466
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,960
Madam,

467
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,240
I'll foot the bill
for the three bowls of wonton.

468
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,590
Put the rest on my tab.

469
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,400
I'll come back next time.

470
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay.

471
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,160
How did it go?

472
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,510
What did Miss Nuo say?

473
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,750
Miss Nuo confessed

474
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,270
that Lady Wuxue took her own life

475
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,110
in an attempt to preserve her beauty.

476
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,480
It has nothing to do with His Highness.

477
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,680
If so, did you ask her

478
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,590
if she saw Ji Chu?

479
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,880
I did.

480
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
Miss Nuo said

481
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,310
she never met Prince Lv.

482
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,960
If so, how did she leave

483
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,030
the ruined temple?

484
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,270
And, where did she go
after she left the place?

485
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,790
She said

486
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,510
she was still worried about Lady Wuxue.

487
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,680
Therefore, she decided
to go and see her.

488
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,440
But she fainted out of exhaustion

489
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,200
on her way there.

490
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,790
When she woke up,

491
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,790
she realized that she was
already at the East Office.

492
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,030
All right, then.

493
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,750
I heard from them

494
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,350
Prince Qi issued an order.

495
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,790
They'll proceed with

496
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,880
the trial of Lady Wuxue's case tomorrow

497
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
after tonight's interrogation.

498
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,240
That soon?

499
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
This concerns the crown prince.

500
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,790
And, Lady Wuxue is the best dancer

501
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,790
in the capital.

502
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,310
The longer they drag this out,

503
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,480
the more gossip it'll produce.

504
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,270
We should solve the case
as soon as possible.

505
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,510
If so, did she say

506
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,070
whether or not she was willing
to clear the crown prince's name

507
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,310
on the court?

508
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,350
[East Office]
Come and look! There's a trial.

509
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,680
I wonder what's going on in there.

510
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,550
We'll know when we ask someone

511
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,510
from the court.

512
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,310
Summon the crown prince!

513
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,750
Chu? What are you doing here?

514
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,270
I was just passing by.

515
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,240
Chu,

516
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,000
that's Ji Yun's seat.

517
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,030
The crown prince is a suspect today.

518
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,640
Do you expect him to be seated
during a trial?

519
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,790
Prince Lv, you have a point.

520
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Status and identities don't matter

521
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,790
on the court.

522
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,790
Only justice and truth matter.

523
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,240
(This guy is really arrogant.)

524
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,680
(He irks me to no end.)

525
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,680
(How can I)

526
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,350
(get rid of him?)

527
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,070
(My goodness.)

528
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,590
(That devil is truly terrifying.)

529
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,070
Your Highness,

530
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,480
we just received news

531
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,790
that Prince Lv has gone
to the East Office too.

532
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,510
That Ji Chu,

533
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,200
what exactly is he up to?

534
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,400
He's been acting mysteriously

535
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,640
ever since his return from Nanjing.

536
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,160
Feng is leading the trial today.

537
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,830
How dare he cause trouble for him?

538
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
Your Highness,

539
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,960
Prince Lv has gone to the East Office.

540
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,920
These four children

541
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,270
have always played together since young.

542
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,240
I never expected them to be reunited

543
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,480
at the court instead.

544
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,790
Yes, Your Majesty.
I was lamenting about the same thing.

545
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
Where is His Majesty?

546
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,920
His Majesty is at Xuanze Hall.

547
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Let's go and take a look.

548
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,700
[Xuanze Hall]

549
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,550
Your Majesty.

550
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,400
Prince Lv has gone to the East Office.

551
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,640
Bring me a piece of paper and a brush.

552
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,920
I will issue an edict.

553
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

554
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,440
Ji Yun,

555
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,550
did you murder Lady Wuxue?

556
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,960
No, I didn't.

557
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
If so, why were you beside her
when she was found dead?

558
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,880
I have no idea either.

559
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
I woke up there

560
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,550
