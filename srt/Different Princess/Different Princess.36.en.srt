And now,

130
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,750
you've taken action against Father.

131
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,870
In your heart,

It's me.

my wish is?

150

Is your wish not for

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,080
the stability of the country

152

and peaceful times?

153
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
When Wan'er was young,

154
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,670
she often capriciously
escaped from the palace.

155
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,670
She said she liked the world
outside the palace.

156

159
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,030
As her brother,

160
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,240
I am truly happy for her.

161

Regardless of how you want
to settle things today,

She is my mother.

181

Since you are so stubborn,

182
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,670
I will kill you first

183
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,000
and then deal with Hua Yunni.

184

Who are you?

185
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,960
Don't worry.

186
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,270
I've been instructed

187

not to kill you.

188
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
You, as the incompetent ruler,

189
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,270
were also one of those who harmed
the Su family back then.

His Majesty.

194
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,550
I don't want my wife

195
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,240
to be without her father in the future.

196
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,150
Give him this.

197
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,150
He will wake up in two days.

198
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,480
Take him away.

199
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,790
Gongge.

200
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,360
Where are you going?

201
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,750
Go where the crowds are.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
It's you?

203
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,790
For the sake of Wan'er,

204
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
everyone advised me not to kill you.

205
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,030
I also thought about

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
letting it go.

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,150
But deep-seated grievances

208
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
are difficult to resolve.

209
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,360
Wan'er.

210
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
Wan'er.

211
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,030
Wan'er.

212
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,480
Wan'er.

213
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,360
Go away.

214
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Wan'er. Why?

215
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
Wan'er.

216
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,670
Darling.

217
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,510
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,840
I lied to you.

219
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,600
Wan'er.

220
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,480
But I can't leave

221
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,750
my mother alone.

222
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,750
Wan'er.

223
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,360
You will be fine.

224
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,960
We still have many

225
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,320
beautiful things to do.

226
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,840
We have

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
a lifetime ahead of us.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,150
I won't let you die.

229
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,790
I am a divine physician.

230
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,630
I won't let you die.

231
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,480
Wan'er.

232
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,480
Darling.

233
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,350
Returning this to its rightful owner.

234
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
What is this?

235
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,400
Darling.

236
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,920
The first time I saw you,

237
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,030
I felt

238
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,590
a sense of curiosity about you.

239
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,240
I could feel
that deep within your heart,

240
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,880
under the layers of pain,

241
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,510
you long for freedom
and the good things in life.

242
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,550
These...

243
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
These are also what I long for.

244
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,240
Darling.

245
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,550
Promise me.

246
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,200
Let go of hatred and

247
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,550
be an unrestrained person.

248
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
All...

249
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,790
All right?

250
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
All right.

251
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,110
I promise you, Wan'er.

252
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,750
Let's do this together.

253
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,350
Our child is still young.

254
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,160
I'll go be with him.

255
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,750
Wan'er.

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
No, Wan'er.

257
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Mother.

258
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,480
Wan'er.

259
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Wan'er.

260
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,830
Mother.

261
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,640
I can't go on anymore.

262
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,960
I beg you to spare Yun.

263
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Wan'er.

264
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,480
Darling.

265
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm here.

266
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,830
I...

267
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,440
I hate to part with you.

268
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
I...

269
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,790
I'm tired.

270
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,960
I want to sleep...

271
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,000
To sleep... just for a while.

272
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,160
Don't sleep.

273
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,000
Wan'er.

274
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,960
Wan'er.

275
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,830
Wan'er.

276
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,510
Wan'er.

277
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,510
Your Majesty.

278
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,590
Your Majesty.

279
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,070
Wan'er.

280
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Wan'er.

281
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,830
Wan'er.

282
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,510
Qing.

283
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
How did you end up here?

284
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,030
What happened to Wan'er?

285
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,270
Where is she going?

286
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,640
Why do you have so much blood on you?

287
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,310
She...

288
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,920
Where is Mo Yu?

289
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,350
She is bleeding.

290
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,750
Chu, be careful.

291
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,480
Prince Lv.

292
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
I advise you not to act recklessly.

293
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,830
Otherwise, this dagger of mine

294
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
might make your Princess Consort's

295
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,240
blood splatter here.

296
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,510
Ji Chu.

297
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,030
Everything today

298
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,480
is caused by you.

299
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,440
If you want Hua Qingge to live,

300
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,640
you'll have to use your own life.

301
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,200
An eye for an eye.

302
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,750
Aunt.

303
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,960
Let's talk things out peacefully.

304
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,510
Mother.

305
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,310
She is your niece.

306
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,590
So what if she's my niece?

307
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,030
She's still opposing me just like you.

308
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,510
If you hadn't

309
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,680
let Ji Chu in,

310
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,310
Wan'er wouldn't have died.

311
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,830
Died?

312
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Mother.

313
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,680
Do you really not know

314
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,110
why Wan'er died?

315
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,830
Your Highness.

316
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,920
Show mercy with your blade.

317
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,270
Hua Yunni.

318
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
You want me dead, don't you?

319
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,880
This has nothing to do with Qing.

320
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,960
Please don't harm her.

321
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,640
Okay.

322
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,270
As long as you take your own life today,

323
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,350
I will immediately release Qing.

324
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,400
Ji Chu, don't listen to her.

325
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,440
Okay.

326
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,750
Ji Yun.

327
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,480
After I die,

328
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,400
you must protect Qing well.

329
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,270
Chu.

330
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,750
Ji Chu, don't be foolish.

331
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,880
I'll go back soon.

332
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
I won't die.

333
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,680

right?

334
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,590

336
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,200
