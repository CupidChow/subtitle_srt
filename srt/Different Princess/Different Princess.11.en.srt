Long time no see.

16

Wait,

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,360
I think I smell an aroma.

18
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,190
It's a kind of rare herb

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,190
called Butterfly Jiegeng.

20
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,080
What is it, Your Highness?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
It's not a long time no see.

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
We just met yesterday.

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,560
Did we?

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,190
Now that you've used

Butterfly Jiegeng,

26
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,360
you must have taken
the antidote beforehand.

Why is your memory worse than mine?

It seems that you have already noticed.

Your scent

of bitterness and freshness.

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't you want to ask me

40
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,120
why I erased your memory?

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,870

Your Highness,,

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,870
I heard that Miss Liu last night,

194
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,790
Had an accident at the East Office.

195
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
This East Office

196
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,440
is a real place of trouble.

197
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,790
Prince Qi's wife-to-be, Liu Xiang,

198
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,840
was murdered last night

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
at the East Office's jail.

200
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
They created an illusion of evil.

201
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,000
This is ridiculous.

202
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,510
I order you and Prince Lv,

203
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,630
to investigate this case together.

204
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,600
We must find out the truth
as soon as possible.

205
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,120
Noted.

206
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,270
Go on.

207
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,390
I'll leave now.

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Actually you don't believe

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
that it's Feng
sent people to kill Liu Xiang.

212
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
Why did you submit that report?

213
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,150
It's Ji Feng or Imperial Consort Wei,

214
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,120
does it make a difference?

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,790
wish we could go back

221

to the way we were
when we were children.

222
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,390
Even if we can't

223
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,480
at least I hope

you and us

Prince Lv has spoken
out of turn many times.

232
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,600
Why do you have to be so tolerant?

233
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,670
After all, it was us who

234
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,750
abandoned him.

to be with Wan'er.

241
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,750
But what I saw just now

242
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,120
was too beautiful.

243
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,910
I can't bear to separate them.

244

Don't think so much.

Your Highness, you've done talking.

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,840
Chu is back,

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,000
they are in discussion,

253
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,630
so I came to find you.

254
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,360
So, tell me.

255
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,200
Tell what?

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,440
Why do you like

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,670
Is it that obvious?

259
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,390
I think he's special.

260
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,840
What's so special about him?

261
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
Being ruthless?

262
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,550
Or being wicked?

263
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
In my eyes,

264
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,840
he carries sunshine, flowers,

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,150
the bitter scent of medicine,

267
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
and a desire to be free.

268
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,390
All of that made him special.

269
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,960
He's unlike anyone else

270
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,960
I've ever met.

271
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,600
But different doesn't always mean good.

272
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,840
I know
he was in the Grand Hall yesterday.

273
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,120
I think

274
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,910
that Miss Liu's demonisation

275
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,790
has something to do with Chu and him.

276
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,150
But I don't want to give up so easily.

277
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,200
Whether it's Chu or him.

278
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
What if

but he has never hurt me.

284
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,390
I don't think he will either.

Can you do me a favour?

289
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,600
What kind of favour?

290
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,390
As long as you don't hurt anyone else,

291
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,440
I'll try to help you.

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
I want to leave Prince Lv Residence.

293

I can't help you

294

on this.

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,870
There's something wrong with the snack.

You're right.

297

Inside the snack,

298
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
there's indeed a drug

299
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
that can suppress the demonic poison.

300
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,120
This is the antidote.

301
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,790
It can make the poison
in Liu Xiang's body

302
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,960
re-emerge.

303
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Alright.

304
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,240
What's the situation in the palace?

305
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,320
For Liu Xiang's case,

306
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,390
His Majesty has brought
in the crown prince.

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,120
It seems this is the result

308
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,840
of testing His Majesty.

309
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,440
His Majesty wants to use him

310
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,390
to ease our relationship

311
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,240
with the Wei family.

312
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,440
This is delusional.

313
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,670
Now that we've confirmed Qing

314
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,670
is indeed Hua Qingge,

315
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,000
why are you still keeping her?

316
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,270
Because she looks

317
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,440
like Hua Qingge,

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
but also not at the same time.

319
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
Just because she knows

320
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,200
what you're thinking,

321
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,270
you're keeping

322
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,240
such a dangerous person with you.

323
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,320
I keep her around,

324
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,840
on the one hand, to find out

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,390
her true identity.

326
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,000
On the other hand,

327
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Ji Yun
seems to be treating her differently.

328
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,080
Keeping her in hand,

329
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,910
it's the same

330
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,600
as grabbing Ji Yun's weak spot.

331
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,480
Chu,

332
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,750
I hope you believe in

333
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,080
what you're saying.

334
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,840
Of course, I do.

335
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,200
If that's the case,

336
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,790
I have nothing more to say.

337
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,910
But you need to know that

338
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
on the road to revenge,

339
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,240
any leniency

340
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,910
will result

341
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,360
in immeasurable consequences.

342
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,200
Goodbye.

343
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,160
What about you?

344
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
I don't want you to hurt Wan'er.

345
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,480
Then keep your sister under control.

346
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,960
Keep her away from me.

347
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,550
Qing,

348
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,680
you made such a scene

349
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,480
at the banquet,

350
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,440
that even Mother testified for you,

351
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,750
If you leave suddenly,

352
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,350
what circumstance are you
placing the others in?

353
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,110
I know.

354
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,440
Running away just like that

355
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,590
is a bit ungrateful.

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,510
But I'm a small-timer,

357
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,110
whether I leave here

358
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,160
or die here,

359
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,920
no one really cares.

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,160
You are now

362
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,750
You're also Liang's Princess Consort Lv.

363
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
But you know

364
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,030
I'm not at all

365
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,480
the princess of Fuyu, Hua Qingge.

366
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,110
If this got exposed,

367
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,200
Ji Chu is a man of honor,

368
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,750
he'll be fine.

369
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,920
But my life would be in danger.

370
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,550
Your Highness,

371
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,440
I just want to live.

372
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,790
I'll have to discuss

373
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,160
this with Chu.

374
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,270
No, you can't tell Ji Chu.

375
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,590
If you tell him

376
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,030
I'll die.

377
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,030
Why are you so afraid of Chu?

378
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,350
No one in this world is

379
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,750
not afraid of him.

380
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,920
How about this?

381
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,240
I can put you

382
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,680
in the Jingzhi Library,

383
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
but I have a condition.

384
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,240
It is

385
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,680
if there's a palace banquet

386
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,750
or an occasion that requires

387
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,750
the presence of Princess Consort Lv.

388
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,790
You must attend

389
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,680
as that identity.

390
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,510
I promise you.

391
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,680
But, Qing,

392
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,200
we can't hide this from Chu.

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
I know.

394
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
But Your Highness,

395
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
since you've decided to help me,

396
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,270
are we

397
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,270
good friends now?

398
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,350
Of course.

399
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,440
From now on,

400
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
can I call you Wan'er?

401
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,200
Of course not.

402
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
Her Highness is honorable,

403
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,480
her name is not to be blasphemed.

404
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,550
Of course, she can.

405
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,750
It's just a name,

406
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,350
I have always been indifferent to these.

407
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,400
Wan'er.

408
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,270
As long as you're firm and have my back,

409
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,640
I'm sure Ji Chu won't dare to

410
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,510
do anything to me.

411
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,510
After all, in my novel,

412
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,240
Ji Chu's only love

413
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,590
is his sister.

414
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,310
Actually,

415
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,920
Even if you stay in Prince Lv Residence,

416
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,310
I can still

417
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,750
protect you.

418
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,440
But I still have to go.

419
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,110
You want to leave Prince Lv Residence?

420
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,510
You just said you'd take care of me,

421
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,070
why are you so scared now?

422
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,790
Where are you going?

423
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,960
Your Highness.

424
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm not the real

425
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
Princess Consort Lv.

426
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
I've been a servant girl for so long.

427
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
You must be tired of it.

428
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,400
Why don't you just kick me

429
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,590
out of the Residence?

430
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,030
Are you going to find Ji Yun?

431
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,750
Sort of.

432
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,270
My future is for sure

433
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,110
bound to Ji Yun and Lin Xiyao

434
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,240
because I need to protect them both.

435
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,830
So,

436
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
you approached me,

437
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,680
and the things you did

438
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,270
are all to help Ji Yun?

439
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes.

440
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,960
I thought you already knew that.

441
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
I've always stood by Ji Yun.

442
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,240
Why?

443
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,550
Do I still need to explain?

444
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,640
Who would want to stay

445
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,270
with a cold and perverted

446
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,240
murderer

447
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,480
who has no boundaries.

448
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,510
This is human,

449
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,110
we all want to avoid harm.

450
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,400
Before you question others,

451
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,350
don't you ask yourself

452
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,920
what have you done?

453
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,400
So,

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,590
in your heart,

455
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,030
Ji Yun is a kind

456
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,440
and warm existence.

457
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,880
For sure.

458
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,030
He's everyone's dream guy.

459
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,160
And yours too?

460
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,350
Of course,

461
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,030
am I not human?

462
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,590
Anyway, since we've talked about it.

463
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,830
I can't stay
in Prince Lv Residence anymore.

464
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,830
You can kill me if you want.

465
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,240
Chu.

466
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,110
Although I don't know why you

467
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
fought with Qing like that,

468
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,790
I think you've misunderstood.

469
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,310
Misunderstood what?

470
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
She wants to leave
the Prince Lv Residence,

471
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
not because she wants to find Ji Yun,

472
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,680
is because she wants to go
to Jingzhi Library.

473
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,920
I'll go and settle down first.

474
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,200
Is she telling the truth?

475
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,510
Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,510
Do you want me to follow her?

477
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,790
No need if she's going

478
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,200
to Jingzhi Library.

479
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,400
Okay.

480
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,630
[Jingzhi Library]

481
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,030
Hold it.

482
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,510
Okay.

483
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
Please come again next time.

484
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,680
Let me know when you have new books.

485
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,440
Sure.

486
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,350
Take care.

487
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,680
Master, you're back.

488
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,920
Your brother has been here

489
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,750
waiting for a long time.

490
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,350
Ji Yun?

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,550
Ji Yun.

492
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,960
Your Highness.

493
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,510
Why are you here?

494
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,960
Mother complained to me today,

495
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,640
that Her Highness has been

496
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,880
running around a lot.

497
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,270
She was worried.

498
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,750
So she asked me to come and take a look.

499
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,680
Yun, let's talk inside.

500
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,310
What's going on?

501
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,920
There's nothing wrong
with the blood color,

502
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,830
and there's no toxicity.

503
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,640
Why has it turned blue now?

504
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,400
I can't tell what kind of poison it is.

505
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,310
It's better to go
to the Mystic Medicine House,

506
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,480
and ask Gongge.

507
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,270
What?

508
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,110
Are you investigating
the Liu Xiang case too?

509
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,790
Right.

510
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,200
Liu Xiang is the future
Princess Consort Qi.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,350
She can't die in vain.

512
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
That's why Father asked me to help Chu,

513
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
to investigate together.

514
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,240
How is it in vain?

515
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,240
It's clearly Ji Chu who did it.

516
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,590
Qing,

517
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,750
how do you know

518
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,160
it's Chu?

519
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,200
Just think of it as my intuition.

520
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,680
In this case,

521
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,830
I think

522
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,550
it's not Chu who did it.

523
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,590
What do you mean?

524
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,750
I went to the East Office

525
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,750
and found the case file of Liu Xiang.

526
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,400
There is something suspicious.

527
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,440
It's not that snack, is it?

528
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,830
Chu

529
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,590
has already sent someone
to investigate that snack.

530
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,920
It indeed has a problem.

531
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,790
Other than that,

532
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,240
what else is there to suspect?

533
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,270
The time of death

534
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,750
is suspicious too.

535
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,270
It's demonic poison.

536
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,440
After being poisoned,

537
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,550
it causes changes in the body.

538
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,110
Like a monster.

539
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,480
So there is such a drug

540
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,030
in this world.

541
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,110
I've only read about similar

542
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,550
descriptions in books.

543
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,240
I didn't think it existed.

544
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,550
But

545
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,750
why when I

546
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,550
first did the autopsy,

547
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,440
I didn't find it?

548
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
All things are mutually exclusive.

549
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,510
In this world,

550
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,750
there are poisons
that can demonize people,

551
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,960
and certainly there are drugs
that can hide them too.

552
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,270
It's easy to understand.

553
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,680
Thank you for the lesson.

554
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,960
These two guards today

555
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
are not the same as last night.

556
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,240
Where are the guards from yesterday?

557
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,480
To answer Your Highness,

558
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,960
they've changed shifts to rest.

559
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,480
Open the cell.

560
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,400
I need to check some more clues.

561
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,750
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

562
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,000
Go get Chang Xun

563
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,110
and the two guards from last night.

564
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,200
Yes.

565
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,110
Those who entered
this chamber last night,

566
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
one of them

567
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
must be the murderer.

568
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,510
Then the one who is most suspected

569
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,590
is Chang Xun,

570
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,750
who first arrived at the scene.

571
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
According to the testimony.

572
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,030
Chang Xun was the first

573
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,160
to enter the cell.

574
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,200
But it was dark inside,

575
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,400
he didn't dare to enter

576
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,310
until the two guards

577
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
arrived in time.

578
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,240
They lit the candles.

579
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,680
Then only the three of them

580
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,880
found the body

581
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,070
of Liu Xiang.

582
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,590
The testimonies of the three

583
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,880
were surprisingly consistent.

584
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,350
There are no gaps in their testimonies.

585
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,240
There's always a candle burning.

586
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,510
Why were the candles out

587
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,550
when they arrived?

588
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,030
Also,

589
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,590
who put out the candles?

590
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,350
What if Liu Xiang put it out?

591
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,480
That doesn't make sense.

592
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
Then who could have inserted

593
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,030
the Vajra Weapon accurately
into Liu Xiang's heart

594
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
in the dark?

595
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,750
Your Highness,

596
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,070
Wang Senior and Wang Junior

597
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,270
have been taken by Prince Lv.

598
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,030
Commander Chang is on leave
due to illness.

599
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,350
Alright.

600
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,200
You can leave.

601
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes, Your Highness.

602
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
What if it was Chang Xun who

603
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
blew out the candles?

604
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,030
If it was him, it doesn't seem like

605
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,510
there's enough time to commit the crime.

606
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,270
You can't tell without practice.

607
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,350
How about this?

608
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,640
Let's run through the

609
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,880
process of the case.

610
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,030
Sure.

611
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm Liu Xiang.

612
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,030
You're Chang Xun.

613
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,310
The two guards outside

614
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,240
are Wang Senior and Wang Junior.

615
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,270
Yes.

616
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,750
Stay back.

617
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,240
No.

618
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,070
Even if Chang Xun had killed

619
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,790
Liu Xiang in the dark,

620
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,310
he'd still be caught red-handed.

621
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,400
There's not enough time.

622
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,960
Right.

623
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,070
What if Chang Xun

624
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,440
killed Liu Xiang first,

625
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,350
and then put out the candles?

626
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,240
