(Ji Chu, third prince of Liang,)

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,750
(was kept at the southern border
as a hostage since young.)

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,070
(He was abandoned by
the imperial family of Liang,)

7
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,640
(causing him to suffer.)

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,400
(Thus,)

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,070
(he vowed to get revenge.)

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,480
(He overthrew the southern border
at the age of 20,)

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,350
(returning to the kingdom
with a vengeance.)

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,430
(Since then, Liang was plunged
into a bloody storm.)

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,040
(He advanced step by step,)

14
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,070
(subverted the courtiers one by one,)

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,790
(drove a wedge
between the imperial family,)

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,600
(and initiated a revolt
when his brother ascended the throne.)

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,040
(He ignored the lives of his beloved)

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,150
(and slaughtered the imperial court.)

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,280
Chu,

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,350
Xi Yao was your beloved too.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,560
How could you do this?

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,920
Sacrificing my beloved is fine

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,920
as long as I can rule the world.

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,510
I've never expected us

25
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,510
to be in this situation

26
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,150
one day.

27
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,710
Since it has come to this,

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,910
it's pointless to say anything else.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,400
Chu,

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,800
I hope you can be a wise ruler.

31
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,590
I don't need a loser

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,360

(and usurped the throne.)

40

(He changed the era's name to Xiande.)

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,680
(That was the beginning
of Liang's prosperous era)

42
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,240

44
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,920

display her self-discipline?

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
By being innovative.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,040
The villain remained evil until the end,

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
and he killed

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,120

(She's a total idiot!)

56
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,750

all the character logic.)

Your groom hasn't arrived yet.

So you cannot remove the veil.

Prince Lv is bloodthirsty
and hard to deal with.

119
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,670
You must practice caution.

126
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720

the niece of the current empress.)

(why Ji Chu committed the deed.)

148
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,440
(But under the emperor's order,)

149
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,150
(everyone acknowledged the fact)

150
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,360
(that Hua Qingge slipped
and fell to her death.)

151
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,200
(They buried her in secret.)

152
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,240
If so, that means I'll die tonight.

161
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
This won't do.

162
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,670
Ji Chu isn't an idiot.

163
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,480
He'll surely find me

164
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,390
if I hide here.

165
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
Luckily, I know some cheat codes

166
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,600
as the author of the novel.

167
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,790
I know the secret paths
Ji Chu had created

168
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,080
within the palace.

169
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,200
Wait.

170
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,270
Ji Chu is very attentive to detail.

171
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,670
He'll definitely notice

172
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,790
that someone touched
the scabbard before.

173
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,200
He'll definitely catch me
if I head to the side chamber

174
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,750
using his secret path.

175
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,720
If only I could fly

176
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,360
to the rooftop using Qinggong.

177
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,720
Wait, Hua Qingge actually
knows Qinggong?

178
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,790
What kind of godly setting is this?

179
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,440
Your Highness.

180
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,030
Ji Chu is paying attention

181
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,830
to the side chamber now.

182
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,070
If he turns around

183
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
and sees that my shoes are gone,

184
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,480
he'll definitely know
that I'm still in the residence.

185
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,310
No, I must take them off.

186
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,200
It's so cold without any shoes on!

187
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,550
Ji Chu was already deceived once

188
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,400
by the fake lead I left behind.

189
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,510
I don't think he'll believe

190
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,550
that I'm escaping with
the shoes and outfit!

191
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,270
Someone!

192
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,790
Find a woman in purple

193
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,830
whose outfit has a sword mark.

194
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,030
She's wearing a pair of red shoes too.

195
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,000
Her identity is unknown.

196
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,750
When you see her,

197
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,350
kill her on sight.

198
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,790
Yes, Your Highness!

199
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,640
Under the order of Prince Lv,

200
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,110
we are to find a woman in purple

201
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,160
who's wearing a pair of red shoes.

202
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,070
Kill her on sight.

203
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,750
Yes, sir!

204
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Why is Ji Chu

205
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,440
using such an unorthodox method?

206
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,880
According to the previous plot,

207
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,550
a trap can be uncovered
by analyzing the leads.

208
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,110
The leads I left behind are obvious.

209
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,270
Don't tell me he has no idea

210
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,350
that this is a trap?

211
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,400
Over here.

212
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,200
Over there. Let's go.

213
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,750
Let's go.

214
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,510
I can't believe that something
as good as this actually happened.

215
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,880
What do you mean?

216
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
Not only did I get to enjoy
your wedding banquet,

217
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,340
[Gongye Qi,
Owner of Mystic Medicine House]

218
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,550
but I also enjoyed a great show of

219
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,880
cat and mouse.

220
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Here, Hong.

221
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,480
Say hello

222
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,400
to Prince Lv.

223
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,880
We have to continue our investigation.

224
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,790
We finally returned to Liang
after so long.

225
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,270
This is just the start of our revenge.

226
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,750
I never expected something
to crop up this soon.

227
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,790
It seems like
she knows about our secret.

228
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,590
It's likely that she also knows

229
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,510
that you'll take her life tonight.

230
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,200
I thought it was strange too.

231
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,790
This woman

232
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,510
knows me very well.

233
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,240
Actually, I don't know

234
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,310
the villain, Ji Chu, at all.

235
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,510
Why did I have to make him so ruthless

236
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,200
when I was

237
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,510
creating his character?

238
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Your Highness,

239
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,830
everything is normal
in the side chambers.

240

241

and servant

242
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,000
and interrogate them.

243
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,350
I'm such a fool.

244
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Hua Qingge was married into Liang
not long ago.

245
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,000
Apart from the empress of Liang,

246
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,720
no one knows what she looks like.

247
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,440
Ji Chu can only

248
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
recognize and locate her

249
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,720
through the outfit she wears.

250
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,110
I just need to get changed.

251
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,270
There was no need for me to escape.

252
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,350
Your Highness?

253
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,110
Prince Lv is trying to arrest you
with his men.

254
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,480
What exactly happened?

255
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,030
Are you guys...

256
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,750

258

Arrest all of them.

They're here already?

260
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Yes, sir!

261
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,680
This place won't do.

262

Come.

What about you guys?

266
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,000
Here. You can escape first.

267
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,750
Here.

Escape from here. Hurry.

270
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,880
Leave through the window.

271

Yes, sir!

273

Why are you arresting us?

What's going on?

275
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,750
Go!

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,590
Let go of me!

277
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,400
Does Hua Qingge have any other servants

278
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,550
besides these two?

279
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Your Highness,

280

these two are her only servants.

281
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,480
There's no way she can
escape from this place alone.

282
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,790
Continue the search.

283
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,550
Yes, Your Highness.

It finally stopped raining.

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,640
Although it stopped raining,

303
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,550
Your Highness, you still look

304
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,920
restless.

305

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,920
was the wrong deed you mentioned
related to the favor I did for you?

How did you know?
