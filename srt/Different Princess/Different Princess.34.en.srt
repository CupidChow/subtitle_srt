00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,200
this is the end

195
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,150
of our affinity as husband and wife.

196
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,910
It's all my fault.

197
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
I got confused

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,320
and deserved it.

199
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,750
Yunni,

200
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,670
now that I think about it,

201
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,630
you had it

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
all planned out back then.

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,600
Tomorrow is the day
when Imperial Concubine Xian

204
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,080
will present a gift for my birthday.

205
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
I promised her

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,550
I'd be there early tonight.

207
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Imperial Concubine Xian is
the most gentle and virtuous of all,

208
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
so she'll understand

209
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,550
Your Majesty's concern
for the country and the people.

210
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
That's true.

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
Of all the concubines,

212
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,320
she understands me the best.

213
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,600
Who are you?

214
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,960
This...

215
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,750
Why is there such a demon-like presence

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,030
in the palace?

217
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,910
Your Majesty,

218
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
this...

219
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,120
The illusion of the demon fox

220
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,510
you created that night

221
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,670
made me believe in the existence

222
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,200
of the demon fox in advance.

223
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,200
The next day,

224
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,510
Imperial Consort Xian
suddenly turned into a demon,

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,480
so I mistakenly thought

226
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,870
she was really a demon.

227
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Yunni,

228
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,030
not only did you let me cause
the death of Imperial Consort Xian,

229
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
you also harmed Chu for so many years.

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,550
Your Majesty,

231
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,750
what's done is done.

232
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,750
I can't change it.

233
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,390
Tonight

234
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,510
is my

235
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,360
last meal with you.

236
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,200
All the past entanglements

237
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
are in this wine.

238
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,960
From now on, I will

239
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,360
recite sutras every day
for Imperial Consort Xian

240
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,790
and pray for the blessing of Prince Lv.

241
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,750
I don't intend to drink tonight.

242
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,390
Fine.

243
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,600
I'll drink alone.

244
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,200
Your Majesty,

245
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,320
no matter what,

246
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,790
I've been true to you

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,630
for more than

248
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,150
20 years.

249
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,150
My love for you is evident
to heaven and earth.

250
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,200
Even though I did a lot of things wrong,

251
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,480
I did them to win

252
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,440
your love for me.

253
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,630
For this third toast,

254
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,600
I hope you'll

255
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,440
give me an answer.

256
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Have you ever

257
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,200
loved me

258
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,150
in all these years?

259
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,790
Even for a moment?

260
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,550
Fine.

261
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,550
Fine.

262
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll drink the last one

263
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,400
with you.

264
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

265
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,030
Your Majesty,

266
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,030
during my time in confinement,

267
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
I have often

268
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,240
recalled the days
when I first entered the palace

269
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,510
I loved to kick the shuttlecock,

270
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,440
so you built

271
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,200
a courtyard for me

272
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,750
to kick the shuttlecock.

273
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,550
You probably didn't know

274
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,310
that it was

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
my eldest sister,

276
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,510
the eldest princess of Fuyu,
who was supposed

277
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,310
to be married to Liang.

278
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,240
But why

279
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,640
was I the one who married you?

280
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,880
It's because when

281
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
you came to Fuyu to propose marriage,

282
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,270
I was

283
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,550
playing shuttlecock in the courtyard.

284
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,510
You stood beside me

285
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,310
and complimented me

286
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,640
that I was graceful

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,880
with my moves.

288
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,440
That's when

289
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,400
you took root

290
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,880
in my heart.

291
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,310
Have you poisoned me?

292
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,880
You may not believe

293
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,270
that all I've done

294
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,880
for so many years

295
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,110
is to make you

296
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,510
like me

297
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,440
even a little bit more.

298
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,110
Hua...

299
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,920
Your Majesty, don't worry.

300
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,200
This poison

301
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,550
won't kill you,

302
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,680
but it will keep you in bed

303
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,920
without a moment's sobriety
for the rest of your life.

304
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,270
Your Majesty, don't worry.

305
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,160
I will always be with you.

306
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,070
Forever.

307
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,000
Your Highness.

308
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,440
What are you doing?

309
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,070
His Majesty...

310
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,480
What have you done to His Majesty?

311
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,590
Don't worry.

312
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,550
You'll be

313
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,000
with His Majesty soon.

314
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,480
You evil woman,

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,070
you'll die a horrible death!

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,030
His Majesty has already decided

317
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
to pass the throne to the crown prince.

318
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,160
How can you...

319
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,750
This will save me

320
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,680
some effort.

321
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,480
Clean this place up.

322
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,480
Yes.

323
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,350
Your Highness, we've found the decree.

324
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,200
Your Highness!

325
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,270
Your Highness!

326
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,550
Something bad has happened!

327
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,160
What's it? Come in and tell me.

328
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,310
Your Highness, the empress...

329
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,510
The empress...

330
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,880
What's wrong with Mother?

331
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,270
The empress...

332
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Her Highness harmed His Majesty.

333
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,510
What?

334
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
Mother still won't stop.

335
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Not only that,

336
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
the empress and Duke

337
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,270
massacred people in the palace at night.

338
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
Now, all the men inside
and outside the palace

339
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,310
have been replaced

340
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,400
by Duke's men.

341
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,000
Your Highness,

342
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,240
Her Highness has also announced

343
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
your accession to the throne
the day after tomorrow.

344
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,920
Qing,

345
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,160
in a few days,

346
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,680
our bags will be all packed,

347
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,070
and we'll be off

348
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,270
to live on the beautiful frontier.

349
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,590
It's your call.

350
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,790
Wherever the husband goes,
the wife follows.

351
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm married to a gray wolf,

352
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,270
so I'll be a good red wolf.

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
You're talking nonsense again.

354
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
Then, why did you

355
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,200
marry me?

356
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,200
That's because I've accumulated

357
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,400
a lot of good luck

358
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,680
to meet you.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,640
Qing,

360
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,240
you said

361
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,960
you'd leave when the story's over.

362
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,350
If our story

363
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,550
never ends,

364
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,110
can you

365
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,110
stay with me forever?

366
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,070
Look,

367
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,270
this is a one-kilowatt bulb.

368
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,790
Your Highness.

369
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,510
Yesterday, Hua Yunni...

370
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,070
Could it be

371
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,960
that the real finale is coming?

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,960
[Xuanze Hall]

373
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,510
Your Majesty,

374
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
you've worked so hard

375
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,160
for so many years.

376
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,550
From today on,

377
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,960
you'll stay in bed and rest.

378
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,440
Come on,

379
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,160
I'll feed you your medicine.

380
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,880
Your Highness, you can't enter.

381
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,590
Step aside.

382
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,480
You can't enter.

383
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,550
Step aside!

384
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,110
Father.

385
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,440
Father.

386
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,400
He won't wake up.

387
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,750
Yun's coronation ceremony

388
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,880
will take place tomorrow.

389
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,590
Dingguo Army is also in my hands.

390
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,790
Even if you use the Fish-shaped Token,

391
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
when the troops from
Nanjing come to Liang,

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
it won't change anything.

393
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,920
You shouldn't have hurt Father.

394
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,920
No matter if I should
or shouldn't, it's done.

395
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,400
There's nothing you can do about it.

396
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,030
So what do you want now?

397
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,030
To kill me?

398
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,590
You will be killed,

399
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,480
but not today.

400
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,070
Yun,

401
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
everything I have done...

402
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
Don't worry, Mother.

403
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
Things have come to this point,

404
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,030
and I have no way back.

405
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,640
It's a relief

406
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,790
that you understand.

407
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,750
Chu,

408
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,880
today is the last time

409
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
we'll speak as brothers.

410
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,240
From tomorrow onward,

411
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,350
I am the emperor

412
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,240
and you are the subject.

413
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,790
Ji Yun,

414
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,880
I didn't like

415
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,240
your hypocrisy in the past,

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,350
but I'm even

417
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,960
more disappointed

418
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,550
in the way

419
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,270
you're defending

420
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,750
this evil woman now.

421
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,400
You're disappointed?

422
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,830
So what?

423
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,350
In the past, I always tolerated you

424
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,270
in the hope

425
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
that we could get along.

426
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,200
But you're always pushing me

427
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,640
and trampling my goodwill underfoot.

428
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,510
Now,

429
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,510
I won't tolerate you anymore.

430
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,030
What's wrong with protecting

431
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,110
my mother?

432
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,790
Protecting your mother?

433
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,000
What about Father?

434
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,440
He's the emperor.

435
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,070
He was ready to abdicate

436
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,000
and pass the throne to you.

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,960
Why can't you wait

438
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,240
even a few days?

439
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,070
Since Father has decided to abdicate,

440
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,000
what's the problem

441
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,030
if it's a few days early?

442
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,310
Ji Yun,

443
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,070
I hope you won't regret

444
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,240
what you have done today.

445
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,590
How dare you!

446
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,310
Tell them all to back off.

447
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,310
Yun.

448
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,270
Mother,

449
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,920
tomorrow is my

450
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,920
coronation.

451
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
If it's known

452
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,240
that Prince Lv's killed
in the palace today,

453
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,270
I'm afraid there will be
some criticism of me.

454
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,790
But Ji Chu is very cunning.

455
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,790
It's hard for me

456
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,790
to use your father's illness

457
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,880
to trick him into entering the palace.

458
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,270
If we let him go back now,

459
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,550
it might leave us with a problem.

460
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,750
Now that Liang's Dingguo Army

461
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
is in your hands,

462
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,070
the troops of Nanjing

463
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,350
are out of reach.

464
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,550
Even if Ji Chu has
any tricks up his sleeve,

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,680
he's bound to fail,

466
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,590
so we have nothing to fear.

467
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,240
Pin Yan.

468
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,920
I got it.

469
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,650
[Xuanze Hall]

470
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,790
By order of the empress,

471
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,030
send Prince Lv out of the palace.

472
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,880
Yun,

473
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,110
I was afraid

474
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,480
you'd be angry with me,

475
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,830
but now you seem clear-headed,

476
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,110
I'm relieved.

477
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,830
I've lost so much,

478
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,440
and now you're all I have left.

479
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,240
Protecting you

480
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,640
is my last wish.

481
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,510
What last wish?

482
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,550
You still have to govern Liang.

483
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,310
From tomorrow onward,

484
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
you'll be a great ruler.

485
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
Everything will be fine.

486
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,680
I understand.

487
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,400
Mother,

488
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,960
I have to go and prepare

489
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,200
for tomorrow's coronation.

490
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,590
Please

491
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,240
take good care of Father.

492
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,000
Go about your business.

493
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,270
I

494
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,550
will definitely
take good care of your father.

495
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,070
Please excuse me.

496
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,240
Pin Yan.

497
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,270
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

498
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,830
Tell Duke

499
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
that the crown prince is merciful,

500
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,590
and that he mustn't hand

501
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,920
over the commander's token to him
until all is settled.

502
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,350
