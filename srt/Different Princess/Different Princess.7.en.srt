14
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,640
Your Highness,

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,310
thank you for today.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,790
Don't thank me.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,350
My eldest brother had me come.

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,120
How is His Highness doing?

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,120
He was chastised by father,

20
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,400
but all in all, still well.

21
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,920
That is good to hear.

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,870
Miss Qing,

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
who are you?

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
I...

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,240
I am just someone

ordinary called Qing.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,150
How are you related to my eldest

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
and third brother then?

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,470
I think there is a misunderstanding.

30
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,960
I am good friends with His Highness,

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,870
but not at all related to Prince Lv.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
Do you think I believe you?

33
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,960
But I...

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,960
I can only tell you this.

If you are not willing to say,

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
I won't force you to.

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,630
I've promised my brother anyway

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,280
to come visit you often.

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,430
Would you do me a favor, please?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,750
Would you help me

ask Prince Lv

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,910
if he could let me do anything else

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,870
Sure.

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,960
However,

please ask for his name on my behalf.

in the existence of ghosts,

In reply to Your Highness,

I am scattering glutinous rice
to ward off evil spirits.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,750

Your Highness is exuding evilness.

Since Wan'er has pleaded with me,

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,070
you don't have to eavesdrop anymore.

I humbly abide by your instructions.

77

It wasn't on purpose.

78
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,190
I really did not do it on purpose.

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480

95
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,950

As a man, Secretary Du

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,430
can't even move those files,

108
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,920

I want to see all those files here.

113
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,560
This is unreasonable.

114
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,950
What if I can't do it?

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
If you can't do it,

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,920
note that Ji Yun's crown prince position
might be at stake.

Do you know what you are talking about?

118

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,510
This guy is out of his mind.

120
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,240
In the novel however,

121
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,270
Ji Chu wasn't trying to do

What's going on?

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
The plot is now getting out of hand.

125
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,630
Alright,

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,830
I will make sure

128

129
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,190
I'll excuse myself.

130
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,040
Your Highness,

131
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,190
why did you bring Miss Qing

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
into the East Office?

133
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Instead of living free and easy

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
at her residence,

135
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
might as well bring her along

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
so that she knows what kind of

137
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,680
the situation she is in

138
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,630
and reveal her true identity.

139
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,560
I see.

140
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,310
But,

141
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,070
do Your Highness really

142
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,870
want to bring down the crown prince?

143
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,870
Let's first investigate this

It's impossible to move all of them.

162
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,790
What are you looking for then?

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
Key information.

164
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,840
Do you need my help?

165
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,480
No.

166
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,150
I am almost there.

167
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,150
Your Highness,

168
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,320
it is almost 5:00 PM,

169
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,270
not a single case file is here.

170
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,670
Has Miss Qing

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,320
given up on the task?

172
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,750
She might just be plotting something.

173
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,870
Found it.

174
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,030
What is this?

175
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,440
Key information.

176
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,320
Secretary Du.

177
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,150
I am here.

178
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Hand this over to Ji Chu.

179
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,870
Move quickly.

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,030
Alright.

181
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,480
Your drawings don't look like anything,

182
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,840
would that work?

183
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,790
We shall leave that to fate.

184
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,000
Your Highness,

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Miss Qing had me

186
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,600
pass this drawing to you.

187
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,320
Why is Secretary Du

188
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
so slow?

189
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,000
Secretary Du is someone

190

192
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,750
asked me instead of him.

193
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,080
You can't go.

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,360
Why?

195
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,750
Because...

196
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,870
In my novel,

197
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,870
there is a relationship development
between both of you.

198
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,440
I have to keep you safe.

199
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,360
I won't let you

200
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
come in contact with this devil and

201
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,000
suffer from it.

202
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Because

203
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,550
you are always lost.

204
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,240
From the file room

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,840
to Jinglv Hall,

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
I still know that route.

207
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,600
Those are not water droplets,

208
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,240
it's my life wasting away.

209
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,360
It is 5:00 PM soon.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
What was the bet

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,150
that you made with Prince Lv exactly?

212
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,630
There was no bet.

213
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,440
Those were just his terms.

214
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,080
Here he is.

215
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,630
It's 5:00 PM sharp.

216
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
It was before 5:00 PM

217
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,910
when Your Highness saw

218
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,080
all of the case files.

219
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,510
Because you can't move the files,

220
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
so you just have to move

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Prince Lv.

222
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,360
Exactly.

223
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,550
Would you have mercy on me?

224
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,510
I said all the case files.

225
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,030
This.

226
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,960
These are all of it.

227
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,550
These are not.

228
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,550
Your Highness,

229
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,320
these are all the case files.

230
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,870
Secretary Du spent a lot of time
looking for these files,

231
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,750
it is impossible

232
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,870
that there would be any mistakes.

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,840
Thank you for the praise, Coroner Lin.

234
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,550
I took one of the files

235
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,790
to Jinglv Hall,

236
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,360
so

237
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,480
these are not all the files.

238
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,630
You...

239
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,510
You are doing this on purpose.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,790
Maybe.

241
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
How sly of you.

242
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,790
Couldn't have seen that coming.

243
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,240
I thought you really cared

244
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
about the crown prince,

245
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,550
but

246
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,790
because of your laziness,

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
he is now in trouble.

248
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,200
If you had just done what I said,

249
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,840
bring all the files

250
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,750
to Jinglv Hall in time,

251
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,000
everything would have been fine.

252
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,750
Secretary Du,

253
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,510
please give me

254
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,030
the file that I asked for from you.

255
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,270
Come on.

256
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Your Highness,

257
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,390
Miss Qing made me.

258
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,080
I was coerced,

259
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
forced to do so.

260
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,870
I just wanted Your Highness

261
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,320
to be able to see all the files.

262
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,670
I think this is reasonable.

263
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,000
Your Highness,

264
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,360
let things go,

265
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,000
don't burn bridges.

266
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,360
I was just trying to help too,

267
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,630
right?

268
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,750
How did you know that I was

269
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,910
looking for what's written on this?

270
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Let's make a deal, should we?

271
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,240
What are your terms?

272
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,440
When we get back,

273
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
we'll talk about it.

274
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,840
[Prince Lv Residence]

275
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,960
What are you doing?

276
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,870
No, nothing.

277
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,480
I prepared some appetizers

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,030
to have a drink with Your Highness.

279
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,240
Your Highness,

280
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,390
I shamelessly begged the princess

281
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,750
to give me this wine.

282
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,270
You have to give it a taste.

283
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,030
How did you know

284
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,200
I was looking

285
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,870
for what was on that piece of paper?

286
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,910
Would you trust me if I told you?

287
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,000
You could tell me first.

288
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I can do that,

289
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,150
but not now.

290
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,510
Are you playing tricks on me?

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,440
Not at all.

292
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,320
I am just

293
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
concerned about my life.

294
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,120
Your Highness,

295
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,480
please have a taste of this wine first,

296
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,960
see if it suits your palate.

297
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
We can talk about that later.

298
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,600
Are you drinking?

299
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,790
I am.

300
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,270
I am.

301
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,840
When did you...

302
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,550
Your Highness,

303
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
is the wine poisoned?

304
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
No.

305
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,320
She was just drunk.

306
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
But

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
she only had one cup.

308
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,200
She will pass out after just one cup,

309
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,440
that explains why she swapped
the wine with water.

310
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,870
What Your Highness means is

311
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,120
Qing

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
used a convertible jug

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
and invited you to drink with her.

314
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,840
So the other half

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,320
was not poisoned wine,

316
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,510
but was instead plain water.

317
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
When did you

318
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,840
swap out my water for wine?

319
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,480
I'm so drunk,

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,790
how could I go on with our negotiations?

321
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,080
Xiao Yan,

322
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,910
all these years,

323
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,440
many have tried to kill me.

324
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,590
Numerous of them.

325
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,030
She hates me so much,

326
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,110
it makes sense that she

327
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,350
would want to kill me.

328
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,160
Why didn't she poison me?

329
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,680
Could she have foreseen

330
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,680
that her plan might not work?

331
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,480
Maybe,

332
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,590
but I am still surprised.

333
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,920
[Anxiang Hall]

334
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,110
I thought I had a nightmare.

335
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
I had too much to drink,

336
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
and Ji Chu carried me home.

337
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,880
How frightening.

338
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,030
That's not a dream.

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
Why are you intruding on a girl's room?

340
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,880
Don't you know how to knock?

341
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,920
You're awake.

342
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,550
Let's pick up from where we

343
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,480
left off yesterday.

344
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,310
How do you know

345
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
about what was written on the paper?

346
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,350
In other words,

347
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
why do you know me so well?

348
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,200
Of course I know you well.

349
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,070
I even know about your little secrets.

350
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,680
I will tell you about it,

351
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,880
but it is not time yet.

352
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,830
When will that be then?

353
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,480
In a month.

354
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,000
During this month,

355
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,680
regardless of what happens,

356
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,830
you can't kill me.

357
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,070
Else, you will never know.

358
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,920
Fine.

359
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,200
This is going too smoothly.

360
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Ji Chu became

361
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,070
so agreeable.

362
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,240
We are going to the East Office soon.

363
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
Time to get up.

364
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,270
I will.

365
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,640
Getting up now.

366
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,920
Why does Ji Chu

367
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,590
have a sudden change in attitude?

368
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,640
Could it be that he

369
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,480
found another way to torture me?

370
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,750
That will come out of nowhere.

371
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,440
Miss,

372
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,510
your brows look ominous.

373
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,550
A fatal misfortune might be coming.

374
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,510
Sir.

375
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,960
I have a question for you.

376
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,160
I would like to save myself,

377
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,270
but to do that,

378
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,160
I can only save one side

379
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,240
and hurt the other.

380
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,920
What should I do?

381
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,680
Miss,

382
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
don't panic.

383
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't worry about saving yourself too.

384
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,750
I can turn your misfortune around.

385
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,640
No, no.

386
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,070
I only have myself to rely on.

387
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,160
No one else can help me.

388
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,590
I

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,680
want to go back to where I came from,

390
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,640
but

391
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,830
I have to change the current outcome,

392
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,400

393
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,000
You would understand, right?

394
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,030
I do.

395
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,830
You're the chosen one.

396
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,830
No.

397
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,440
I made all of these happen.

398
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,200
I am responsible for the hole that
I dug for myself.

399
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,350
If I may ask,

400
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,310
who are you really?

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
I should say,

402
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,160
in this world,

403
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,350
you and I are somewhat similar.

404
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,960
We are mainly burdened by

405
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
the weight of knowledge.

406
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
If I may ask some more,

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
your plan of going against fate,

408
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
how is that coming along so far?

409
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,270
It is still in progress.

410
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,270
That person is as stubborn as a rock,

411
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,830
I don't really know where to start.

412

Sir,

413
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,310
how do I

414
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,510
talk someone into

415
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,200
letting go of their evilness

416
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,960
and work towards goodness?

417
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,750
Give up evil and turn over a new leaf?

418
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,920
Hardly achievable

419
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,880
by anyone on earth, I reckon.

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
I understand now.

421
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,030
To transform a devil into an angel

422
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,070
is close to impossible.

423
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,830
He should first learn to be human,

424
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,790

every cause has its consequence

427
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,790
and I am the consequence of your deeds.

428
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Got it.

429
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
I had a good chat with you today.

430
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,200

Bye bye.

where that silly little girl

Smells so good.

Your Highness,

443
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,270

This is my chance.

452
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,240
I should start small,

453
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,830
so that Ji Chu can feel

454
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,110
love in this world.

Your Highness,

461
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,160
I thought about it.

462
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,590
From now on, I will be

463

464
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
I don't want that.

465
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,960
There's an old saying,

466
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,310
our life is limited,

467
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,110
yet knowledge is limitless.

When you listen to stories,

469
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,640
that is

470
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,310
a way of gaining knowledge.

471
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,200
Don't be quick to say no.

I don't believe in Buddhism.

475

This does not matter.

476
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,880
What matters is

477
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,440
to have a pair of

To be honest,
