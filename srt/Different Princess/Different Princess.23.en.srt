It's done.

194
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,440
You can get everything

195
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,200
after hanging out with Gongye Qi.

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,840
So...

197
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,270
Of course.

198
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,440
As the Master of Mystic Medicine House's

199
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,790
future...

200
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,670
I have to pay attention to things.

201
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,320
This is too mushy.

202
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,480
Are you and Gongye Qi

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,550
going to make it official?

204
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,150
Will there

205
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,270
be some kind of trouble?

206
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,510
Either way, I've made up my mind.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,270
No amount of objection

208
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,240
can ever stop me from marrying

209
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,390
the love of my life.

210
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,670
I shouldn't have asked.

211
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,450
[Anxiang Hall]

212
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,360
I am dog-tired.

213
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,080
What is that smell?

214
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,030
It stinks.

215
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,120
The witch fell for it again!

216
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,910
Yay!

217
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,360
She fell for it again!

218
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,120
Little rascal! I've had enough of you!

219
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,150
Why you...

220
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,480
Do you enjoy messing with me?

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,240
Shut it!

222
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,150
You never stop yelling at me!

223
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,240
Why you...

224
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,510
Give it here!

225
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,720
Hand it over!

226
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,200
You hit me!

227
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,750
No!

228
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,790
What's going on here?

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,910
Father.

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
You're finally here to save me.

231
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,910
You started it first.

232
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,320
Miss Qing

233
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,960
won't let me call you my father.

234
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,750
She wanted to punish me for it.

235
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,320
But it's not her fault.

236
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,910
It's my fault.

237
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,200
I came uninvited.

238
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Drop the act.

239
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,600
Stop playing the victim here.

240
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,270
Pumpkin.

241
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,030
Are you hurt?

242
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,790
No.

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,390
Sorry for making you worry.

244
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Good.

245
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,960
Ask Xiao Yan to play with you.

246
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,670
I never would've thought

247
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,790
a little feigning rascal

248
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,630
would outsmart me.

249
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,870
Who would've thought?

250
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,480
The kid actually

251
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,200
gave you a hard time.

252
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,270
I'm not a stepmother.

253
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,000
If I retaliated,

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
it'd make me the evil stepmom.

255
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,200
What did you say?

256
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,200
Just admit it.

257
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,200
How many

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,960
are there?

259
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,320
I want to be ready for it.

260
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,600
You finally admit it.

261
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,440
Admit what?

262
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,550
Admit it! How many?

263
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,390
How many of them are there?

264
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,790
My illegitimate children?

265
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,630
Not a lot.

266
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,390
Around 180 of them.

267
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,120
There are 180 of them?

268
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,840
What are you? A machine?

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,910
There are 180 of them?

270
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,790
I...

271
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,200
It was a joke.

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,120
If I have a child,

273
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,840
it will be our child.

274
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,620
I...

275
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,120
I don't want a child with you.

276
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
Who is Pumpkin's mother?

277
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Your first love?

278
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,150
What is a first love?

279
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,950
The first woman you fell in love with.

280
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,420
You are the first

281
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,830
I've fallen in love with.

282
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,270
I almost fell for your lies.

283
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,960
If I were your first love,

284
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,510
did Pumpkin just appear out of thin air?

285
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,790
Are you jealous?

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,790
No way.

287
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,030
You are.

288
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,310
No.

289
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,030
Fine.

290
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,960
It makes me a bit uncomfortable.

291
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Good.

292
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,000
I like it

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,310
when you're jealous.

294
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,110
Here's a piece of advice.

295
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,830
Avoiding picking a fight with Pumpkin.

296
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,550
He got his temper from me.

297
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
You can never outsmart him.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,070
The arrogance!

299
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,000
You...

300
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,160
Your whole family are bullies!

301
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,010
[Linhua Hall]

302
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,590
As decree by His Majesty

303
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,440
the Emperor,

304
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,110
the virtuous heaven

305
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,550
has blessed you with betrothment.

306
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,160
Given that Crown Prince Ji Yun
has virtuous qualities

307
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,310
and is unmarried,

308
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,550
and that Lady Lin, daughter of the Duke,

309
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,000
is kind and gentle,

310
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,400
the two will be a good match.

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
A wedding is now in place

312
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,070
to make this union a reality,

313
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
as wished by His Majesty.

314
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,000
The end.

315
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,790
Your Highness,

316
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,750
accept the decree.

317
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,640
I accept the decree.

318
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,350
Yun.

319
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,200
You are now betrothed.

320
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,880
This is a relief.

321
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,440
Mother.

322
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,830
I have a favor to ask.

323
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll offer any help

324
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,750
you need.

325
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,790
Mother.

326
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,200
I need you to stay away

327
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,750
from the Imperial Court's affairs.

328
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,640
Yun.

329
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,550
To clean up the mess you made,

330
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,680
I forced myself to go against

331
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,200
my own will.

332
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,070
I've done many wrongful things

333
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,960
for your sake.

334
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Is this about

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,030
you marrying Lin Xiyao?

336
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,830
Or is this about Qing?

337
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,000
I could tell from the get-go

338
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,350
that your feelings for Qing

339
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,790
were unusual.

340
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
I gave birth to you myself.

341
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,960
It's only natural that I know

342
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,960
what's on your mind.

343
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,000
But let me be clear.

344
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Qing is Prince Lv's consort.

345
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,030
You may fall for anyone in this world,

346
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,830
but never fall for Qing.

347
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,030
I assure you

348
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,960
I've moved on.

349
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
I hope so.

350
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,880
It's so quiet here.

351
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
Pumpkin must be up to no good.

352
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,550
Easy-peasy.

353
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,790
As expected from an eight-year-old.

354
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,680
Old witch!

355
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,200
This is the end for you, witch!

356
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,480
Are you all right?

357
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,200
Miss Qing, I'm sorry.

358
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,680
Miss Qing, are you all right?

359
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,030
I was too careless.

360
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,200
Did I hurt you?

361
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,440
Two-faced rascal!

362
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,550
Qing.

363
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,960
Who is this boy?

364
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,310
You can call me Pumpkin.

365
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,030
Sir,

366
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
I bet you're not any ordinary guy.

367
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,590
What makes you say so?

368
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,200
You were swift

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,000
and composed.

370
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
You must be someone of great status.

371
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,920
I'm flattered.

372
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,440
Master.

373
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
I've finally found you, Master.

374
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,240
Master.

375
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
It's time to get some rest.

376
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,480
Bye, Miss Qing.

377
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,880
Bye, good sir!

378
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,160
Your Highness.

379
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,000
Are you here for me?

380
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,350
Qing.

381
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,830
How long has that boy

382
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,110
been here?

383
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,350
A few days.

384
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
The thought of him drives me insane.

385
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,680
In my world, he could've

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
won an Oscar.

387
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,200
Forget it.

388
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
It's not entirely his fault.

389
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,680
It's Ji Chu's fault.

390
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,750
Why did he have a son

391
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,830
in Nanjing?

392
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,590
Are you saying

393
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,440
Pumpkin's Ji Chu's son?

394
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,350
I heard stories

395
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,550
about how Ji Chu

396
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,350
had gone through hell in Nanjing.

397
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,240
He was at death's doorstep.

398
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,550
But I never knew he had a son.

399
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,400
Ji Chu almost died in Nanjing?

400
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,510
I didn't go into details
about his journey there

401
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,750
when I was writing.

402
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,440
What did he go through?

403
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,110
After Du Hui passed away,

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,240
did Ji Chu investigate?

405
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,680
Why not?

406
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,480
Du Hui's murderer

407
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,500
committed suicide in jail.

408
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
We lost the lead.

409
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,000
Did Du Hui leave any message?

410
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,860
Qing.

411
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
There's something you should know.

412
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,480
What is it?

413
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,270
Xiyao and I are getting married.

414
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,200
That's great!

415
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,550
It is.

416
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,550
Yao is madly in love with you.

417
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
She finally found her love.

418
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,590
Qing.

419
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,240
Aside from

420
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,510
feeling happy for her,

421
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,030
don't you have other feelings?

422
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,480
Yeah.

423
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,880
I feel a bit wistful.

424
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,200
If you two are getting married,

425
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,200
it means

426
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,070
the story is coming to an end.

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,030
Ji Chu and I

428
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,480
are going to...

429
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,000
Why do you feel wistful?

430
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,880
I'll have to

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,030
share my beloved Yao

432
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,350
with you.

433
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
I see.

434
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,110
Your Highness.

435
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,160
You and Yao are a match made in heaven.

436
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,510
You should be happy.

437
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,240
I forgot your tea.

438
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,400
We will be happy.

439
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,480
Your Highness.

440
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,790
He is awake.

441
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,440
However, it's only for a while.

442
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,590
You actually survived

443
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,590
and managed
to elude death for some time.

444
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,480
Du Hui.

445
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,070
Is it worth it to work for her?

446
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,400
She didn't even listen

447
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
to your final message.

448
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
You're devoted.

449
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,400
I didn't understand
why people could be so devoted.

450
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,680
But now, I can somewhat see the reasons.

451
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,920
I want to know

452
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,790
if she was involved

453
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,030
in the incident from 15 years ago.

454
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,030
I've uncovered

455
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,160
your ties with Her Majesty.

456
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,350
I even know about the hairpin you had

457
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,830
as a token of love.

458
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,110
I also know that

459
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,400
my father was supposed

460
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,680
to marry the First Princess of Fuyu.

461
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,400
It was with your help

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,480
that

463
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,160
the ambitious Third Princess

464
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,110
managed to marry my father.

465
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,750
You knew the love of your life

466
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,880
would never be content

467
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,000
with what she had.

468
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,790
So, you helped her realize her ambition.

469
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,070
That was very generous of you.

470
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,920
I pity you.

471
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,920
You will never know if Her Majesty

472
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,030
has ever

473
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,030
thought about you.

474
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,200
I want to know

475
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,590
if she was involved

476
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,200
15 years ago.

477
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,200
Fifteen years ago...

478
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,200
The empress...

479
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,270
The Su family...

480
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,400
The Demon Poison...

481
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,110
What's up?

482
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,590
There many mosquitoes lately.

483
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,830
I grew some repelling herbs

484
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,350
for Wan to carry with her.

485
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,510
What is it?

486
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,960
Do you need something?

487
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,070
I heard stories

488
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,590
about how Ji Chu had
gone through hell in Nanjing.

489
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,400
He was at death's doorstep.

490
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,200
I'd like to know

491
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,830
what Ji Chu had gone through

492
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
in Nanjing.

493
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,240
Why the sudden interest?

494
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,200
Are you mad at him

495
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,200
because of Pumpkin?

496
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,000
Not really.

497
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,240
I want to know more about his past.

498
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,510
Very well.

499
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,640
It wouldn't hurt to tell you.

500
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,880
At least you'll treat him better.
