[Different Princess]

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
[Episode 5]

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,790
Did you see

15
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,120
who attacked you?

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,950
Yes.

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,230
Your Highness.

18
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,870
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
According to my speculation,

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,750
Lady Wuxue committed suicide.

21
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,750
Why did she want to commit suicide?

22
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,590
Your Highness.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,430
Please keep my secret.

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
(She's the only one)

25
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,240
who knew the reason.

26
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,000
You're the coroner.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Speak up.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,190
Tell me how Lady Wuxue died.

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,590
Your Highness.

30
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,080
Lady Wuxue's death was caused
by charcoal-burning suicide.

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,590
The charcoal was burning in the lounge.

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,840
But her body was in the dance room.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,960
How did a dead person

34
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
move her own body

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,800
to another room

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,190
and had the crown prince

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,520
with her?

38
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,750
Regarding this question,

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,800
someone can answer.

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,910
Who?

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,910
Lady Wuxue's maid,

42
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,470
Nuo.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,680
Send for Nuo.

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,750
Send for Nuo.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,750
Miss Nuo.

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,870
After Lady Wuxue died
from charcoal-burning,

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,630
you were the one who moved her body

48
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,430
from the lounge

49
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,590
to the dance room,

50
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,470
right?

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,120
What did you say?

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,470
After Lady Wuxue committed suicide,

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,840
you were the one who moved her body

54
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,030
to the dance room

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,240
and placed it
in the middle of the stage.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,630
Why would Xue commit suicide?

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,910
She was so pretty.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,870
So many people liked her.

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Why would she seek death?

60
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,910
(No.)

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,190
(This is not right.)

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,190
(Why did Nuo change her testimony?)

63
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,600
It was him.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,750
It was the sanctimonious crown prince.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Not only did he lie to her,

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,510
but he also cruelly

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,120
killed Xue.

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,390
Sir.

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,800
You must

70
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,120
find justice for my sister,

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Lady Wuxue.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,270
Lady Wuxue liked the crown prince?

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,630
Xue was loyal

74
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,000
to His Highness.

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,120
However,

76
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,190
His Highness

77
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,240
was having

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,870
an affair with a woman

79
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,920
of unknown origin.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,680
A woman of unknown origin?

81
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,160
It's this woman named Qing.

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Me?

83
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,480
Indeed.

84
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,190
It's you.

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,510
Ever since you came into the picture,

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,360
Xue had been

87
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,510
very depressed every day.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,950
Ji Yun.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you know this woman?

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
I treat her like my younger sister.

91
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,310
Nuo.

92
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,270
How did you leave

93
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,430
the wry neck ruined temple?

94
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,870
Were you seized?

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,820
I don't understand

96
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,920
what you're talking about.

97
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,120
It's okay that you don't understand.

98
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,480
I understood now.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,070
Tell me,

100
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,950
why would His Highness

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,950
stay at the scene

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,070
after killing someone

103
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,000
so everyone could

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,560
hold this against him?

105
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,680
This...

106
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,630
This is your matter.

107
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,120
Why would I know?

108
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,510
Of course you don't know.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,070
Because you're lying.

110
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm not.

111
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,630
(Since you insist on not admitting.)

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,950
(I shall force you)

113
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,560
(until you tell the truth.)

114
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,240
Miss Lin.

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,870
Yes?

116
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,000
Where are the dregs of the medicine?

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,630
This is the medicine

118
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,190
Lady Wuxue took for long-term use.

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
Since we have

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,510
Bei Wanshu

121
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,750
from Nangong Physicians around,

122
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,160
let's ask

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,560
the knowledgeable Bei Wanshu

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
to have a look at

125
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,160
what medicinal herb this actually is.

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,160
This medicinal herb is called Yinbing.

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,830
It nourishes beauty

128
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,870
and helps delay skin aging.

129
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,070
Is this herb poisonous?

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,070
It has severe pathogenic cold.

131
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,510
When taken in long term,

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,190
it can cause cold to enter the body

133
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,070
that leads to organ failure and death.

134
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,000
Does this poison

135
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,600
show any symptom?

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,310
At the later stage of poisoning,

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,360
the body will show purple spots.

138
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,360
There were indeed

139
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,920
purple spots on the body.

140
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,560
Nuo.

141
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,560
Because of

142
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,310
her long-term use
of this medicinal herb,

143
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
Lady Wuxue's body

144
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,920
showed spots.

145
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,800
As her closest maid,

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,190
you're most likely

147
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,430
to be poisoning her chronically.

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,510
Why did you poison her?

149
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
You're talking nonsense.

150
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,680
I didn't poison Xue.

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
You won't say it?

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I will.

153
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,560
Because Lady Wuxue ruined your face.

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,870
Because you looked good
since you were young,

155
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,070
and some customers were fond of you.

156
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,190
Out of rage, Lady Wuxue

157
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,200
cut your face.

158
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,030
She didn't allow treatment.

159
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,550
Therefore,

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,480
your face

161
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,750
has a scar.

162
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,320
Although you looked fine with it,

163
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,870
you've been holding grudge.

164
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,790
That's why you

165
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,200
poisoned Lady Wuxue secretly.

166
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
I didn't.

167
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,150
It wasn't me.

168
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,360
Lady Wuxue took this poison

169
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,440
for a long time.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Her body was very cold.

171
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,200
She needed to get warmth

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
from burning charcoal.

173
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
That day,

174
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,870
when she was burning charcoal,

175
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,840
you used cotton

176
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,600
to seal the doors and windows.

177
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
After killing her,

178
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,200
you blamed it on His Highness.

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,080
No.

180
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,360
No, it wasn't me.

181
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,240
Well...

182
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,000
Why would I

183
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,390
kill Xue?

184
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,870
Although you don't admit it,

185
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,750
your legs have betrayed you.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,910
Because you were jealous

187
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,440
of Lady Wuxue's beauty and dance,

188
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,390
you secretly

189
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,790
stepped on gold dust to vent your anger.

190
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,510
The gold-dusted footprints

191
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,960
you left at the scene

192
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,270
are the best evidence.

193
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,510
Stop making excuses.

194
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,550
Impossible.

195
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,270
There's no gold dust on my shoes.

196
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,870
Xue.

197
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,320
Although she cut your face,

198
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,670
you've been together with her

199
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,750
for so long,

200
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,790
you're so close to each other.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,910
How could you

202
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,150
just let her die?

203
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,870
You even used her death
as a false evidence.

204
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,480
You were the person
she trusted the most.

205
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
No.

206
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,750
Xue wasn't

207
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,000
killed by me.

208
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,790
She committed suicide.

209
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,200
I only moved her body

210
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,870
to the dance room.

211
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,270
There was no gold dust

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,630
in dance room that day.

213
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,080
She's lying.

214
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,150
Sir, I didn't murder anyone.

215
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,790
Prince Qi,

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
this case has been cleared.

217
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,360
Lady Wuxue committed suicide.

218
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,910
The person who moved the body was Nuo.

219
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,200
I...

220
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,480
Speak.

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,550
Why did you lie

222
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,510
and frame Ji Yun?

223
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,910
I don't know.

224
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,480
I don't know anything.

225
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
(You try to surpass me
in making up stories?)

226
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,080
(You're out of the league.)

227
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,630
I have a question.

228
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,870
What question?

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
Even if Lady Wuxue committed suicide,

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,320
why did she sedate the crown prince

231
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,270
and keep him by her side?

232
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,550
(It was you)

233
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,790
(who used the Glamour Neon Dress)

234
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
(to make Lady Wuxue kill herself)

235
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
(in order to get East Office.)

236
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
(You also forced her)

237
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,000
(to leave the crown prince at the scene)

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,630
(in order to frame him)

239
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,440
(as the murderer.)

240
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,510
What's the relationship

241
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,440
between Your Highness

242
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,910
and Lady Wuxue?

243
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,790
You just want to slander His Highness

244
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,910
and Lady Wuxue

245
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
to anger His Majesty

246
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,390
so his East Office will be abolished.

247
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,200
Qing.

248
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,200
Lady Wuxue and I

249
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,630
were just friends.

250
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,600
She played zither well.

251
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
We used to talk and discuss a lot.

252
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,600
That's all.

253
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm afraid

254
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,120
your mere words

255
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,480
can't stop the people from talking.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,480
Chu.

257
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,080
Why are you being aggressive?

258
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,910
Because

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
I want to find

260
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,750
an interesting maid.

261
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,120
Do you know who I am?

262
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,120
Do you know who's behind me?

263
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
It's of course Prince Lv.

264
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,550
Prince Lv is my master.

265
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,240
I'll make a good master.

266
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,440
"You're like the bright moon
and I'm like the fog

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,630
Fog followed the moon away
and left dewdrops behind.

268
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,390
You're good in playing zither
and I'm good in dancing.

269
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,120
When the song ends, people leave.

270
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,030
Only sadness is left."

271
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,030
This is a love poem

272
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
from Lady Wuxue to the crown prince.

273
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
From the content we can tell

274
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,550
that both of them are deep in love.

275
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,080
I deduce

276
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,910
that Lady Wuxue wanted
to keep the crown prince

277
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,750
by her side at her death because,

278
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
just like the rumors,

279
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,790
the crown prince is

280
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,960
a heartless man.

281
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
This story

282
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
is nicely created.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,390
That's right.

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,870
I'm not worse than anyone

285
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,440
in making up stories.

286
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,550
Not only that,

287
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,030
but I'm also not worse than anyone

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
in creating evidences.

289
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,150
It seems that, after Lady Wuxue died,

290
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,150
His Highness will have to bear

291
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,000
the reputation of a heartless man.

292
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,390
What do you want?

293
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,870
The crown prince

294
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
or you?

295
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,390
You can only protect one.

296
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,200
Your Majesty.

297
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,240
Chu left home since young

298
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,550
to become a hostage in Nanjing.

299
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,200
He was alone out there,

300
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,200
he must have suffered a lot.

301
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
He's finally back.

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,550
As his parents,

303
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,270
we should treat him well.

304
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,200
How do you think

305
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,480
we should treat him well?

306
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,840
It seems it was just a misunderstanding.

307
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,270
Acting Judge,

308
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,390
you may continue the trial.

309
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,120
After being dead for hours,

310
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,840
Lady Wuxue still looked like
when she was alive.

311
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,320
Why was that so?

312
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,440
That's because she was wearing

313
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
a special dance gown.

314
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,360
After wearing it,

315
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,790
one can maintain
her appearance before death.

316
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,320
Glamour Neon Dress

317
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,120
has an extraordinary origin.

318
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,550
This was a gift

319
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,870
to the empress by Fuyu.

320
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,670
Although the empress didn't like it

321
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,510
and it was worshiped in Zhendao Temple,

322
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,790
it still belonged to the empress.

323
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,270
How did the dress

324
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,870
end up with Lady Wuxue?

325
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,030
Furthermore, how could she be sure

326
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,910
that she can be buried in this dress

327
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,080
to maintain her beauty and youth?

328
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,960
I've asked for Mother's permission

329
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,240
to let Lady Wuxue

330
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,080
be buried in the dress.

331
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
What?

332
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
(Ji Yun is admitting)

333
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,390
(that he's related to Lady Wuxue.)

334
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,960
(But why did he do that?)

335
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,030
The imperial edict is here.

336
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,360
Not kneeling in front
of the imperial edict?

337
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,360
Do you want to lose your head?

338
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,390
You're not kneeling either.

339
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,670
I'll kneel soon.

340
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,750
You kneel first.

341
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,830
In God's mandate,

342
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,640
His Majesty wrote this edict.

343
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,680
The crown prince, Ji Yun,
has disappointed His Majesty

344
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,270
by having flawed virtue.

345
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,790
His position as the head of East Office
shall be abolished.

346
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,200
It shall be replaced
by Prince Lv, Ji Chu.

347
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,160
Hopefully you'll be humble, dedicated,

348
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,480
disciplined,

349
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
and not disappoint me.

350
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
I accept the order.

351
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,510
Honor this.

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,960
Qing.

353
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,510
Are you all right?

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
What's your plan?

355
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,510
First, I want to

356
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,790
get a treatment from Miss Lin.

357
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,510
I knelt down too hard just now.

358
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,880
I think my knees are injured.

359
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,440
It's not safe out there.

360
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,160
Come back to
the Crown Prince Residence with me.

361
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,200
Be it treatment or other things,

362
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
we can still discuss about it.

363
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,790
It's okay, Your Highness.

364
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,510
(I'm the thorn in Ji Chu's side.)

365
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
(If I stay by Ji Yun,)

366
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,070
(I may bring him trouble.)

367
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,240
By the way,

368
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,350
Just now at the law court,

369
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
why didn't you confess

370
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,270
the true reason of Lady Wuxue's suicide?

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
I want to help her keep a secret.

372
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,960
You suffered because of others.

373
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,960
You're indeed

374
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,110
the dream man of all.

375
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
Miss Qing.

376
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,110
Don't forget

377
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,640
that you're mine.

378
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,160
What?

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,790
Are you backing out?

380
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,480
(I'm flexible.)

381
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,000
(Obey when you have to.)

382
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,070
(It's not embarrassing.)

383
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,200
Your Highness.

384
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,110
I'm of low status.

385
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm afraid I'm not worthy

386
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,790
of the noble you.

387
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,350
Please have mercy

388
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,200
and let me go.

389
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,550
You're not worthy of me indeed.

390
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,240
However,

391
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,310
you can still be the lowest ranked maid

392
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,000
in my residence.

393
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,160
As a maid?

394
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,830
I...

395
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
Your Highness.

396
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,200
You have the temperament

397
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,920
of a domineering president.

398
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,880
Chu.

399
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,350
Qing is my friend.

400
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm taking her back

401
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,110
to my residence for treatment.

402
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,790
Back to your residence?

403
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
Outside East Office,

404
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,110
Miss Qing admitted herself

405
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,510
that she's one of mine.

406
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,270
Why is she going back
to Crown Prince Residence?

407
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,830
Could she have

408
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,200
faked her identity in public
in front of East Office?

409
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,480
I don't mean that.

410
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,960
What do you mean, then?

411
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,240
Qing has nothing to do
with Lady Wuxue's case.

412
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,510
Don't drag innocent people

413
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,480
into this matter.

414
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,960
She talked nonsense at the law court

415
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,160
and intimidated the witness.

416
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,960
Is she innocent?

417
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,160
In my opinion,

418
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,160
not only is she not innocent,

419
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,680
but she's also colluding

420
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,270
with you.

421
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,750
Someone.

422
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes, Your Highness.

423
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,070
Take down

424
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
this woman who disturbed the law court

425
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
and imprison her.

426
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,510
The case of Lady Wuxue
will be retried tomorrow.

427
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,110
Your Highness.

428
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,070
Please go back to your residence

429
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,240
and continue to be grounded.

430
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,400
Chu.

431
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,200
Your Highness.

432
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,350
It's been 15 years.

433
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,240
You still don't understand this.

434
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,510
Whatever you want,

435
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,200
by hook or by crook,

436
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,750
you have to grab it.

437
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,550
Qing is not an object.

438
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,510
I'm not an object indeed.

439
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm a human.

440
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,790
I have my own choice.

441
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,830
What's your choice?

442
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,680
Your Highness.

443
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,750
Ji Chu is always scheming.

444
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,920
If he's allowed to retry the case,

445
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,270
who knows how he'll frame us?

446
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,400
I shall go back with him first.

447
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,350
No way.

448
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,310
I'm worried
that if you go back with him,

449
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,480
you may be in danger.

450
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm not to be trifled with.

451
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,270
We're not sure who'll be harmed.

452
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,830
I choose Prince Lv.

453
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,550
Let's go.

454
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
For the sake of the crown prince,

455
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,350
you're willing to sacrifice yourself.

456
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,590
You're truly devoted.

457
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,510
Whatever.

458
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Between the prince's residence and jail,

459
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,240
anyone would choose
the prince's residence.

460
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,750
What now?

461
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,790
Is Prince Lv Residence
worse than the jail?

462
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,440
I would like to see

463
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,960
for how much longer
you can put on your smile.

464
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,640
Stay tuned.

465
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,750
40 years ago,

466
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,750
the legend says

467
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,680
that there was a famous dancer
in Shenyang,

468
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,550
named Gongsun Xu.

469
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
It's said

470
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,510
that her Luo Shen Dance

471
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,350
has shocked the world.

472
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,920
Whoever saw her dance

473
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,590
was amazed.

474
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,880
Her dance

475
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,350
was better than Lady Wuxue's?

476
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,350
They're not far from each other.

477
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,750
Even so,

478
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,830
what would

479
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,480
these two dancers who are 40 years apart

480
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,510
have to do with each other?

481
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,040
[Deed]

482
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,310
Two days ago,

483
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,640
I unintentionally

484
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,200
opened a dossier.

485
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
(The owner of Melodious Serenity Abode)

486
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,830
(was Gongsun Xu.)

487
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,550
Melodious Serenity Abode?

488
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,030
(Could Gongsun Xu)

489
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,510
(and Lady Wuxue)

490
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,640
(the same person?)

491
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,750
Whatever the crown prince did

492
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,070
was to help Lady Wuxue

493
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,640
keep this secret?

494
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,510
[Crown Prince]

495
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,680
(Once Gongsun Xu,)

496
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,750
(now Lady Wuxue.)

497
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,790
(Beauty has bounded my life.)

498
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,110
(I hope death can bring an end to this.)

499
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,400
(Please grant me this wish,
Your Highness.)

500
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,070
(Gongsun Nuo)

501
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,350
(has only one life.)

502
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,680
(I didn't want her
to follow my footstep,)

503
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,550
(so I destroyed her beauty.)

504
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,070
(After I die,)

505
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,200
(please help her)

506
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,200
(settle down.)

507
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,200
The prettiest woman in Shenyang,

508
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,350
Lady Wuxue.

509
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,830
Farewell.

510
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,790
Second Brother.

511
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,200
Why do you like

512
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Lady Wuxue so much?

513
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,790
She was the prettiest woman in Shenyang.

514
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,240
Isn't that enough?

515
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,110
But I heard that,

516
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,240
after she died,

517
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,680
you weren't willing to see her body.

518
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,240
Why should I look at her body?

519
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,960
May she

520
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,240
live in my heart forever.

521
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Tell me,

522
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,720
why did Ji Yun

523
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,110
ask Mother's permission

524
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,510
to let Lady Wuxue
keep Glamour Neon Dress,

525
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,310
which caused him

526
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,510
to lose the position in East Office?

527
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,790
I guess she felt sorry for her.

528
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,510
How hard was it to understand?

529
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
Ji Yun is gentle but not willful.

530
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,790
Why would he do

531
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,310
things that only you would do?

532
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,270
I'm not willful.

533
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,440
It was Mother

534
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,550
who forced me all the time.

535
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,440
There are things

536
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,920
that are beyond my control.

537
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,480
(Your Highness.)

538
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,240
Miss Qing is brought back
to Prince Lv Residence.

539
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,480
She's safe for now.

540
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,790
Before confirming

541
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,000
Qing's real identity,

542
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,680
Chu won't take action recklessly.

543
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,790
[Crown prince's guard, Fang Cheng]
Is Miss Qing

544
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,310
safe or in danger?

545
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,640
The dangerous part is

546
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,590
that Chu won't give up
on killing Hua Qingge.

547
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,300
[Anxiang Hall]

548
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,200
You prepared me, a maid,

549
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
such a good meal

550
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,400
and such a nice room.

551
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,680
You're generous indeed, Your Highness.

552
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,440
I made such an arrangement

553
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
because you're worthy of it.

554
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,550
Will you poison me?

555
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,960
You may give it a try.

556
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
Sure, I'm not afraid.

557
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,200
Why?

558
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
Aren't you afraid that I may poison you?

559
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
Compared to poisoning me,

560
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,030
I think you

561
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,070
would prefer to keep me

562
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,440
and torture me slowly.

563
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,880
That's my blind guess.

564
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,020
[Anxiang Hall]

565
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,790
I'm living

566
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,310
in Xuanyu Hall
that's next to your place.

567
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,830
If you recall anything

568
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,240
related to Hua Qingge,

569
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,590
you may come to see me.

570
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,550
(Turns out after running around,)

571
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,750
