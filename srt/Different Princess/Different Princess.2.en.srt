00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,440
(She's so beautiful)

191
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,630
(that so many people like her.)

192
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Stop talking about it.

193
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,750
(But I wrote her to death.)

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,270
Qing,

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,840
what's wrong with you?

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,200
I...

197
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,550
(If I tell Ji Yun)

198
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,030
(that Lady Wuxue will die,)

199
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,360
(will he suspect my origins?)

200
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Lady Wuxue!

201
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,000
No.

202
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,080
Nothing.

203
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,910
Lady Wuxue!

204
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,750
Do you want to stay young
and beautiful forever?

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,150
I can help you.

206
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,480
Your Highness.

207
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,200
Gongge has given
the Glamour Neon Dress to Lady Wuxue.

208
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,630
Lady Wuxue is willing to
give her life in exchange.

209
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,390
All right, just stick to the plan.

210
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,200
It's Lady Wuxue.

211
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,270
She's not really dead, is she?

212
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,630
Miss Qing, it's you.

213
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
My gosh.

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,910
Xue,

215
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
why didn't you light the candles?

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,080
I forgot

217
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
you're living here lately.

218
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,390
I'm sorry

219
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,440
to bother you.

220
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,200
It's okay.

221
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,870
(Is this the Glamour Neon Dress?)

222
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,240
It's getting late.

223
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,480
You should get some rest.

224
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,790
(In my novel,)

225
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,480
(Lady Wuxue dies)

226
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,630
(the day after she gets)

227
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,480
(the Glamour Neon Dress.)

228
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,440
(Ji Yun's at the scene of the crime,)

229
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,200
(so he's considered the murderer.)

230
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,840
(And all of this)

231
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,670
(is set up by Ji Chu)

232
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
(to seize the East Office from Ji Yun.)

233
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,120
Maybe if I die,

234
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,270
I'll be able to go back
and revise the novel,

235
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,550
then Xue won't have to die.

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,600
I am in

237
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,600
the world of the novel,

238
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,800
but the pain is very real.

239
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
What if I don't die,

240
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,390
and my wound gets infected
and pus flows out,

241
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,670
and I become a disabled amputee?

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,510
(Please revise the ending
of "The Tale of Yun and Xi")

243
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,030
(to revive Ji Yun and
bring down Ji Chu.)

244
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,080
(Otherwise, the plot
will backfire on you.)

245
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,630
Should I stay in the novel

246
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,150
and revise the ending?

247
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,630
Maybe I can go back
after getting rid of Ji Chu

248
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
and protecting Ji Yun.

249
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,790
If that's the case,

250
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,550
(the first thing I'll do)

251
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,510
(is stop Lady Wuxue
from committing suicide.)

252
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,120
If I steal the Glamour Neon Dress,

253
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
she won't have to die.

254
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,320
(And I can)

255
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
[Rumeng House]
(change the ending and go back.)

256
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,440
What a rude guy.

257
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,440
How dare you

258
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,870
[Prince Qi of Liang, Ji Feng]
get in a prince's way?

259
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,550
This guy is actually a prince?

260
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,270
(Could it be that he is Ji Yun)

261
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,480
(and Ji Chu's second brother,)

262
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,270
(Shengjing's top dandy,
Prince Qi, Ji Feng?)

263
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,960
Come on.

264
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,870
This is no fun.

265
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,840
Let's go upstairs.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Good!

267
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,080
Awesome!

268
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,480
Great!

269
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,240
What are they doing?

270
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,630
Aren't they just imitating Lady Wuxue?

271
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,150
(I remember in the novel,)

272
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,320
(Lady Wuxue lives in)

273
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
(the third room on the second floor.)

274
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,630
Your Highness, this way, please.

275
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,870
Let me try it.

276
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,870
Mister, come here.

277
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,600
Come on, let's go up there and talk.

278
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,630
Let's go, my dear.

279
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,030
- You're here.
- I see.

280
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,150
So you're here.

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,670
Awesome!

282
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,150
Your Highness, do you know her?

283
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
She once showed up
by the crown prince's side,

284
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,480
and now she's here
at Rumeng House.

285
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,510
Do you think

286
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,150
it's a coincidence?

287
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,440
This is the night Lady Wuxue will die.

288
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,600
[Guard of Prince Lv, Xiao Yan]
To avoid any trouble,

289
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,270
I'll kill her now.

290
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,960
No need.

291
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,360
Go and deliver a letter

292
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,030
to the crown prince for me.

293
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,550
Nuo,

294
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,830
where's my medicine?

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,070
Xue,

296
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,310
you really need to stop drinking

297
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,440
this medicine.

298
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,550
Nuo, give me the medicine.

299
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,480
Give it to me!

300
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,160
Nuo!

301
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,590
I'm here to steal something.

302
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,310
Isn't it too blatant

303
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,790
to enter through the front door?

304
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,750
No one's here?

305
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,070
The show's about to start.

306
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,830
Where is she?

307
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,070
Xue,

308
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,640
why do we have to change rooms?

309
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,830
Just do as you're told.

310
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,200
Nuo, go and put the box away.

311
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Glamour Neon Dress.

312
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,590
Your Highness,

313
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
I saw a guy

314
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,640
entering Lady Wuxue's room.

315
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,910
Go in and get him out.

316
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,030
I'll block him here.

317
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Your Highness,

318
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
why don't we go in together?

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
It's better for two to catch one.

320
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,030
I am

321
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,830
the prince of Liang.

322
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,750
It's inappropriate for me

323
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,640
to enter a dancer's room.

324
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,310
Go now!

325
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,270
Gongge,

326
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,480
what brings you here?

327
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,960
It's such a lively evening.

328
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
How could I not come to see it?

329
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,960
Where is your master?

330
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,310
Your Highness,

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,590
there's no one in the room.

332
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,550
What?

333
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,590
What's going on?

334
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,240
I saw

335
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
the guy coming in.

336
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,510
He must still be in the room.

337
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,920
Find him!

338
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes.

339
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,440
(Why did I jump onto the beam)

340
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,680
(in the heat of the moment?)

341
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,750
(Why am I hiding from Ji Feng?)

342
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,270
(After all,)

343
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,590
(compared to Ji Feng,)

344
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,960
(the one who's scarier is...)

345
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
(I'm in a hurry,)

346
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,550
(you two.)

347
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,350
(I have to steal)

348
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,270
(the Glamour Neon Dress)

349
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,030
(before Lady Wuxue
starts her performance.)

350
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
(Otherwise, I won't have a chance.)

351
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,830
Your Highness,

352
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,200
I haven't searched this place yet.

353
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,350
The guy

354
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,440
must have escaped through the window.

355
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,510
I'm sure we can

356
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,590
catch up with him now.

357
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Your Highness,

358
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,400
I think it's an illusion.

359
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,240
After him!

360
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,200
Yes.

361
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,790
I...

362
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
Do we know each other?

363
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,310
Why are you so scared of me?

364
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,350
I'm in a hurry.

365
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,510
I have to go now.

366
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
What do you want?

367
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,110
I haven't finished my sentence.

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,750
Why should I listen to you?

369
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,880
Are you my husband?

370
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
Whether or not I'm your husband,

371
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,030
that depends on who you are.

372
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,440
If you want to know who I am,

373
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,880
you'll have to tell me

374
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,070
who you are.

375
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,270
You don't know who I am?

376
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,030
Are you some kind of big shot?

377

Does everyone have to know you?

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,680
Just now,

379

were you looking for
the Glamour Neon Dress?

380
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,030
Yes.

381
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,400
How did you know

382
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,240
the Glamour Neon Dress was here?

383
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,030
I don't know.

384
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,000
That's why I didn't find it.

385
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,310
Do you know

386
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,200
where the Glamour Neon Dress is?

387
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,680
Nuo,

388
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,000
bring me my dancing dress.

389
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,070
Where is my dancing dress?

390
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,510
Don't try to run away.

391
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,070
Be good

392
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,400
and give her back the dancing dress.

393
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,960
No.

394
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,880
No way.

get closer to him.

hid on the beams together, didn't we?

403

Handsome,

404
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,070
can you tell me

405

Miss Qing,

411
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,880
why are you here?

412
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
It's a long story.

413
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,880
In all my life,

414
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,960

415
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,310
so scared.

Xue,

417
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,200
where have you been?

418
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,790
For some reason,

419
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,200
I moved to the break room.

420
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,680
What reason?

421
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,270
That's not important.

422
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,510
Xue,

423
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
shouldn't you be on stage

424
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,440
at this hour?

425
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,510
I've lost my dancing dress.

426
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,310
(That's great.)

(But)

to steal the Glamour Neon Dress)

from committing suicide)

(as much as I do?)

431
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,550
Right, Miss Qing,

432
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,310
the crown prince didn't come with you?

433
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440

Miss Lin,

440
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,270
I heard you examined

00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,880
six bodies today.

442
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,310
Thank you for your hard work.

443
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,110

Thank you.

What's the matter?

What's she doing at Rumeng House?

452
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,960
Miss Lin, it's getting late.

453
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Get some rest.

454
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,110

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,110
disappears tonight
