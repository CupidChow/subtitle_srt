00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,080
I will make him

195
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,120
pay with his blood.

196
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,150
Your Royal Highness.

197
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,790
Your Highness.

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
The Wei family illegally manufactured
weapons,

199
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,670
so there is an intention of rebellion.

200
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,440
Please return to Ning'an Palace

201
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,750
and wait for Father's instructions.

202
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
These are false accusations.

203
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
I will see the emperor myself.

204
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,440
Let me go!

205
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,790
Fang Cheng.

206
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,750
Your Highness.

207
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,840
Escort Her Royal Highness
back to the palace.

208
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,390
Yes, Your Highness.

209
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,510
Your Highness.

210
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,000
Your Royal Highness,

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,790
after you.

212
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,870
Your Highness.

213
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Your Highness.

214
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Let's go.

215
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,600
Feng.

216
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,910
Feng.

217
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,750
Qing,

218
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,630
you are awake?

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,480
Yao,

220
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,150
I thought I was dead.

221
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,030
Why am I still in the past?

222
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,080
Why are you speaking nonsense
after just waking up?

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,670
This is Mystic Medicine House.

224
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
Mystic Medicine House?

225
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,200
Are you unwell anywhere else?

226
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Where is the crown prince and Ji Chu?

227
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,630
Your Highness.

228
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,480
Your Highness,

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,360
why has

230
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,440
your hair changed?

231
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,270
Why are you still standing there?

232
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,960
I think

233
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,150
this looks better on you.

234
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,550
Father,

235
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
I have failed to protect Feng,

236
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,440
please punish me.

237
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,270
This has nothing to do with you.

238
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
I know

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
you flew in the face of danger

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,270
and did what you could.

241
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,480
Please rise.

242
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,440
Thank you, father.

243
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Who dared to

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,910
kill a royal offspring?

245
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,150
I

246
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,390
found the lethal dagger

247
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,790
on Feng's body.

248
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,540
Chu.

249
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Father,

250
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,390
I am starting to suspect

251
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,600
that this has to do with Chu.

252
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,790
Of course, I am involved.

253
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,550
Chu.

254
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,150
What does that mean for

255
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,240
what you just said?

256
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,750
Father,

257
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,440
when Prince Qi was murdered,

258
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,630
I was a witness.

259
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,840
Chu.

260
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,320
Chu, you're here!

261
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,240
Why does the dagger found on Feng's body

262
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,670
have your special emblem?

263
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,670
It is just a mere dagger,

264
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,390
how difficult it is to make one?

265
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,240
Do Your Highness think that

266
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,120
I am that stupid to leave

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,600
my dagger at the crime scene?

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Feng was kidnapped to the weapons camp

269
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,960
and killed,

270
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,150
this whole matter seems suspicious.

271
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,000
Father,

272
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,200
I suspect

273
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,960
that someone is trying to frame me

274
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,870
to reap its benefits.

275
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,630
Chu,

276
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,550
are you suspecting me?

277
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,630
Didn't you

278
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,630
suspect me as well?

279
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,600
I was just...

280
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,480
Enough.

281
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,550
Stop arguing, both of you.

282
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,630
This requires further investigation.

283
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,630
Father,

284
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,120
I will find that murderer,

285
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,630
seek revenge for Qi,

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,240
and prove my innocence.

287
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,840
Your Royal Highness.

288
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
Please wait up, Your Royal Highness.

289
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,790
Go away.

290
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
Your Highness, please stop.

291
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,240
Enough of your hypocrisy.

292
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,480
It is you who killed Feng.

293
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,960
Imperial Consort,

294
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
who permitted you to come here?

295
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,270
Please judge wisely, Your Majesty.

296
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,360
I am just trying to

297
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,270
seek justice for our son.

298
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,240
Since the return of Ji Chu from Nanjing,

299
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,080
he has been sowing discord.

300
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,480
All he wants

301
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,550
is to seek revenge for
Imperial Consort Xian.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
This is no different.

303
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,240
Else,

304
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,390
Feng wouldn't go missing,

305
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,550
and he won't also keep on pointing

306
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,200
toward my brother's weapon camp.

307
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,510
His sole intention is

308
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,870
to kill Feng and

309
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,510
take down the Wei family,

310
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,080
all out of personal revenge.

311
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,150
Your Majesty,

312
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,240
please do not trust him.

313
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,270
Chu,

314
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,750
what do you have to say about this?

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,310
If you rather believe in

316
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,640
this rebel from the Wei family

317
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,310
than me,

318
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,110
what else can I say?

319
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,790
Your Majesty,

320
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,590
please do not trust him, Your Majesty.

321
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,920
Enough.

322
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,310
If the Wei family

323
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,350
hadn't done
such heinous acts of treason,

324
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,240
Feng would never be harmed.

325
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
Starting from today,

326
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,200
she will be stripped
of the imperial consort title.

327
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,310
Take her away.

328
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't.

330
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,960
Your Majesty,

331
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,510
please don't do this, Your Majesty.

332
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,440
I want to seek revenge for Feng.

333
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,310
Your Majesty!

334
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,240
Your Majesty!

335
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,000
Ji Chu was the one who killed Feng.

336
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,830
Your Majesty!

337
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,790
Your Majesty!

338
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,920
Your Majesty!

339
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
Your Majesty!

340
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,240
Chu,

341
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,110
I do want to believe you,

342
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,400
but I was just devastated over
the loss of my son.

343
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,440
I hope that

344
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,200
you will work together with Yu.

345
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,400
You must

346
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,200
find out the real culprit
of Feng's death.

347
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,110
I will obey your orders, Your Majesty.

348
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,270
Your Majesty,

349
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,960
the Duke is here.

350
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,160
Both of you can leave.

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,350
I have something

352
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,590
to discuss with the Duke.

353
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,640
I'll take my leave.

354
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,000
Chu,

355
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,350
I truly hope that

356
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,270
this has nothing to do with you.

357
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,960
The innocent will prove themselves.

358
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,960
I will find out

359
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,830
the truth of Feng's murder.

360
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,590
I will also prove my innocence.

361
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,070
The assailant that you caught

362
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
is highly suspicious.

363
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,750
Would you mind handing him over
for investigation?

364
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,070
Ji Yun,

365
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,440
we are not on the same path,

366
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,440
so we should just do things our way.

367
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,680
Your Highness,

368
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,070
are you alright?

369
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,160
Judging by your condition,

370
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
you shouldn't have
forced yourself to come.

371
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,960
I am fine.

372
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Let's go back to Mystic Medicine House.

373
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,750
Yes, Your Highness.

374
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,510
Your Majesty,

375
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,270
this is a list of evidence

376
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,830
on Wei Zhao's illegal
manufacturing of weapons,

377
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
raising private soldiers,
imprisoning people,

378
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,440
and killing the innocent
that I have found.

379
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,110
Please have a look.

380
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,790
He dared to go behind my back

381
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
and done so many evil things
to the country and the people.

382
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,880
Calm down, Your Majesty.

383
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,400
Come,

384
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,830
pass on my order.

385
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,640
Wei Zhao disregarded the royal grace

386
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,240
and committed the crime of treason.

387
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,070
According to the laws of Liang,

388
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,350
his nine generations will be punished

389
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,830
as a deterrent to others.

390
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,160
Considering Lady Wei has lost her son,

391
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,400
she will be excluded
from this punishment,

392
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,680
but confined to West Court for life.

393
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,240
Your decision is wise, Your Majesty.

394
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,590
Duke,

395
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,880
you have merit in apprehending
the traitor.

396
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,240
Because of your loyalty,

397
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,440
you will be in charge
of military matters.

398
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

399
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,070
Chu.

400
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,880
Gongge.

401
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,680
Where is Qing?

402
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,110
You don't care about yourself,

403
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,920
but you care about her?

404
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,440
And you are even changing how you look?

405
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,830
How is she?

406
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,400
The last of her poison has been cured.

407
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,070
She is alright now.

408
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,070
She left after she woke up.

409
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,510
Where did she go?

410
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,510
Let me treat your wound,

411
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,550
and I will tell you.

412
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,960
You..

413
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,000
Come here.

414
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,830
Your wound has worsened to this point,

415
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,680
we can only scrape off the rotting flesh
to treat it.

416
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,880
Bear with it.

417
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,960
How long-winded.

418
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,030
Qing.

419
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,750
Where are you going?

420
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,160
How is your wound?

421
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,270
I am fine now.

422
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,440
Yao and I are going
to the Prince Qi Residence.

423
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
I am going to pay Feng

424
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,640
my last respects as well.

425
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,750
Your Highness,

426
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,350
the death of Prince Qi...

427
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
Chu has told Father that

428
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,640
it was not his doing.

429
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,880
His Majesty believed in him?

430
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,160
I saw

431
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,510
the whole of everything.

432
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,550
I can be a witness.

433
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,240
There is no need for that.

434
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,350
Father has ordered me and Chu

435
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,440
to investigate this together.

436
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,310
We would

437
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,590
probably need help from you

438
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,350
and Coroner Lin.

439
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
I will

440
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,640
bring this murderer to justice.

441
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,790
I will help Your Highness get
to the bottom of this.

442
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,110
Coroner Lin,

443
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,350
is your wound alright?

444
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,550
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

445
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
Nothing much to worry about.

446
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,590
Let's go then.

447
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
I do not always do as I wish.

448
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,030
Mother is always giving me pressure.

449
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,110
There are a lot of things

450
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,440
that I do not get to decide for myself.

451
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
Qi.

452
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,240
Qi.

453
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,160
Your Highness,

454
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,440
your body won't be able

455
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,200
totake it if you go on like this.

456
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,030
Prince Qi wouldn't like

457
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
to see you in this state as well.

458
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,110
Qi.

459
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,510
Your Highness.

460
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,550
Qing,

461
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
you're alright.

462
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,680
Wan'er,

463
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,200
I am sorry.

464
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,550
I couldn't save your brother.

465
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,440
Do you know,

466
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,480
Feng is someone

467
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,640
who seems like a decadent,

468
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,550
but his heart is exceptionally

469
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,720
pure.

470
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,350
Please tell me

471
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,830
who was the one that killed him.

472
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Rest assured, Wan'er.

473
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,160
I will find out the murderer for Feng.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,640
Coroner Lin,

475
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,640
would you please

476
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,750
examine Feng's body again?

477
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,310
You have been standing vigil for days,

479
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
you don't look well.

480
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,480
Please go home and rest.

481
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,830
I won't be able to sleep at home.

482
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,110
Why are you here?

483
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,070
I am of course here to

484
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
see if my patient who cannot sit still

485
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,070
is still alive,

486
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,070
else it might ruin my reputation
as a great physician.

487
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,030
I am very fine.

488
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,960
Thank you for saving my life.

489
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,160
You don't have to thank me.

490
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,350
I am only doing this

491
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,400
because of Chu.

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,510
Wan'er,

493
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,240
go home first.

494
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,240
I will come after talking to him.

495
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,830
I am sorry for your loss, Your Highness.

496
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,770
[Jingzhi Library]

497
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,750
What did you want to talk to me about?

498
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,200
I am impressed.

499
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,350
You and Ji Chu still dare to appear

500
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,000
after conducting such crimes.

501
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,000
Are you not even a little

502
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
guilty?

503
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,240
I would like to ask,

504
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
you kept saying that

505
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,680
it was Chu who killed Prince Qi,

506
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,640
but did you see it yourself?

507
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,440
When I was there,

508
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,830
Ji Feng was lying dead
in front of Ji Chu,

509
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,680
and there was a dagger.

510
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,590
You are basing this off a dagger,

511
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,830
and was so sure that it was Chu

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
who killed Prince Qi?

513
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,680
If Chu wanted to kill him,

514
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,750
would he even leave such flaws?

515
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
It was only because he did not deny
these doings,

516
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,400
and you were determined

517
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
to see him that way,

518
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,240
that you did not hesitate

519
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,160
to be prejudiced against him

520
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,350
and think that he did

521
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,640
all these evil things.

522
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,790
What a pity that he wanted to save you

523
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,880
and gave up his opportunity

524
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,270
to hurry to the weapons camp.

525
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
What did you say?

526
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,440
Ji Chu went to the weapons camp

527
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,550
to save me?

528
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,400
What else could it be?

529
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,310
It was because he wanted to save you

530
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,310
that he was ambushed.

531
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,110
He got wounded because of you.

532
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,070
When you were poisoned,

533
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,750
he even sucked the poison out of you.

534
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,350
Else you wouldn't

535
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,640
