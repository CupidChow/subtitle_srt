00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,230
I suppose the person intends to frame me

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,310
my intention

17
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,350
and planned to blindside me.

18
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,150
Could it be the crown prince?

19
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,640
I know him quite well.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,950
It wasn't him.

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,430
Who could it be, then?

No matter who it is,

I will flush this person out.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,680
You were wise enough

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,240
to have me kill Wei Zhao on the spot

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
and made him

27
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,910
a silent suspect

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
of Prince Qi's imprisonment.

29

Hence, His Majesty doesn't suspect you.

30

Which is for the time being.

He struggled before he died.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,750
Garment and skin tissues
were found under his nails.

39
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,520
When he was struggling,

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,310

Yes.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,190

more clues about it

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,560

Ji Chu of killing Ji Feng.

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,150
I thought you suspected me.

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes, I slightly did.

149

But the case

150
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,600
seems suspicious.

151
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,150
I can be at ease

152
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,030

of interrogation

161
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,120
is cruel.

Do you have a better way?

163
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240

Do you remember me?

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Your memory is considered poor

167
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,840
for an assassin.

168
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,630
I'll give you a hint.

169
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Snake!

170
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
So, you're afraid of snakes.

171
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,670
I'm not.

172
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,550
Finally, you speak.

173
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,630
That's more like it.

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,240
Kill me if you want.

175
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,360
Don't waste your breath.

176
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,270
I have a few questions for you.

177
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,320
Just answer yes or no,

178
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,360
and I will give you a quick death.

179
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,080
What do you say?

180
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,270
All right.

181
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,870
Are you an assassin?

182
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes.

183
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,600
You're not afraid of death?

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,360
No.

185
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,000
You killed Ji Feng?

186
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,630
Yes.

187
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,150
I see.

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,150
You killed Ji Feng

189
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,910
and shifted the blame to Ji Chu.

190
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,000
This is strange.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Since you meant
to shift the blame to him,

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,790
why did you hunt him down afterward?

193
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,960
What a good communication skill.

194
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,550
I'm really impressed

195
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,790
by your performance.

196
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,840
No biggie. Just playing to my strengths.

197
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,240
This is the reason

198
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,030
they changed their mind

199
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,480
and wanted to kill me.

200
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,390
So it is because

201
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,120
you saw this.

202
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,120
That's why they changed the plan

203
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,240
to silence you.

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
Precisely.

205
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,960
This tattoo

206
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,870
is very crucial to them.

207
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,390
They put on a mask during every action

208
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,840
to not expose their identity.

209
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,030
It means...

210
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,030
We know this person.

211
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
Qing.

212
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,240
Your Highness.

213
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,600
I've found new clues.

214
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,960
The murderer of Feng

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,750
has scratches

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,120
on their arm.

217
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,240
I wonder if I could examine you.

218
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
What if I say no?

219
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,550
I'm doing this for the investigation.

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,670
If not,

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,120
you can't clear yourself
of the suspicions.

222
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,440
It's not a big deal.

223
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,390
Just cooperate with him.

224
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,670
You have nothing to hide...

225
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Did you see it clearly?

226
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,840
So many old scars.

227
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,510
Your Highness.

228
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
Prince Lv is not the murderer.

229
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,600
We fished the truth out

230
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,390
from the guy in black

231
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,550
we arrested.

232
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,200
But he didn't reveal the mastermind.

233
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,030
Chu.

234
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,910
I was wrong about you.

235
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,270
It doesn't matter.

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm used to it.

237
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,240
Your Highness.

238
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,600
You need to handle

239
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,150
the confiscation of the Zhu family.

240
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,270
What has the Su family done

241
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,550
to deserve to be exterminated?

242
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,270
Get up.

243
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,440
How dare you.

244
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,910
Get up.

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,080
Take her away.

246
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,960
Leave now.

247
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,390
The Wei family is truly evil.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
Great that they were all executed.

249
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,440
That's right.

250
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,510
The Wei family

251
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,030
had harmed countless people.

252
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,670
This was the exact scene

253
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,200
of the Su family fifteen years ago.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,910
Great news!

255
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,550
Everything is in the past.

256
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
Now that the Wei family has collapsed,

257
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,270
what's your plan

258
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,270
to deal with Imperial Consort Wei?

259
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Wei has already lost her support.

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,480
It's better to let struggle in torture

261
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,510
than an easy death.

262
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,080
My Feng.

263
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,670
Where are you?

264
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,120
Feng.

265
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,150
Wei.

266
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,390
This is the medicine
the imperial physician prepared.

267
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,910
Drink it while it's hot.

268
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,360
Get lost!

269
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm perfectly fine.

270
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,360
I don't need medicine.

271
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,870
Where's Wushuang?

272
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,550
I want Wushuang.

273
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,000
She will wait on me.

274
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,670
This is Changhan Palace.

275
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,240
Your maidservant can't come in here.

276
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,480
So I'll help you with the medicine.

277
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,790
Was it Ji Chu?

278
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,360
Did Ji Chu send you

279
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,670
to kill me? Right?

280
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,790
I want to see His Majesty!

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,240
I want to see His Majesty!

282
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,440
I want to see His Majesty!

283
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,910
His Majesty won't see you.

284
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,270
I want to see His Majesty!

285
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,270
I want to see His Majesty!

286
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,960
Wei.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,510
Scram!

288
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,080
After Feng's passing,

289
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm beginning to miss you,

290
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
my children.

291
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,270
I feel relieved

292
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,870
after calling you here today.

293
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
All of you seem to be faring quite well.

294
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,550
My apologies.

295
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,670
I should visit you more often, Mother.

296
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,000
That's fine.

297
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,960
You've grown up.

298
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,120
You have your own things to focus on.

299
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,840
I can't keep you around

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
all the time.

301
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,750
As long as I know you do well in life.

302
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,080
Thank you, Mother.

303
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,200
Pin Yan.

304
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,120
Bring over

306
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,510
the pastry I prepared.

307
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,510
Yes.

308
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,630
It's been some time

309
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,910
since I last ate the pastry from you.

310
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,270
I know this is yummy.

311
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
Sweet girl.

312
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,120
Qing, try this.

313
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

314
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,240
She's recuperating.

315
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,880
She can't eat sweets.

316
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,030
I'm planning to have a tea party

317
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,240
afterward.

318
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,270
By then,

319
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,070
noble ladies in the capital

320
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,550
will be invited.

321
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,270
It's also an opportunity

322
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,070
to find Yun a good match.

323
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,510
Mother.

324
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,790
There's no rush.

325
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,830
It's been eventful lately.

326
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,030
It might be a good idea

327
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,030
to use your engagement

328
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,510
to bring blessings to the royal family.

329
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,510
Rightfully so, Your Majesty.

330
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,590
As Crown Prince,

331
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,200
you should name a Crown Princess
as early as possible.

332
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,350
Qing.

333
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,160
Please come to the tea party

334
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,310
and look for a suitable bride
for cousin Yun.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
Sure, I will.

336
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,030
Guards!

337
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,000
Ji Chu, I want to kill you!

338
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,590
Let go of me.

339
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,110
Let go!

340
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,310
Let go!

341
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,000
Chu.

342
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,110
Are you all right?

343
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,750
Don't worry about me, Your Majesty.

344
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,880
Wei.

345
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,310
This is foolish.

346
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,550
You will be convicted of
a death sentence

347
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,790
for harming princes.

348
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,510
He killed Feng.

349
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,750
I want to kill you!

350
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,920
Get off!

351
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,510
You can't kill him
before anything is confirmed.

352
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,880
What if you kill the wrong person?

353
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,070
Wei.

354
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,790
If you insist,

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
I can't keep you safe either.

356
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,400
I will report this to His Majesty

357
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,830
and let him decide.

358
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Take Wei away.

359
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,550
Yes.

360
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,270
Let go of me!

361
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,750
I must kill Ji Chu!

362
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,440
Move.

363
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,240
Let go of me!

364
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,480
Ji Chu!

365
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
I must kill him!

366
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,110
Mother,

367
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,350
has Imperial Consort Wei gone insane?

368
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,070
Whatever the case,

369
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm afraid His Majesty won't spare her.

370
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,550
Take it away. I'm not drinking this.

371
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,310
Out of my sight.

372
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,880
Take it away.

373
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,030
I can't die.

374
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,590
Don't ever think a second
you can poison me.

375
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,790
Wei.

376
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,480
You framed Imperial Consort Xian

377
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,750
and attempted to assassinate a prince.

378
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,160
His Majesty means

379
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,200
to give you a proper death.

380
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,920
Please drink it now.

381
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,920
No.

382
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,350
I can't die.

383
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
I have Feng.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Feng is so little.

385
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
He needs me.

386
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,030
Wei.

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

388
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,480
Look, Feng is smiling so happily.

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
He knows his father

390
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,550
is coming for him soon.

391
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,590
Look at his smile.

392
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,240
Your Highness.

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,550
Wei refuses to drink the poisoned wine.

394
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,270
She seems overstimulated

395
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,350
and paranoid.

396
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Leave this to me.

397
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,070
Be good.

398
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
You may leave us.

399
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,960
Good boy.

400
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,640
My mother hurt you

402
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,110
and made you suffer every single day

403
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,440
in the past decade.

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,830
Chu.

405
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,640
I will pay you for her sake

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,160
with my life, please?

407
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,880
You...

408
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,350
What are you doing?

409
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,920
Are you trying to kill Feng?

410
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,270
Don't be afraid.

411
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,200
Scram!

412
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,590
Get out of here.

413
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
You don't want to die?

414
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,480
Fine.

415
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,510
I'll grant your wish.

416
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,030
I've made a request from Father

417
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,400
to spare your life.

418
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,200
Yes, I can't die.

419
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,510
That's right.

420
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,030
Death is an easy thing to do.

421
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,640
Don't worry.

422
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll make sure you live well.

423
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,590
For the rest of your life,

424
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,000
you will be confined
in this Changhan Palace

425
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
and never leave.

426
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,550
I feel truly liberated

427
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,310
after taking the revenge

428
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
that I've planned for years.

429
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,400
I will seek justice

430
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,110
for the wronged Su family

431
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,960
and clear its name

432
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
once I find the right chance.

433
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
My family

434
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,070
was once a prestigious medical family

435
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
teeming with talents.

436
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,030
To think I'm the only one left

437
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,920
living in shame under an assumed name.

438
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,880
Due to the greed of that vicious Wei,

439
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,070
more than a hundred members of my family

440
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,110
died unjustly.

441
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,270
The dreadful Wei family

442
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,920
can never compensate for that.

443
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,680
Our misfortune

444
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,350
was brought by the Demon Poison.

445
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,960
We mustn't let it

446
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,110
reappear

447
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,240
and wreak havoc on the people.

448
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,200
The most demonic thing

449
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
is a chaotic world.

450
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,310
The most evil thing

451
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,440
is human minds.

452
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,680
Don't be so pessimistic.

453
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,880
Eradicate anything

454
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,440
that threatens you.

455
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
I believe

456
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
you will forge your own path out

457
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,110
in this treacherous world.

458
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,920
I'm just a physician.

459
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,400
I can't bring the dead back to life

460
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,070
nor can I change anything.

461
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,550
You once said

462
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,830
that after avenging your family,

463
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,590
you will roam around

464
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,960
and be a nomadic physician.

465
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
Have you changed your mind?

466
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,590
I don't think

467
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,750
I can be as carefree as this.

468
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,790
What about you?

469
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,200
What's your next plan?

470
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,590
I want to find out

471
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,160
the murderer of Ji Feng,

472
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,830
who incriminated me.

473
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,680
This person is a threat

474
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,070
and must be eliminated.

475
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,270
What's next?

476
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,110
Keep Hua Qingge around me.

477
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
Can you win over her heart

478
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,350
even if she stays with you?

479
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,110
Qing has a knack for slipping off

480
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,510
like a pond loach.

481
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,790
I want

482
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,920
all of her.

483
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,200
Well.

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,070
Regardless of anything else,

485
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,480
we avenged ourselves today.

486
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,070
Let's drink to our heart's content.

487
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,310
Till I drop.

488
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,750
Come on.

489
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,240
What are you doing?

490
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,750
So secretive.

491
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,240
Be frank with me.

492
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,590
Are you Hua Qingge?

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
You found that out?

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,480
I knew I couldn't keep it
from you for long.

495
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,960
You're smart.

496
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,160
Of course.

497
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
Mother was so kind to you

498
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,920
when she invited us to the palace.

499
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,200
I know she wasn't pretending.

500
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm daft

501
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
if I couldn't tell that.

502
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,790
No, you're not.

503
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,200
You're the most intelligent

504
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,030
in my story.

505
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,510
What is that?

506
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,160
A slip of the tongue.

507
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,240
You're the most intelligent princess

508
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,790
in the royal family.

509
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,030
Don't trick me.

510
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,880
You've been keeping me in the dark.

511
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,920
I always see you

512
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,920
as my best friend.

513
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,440
It turns out

514
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,550
you're my third sister-in-law.

515
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,480
No.

516
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,270
I'm your best friend,

517
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,310
not your sister-in-law.

518
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,310
But even I can figure out

519
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,400
your identity.

520
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,440
Chu knew it

521
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,790
a long time ago, didn't he?

522
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,240
I don't care.

523
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
I won't admit it, anyway.

524
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,680
You're like an ostrich.

525
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,550
As a matter of fact,

526
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,070
I'm Hua Qingge,

527
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,480
but I'm not.

528
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,830
It's complicated.

529
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,510
As a matter of fact,

530
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,240
I can understand you,

531
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,590
but I can't.

532
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
It's complicated.

533
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,310
Smart girl,

534
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,400
are you doing this on purpose?

535
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,030
I thought

536
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,240
you were repulsive to Chu,

537
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,000
and you liked Yun.

538
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,920
No.

539
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,070
Absolutely not.

540
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,750
I wouldn't dare to think of that
about the finest guy.

541
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,480
Li Xiyao is his match.

542
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,960

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,110
Why are you looking at me

546
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,000
with your goo-goo eyes?

547
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,750
I'm supposed to be glad

548
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,590
to see you and Chu get closer.

00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,510

550
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,480
Where are we going,

551
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
actually?

552
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,270
Do we need

553
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,750
a destination?

554
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm taking a stroll.

556
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,440
A stroll?

557
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,750

He won't know
