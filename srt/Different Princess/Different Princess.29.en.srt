[Episode 29]

14
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,400
I thought Chu

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
would never

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,950
let his guard down

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,230
for any woman

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,790
until I came here

19
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,590
and learned that…

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Chu,

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,230
let's get married.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,560
If you agree,

23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,870
I will give the Fish-shaped Token to you

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,910
and help you get revenge.

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,430
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,280
I can't say yes.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,030
Why not?

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,870
Chu,

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,870
have you never even had

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,190
the slightest affection for me?

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,870
I've always had only one person

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,470
in my heart,

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Hua Qingge.

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,190
I understand.

35
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,960
I suddenly find myself

36
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,400
somewhat envious of Princess Consort Lv,

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
having a husband like you

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,120
by her side.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
You've got it wrong.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,590
Having her with me

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,750
is my blessing.

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,190
Nanyi,

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,630
I will get rid

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,590
of Prime Minister Li for you

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,360
and save you the trouble.

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
I believe in you.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
But I will still lend you

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
the Fish-shaped Token.

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,240
If it weren't for Qing,

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,750
I wouldn't have thought

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,430
Chu could be so upset

52
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,470
by a woman.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,910
It's good

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,030
that he can love someone

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,430
without reservation.

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,590
The ice around his heart

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,870
will thaw.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,430
Will it?

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
I think his pain and troubles

60
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,600
will only increase.

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
When it comes to seeking revenge,

62
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,390
you seem to be more
deeply entangled than him.

63
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,000
Can't you try to forget some of it?

64
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,950
How can one forget the pain

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,750
of losing one's entire family?

66
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,480
If only revenge

67
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,360
can bring peace to your heart,

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,750
then may you have it
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,560
One day, I will tear off
that woman's pretentious mask

70
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,000
and make her pay with blood

71
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,360
for her sins.

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm inebriated myself.

73
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,430
I'll leave Ji Chu

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,510
to you.

75
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,510
My eyes didn't deceive me.

76
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,560
My hands are fading.

77
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,390
Will I have

78
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
to go back soon?

79
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,480

This is no time

117
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,600
to cry.

118
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,750
I heard that a woman has arrived
at Prince Lv Residence.

119
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,480
She carries the Fish-shaped Token

120
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,080
that could threaten Liang's safety.

121
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,510
Qing,

122
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,790
before this woman stirs up trouble,

123
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,200
find an opportunity to bring me
the Fish-shaped Token.

124
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,670
Since Ji Chu is busy

125
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,670
with his wedding plans,

126
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,510
I won't bother him

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,670
with this trivial matter.

128
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,670
I can handle it myself.

129
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,600
Chu,

130
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
why do you look troubled?

131
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,240
Something must have happened.

132
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,270
You can fool the others,

133
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,600
but not me.

134
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,320
Chu.

135
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,750
Someone was here.

136
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
The Fish-shaped Token.

137
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,840
It's the empress's people.

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,240
But how did they manage
to bypass all guards

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
at Prince Lv Residence?

140
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,960
Why are you here?

141
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
If I tell you

142
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,080
I just happened to be passing by,

143
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,150
would you believe me?

144
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,870
Chu.

145
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,870
Take it out.

146
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,600
I…

147
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,360
Were you planning to hand over
the Fish-shaped Token to the empress?

148
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,670
Ji Chu, I can explain.

149
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,480
Xiao Yan.

150
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,750
I…

151
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,790
Your Highness.

152
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,030
Take Hua Qingge back to Anxiang Hall.

153
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,750
Until I say otherwise,

154
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,960
she is not to leave Anxiang Hall.

155
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,150
Yes.

156
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,600
Your Highness, I apologise.

157
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Xiao Yan,

158
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,150
how long will I be confined?

159
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,550
I don't know.

160
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
Will the empress resort

161
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,030
to other means to deal with Ji Chu

162
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,360
once she finds out I've been confined?

163
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,600
Ji Chu

164
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,120
caught Qing in action

165
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,910
and confined her?

166
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
I've always been worried

168
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,120
that Qing might have taken Ji Chu's side

169
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,510
and betrayed me.

170
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,030
But looking at it now,

171
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,550
her identity is clear.

172
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,480
At the very least,
she hasn't betrayed me.

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,750
Princess Consort Lv is,

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,630
after all, Your Highness' niece.

175
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,240
She must be inclined
towards Your Highness.

176
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,790
Unfortunately,

177
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,030
Qing's actions were too rash

178
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,750
and exposed her intentions.

179
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,790
She must have also lost

180
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,550
Ji Chu's trust.

181
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,910
All the years spent
cultivating her as a pawn

182
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,870
have been in vain.

183
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,200
Your Highness,

184
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,240
should we intervene
to help Princess Consort Lv?

185
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,270
If I act now,

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,670
it would be telling everyone
that I ordered her

187
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,480
to steal the token.

188
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
What should we do, then?

189
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,750
Just leave Princess Consort Lv
in a precarious situation?

190
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,120
Everyone has their destiny.

191
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,320
Considering that Qing is in trouble

192
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,600
because of me,

193
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,870
I can give it

194
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,360
one last try.

195
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,480
The outcome will depend

196
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,960
on her fate.

197
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,360
What about Yun?

198
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,000
Any developments on his end?

199
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,510
His Highness has shown
no recent activity.

200
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,390
All right.

201
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,000
It's time to give him a push.

202
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,400
[Prince Lv Residence]

203
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,150
I've always had my suspicions

204
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,320
about Hua Qingge.

205
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,630
As it turns out,

206
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,550
she did have ill intentions.

207
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Ji Chu,

208
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,320
no matter how good

209
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,630
your relationship was with her before,

210
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,120
she was always sent to you

211
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,840
by the empress.

212
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,360
I have already confined her.

213
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,630
I don't want her
to be too involved in this.

214
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,510
What's the matter with you?

215
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,550
Why are you still protecting her?

216
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,120
She has been caught
stealing the Fish-shaped Token.

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,910
Yet, you won't take this opportunity

218
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,360
to remove this piece

219
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,360
and instead let it remain by your side
as a potential threat?

220
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Gongye Qi,

221
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,840
I know what I'm doing.

222
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,550
Don't interfere.

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,000
There's another matter.

224
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,840
If Wan'er is getting married,

225
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,150
she should marry a good man.

226
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,840
You and I both know
Prime Minister Li's character.

227
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,030
He is definitely not a suitable match.

228
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,150
You can trust me

229
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,360
on this one.

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Whatever.

231
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,910
It's out of my hands anyway.

232
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,190
Ji Chu,

233
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,030
you have always been decisive
in your actions.

234
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,550
I hope you'll practice the same

235
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,200
when it comes to your personal relations

236
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,400
and not let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

237
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,030
You and I are different in that regard.

238
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
Revenge is important,

239
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,880
but there are things even more important

240
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,920
than revenge.

241
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,240
Mother,

242
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,310
are you feeling better?

243
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,920
Why did you suddenly fall ill?

244
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,200
I heard about what happened to Qing

245
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,160
at Prince Lv Residence,

246
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,030
and in a moment of anger,

247
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,640
I fell ill.

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,790
What happened to Qing?

249
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
It's all because

250
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,200
of my willful decision

251
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,590
to marry Qing to Chu

252
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,400
that she ended up in such a predicament.

253
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,270
It's my fault.

254
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,000
Mother,

255
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,200
what exactly happened?

256
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,550
Chu has given orders for Qing

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to be confined to Anxiang Hall

258
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,480
and not to take even a step out.

259
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,200
Perhaps

260
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,960
Chu is so cautious

261
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,400
because Qing is my niece.

262
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,480
Not only that,

263
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,310
there's a new woman

264
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,000
at Prince Lv Residence recently.

265
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,150
I heard she is Chu's love interest

266
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
from Nanjing.

267
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,590
Chu's love interest?

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,310
I've never heard of Chu

269
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,030
having a love interest.

270
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,550
This woman

271
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,110
is the First Princess of Nanjing,

272
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,750
Wei Nanyi.

273
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,310
Chu helped her ascend

274
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,350
to the position
of Empress Regent in Nanjing.

275
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm worried that Chu might want

276
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,310
to divorce Qing and make Wei Nanyi

277
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,240
his new princess consort.

278
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
But I've seen Chu's attitude

279
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
towards Qing,

280
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,550
and he seemed to genuinely care for her.

281
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,270
One can never know

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,790
a person's true feelings

283
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,030
unless you dig deep into their heart.

284
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,830
Mother,

285
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
I understand.

286
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,920
Chu,

287
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,240
Prime Minister Li knows
that I'm not in the palace.

288
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,110
I'm afraid he might take advantage
of the situation and make moves.

289
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
That's what I'm counting on.

290
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,400
This way,

291
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,680
we'll have a reason

292
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,070
to take them down in one fell swoop.

293
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,000
Why is that?

294
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,160
When I was in Nanjing,

295
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,240
I had already placed
my people around him.

296
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,310
The person by his side

297
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,750
is Prime Minister Li's

298
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,030
most trusted deputy.

299
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,310
He has a deep-seated vendetta
against him,

300
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,030
and now he has followers

301
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,030
willing to sacrifice their lives
for him.

302
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,480
Besides,

303
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
I have other backup plans.

304
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,400
You knew

305
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
this would happen even back then?

306
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,920
It was just a precaution.

307
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,790
Nanyi,

308
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,030
rest assured.

309
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,030
I promised to help you

310
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,270
eliminate Prime Minister Li,

311
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,440
and I'll do everything in my power.

312
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,960
Take Hua Qingge back to Anxiang Hall.

313
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,070
Until I say otherwise,

314
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,790
she is not to leave Anxiang Hall.

315
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Chu,

316
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,160
I know you have feelings for Hua Qingge,

317
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,110
but she did take the Fish-shaped Token.

318
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,350
Even so,

319
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,000
you don't believe

320
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,350
she's working for the empress?

321
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm just worried

322
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,240
that Qing is being manipulated by her.

323
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,750
Your Highness,

324
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,240
His Majesty demands your presence
at the palace at once.

325
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,550
Father, may I know the reason

326
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,070
you summoned me so urgently?

327
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,590
I heard that there were esteemed guests

328
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,590
at your residence.

329
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,920
I intended to turn a blind eye,

330
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,640
but officials have
repeatedly raised issues on the matter

331
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,240
and it is causing unrest in the court.

332
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,510
I did not anticipate

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,240
that me having guests at my residence

334
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,680
would cause such panic
among the ministers.

335
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
I would like to know

336
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,640
the concerns raised.

337
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,440
Yun,

338
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,680
tell him.

339
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,830
Wei Nanqing and Wei Nanyi

340
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,270
are not ordinary commoners.

341
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,310
Officials are concerned

342
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,310
that their purpose in coming here

343
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,440
may be to encroach upon Liang.

344
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,590
The ministers' worry is excessive.

345
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,350
The two of them are here

346
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,240
just to visit,

347
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,750
there is no cause for concern
about encroachment.

348
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,110
They both possess the Fish-shaped Token,

349
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,000
a symbol of military command,
and have been staying

350
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
at Prince Lv Residence
for an extended period.

351
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,920
This itself poses a threat

352
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,310
to Liang.

353
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,590
No wonder there has been frequent unrest

354
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,920
at my residence recently.

355
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,400
It seems someone baselessly fears them.

356
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,240
Enough.

357
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,000
Having rulers from other countries

358
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,240
staying in Liang
for such an extended period is,

359
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,920
indeed, a potential threat.

360
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,000
Chu,

361
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,480
if you want the officials to calm down,

362
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,880
it's best to send them away

363
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,270
as soon as possible.

364
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,200
Father,

365
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,030
Wei Nanyi saved my life

366
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,960
when I was in Nanjing.

367
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,110
Sending her away so abruptly

368
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,240
may appear heartless and ungrateful.

369
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,440
Father, grant me a few more days.

370
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,310
I will ensure that this matter

371
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,030
is handled properly.

372
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,510
Very well.

373
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,070
The last thing I want to see

374
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,680
is my two sons

375
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,440
not getting along.

376
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
We'll be sending off Wan'er
in a couple of days.

377
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,400
I want everyone to be smiling

378
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,270
at the send-off,

379
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,030
am I understood?

380
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,590
Yes.

381
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:24,750
Your Highness.

382
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,070
Your Highness.

383
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,750
You're the "officials", aren't you?

384
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,750
Myriads of flowers enchant the eye.

385
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,350
I only wish for the flower

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,240
to bloom elsewhere.

387
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,750
Ji Yun,

388
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,680
I won't go easy on you anymore.

389
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,200
Chu,

390
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,030
don't push me any further.

391
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,960
[Xuanze Hall]

392
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,160
Xiao Yan,

393
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
are you there?

394
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,920
I have to explain to Ji Chu.

395
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,200
Xiao Yan!

396
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
Xiao Yan…

397
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,240
Xiao Yan…

398
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,750
Pumpkin!

399
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,240
Can you get Ji Chu here

400
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,270
for me?

401
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,510
I'm not here to help you.

402
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,240
Then, you're here
to add salt to my wound.

403
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
I came to reprimand you.

404
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,350
I don't know what you did,

405
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,160
but it has made Father
so disappointed and angry

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,550
that he can't even eat.

407
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, it was my fault. My mistake.

408
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,240
So…

409
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,240
So I need to go out

410
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,480
and explain to him.

411
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,270
No.

412
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,680
Now is the perfect time
for my elder sister

413
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,510
to take advantage of the situation.

414
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,110
True.

415
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,440
You, little brat,

416
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
have never been a kind one.

417
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,680
Actually,

418
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,440
I came with something to tell you.

419
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,400
Ji Wan'er has been betrothed

420
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,830
to Prime Minister Li in Nanjing.

421
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,960
In a few days,

422
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,000
she will be departing for Nanjing.

423
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
How can that be?

424
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,030
You're lying, aren't you?

425
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,000
Believe what you will.

426
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,070
Even though you're incomparable

427
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,480
to my elder sister in every way,

428
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,310
at least your heart is still kind.

429
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,550
Her Highness and you were like sisters,

430
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,680
so I thought

431
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,110
you should know.

432
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,310
But

433
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,480
you're in a tight situation yourself.

434
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,070
I guess you should
worry about yourself first.

435
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,920
Then…

436
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Then, I'd better try.

437
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Pumpkin!

438
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,270
Pumpkin!

439
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,030
Why is my hand fading again?

440
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,590
I…

441
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
So, my hand was fading

442
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
because I have to return

443
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,960
to the world I came from.

444
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
But I don't want to go back yet.

445
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,750
I…

446
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,480
Your Highness, do you wish
to see Her Highness?

447
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
You've heard the maid.

448
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,310
Do you not believe Qing
is the empress's pawn

449
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
sent to get close to me?

450
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,240
I've been with Her Highness

451
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,110
for a while now.

452
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,920
Although Her Highness

453
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
often speaks nonsense,

454
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,200
her character is trustworthy.

455
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,000
Qing.

456
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,030
I know you're still awake.

457
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,070
Get up.

458
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,790
I'm the one who should be
feeling wronged.

459
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,440
What are you feeling aggrieved about?

460
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,440
Speak.

461
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,880
Because of your situation
with the First Princess,

462
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
Wan'er's marriage,

463
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,550
and…

464
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,680
And what else?

465
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,110
And the possibility

466
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,030
that we might be separated forever.

467
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,830
Don't cry, please.

468
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,680
I…

469
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,350
I've been by your side for so long,

470
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,310
and you still doubt me,

471
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,400
don't you?

472
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,960
Qing.

473
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,240
I don't want this either,

474
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,200
but…

475
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
I cannot make any wrong moves

476
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,270
when it comes to the empress.

477
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,110
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

478
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,480
Just go.

Am I going to leave this world again

481
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,440
so soon?
