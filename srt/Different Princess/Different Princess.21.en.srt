13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
[Episode 21]

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,680
Finally got rid of Mo Yu.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,350
I thought she was a veteran assassin

16
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,350
sent by Ji Chu.

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,400
I didn't expect

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,350
her to be a forcibly arranged fan.

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,120
Such a nightmare.

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,630
Is everything arranged?

21
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Everything is ready.

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
Great.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,150
Proceed according to the plan tomorrow.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,430
Yes.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Be careful while moving.

27
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,400
Yes.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
This is...

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,960
Gunpowder?

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,150
Why is this guy hoarding so much

31
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,190
gunpowder?

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,310
Oh, dear.

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,840
I thought Ji Chu

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,430
would become a man of virtue

35
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,520
after taking revenge.

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,400
I didn't expect him

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,190
to secretly plot something big.

38
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,190
Ji Chu has prepared so much gunpowder.

39
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,430
Whatever he's planning,

40
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,560
it's too dangerous.

41
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,870
I need to quickly destroy them.

42
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,750
Everything here

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,750
needs to be watched closely.

44
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,630
Tomorrow, it will be of great use.

45
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,160
I wonder what significant use
it will have.

46
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,360
Finally, His Highness
is going to take action.

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,630
Tomorrow, just make sure

48
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,600
they follow

49
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,510
His Highness's orders.

50
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,630
Yes.

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,040
They are going to take action tomorrow.

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,950
Isn't tomorrow

53
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,360
the tea party organized by Empress?

54
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,360
Oh my God.

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't tell me...

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't tell me that the end
is coming sooner.

57
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,830
Who is this?

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,430
Why does she dress like this
to enter the palace?

59
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,830
She probably wasn't invited.

60
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,070
Here you go.

61
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,160
Come.

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Is this your invitation?

63
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Yes.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,270
I am Lin Xiyao,
a coroner from the East Office.

65
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,390
A coroner.

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,190
This is really ominous.

67
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
What if this offended Empress?

68
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,430
Your Highness.

69
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,190
What should we do?

70
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,000
Exactly.

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,310
How can we allow such an ominous person

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,190
to enter the palace?

73
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,430
Could it be that the invitation

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
was stolen from some Young Lady?

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,600
Exactly.

76
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,430
I think so too.

77
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,270
Can I go in now?

78
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,270
Your Highness.

79
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,040
Miss Lin.

80
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,560
You come with me into the palace.

81
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,190
Yes, Your Highness.

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,430
This is...

83
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,310
How could this be?

84
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,390
How dare such a lowly and ominous person

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,270
try to cling to His Highness.

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
I will make her regret it.

87
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,190
Give it to me.

88
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Gongye Qi.

89
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,360
Darn, Gongye Qi.

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
Darn, Gongye Qi.

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,390
Is this flower bullying you?

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,950
Qing.

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
I intended to have Gongye Qi

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,190
attend this tea party

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,310
and introduce him to Mother.

96
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,070
However, he declined my invitation.

97
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,830
You two have just started
your relationship.

98
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,750
Meeting the parents so soon

99
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,480
can be a burden for anyone.

100
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,430
Besides, your family background

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,240
is quite intimidating.

102
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,480
That's true.

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,750
Where is Yao?

104
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,750
She's probably lost again.

105
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,680
I see.

106
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,040
I'll leave Yao to you then.

107
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,160
I have some important matters.

108
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,560
Hold on.

109
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Important matters.

110
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,600
What is it?

111
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,160
To watch over Chu.

112
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,270
Qing.

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,630
Your Highness.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,190
Where are you going?

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I'll go with you.

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Do you not need to be

117
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,510
with your sisters today?

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,190
No, no need.

119
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,510
My main task is to display

120
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,870
public affection with you, right?

121
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Affection is not a show.

122
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,070
Xiyao.

123
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,310
What took you so long?

124
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,550
And you came in these clothes.

125
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Didn't I tell you

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,030
to get dressed today?

127
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,360
A headless female corpse

128
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,320
case just occurred.

129
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,670
I finished the autopsy

130
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,670
and came in a rush.

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
There wasn't time to change.

132
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,270
Headless female corpse?

133
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,630
That's really frightening.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who is she?

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,790
Why is she sitting

136
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,960
in front of me?

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Exactly.

138
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,390
How dare an ominous person

139
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,440
join His Highness's blind date
and tea party?

140
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,270
It is a pipe dream.

141
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,600
Exactly.

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,390
His Highness's blind date?

143
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,750
Wan'er.

144
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,840
Why didn't you tell me

145
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,750
today is His Highness's

146
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,510
blind date?

147
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,750
If I told you, would you still come?

148
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,360
But Yao.

149
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,150
For today's tea party,

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,030
you are the one who should come.

151
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,630
As for the others,

152
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,790
they are just foils.

153
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,480
The Empress has arrived.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,270
Greetings to Your Majesty

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
and Your Highness.

156
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,960
Wishing Your Majesty and Your Highness

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,080
everlasting peace and prosperity.

158
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,790
Everlasting peace and prosperity.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,910
You may rise.

160
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,480
Yun.

162
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,870
Today, you must take a close look.

163
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,000
If there's anyone you find suitable,

164
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,200
you must let me know.

165
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,790
Do you understand?

166
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,670
Yes, Mother.

167
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,150
Qing.

168
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,240
You also keep an eye for your cousin.

169
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,960
Help him with his choice.

170
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,840
Aunt, rest assured.

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,910
Today, I will make sure

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
the future Crown Princess

173
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,200
that both you

174
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,030
and His Highness
are satisfied will appear.

175
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,200
Then I'll take your blessing.

176
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,910
Try this.

177
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,510
It's sweet but not too much.

178
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,870
This Ji Chu

179
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,000
is truly an expert
in displaying affection, isn't he?

180
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,320
All right, then.

181
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,750
As long as it can stop

182
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,080
the arch-villain from causing trouble,

183
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
I'll go ahead with
this public display of affection.

184
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,870
You're still so careless.

185
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,750
Hua Qingge, oh Hua Qingge.

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,790
Look at how pathetic you are.

187
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,550
Seeing Chu and Qing

188
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,600
so deeply in love,

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
I feel relieved.

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,870
Don't touch me.

191
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Your hands just touched a corpse.

192
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
It's so disgusting.

193
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
The Empress is here.

194
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,240
What's the fuss about?

195
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,960
Apologies, Your Majesty.

196
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,750
It's because a coroner who spends

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,480
the whole day

198
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,150
handling corpses
has infiltrated the tea party.

199
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,440
This has caused panic
among the young ladies.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,790
Coroner?

201
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Is there a coroner?

202
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,600
Lin Xiyao, the coroner
from the East Office,

203
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,960
pays respects to Your Majesty.

204
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,870
How did you get into

205
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,240
my tea party?

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
She was invited by me.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,750
Even if she is a friend

208
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,270
of Princess and Princess Consort Lv,

209
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,240
she's a

210
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,200
lowly coroner. With her attendance,

211
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm afraid Your Highness

212
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,150
and Your Majesty

213
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,790
might be tainted with ominous vibes.

214
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,080
Who said that my daughter's status

215
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,750
is lowly and ominous?

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,630
Duke?

217
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,150
Paying respects to Your Majesty.

218
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,200
Duke.

219
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,910
I remember you had a daughter

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,270
who was lost at the border
since childhood.

221
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,150
How did Miss Lin
suddenly become your daughter?

222
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,320
Lin Xiyao

223
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
is indeed

224
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,480
the daughter I lost many years ago.

225
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,670
That's right.

226
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,320
Yao is the Duke's daughter.

227
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
Duke.

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

229
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,200
Back then, I was fighting on the border.

230
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,440
Your mother brought you to find me.

231
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,150
But encountered bandits on the way.

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,790
Afterward, I searched everywhere

233
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,320
but only found your mother's body.

234
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,510
As for you,

235
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,000
there was no news of you.

236
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,600
A few days ago,

237
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
I just found out

238
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,790
that you were adopted by an old coroner.

239
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,320
Heaven has eyes.

240
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,360
Allowing me to regain what was lost
after many years.

241
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,200
Are you really my...

242
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,390
Xiyao.

243
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
I am your father.

244
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,870
Since the day I discovered

245
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,200
how much you resembled

246
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,910
your mother,

247
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,390
I've been investigating for a long time,

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,790
looking for an opportunity

249
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,030
to reunite with you.

250
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,600
Yao.

251
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,080
Duke.

252
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,240
Yao might not be able to take it

253
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,150
right away.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Allow her some time.

255
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,390
All right.

256
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,270
Yao.

257
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,360
I'll be at home waiting for you.

258
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,390
I didn't expect that this Young Lady

259
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,480
is actually

260
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,440
the daughter Duke lost many years ago.

261
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,270
Regardless of

262
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,870
whether Yao is Duke's daughter,

263
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,360
with her reputation

264
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
as the top female coroner in Shengjing,

265
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,270
she outshines you

266
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,080
who rely on comparing

267
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
family backgrounds.

268
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,200
Although there were some hiccups

269
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
at my tea party today,

270
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,120
helping Duke

271
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
with a match

272
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,000
is also a joyous occasion.

273
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,790
Miss Lin.

274
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,270
You are elegant and refined,

275
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,750
with outstanding abilities.

276
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,960
I really like you.

277
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,480
In the future, you should
come to the palace more often

278
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,200
and keep me company.

279
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,030
I thank Your Majesty for your favor.

280
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,360
Please rise.

281
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

282
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,790
Let the banquet begin.

283
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Secretary Du.

284
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,390
We've been searching for you for days.

285
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,870
We didn't expect you
to hide in the palace.

286
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,150
Your identity

287
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,000
is indeed not that simple.

288
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,240
Qing.

289
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,270
Wan'er will stay in the palace today.

290
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,790
You have to return
to the study room yourself.

291
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,390
Your Highness, don't worry.

292
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,120
My Princess Consort

293
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,550
will return to Prince Lv Residence.

294
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,360
Did you move back
to Prince Lv Residence?

295
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,320
Yes.

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
I just moved back not long ago.

297
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,550
In that case,

298
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,910
you should

299
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,360
treat Qing well moving forward.

300
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,960
You're joking, Your Highness.

301
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,390
I have great affection

302
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,510
for my own princess consort.

303
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,600
How could I not treat her well?

304
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,390
That's good.

305
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,750
You should worry about

306
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,270
your own marriage prospects.

307
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,150
By the way.

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Your Highness.

309
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,960
Could you help me

310
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,960
send Yao back?

311
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,200
You know about

312
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
her lack of direction.

313
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,270
Okay.

314
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,960
I will send her back safely.

315
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,480
Okay.

316
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,270
Goodbye.

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,270
Please.

318
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,200
I know you find it unacceptable for now.

319
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,750
But now having a family

320
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,550
is a good thing after all.

321
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,880
Perhaps you could...

322
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Actually, after my foster father
passed away,

323
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
I wandered

324
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
alone.

325
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,030
I've gotten used to being alone.

326
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
Suddenly having a family member

327
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,750
makes me feel unsure about
how to handle it.

328
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,640
I understand your feelings.

329
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,110
However, being alone for a long time,

330
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,400
eventually,

331
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,510
you need a stable place.

332
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,070
Thank you for sending me home today

333
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,400
and offering patient consolation.

334
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,960
You're welcome, Miss Lin.

335
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,560
Your Highness.

336
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,550
Actually,

337
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,200
you can call me Xiyao.

338
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,270
Okay.

339
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,510
Xiyao.

340
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,160
Your Highness.

341
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,240
I had no intention
of causing trouble today.

342
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,200
But I messed up

343
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,030
your blind date.

344
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,470
It's okay.

345
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,590
It was just

346
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,880
to appease Mother.

347
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,960
Your Highness.

348
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,750
I am curious

349
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
about what standards you have

350
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,350
for choosing Crown Princess.

351
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,480
Although there are no specific criteria,

352
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,310
I feel that it should not

353
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,310
be based solely on background.

354
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,590
Character is more important.

355
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,200
It would be even better if our interests

356
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,070
and aspirations align.

357
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
You are completely different from

358
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,070
other members of the royal family.

359
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,440
You are the greatest man in my heart.

360
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,270
You don't have to feel burdened.

361
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,070
It's just that I believe

362
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,880
liking someone
is not a one-sided matter.

363
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,070
Instead of hiding them,

364
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,480
it's better to openly express them.

365
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,680
Even if I get rejected,

366
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,030
at least there is a response

367
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,510
in this relationship.

368
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,000
It's better than it ending
without any closure.

369
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,960
You are also completely

370
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,550
different from other women.

371
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,750
I was in a blue funk all day,

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
guarding to prevent Ji Chu
from causing trouble.

373
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,750
Who would have thought that he was just

374
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,070
going after an easy target

375
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,030
and successfully caught Du Hui.

376
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,550
But

377
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,920
what is the black gunpowder

378
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,070
for?

379
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Today.

380
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,110
I have prepared a surprise for you.

381
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,350
Surprise?

382
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,070
What kind of surprise?

383
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,350
This...

384
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,550
What's going on?

385
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,880
Where are the fireworks?

386
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,350
So

387
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
those were fireworks?

388
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,750
What have you done again?

389
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,830
Perhaps.

390
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,030
Maybe.

391
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,350
I might have accidentally
ruined it again.

392
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,270
I thought

393
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
you were using it for something else.

394
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,440
So

395
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,590
you already know?

396
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,790
Know?

397
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,350
Know what?

398
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,400
I have

399
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,350
feelings for you.

400
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,550
What does this have to do

401
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,000
with me ruining the fireworks?

402
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,070
Whether you admit it or not,

403
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,640
what I want to get

404
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
has never been unattainable.

405
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,350
Princess Consort.

406
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,270
I am awaiting the good news.

407
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,160
Wan'er.

408
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,830
How do you pronounce this character?

409
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,000
"Shuo", and it refers to a long spear.

410
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
It's too difficult.

411
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,400
If I were born in ancient times,

412
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,110
I would definitely be bad at studying.

413
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,350
Qing.

414
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,200
What are you really looking for?

415
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,510
Totem.

416
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,400
But I've searched

417
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,200
all your books and haven't found it.

418
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,960
It's...

419
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,400
It's a totem

420
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,480
that looks like this.

421
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,750
Like this?

422
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,000
Why are you looking for a totem?

423
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,960
It's because I want to find out

424
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,830
who is trying to frame Ji Chu.

425
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,240
Why are you becoming
more and more concerned

426
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,590
about Chu?

427
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,510
That's because...

428
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,750
Because...

429
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,790
What?

430
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,590
It's not this book either.

431
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,880
What?

432
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,310
Qing.

433
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,310
No.

434
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,440
Which book is it exactly?

435
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,030
You've been at the East Office

436
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,070
for twenty years.

437
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,920
Who is the person who ordered you

438
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,640
to infiltrate?

439
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,590
Your Highness.

440
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,920
I have said many times.

441
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
There is no such person.

442
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,160
If you insist on forcing me
to make up someone,

443
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,030
then I'll have to

444
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,880
carefully select a candidate.

445
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,880
Why did you kill Prince Qi?

446
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,270
I've never liked him

447
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,110
as he is a good-for-nothing.

448
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,550
Why not carry out God's will

449
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,830
to eliminate a public threat?

450
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,790
How do you explain

451
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,510
your totem?

452
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Qing.

453
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,510
Though I don't know what the totem

454
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,000
you gestured means,

455
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,880
I have a solitary volume here

456
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,510
that records various patterns.

457
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,510
Take a look.

458
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,200
See if it helps.

459
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,640
What kind of weird symbols are these?

460
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
The symbols here come
from various places.

461
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Ancient divine knowledge

462
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
from Nanjing, Liang, Fuyu, and others

463
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,880
are all documented.

464
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,510
But they are just legends

465
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,070
and have no actual power.

466
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,160
This is the reason why

467
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,750
they framed me

468
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,750
and then attempted to assassinate me.

469
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,790
This?

470
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880
It's just a prank

471
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,550
for fun,

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,750
not worth mentioning.

473
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,680
You know you can't hide

474
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
from my eyes.

475
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,310
Your resistance

476
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
is just a matter of time.

477
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,790
Your Highness.

478
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,590
I've told you everything.

479
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,400
From my understanding,

480
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,160
you have always been
indifferent to fame and fortune,

481
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,270
focusing on scholarly pursuits.

482
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,880
Normally, a little fame and fortune

483
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,070
wouldn't tempt you.

484
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,790
But why were you eventually captured

485
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,830
in the palace?

486
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,920
I will uncover

487
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,110
the mystery behind this.

488
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,310
The Tiger Totem

489
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,110
symbolizes loyalty and bravery.

490
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,790
In the early days, there was
an assassin organization

491
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,550
in Fuyu named Tiger Totem,

492
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,310
but it disappeared for many years.

493
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,240
It disappeared for many years.

494
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,880
Why did they reappear,

495
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,200
kill Ji Feng,

496
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,000
and then frame Ji Chu?

497
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,640
Qing.

498
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,640
Look.

499
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,270
Are these two pictures very similar?

500
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,070
But upon closer comparison,

501
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,790
there are differences.

502
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
According to the book,

503
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,550
this totem

504
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,590
also comes from Fuyu,

505
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,030
symbolizing a life-and-death covenant.

506
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,790
It's called the Red Luan
Constellation Signs.

507
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Red Luan Constellation Signs?

508
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,200
Men and women
share their innermost feelings,

509
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,440
a pledge sealed with their lives.

510
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,110
Never leave or abandon each other.

[Prince Lv Residence]

512
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,880
How is it?

513
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,640
What discoveries have you made?

514
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,830
Du Hui comes from Fuyu.

515
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,200
Liang is a mix of various people,

516
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
with individuals from all walks of life.

517
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,170
This doesn't mean much.

518
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
What if I say

519
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,510
Du Hui is a strategist for Fuyu?

520
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Strategist?

521
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,160
A strategist in Fuyu

522
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
is a third-grade minister.

523
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,240
Since he is a strategist,

524
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,030
why did she come to Liang

525
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,920
and become a lowly secretary?

526
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,000
Could it be that he committed a crime
in Fuyu

527
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,200
and fled to Liang?

528
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,790
I don't know.

529
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,110
Xiao Yan.

530
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,310
Immediately send a message to Fuyu.

531
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Quickly search for the files
of all the strategists

532

533
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,160
Yes.

[Yin Yang Pisces.
Red Luan Constellation Signs]

535
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,350
The pattern on Du Hui's body

536
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,550
is very similar to the Tiger Totem

537
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,680
of the man in black.

538
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,590
However,

539
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,200
it is the Red Luan Constellation Signs.

540
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,830
Both of these patterns come from Fuyu.

There are subtle differences,

542

being falsely accused

553
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,200
is too unfair.

Helping you is one thing.
