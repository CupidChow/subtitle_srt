Wan'er sacrifice her happiness

238
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,910
like this.

239
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
There are so many things

240
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,390
I haven't said to her.

241
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,670
I did not even have the chance

242
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,630
to see her one last time.

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
Was that the last time

246
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,150
I will ever get to see Wan'er?

247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Stop crying.

248
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,440
If you want to see Wan'er,

249
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,550
I can take you to her.

250
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,870
Really?

251
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,120
When have I ever lied to you?

00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
Your Highness,

253
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,600
will Gongge come?

254
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Ru Jiao,

255
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,750
take another look at Liang.

256
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,910
After today,

257
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
we may never see our homeland again.

258
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,150
Your Highness.

259
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,600
Help me scoop up

260
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,870

I can take care of myself.

281

Don't worry.

282
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,830
He didn't come.

283
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,680

Is that why

323
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,750
you called me here?

324
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,350

325
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm going back.

326
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,240
Call me when you actually have
something to tell me.

327
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,920
Wait.

When you read this letter,

332
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
I will have left Liang forever.

333
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,310
Perhaps you may never read

334
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,830
this letter.

335
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,830
No matter.

336
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,440
It's been my greatest fortune

337
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,350
to have met you.

338
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,310
The first time we met,

339
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,160
my heart ached for days.

340
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,920
I didn't understand the feeling

341
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,200
at the time.

342
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,590
After going through many ancient texts,

343
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,550
I realized it was

344
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,550
the stirring of the heart,

345
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,640
the onset of love.

346
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,400
I know a way

347
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,830
to lift one's spirits.

348
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,440
Don't feel indebted.

349
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,680
Though you often

350
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,350
disguise yourself

351
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,440
with a carefree facade,

352
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,790
I know you are not

353
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,350
a heartless person.

354
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,110
You and I are like

355
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,270
Zhuangzi's dream of the butterfly.

356
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,920
You can't tell

357
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,960
whether Zhuangzi dreamed

358
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,680
of the butterfly

359
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
or if the butterfly willingly
transformed into Zhuangzi's dream.

360
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,790
No matter.

361
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,210
I have no regrets.

362
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,310
Dreaming with you was enough.

363
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
I am hurt.

364
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,590
My heart is hurt.

365
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,440
I am hurt

366
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,270
everywhere.

367
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,400
You, mediocre physician,

368
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,270
have to take care of me for a lifetime.

369
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
How does Your Highness spout
such romantic lines?

370
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
Did you learn them from books?

371
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,310
Whether the ending is happy or sad,

372
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,880
there's no avoiding it.

373
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,310
Best wishes.

374
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,070
From, Wan'er.

375
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,790
Wan'er,

376
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,960
if there is a life after this one,

377
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
I will not forsake you again.

378

[Xuanyu Hall]

379
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,240
Your Highness,

380
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
do you remember what day it is?

381
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,240
How could I not?

382
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,640
Today is the anniversary
of my mother's passing.

383
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,110
Imperial Concubine Xian,

384
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,960
today is the anniversary
of your passing.

385
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
I can't even properly

386
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,310
pay my respects to you.

387
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,590
Would you blame me

388
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,790
if you knew?

389
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,310
What's the matter?

390
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,070
Were you scolded by your father again?

391
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,240
Mother,

392
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,790
why is Father so strict

393
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,920
with me?

394
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,240
Because he has expectations for you.

395
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,200
Don't be sad.

396
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,310
Chu,

397
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,240
I will always be with you.

398
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,880
When the green willows sway,
play the diabolo.

399
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,960
When the willows wither,
play the jianzi.

400
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,550
When the willows lush,
play the spinning top.

401
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,880
When the green willows sway,
play the diabolo.

402
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,590
When the willows wither,
play the jianzi...

403
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,310
Demon!

404
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,960
Run!

405
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,070
Mother!

406
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,880
Mother!

407
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,310
Mother...

408
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,200
Ji Chu.

409
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,310
Ji Chu.

410
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Did you have a nightmare again?

411
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,790
I dreamt of my mother.

412
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,270
In the novel,

413
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
when Ji Chu had nightmares as a child,

414
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,510
his mother

415
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,480
would comfort him like this.

416
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,400
What?

417
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,880
Come here.

418
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,200
When the willows lush,
play the spinning top.

419
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:52,480
When the green willows sway,
play the diabolo.

420
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:59,350
When the willows wither,
play the jianzi...

421
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,240
Why do you know

422
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,960
this children's rhyme?

423
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:13,310
When the willows lush,
play the spinning top.

424
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,240
When the green willows sway,
play the diabolo.

425
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:31,550
When the willows wither,
play the jianzi...
