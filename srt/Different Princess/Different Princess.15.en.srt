His Majesty urgently
summons you both to the palace.

If anything

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,760
happens to Feng,

Prince Qi disappeared

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,350
from Rumeng House.

26

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,840

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm sure your second brother
will be fine.

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,080
Believe me.

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,000
How could you be sure?

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
How can I not be sure?

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,520
In the novel,

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,630
the strange disappearance
of Prince Qi, Ji Feng,

34
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,280
is set up by Ji Chu

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,680
because he wants to use Ji Feng

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,400
to bring down the Wei family completely,

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,400
but he doesn't

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
kill Ji Feng.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,750
I stood guard outside the door

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,630
and didn't go a step further.

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,190
After a long time,

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,310
the miserable cries of Prince Qi

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,960
came from inside the room.

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,430
Lady Wuxue,

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,750
don't catch me.

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,560
When I went after His Highness,

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,870
he was gone.

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,680
So,

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
I wonder

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,360
if Lady Wuxue's spirit

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
has captured His Highness.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,630
How dare you say that?

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,400
Lady Wuxue has been dead
for a long time.

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,430
Don't try to mislead the public here.

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,800
I am not speaking out of turn.

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,800
Including Prince Qi,

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,310
many young men have vanished

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,470
in the city.

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Vanished?

60
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,080
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,800
I think there's something strange
going on here

62
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,190
and it might have something to do
with Feng's disappearance,

63
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,310
so we need to investigate it thoroughly.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,750
You have a point.

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,430
I now appoint you
to lead the East Office.

66
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,400
Your Majesty,

67
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,080
it's vital to track down
Feng's whereabouts.

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,190
But I don't think

69
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,190
it's easy for Prince Lv

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,150
to track him down

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,430
since he's just returned to the capital.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,750
But the crown prince

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,150
has grown up in the capital

74
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
and is familiar with its topography

75
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,030
and environment.

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Besides, he's

77
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,120
very meticulous and strict.

78
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,430
He's the right man for the task.

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,840
Well...

Your Majesty,

81
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,520
I think

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,080
Imperial Consort Wei's concern

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
is justified.

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
The crown prince is better suited
to the task than I am.

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,190
The search for Prince Qi is urgent.

86

There's no time to lose.

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,800

to know

97
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,510
that Ji Feng's safe and sound.

98
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,560
Anyway, the Wei family

99
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
had it coming.

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,630
The pattern of this footprint

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,430
is a royal print,

102
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,510
so it must have been left by Feng.

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480

on the side of the cup

106
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,680

This powder seems

167
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,040
so ordinary,

168
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
it has no effect whatsoever.

169
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
On its own, it's harmless,

170

but if other substances
were added to it,

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
could it be hallucinogenic?

172
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,080
Of course,

After mixing it with other substances,
it's the famous

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,840
This poison

Good dreamers won't wake up

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
and I can't do much to help.

192
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm leaving.

193
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
You guys, go for it.

194
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,320
I've lost this game.

195
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,790
I'm just lucky.

196
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,910
No.

197
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,870
You can turn the tide

198
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,240
against the odds by thinking ahead.

199
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,390
You're the expert of strategy.

200
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,070
I'm impressed.

201
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,600
A game of weiqi is like a game of war.

202
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Plan before you act.

203
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,790
If you can show

204
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,750
the same spirit as in weiqi,

205
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,600
you'll be able to achieve great things.

206
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,150
Now His Majesty has been
under the influence of sycophants.

207
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,840
I've tried to advise His Majesty
many times,

208
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,870
but all my advice has been rejected.

209
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
There's no point in talking anymore.

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,440
The only way to get rid of sycophants

211
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,480
is to strike at the base

212
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,440
of the enemy

213
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,600
and uproot them.

214
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,670
Your Highness, you mean...

215
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,480
I've set up a plan.

216
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,360
I wonder if you

217
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,240
can be the one to finish it.

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,200
This is a good move,

219
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,480
it can turn the tide.

220
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm at your disposal.

221
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,270
I'll do my best.

222
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,240
Liu Xu saw Ji Feng

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,910
jump from the window,

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,120
but Ji Feng suddenly

225
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,840
disappeared without a trace.

226
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,480
If he had landed,
there would have been a loud noise,

227
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,670
but Liu Xu didn't hear it.

228
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,240
If he was held hostage...

229
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,790
Do you know

230
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
that most of the murder cases

231
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,480
of East Office

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,360
are due to curiosity?

233
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,670
And I still can't control my legs.

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I wonder how many lives
I have enough for me

235
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
to take the risk.

236
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
Forget it.

237
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,750
We should help out in any way we can.

238
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,000
Take things as they come.

239
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,000
My butt.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,480
Qing,

241
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,000
are you all right?

242
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,870
Why are you here?

243
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,030
I...

244
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,440
I was trying to take a shortcut,

245
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,550
but I didn't expect to see

246
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,200
a man fall from the sky.

247
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,550
I was trying to demonstrate

248
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,910
jumping out of a window,

249
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,840
but I didn't know I'd scare you.

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,870
There are only few straws on the ground,

251
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,080
it's killing me.

252
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,120
If there were more,

253
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,910
I could have been cushioned.

254
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,030
The mark of carriage.

255
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,750
I got it now.

256
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,440
The crooks used scary rumors

257
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,200
to abduct Ji Feng

258
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,870
in an attempt to distract the public

259
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
and cover up the truth.

260
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,670
Seriously?

261
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,390
Such an unintentional move

262
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,750
worked.

263
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,390
I'm really a genius.

264
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,910
Your Highness, you're so smart.

265
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,600
You're my lucky star.

266
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,870
Get up.

267
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
You're solving the case

268
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,360
as if you're being aided
by the gods, huh?

269
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,790
Oh, no.

270
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,440
How could I have forgotten

271
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,200
about this mean guy?

272
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,320
Did it go well with your assistance

273
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,750
in the investigation?

274
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,750
Yes.

275
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,120
It's going well.

276
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,630
That Qing alone is enough.

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,550
They don't need my help at all.

278
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,510
She helped them solve the case again?

279
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,510
Without her interference,

280
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,080
Ji Yun and the others
wouldn't have been able

281
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,390
to find the clues so soon.

282
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,630
They'd probably have gone

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,510
straight to the rescue by now.

284
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,150
It's all right.

285
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,790
It's just to speed up the process

286
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,270
so that Ji Feng suffers less.

287
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,790
It won't affect the overall picture.

288
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,480
No, I just don't get it.

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Why do you keep her around

290
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
when she's so close

291
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,030
to ruining our plans?

292
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,840
It's a stagnant pool of water.

293
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,080
Isn't it more interesting
to have something lively

294
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,510
to stir up the waves?

295
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,550
Chu,

296
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,270
I want you to keep in mind

297
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,790
that you're the one who's fishing.

298
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,550
I really don't want to come back

299
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,630
to this place of intrigue.

300
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,960
But Shengjing is a big city.

301
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,030
Where can I find Ji Feng?

302
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,910
So I'll have to ask Ji Chu.

303
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,480
Is everything done?

304
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,960
Yes.

305
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,550
Remember,

306
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,750
when it's done,

307
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,200
leave no one alive.

308
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Is that the order of His Highness?

309
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
It is my order

310
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,320
as well as His Highness'.

311
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,630
I got it.

312
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Oh my God.

313
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,750
In my plot,

314
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,910
Ji Chu doesn't kill Ji Feng.

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
But now...

316
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,910
This is bad.

317
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,840
The plot is getting
out of control again.

318
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,120
No way.

319
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,440
I have to find Ji Feng quickly.

320
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,070
[East Office]

321
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,820
Your Highness, Yao,

322
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,150
where are you going?

323
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,870
Did you get any leads?

324
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,510
We did find

325
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,390
a number of people missing
from the black market.

326
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,000
We're not sure if there's
a connection between them

327
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,200
and the disappearance of Feng,

328
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
so we're going

329
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,000
to investigate it.

330
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,630
Let's go.

331
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll come with you.

332
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,910
Qing,

333
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,030
we're not sure

334
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,440
if it's dangerous on this trip.

335
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,150
Miss Lin's right.

336
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,840
Don't come along this time.

337
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,550
I'm worried you'll risk your life.

338
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,550
What am I afraid of
with you guys around?

339
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,510
Besides,

340
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm your lucky star.

341
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,080
Take me with you, just in case.

342
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,790
Let's play it by ear, then.

343
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,200
Is that how you're going there?

344
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
If not, how?

345
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,200
I can do anything.

346
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,200
Qing,

347
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,920
can we find out

348
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
where Ji Feng is if we dress like this?

349
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,480
Believe me.

350
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
If we can get on

351
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,510
the labor team,

352
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,670
we'll find Ji Feng for sure.

353
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,030
Liu is here.

354
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,960
Hurry up.

355
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Hurry up. Come on.

356
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
Sir, I can eat and work.

357
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,480
Yes, me too.

358
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,070
Go over there.

359
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,590
Go over there.

360
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,070
Okay.

361
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,880
All right.

362
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,270
You, go over there.

363
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Oh my God,

364
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,880
Ji Yun and Lin Xiyao didn't get picked.

365
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,270
I'll be in trouble...

366
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,880
Go.

367
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,440
If I'm the only one picked.

368
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,160
Are you blind?

369
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,240
Yes, sir.

370
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,590
I was born blind.

371
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,160
You're picked.

372
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm blind

373
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,480
and can't move easily.

374
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
It's hard for me to work.

375
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,680
It's okay.

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,920
The buyer needs a blind servant,

377
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,480
so you'll just be there
and follow orders.

378
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,480
Let's go.

379
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,110
- Why did I pretend to be blind?
- Go.

380
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,790
Your Highness,

381
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,480
don't be impulsive and spoil the plan.

382
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,920
We can follow her secretly

383
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,920
to keep her safe.

384
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,070
Work hard

385
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,270
when you get to the site.

386
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,110
As long as you work hard,

387
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,830
you'll be fed and paid.

388
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,830
If you work well,

389
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
you'll be able

390
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,350
to build a house in your hometown
and get married

391
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,400
with a year's wages.

392
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,070
That's good.

393
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,350
I'll be able to have children, then.

394
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,110
That's great.

395
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,750
It will be a long journey.

396
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,790
Drink enough water
before you get on the carriage.

397
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

398
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,750
That's right.

399
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,590
You're so happy, huh?

400
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,680
We can go home and get a wife, then.

401
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,030
Come on, drink more.

402
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,680
We finally might
get to live a good life.

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,440
Thank you.

404
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,830
Drink more.

405
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,160
Thank you.

406
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,440
Thank you.

407
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,070
It's so good.

408
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,920
Specially scented red beans.

409
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
This is the mark left by Qing.

410
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,880
No, I can't wait any longer.

411
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,350
Gather all the spies

412
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,310
and conduct an intensive search

413
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
to find Feng as soon as possible!

414
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,270
No.

415
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,200
These spies

416
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,310
have been lurking in Shengjing
for many years.

417
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,590
Unless it's a critical moment...

418
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,240
Now is the critical moment!

419
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,550
Without Feng,

420
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,200
it's all for nothing!

421
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,830
But if it's exposed too soon,

422
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,790
it'll bring disaster

423
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,830
to our family!

424
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Sister,

425
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,750
please keep the bigger picture in mind.

426
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,880
Wushuang.

427
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,480
Pass on my orders with this token.

428
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
[Complete Essentials
for the Military Classics]

429
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,480
Your Highness,

430
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,510
an informant in the palace has reported

431
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,750
that Imperial Consort Wei
has made a move.

432
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,160
As expected.

433
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,590
This woman

434
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,590
will do anything

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,590
for her son.

436
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,590
Set it up

437
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,160
and wait for the fish
to fall into the net.

438
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,240
Hurry up.

439
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,270
Get to work.

440
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,110
Do you have a death wish?

441
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,480
Get up.

442
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Hurry up. I'm talking to you.

443
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,480
Come on.

444
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,830
Get to work.
Do you have a death wish?

445
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,310
Sir.

446
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,640
Sir.

447
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,000
This is a new batch of laborers.

448
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,480
Those in the carriage,

449
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,880
get down now!

450
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,550
Hurry up.

451
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,790
Those guys over there, don't get lazy.

452
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,070
Hurry up.

453
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,640
Hurry up.

454
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,680
Those in the back, follow the others.

455
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,510
Come on.

456
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,440
Quick.

457
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,960
This is the weapons camp

458
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,200
in my novel.

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,880
If nothing goes wrong,

460
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,680
Ji Feng should be locked up here.

461
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,830
I'll see who dares to slack off again.

462
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,510
Get to work.

463
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,480
Sir,

464
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,270
these laborers are very hard-working.

465
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,590
Please bring them to Mr. Xu.

466
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,160
You guys,

467
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,400
follow me.

468
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:05,750
Quick.

469
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,790
Go, come on.

470
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,480
Hurry up.

471
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,440
Quick.

472
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
You, follow me.

473
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,160
This way.

474
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,920
Go.

475
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,070
What are you two doing?

476
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,030
Come on.

477
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
Walk faster.

478
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,110
Seriously.

479
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,590
She's blind.

480
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,590
Sister,

481
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
what are you doing?

482
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,750
Who's your sister?

483
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
You've done

484
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,030
so many wrongs.

485
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Today, I'm going

486
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,200
to do justice.

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,030
Swordswoman!

488
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,030
Swordswoman!

489
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,830
Spare me, Swordswoman!

490
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,110
I thought

491
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,550
I'd quit

492
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,590
after this trip.

493
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
Quit?

494
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,880
I think you've made enough money.

495
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,350
Seriously.

496
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,400
There's nothing I can hide from you.

497
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,200
I've just been asked

498
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,030
to send

499
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
someone in.

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,590
Who is it?

501
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
Is it a young master?

502
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,350
Yes.

503
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,750
You've got a good head
on your shoulders.

504
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,160
Stop flattering me.

505
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,000
If you want me to spare your life,

506
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
you have to cooperate with me.

507
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,480
I promise

508
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,550
to cooperate with you.

509
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,590
Don't reveal my identity.

510
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,510
Otherwise...

511
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,400
What...

512
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,590
What is this?

513
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,830
The pill I gave you just now

514
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,440
is my secret

515
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,310
10-day intestine-breaking pill.

516
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,310
If you don't have
the antidote in ten days,

517
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,350
you'll be dead
with your intestines bursting.

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,350
Well...

519
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,070
How can I relieve the poison

520
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,030
after ten days?

521
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,750
Come to me after ten days
for the antidote.

522
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,200
Stop crying. Let's go.

523
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,790
Let's go.

524
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,270
Luckily, the old man
living next door to me

525
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,270
is blind.

526
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,270
I used to imitate him when I was a kid.

527
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,550
I didn't expect this skill

528
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,550
to come in handy.

529
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,680
It's always good to learn more skills.

530
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,550
Sir,

531
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
she's here.

532
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,440
Is this the person
who's going to be a maid here?

533
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,880
Yes, it's her.

534
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,680
She's blind and obedient.

535
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,830
It's good
that you get a blind girl here.

536
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
She can't leak any secrets.

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,830
I was born blind.

538
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,400
I can't see.

539
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,400
Follow me.

540
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,960
Let's go.

541
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,640
Gongge.

542
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,440
Are you looking for His Highness?

543
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,350
Yes.

544
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,110
I have something important to report.

545
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,920
His Highness is

546
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,640
having a medicinal bath in Lanting Pool.

547
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,480
Don't disturb him.

548
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,550
I can pass on the message for you.

549
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,030
Thank you, Gongge.

550
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
I've been informed

551
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,000
that His Highness and Miss Lin

552
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,790
have gone to the weapons camp
for investigation.

553
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,270
But Miss Qing

554
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,030
unexpectedly penetrated the camp first.

555
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,200
I wonder if it will

556
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,310
affect our plan.

557
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,310
They just want to save Ji Feng.

558
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,150
I don't think
she'll make much of a fuss.

559
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,480
Where exactly is Ji Feng?

560
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,880
Quick. I'm talking to you.

561
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,350
Hurry up.

562
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,070
Get to work.

563
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,110
Do you have a death wish?

564
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,680
I almost got caught.

565
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,510
That was close.

566
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,110
Hurry up.

567
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,350
Those guys over there, don't get lazy.

568
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,400
How...

569
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,510
What are you staring at?

570
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,550
Quick.

571
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,640
If you don't finish your work,

572
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,550
you won't get to sleep today.

573
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:10,920
Hurry up.

574
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,830
What are you doing over there?

575
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

576
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,160
How could I, Prince Qi,

577
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,590
end up in such a state?

578
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,160
Imperial Consort Wei

579
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,830
asked me to pass on a message to you.

580
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,070
"Without Mother,

581
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,750
without the Wei family's support,

582
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,750
how can you

583
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
compete

584
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,960
in this bloodthirsty palace?"

585
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,550
Mother,

586
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,510
at this moment,

587
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,200
I finally understand your words.

588
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,350
I'm as good as nothing

589
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,790
without my status as Prince Qi.

590
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,750
Mother!

591
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,920
Mother!

592
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,830
It's time

593
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,750
