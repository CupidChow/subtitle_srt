191
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,600
so he had another role to play.

192
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,270
Did you order Du Hui

193
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,360
to kill Feng?

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,240
So,

195
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
you've always taught me

196
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
to be generous,

197
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,870
kind and courteous.

198
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,670
Now,

199
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,870

201
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,600
I remember when I was little,

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,600
you punished me to copy

203
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
the sutra a hundred times

204
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,150
because I snatched
a piece of cake with Chu.

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,390
You told me

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
not to fight

207
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,910

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,840

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,630

and not to compete for anything.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120

213
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,240

Alright, Qing.

222

I trust you.

224
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,550

happened.

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,440
Why did you

227
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,910
call me here?

228
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,200
Miss Qing,

229
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,440
I do have a favour to ask of you.

to reflect the light.

240
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,080
You're the one who sprinkled

and Du Hui, aren't you?

242
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,670
And this.

243
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,390
It seems that you've been feuding
with Du Hui for a long time.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
Even if he wasn't in jail,

245
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,910
I'd still have to kill him

246
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,910

So much was written?

251
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,550
It's just a false impression

252
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,030
that the murderer was bullied
by Du Hui all these years.

253
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,840
Du Hui had a good reputation
in East Office

254

00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,420

Is it the one who killed Feng?

to tell me a story?

295
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,000
Not really.

296
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,070

297
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,310
you're from Fuyu,

298
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,880
so you must have heard many

299
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,480
stories about Du Hui.

300
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,990
Before he died,

301
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,070
he had some words for me
to pass on to his old friend

302
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,510
but I don't know

303
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,160
who to pass the message on to,

304
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,480

I'll leave you alone, then.

308

One insignificant detail

320
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,880
is enough to ruin

worked for a long time.

Father,

380
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,590
That's my job.

381
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,590
I know.

382
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
But look at me,

383
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm getting older.

384
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,750
We'd been separated for years,

385
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,790
and now you don't even have time

386
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
to spend with me.

387
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,070
I'll have even less chance

388
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,440
to see you

389
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,400
when you get married, won't I?

390
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,480
Father,

391
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,830
I don't want to get married.

392
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,790
Your mother's wish

393
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,480
was to see you get married.

394
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,550
I hope you will find
a good husband, too.

395
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
If you don't get married,

396
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,830
your mother

397
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,790
will blame me.

398
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,680
Yao,

399
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,110
listen to me.

400
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,270
Just stay at home

401
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,680
and keep me company.

402
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,590
I'm fine with not going to East Office
for the time being,

403
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,070
but getting married...

404
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,240
Yao, don't worry.

405
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,400
I'll make sure to get you

406
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,200
the best match possible.

407
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
Why are you here

408
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,640
to see me this time?

409
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Your Highness, I'd like
to get closer to you

410
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
by marriage.

411
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,830
You mean

412
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,240
you want me to marry your daughter?

413
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,350
Ji Chu is going to marry Yao?

414
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,790
Sooner or later, the crown prince
will ascend to the throne,

415
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,510
so if you make your daughter
the crown princess,

416
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,480
she will be

417
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,830
the new empress of Liang.

418
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Wouldn't this

419
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,000
be a better arrangement

420
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,000
for Lin Xiyao?

421
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,550
That's true,

422
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,310
but I've learned about

423
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,440
your ambition from

424
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,200
the game of chess.

425
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,880
And with the case of Wei Zhao,

426
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm even more impressed by you.

427
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,110
That's not a sure thing
who's going to be

428
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,240
the final winner.

429
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,590
It had been hard for Ji Chu

430
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,920
to get Duke on his side.

431
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,240
Now that Duke is making a demand,

432
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,510
Ji Chu won't

433
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
really agree to it, will he?

434
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,750
Your Highness,

435
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
It's in

436
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920
your best interest.

437
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,200
If you marry my daughter,

438
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,550
you'll be

439
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,590
related to me by marriage.

440
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,440
Then, Dingguo Army

441
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,960
will be

442
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,640
in your hands as well.

443
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,240
You are using Lin Xiyao
as a bargaining chip?

444
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,070
That's not true.

445
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,680
Yao is my beloved daughter.

446
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,830
I just want her

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,070
to live a carefree life.

448
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,200
So if my daughter marries you,

449
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,400
I want her to be Princess Consort Lv.

450
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,240
He's making me give away my position?

451
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,750
However, I'm not good enough

452
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,200
to be Princess Consort Lv.

453
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
I appreciate

454
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
the offer,

455
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,350
but I'm sorry I can't accept it.

456
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,960
Why?

457
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,240
I already have a wife.

458
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,790
Ji Chu gave up

459
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
getting Duke's support for me.

460
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,310
Then, I shall not bother you any longer.

461
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,160
You should come out now.

462
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,920
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

463
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,080
You heard everything?

464
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,510
But

465
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,400
why did you turn down

466
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,640
such a good opportunity

467
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,350
to get Duke's support?

468
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,960
I won't do anything

469
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,270
that will hurt you.

470
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,240
