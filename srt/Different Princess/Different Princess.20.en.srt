Thank you, Miss Qing.

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,510
Why are you smiling?

197
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
My wife knows me the best.

198
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,030
Who are you calling your wife?

199
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,790
It's all fake.

200
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,840
You know that, right?

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
Are you not scared of deceiving
His Majesty anymore?

202
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,960
I have a way

203
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
to solve this once and for all.

204
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
What is it?

205
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,080
What do you think of making it real?

206
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,870
You don't have a fever.

207
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,240
Why are you talking nonsense?

208
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,200
The arch-villain

209
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,390
is so charming.

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Only I can handle it.

211
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,000
Anyone else

212
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,670
wouldn't have been able to handle it.

213
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,950
[East Office]

214
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,260
Come on. I'll take you to the market.

215
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,670
No thanks.

216
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,510
I have an appointment with Wan'er and Yao.

217
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,510
Don't forget.

218
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,080
To others,

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
you're still Princess Consort Lv.

220
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,270
But we have something important

221
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,670
to do tonight.

222
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,670
You have to promise
not to cause trouble.

223
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,600
When have I...

224
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,240
Fine.

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,630
Do whatever I say tonight.

226
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,480
You can do it,

227
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,150
can't you?

228
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Yes.

229
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,600
There's so many people.

230
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,440
It's because today

231
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,200
is the annual Mid-Autumn Festival.

232
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,270
Mid-Autumn Festival represents reunion.

233
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,120
It is said that if two lovers

234
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,150
complete the moon worship ceremony

235
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,510
today,

236
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
they can be together

237
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,480
forever.

238
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
Mid-Autumn Festival is the day

239
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,200
when my male lead and female lead
confess their love.

240
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,200
Wan'er and I have separate plans

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,910
to make

242
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,870
Yao and Ji Yun's romance

243
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,240
on track tonight.

244
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,550
Let me show you over there.

245
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,790
Let's meet up with Wan'er.

246
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,270
Hurry up.

247
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,630
We'll be too late if we take our time.

248
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,240
What's the hurry?

249
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,630
Your Highness.

250
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
What a coincidence.

251
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,480
Secretary Du.

252
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,120
Sometimes, it's a blessing

253
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,670
not to get what you want.

254
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,750
Secretary Du, it seems

255
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,670
you've experienced the same thing too.

256
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,150
I think I've been here before.

257
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
How did I end up here again?

258
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,630
Where should I go?

259
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,630
Is it you, Miss Lin?

260
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,200
Why do you like
the outside world so much?

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,790
People in the outside world
are friendly.

262
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,910
It feels warm.

263
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm afraid of the cold.

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,670
That statement

265
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,960
makes us doctors feel bad.

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,670
Young Master and Miss.

267
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,030
We're missing one last couple

268
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,670
in our searching game.

269
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,910
Would you two like to join?

270
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,830
The two of us?

271
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Here. This way, please.

272
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,510
Sure.

273
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,510
Thank you, Duke.

274
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,750
Miss Lin, I didn't expect you

275
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,030
to not know your way.

276
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,240
I've always done that since I was a kid.

277
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,240
My late wife had this problem too.

278
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,390
But I find it

279
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,510
adorable.

280
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,320
I vaguely remember

281
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,750
my mother doing the same.

282
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,670
It could be genetic.

283
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
She has a lot in common

284
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
with my lost daughter.

285
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
Could she be...

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,550
Our game

287
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,700
requires the men

288
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,750
to observe the ladies' hands

289
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,510
to find their partners.

290
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,270
The first couple

291
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,360
to find each other
within the allotted time

292
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,240
will win a unique

293
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
crescent prize.

294
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,030
Ladies,
please stretch out your left hand.

295
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,550
The game begins.

296
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,960

I'm sorry, Miss. I held the wrong lady.

301
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,630
You held someone else's hand.

302
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,320
Once more.

303
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,150
You don't love me at all.

304
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,600
How can you get a second chance?

305
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,440

How come I don't see any of them?

315
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,750
By the way,

316
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,320
Where's

317
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,150
the crescent token...

318
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,000
I think I've seen it

319
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,870
on our way here.

320
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,150
Over here.

321
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,750
Let's go.

322
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,790
Here. Congratulations.

323
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,750
Please take it.

324
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
It's pretty.

325
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,830
How did you recognize me just now?

326
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,240
I took your pulse before,

327
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,030
so I remember your hand.

328
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,550
Are you so sure

329
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,590
just because of that?

330
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,200
Also,

331
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,590
you've always spent time reading.

332
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,680
Your fingers smell like book pages

333
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,000
and are unique.

334
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,830
Oh, no.

335
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,830
I forgot I had a date today

336
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,750
with Yun and Xi Yao

337
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,680
to set them up.

338
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,480
Let's go.

339
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Miss, your lantern.

340
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,750
Thank you.

341
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,960
Goodbye, Your Highness.

342
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,030
Why did it fall?

343
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,790
Yes.

344
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,790
That was a close call.

345
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
It almost hit him.

346
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,550
It's a good thing this guy is skilled.

347
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,750
How shocking.

348
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,400
Let me check.

349
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,030
It's epilepsy caused by seizures.

350
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,790
He's cured.

351
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,510
He's a miracle doctor.

352
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,400
It was a false alarm.

353
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,160
Yes.

354
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,310
- All that matters is that he's fine.
- He's good.

355
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,480
Why did a civil official
like Secretary Du

356
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,030
have such skills?

357
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,790
Your Highness!

358
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Qing?

359
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,830
Where's Yao?

360
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm here.

361
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,030
Sorry.

362
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,240
I got delayed

363
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,510
because something
happened on my way here.

364
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,030
Did you lose your way again?

365
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,750
Where's Wan'er?

366
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,480
How dare you?

367
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,030
Do you know who I am?

368
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm...

369
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,750
Do you know

370
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
we're going to have

371
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
the moon worship ceremony soon?

372
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,550
Don't come over!

373
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,510
I'm telling you.

374
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,070
After the moon worship ceremony,

375
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,350
we'll be together

376
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,030
forever.

377
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,480
No one can stop me

378
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,960
from marrying my wife.

379
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,000
What...What happened to him?

380
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,400
Beg to Die needle.

381
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,110
It'll make him wish he was dead.

382
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,070
Are you alright?

383
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,960
Gongye Qi.

384
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,110
I was so scared.

385
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,070
I knew you'd come for me.

386
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,960
The royal family and the Su family﻿

387
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
have a blood feud.

388
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I can't do this.

389
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,640
Your Highness.

390
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,400
Please behave yourself.

391
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
I know...

392
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,510
I know you like me.

393
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Your Highness.

394
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,270
You misunderstood.

395
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,070
Then why won't you look at me?

396
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,240
So...

397
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,350
So it's because

398
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm a princess,

399
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,160
isn't it?

400
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,870
We're

401
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,110
not right for each other.

402
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,400
I...

403
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,310
I can ask Mother

404
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,240
to give us her blessing.

405
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,240
I can even give up

406
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,310
being a princess.

407
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,110
You

408
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't care about

409
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,310
identity.

410
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,350
If I can be

411
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,270
with the person I like,

412
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
I'm content with

413
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,310
being an ordinary person.

414
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,270
Where did you hurt yourself?

415
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,830
Is it your leg?

416
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm indeed hurt.

417
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,200
I'm heartbroken.

418
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm hurt

419
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,590
everywhere.

420
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,510
You have to

421
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,790
take care of me forever.

422
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,200
Why are you so good
at saying sweet nothings, Your Highness?

423
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,960
Did you learn it in books?

424
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,110
No.

425
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,960
I learned it from Qing.

426
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,510
Qing said

427
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,880
it's called flirting.

428
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Why are you laughing?

429
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,240
Anyway...

430
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,400
Anyway, I'm hurt.

431
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,240
Everywhere

432
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,920
hurts.

433
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,480
I'm going to cling to you like this

434
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,550
forever.

435
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,350
Since I've gotten my revenge,

436
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,270
can I

437
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,750
live as I please?

438
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,390
♪I can't help being in love with you♪

439
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,650
♪Love is an absurdity♪

440
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,370
♪That repeats the illusion♪

441
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,940
♪I'm still yearning♪

442
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,640
♪Love eventually gets me lost♪

443
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,020
♪Saddened by the fading of love♪

444
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,290
♪I'm left with a dream♪

445
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,150
♪Why do I still wish♪

446
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,640
♪I could spend
the rest of my life with you?♪

447
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,400
You hurt her.

448
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,240
The damn plot has gone wrong again.

449
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,310
The male lead and female lead
missed each other.

450
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Ji Wan'er and Gongye Qi

451
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,830
sped up their relationship instead.

452
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,310
Unintentional actions
brought unexpected success.

453
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,680
Chu.

454
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,640
Qi and I

455
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,480
have decided

456
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,110
that we want to be

457
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
together forever.

458
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,400
I disagree.

459
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,680
Why?

460
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,790
Aren't you best friends?

461
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,440
Knowing you two,

462
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,160
I know you're not a good fit
for each other.

463
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,350
It's not...

464
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,640
It's not up to you

465
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,400
to decide
whether we're fit for each other.

466
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,750
Can you really let it go?

467
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,270
I can give it a shot

468
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,510
for Wan'er.

469
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,310
This isn't going to end well for you.

470
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,880
Chu, you...

471
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,830
No matter what happens,

472
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,750
he's the only one I want to be with.

473
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,960
Have you watched enough?

474
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,350
Gongye Qi is willing to give up

475
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,000
his prejudice and hatred
for the royal family for Wan'er.

476
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,200
Why won't you

477
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,160
give them a chance?

478
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,440
Alright.

479
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,240
I can give them a chance.

480
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,240
But you're moving back
to Prince Lv Residence.

481
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,790
What does this have to do with me?

482
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,790
You're being unreasonable.

483
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,000
I've always been this way.

484
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,240
Fine.

485
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,790
For Wan'er's happiness, you have a deal.

486
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,440
Hua Qingge.

487
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,270
What do you want?

488
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,750
You finally admit it.

489
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
My princess consort.

490
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,030
I'll be waiting for your return.

491
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,590
He tricked me.

492
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,920
Is he still going to kill me?

493
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,960
Welcome back, Princess Consort.

494
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,240
If there's anything you need,

495
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,400
just tell the servants
to take care of it.

496
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,240
You're the mistress of this residence.

497
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,830
You can arrange

498
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,790
however you want

499
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,240
with the food and clothing.

500
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
Just keep it as usual.

501
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,790
This... This is way over the top.

502
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,200
Princess Consort.

503
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,070
Yes.

504
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,070
Mo Yu will continue

505
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
to be your escort.

506
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,310
Just let her know

507
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,030
if you need anything.

508
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,030
With an expert like her

509
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,960
following me around,

510
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,310
is she serving or watching me?

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,240
Hello, Mo Yu.

512
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,480
Long time no see.

513
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,270
Princess Consort.

514
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,240
You should

515
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,880
say that to His Highness.

516
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,310
I'll come back and spend time with you

517
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,160
after I finish work at East Office.

518
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,510
Be careful.

519
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,160
Duke.

520
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,680
We found out

521
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,960
Miss Lin
often visits this dumpling stall.

522
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,440
Madam.

523
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,350
Give me a bowl of dumplings.

524
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,880
Miss Lin.

525
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,510
You haven't been here in a while.

526
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,000
I just finished a case.

527
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,240
Have a seat.

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,240
Good day, Duke.

529
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,550
No need for courtesy.

530
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,270
Here, sit.

531
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,480
Yes.

532
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Are you here for dumplings?

533
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,640
Yes.

534
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,200
Enjoy, Miss.

535
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,070
Few people eat dumplings

536
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,160
with so much chili.

537
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,590
I've loved spicy food since I was a kid.

538
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,680
You're just like my daughter.

539
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,550
She loves dumplings

540
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,790
and spicy good.

541
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,270
Why don't you buy her some dumplings

542
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,030
when you go home?

543
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,310
She has been separated
from me for years.

544
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,400
If she grew up safely,

545
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,960
she'll be about your age.

546
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,750
I didn't mean to

548
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,030
bring up such a sad incident.

549
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,510
It's alright.

550
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,070
If you're really my daughter,

551
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,590
I wonder if you'll accept me,

552
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,880
a father who hasn't done his job

553
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,550
for years.

554
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,160
Your Highness.

555
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,510
Did Prince Qi's killer confess?

556
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,350
Yes.

557
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,240
It's as you described.

558
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,590
Shall we convict him?

559
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,160
Something's wrong if he confessed.

560
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,110
I don't understand.

561
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,030
He's probably just a scapegoat.

562
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,400
Did Secretary Du write this dossier

563
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,310
20 years ago?

564
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,880
Yes.

565
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,830
All the dossiers about missing women

566
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,790
during Mid-Autumn Festival every year

567
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,640
were recorded by Secretary Du.

568
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
The case dates back

569
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,510
as far as 20 years.

570
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,070
Look, Secretary Du's writing

571
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,070
in the dossiers 20 years ago

572
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,590
is stiff.

573
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,590
20 years later,

574
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,070
his writing is elegant and smooth.

575
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,440
Is it possible

576
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,680
that Secretary Du isn't from here,

577
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,110
or...

578
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,240
And Secretary Du's very skilled.

579
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,310
He's suspicious indeed.

580
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,880
I hurt Secretary Du hurt his arm.

581
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,070
And he just resigned.

582
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,310
All the signs

583
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,790
make him more suspicious.

584
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,590
You have nothing to worry,
Your Highness.

585
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,750
I'll investigate it.

586
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,200
Father ordered you and me

587
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,030
to work together on this case.

588
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,270
Feng was killed.

589
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,480
How can I not take it seriously?

590
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,590
You're already helping me

591
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,960
by not suspecting me.

592
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,590
Has Du Hui left the city?

593
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,440
He has handed over his work,

594
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,030
but he hasn't left the city.

595
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,350
I wonder what he's up to next.

596
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,830
Send someone to spy on him.

597
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,440
Don't alarm him.

598
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,750
We must lure out whoever's behind this.
