00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,440
I'll pick a better day to come.

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah.

192
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,670
It is you.

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Why are you pulling this prank on me?

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
This is so out of your character.

195
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,790
What is in my character, then?

196
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,080
You've had a lot to drink?

197
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,670
Although I know qinggong,

198
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,150
but this is just too high.

199
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Didn't you just

200
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
get your revenge?

201
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,910
You shouldn't be killing now.

202
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,080
You

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
know everything, don't you?

204
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,840
That's a blind guess.

205
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,910
Did...

206
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,630
Did you get revenge for your mother?

207
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,440
I see, we can see the palace
from up here.

208
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,440
Look at this bitter-looking face,

209
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,480
it doesn't seem like
he's gotten his revenge.

210
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,150
Did something

211
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,200
happen unexpectedly?

212
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,390
That can't be it, no?

213
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,360
You didn't bring me up here

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,840
just to look at some scenery, right?

215
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Just be quiet.

216
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
I did want

217
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,870
to leave quietly.

218
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,240
But

219
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,480
at this height,

220
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,840
I, your wife, can't possibly do it.

221
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,510
Are you owning up

222
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,750
to your identity now?

223
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,000
What? I am not.

224
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,240
You're no fun.

225
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,440
You are so far away from home,

226
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,790
do you miss it?

227
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
I do,

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
but what can I do?

229
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
I can't get home.

230
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,150
I used to be like you,

231
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,510
but there's no point being back here.

232
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,150
You are actually further away from home.

233
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,270
Did you come back just to seek revenge?

234
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,390
Should I not seek revenge?

235
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,550
But there is more to life

236
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,270
than just seeking revenge.

237
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,200
What is of utmost importance
to you, then?

238
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,510
To be alive.

239
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,080
Will you do something against your will

240
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,320
to keep yourself alive?

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,840
Although I'd hate to admit it,

242
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,150
I have done many things against my will

243
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
to save myself.

244
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,030
I am not a saint,

245
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,080
so I can't take care of everyone.

246
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
I can only save myself.

247
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,550
It's the same

248
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,910
for me.

249
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,440
To have spent a few more years

250
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,240
with my mother,

251
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,790
that was the most important thing to me.

252
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,960
Everything else is not important.

253
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,840
That is why

254
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,840
I would rather resort to any means
to achieve my goal.

255
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,440
At first, I only wanted to give him

256
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,960
a motive to plot revenge.

257
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,030
I have never thought

258
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,870
of the pain caused

259
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,600
by his miserable life circumstances

260
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,240
that would affect his life.

261
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,080
I know now.

262
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,150
There is no hatred without a reason,

263
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,670
nor is there evil without a cause.

264
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,750
Actually,

265
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,870
the longer I am up here,

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
the less scary this feels.

267
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,320
This view looks pretty good.

268
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,120
Your Highness?

269
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,510
Why are you following me?

270
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,240
I...

271
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,440
I would like to ask you for a favor.

272
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,030
My second brother was startled

273
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,150
and has been on his sick bed for days.

274
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,750
Would you take a look at him for me?

275
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,600
No.

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Why?

277
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,630
I have people whom I refuse to cure.

278
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,240
No one can convince me otherwise.

279
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,240
Stop following me.

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,030
You have principles.

281
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,670
Very well.

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,240
I know a way

283
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,870
to turn one's mood around.

284
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,870
Don't ask me why I knew

285
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,870
you are unhappy.

286
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,510
There are four words

287
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,840
written on your face.

288
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,030
I'm angry,

289
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,600
disturb not.

290
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,960
Why do you do the exact opposite, then?

291
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,360
Indeed.

292
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,840
Sometimes people know

293
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,440
that they don't need to get angry,

294
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,320
but they still can't help it.

295
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,200
If you didn't irritate me,

296
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,150
I wouldn't have gotten angry.

297
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,630
I tried to explain,
but you wouldn't hear me out.

298
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,840
Look!

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,030
Don't disturb the lovebirds.

300
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,030
Come home with me.

301
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,200
You gave me a scare.

302
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,510
You

303
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
were looking for me?

304
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you.

305
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,390
You've had too much to drink too?

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,510
No.

307
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,150
I don't drink at all.

308
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,630
Why are you thanking me, then?

309
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,350
Thank you

310
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,550
for accompanying

311
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,510
His Highness

312
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,960
when he was at his lowest.

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
I was forced to do it.

314
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,440
That's because he has control over

315
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
the life and death of others.

316
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,640
His Highness

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
isn't as blood-thirsty as rumored.

318
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,590
He never kills the innocent.

319
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,880
Really?

320
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,350
Then why did I hear

321
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,830
from those working in his residence

322
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,400
that the servants and the wet nurse

323
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,590
who came with the consort

324
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,790
were killed by him?

325
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,790
Who said so?

326
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,680
They committed suicide.

327
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,400
Suicide?

328
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,000
What is the reason that Hua Qingge

329
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,400
marry into Prince Lv Residence?

330
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
It is clearly
for the diplomatic relations

331
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,240
between Fuyu and Liang.

332
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,830
It's a marriage alliance.

333
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,110
If it is a marriage alliance,

334
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
why did she leave both of you

335
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,830
and run away?

336
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,880
Speak!

337
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
Where did Hua Qingge run away to?

338
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,640
You can kill us if you want,

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,030
but we won't say it.

340
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,030
Take them away for interrogation.

341
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,550
Are you telling the truth?

342
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,030
Every single word of it.

343
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,680
If they were killed by His Highness,

344
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,160
there is no need
to explain himself at all.

345
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,590
He never cared

346
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,680
about his reputation.

347
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,270
That is true.

348
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,830
His Highness does not bother
to explain himself.

349
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,160
That is why

350
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,440
he's bearing this reputation
as a bloodthirsty man.

351
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,640
When I got back hurriedly,

352
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,440
I only saw the outcome

353
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,750
instead of the process.

354
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,790
Could it be that
I blamed Ji Chu wrongly again?

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,830
So he isn't as bad as I thought.

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
There is still hope for him.

357
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Qing,

358
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,790
what are you looking for?

359
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,070
Do you have

360
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,550
books that can help purify one's soul?

361
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,000
Soul-purifying?

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,830
The Great Compassion Mantra?

363
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
No.

364
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,030
Not that.

365
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
It's the kind that
tells stories of the good people

366
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,790
which moves hearts

367
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
and touches the whole nation.

368
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,920
It promotes truth, kindness and beauty,

369
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,160
and sets good examples.

370
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,200
I am considered well-read,

371
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,960
but the books that you just described,

372
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,830
I have never come across any.

373
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
Would I be required

374
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
to write one myself?

375
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,240
That can't work.

376
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,400
I don't have enough time.

377
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
I got it!

378
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,160
Mindfulness Club.

379
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,030
What does 'mindfulness club' mean,

380
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,590
Qing?

381
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
We can play interactive games

382
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,070
or role play

383
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,510
to narrate one's inner self

384
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,680
and get emotional guidance.

385
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,920
Hold on.

386
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
It sounds too complicated,

387
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
but you will get it after this.

388
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,550
Let's go and check it out.

389
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,070
It's the murder case
of Mr. Liu and his daughter.

390
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,270
They will be beheaded in the afternoon.

391
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,680
I heard that the crown prince will
see to it himself.

392
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,350
Hurry and go.

393
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,920
Let's go.

394
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,830
Let's go now.

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
We'll go check it out too.

396
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,110
Quick.

397
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,110
That is

398
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
how it is going to end?

399
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,030
Come. Let's go together.

400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm coming too. Let's go.

401
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,790
We'll all go.

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,590
The crown prince who is known to be fair

403
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,350
has changed.

404
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Qing,

405
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,310
Ji Yun has his difficulties as well.

406
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,920
I heard that
it was Father who made him do it.

407
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,200
He had no choice but to obey him.

408
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,160
But still,

409
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,030
one shouldn't be weighing pros and cons

410
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,240
to justify doing something
that goes against one's wishes.

411
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,440
Well, I'm done talking about him.

412
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,880
Wan'er,

413
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,640
I am handing you

414
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,310
a highly important and sacred task.

415
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,240
"Club invitation card"?

416
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,030
Let Her Highness know

417
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,240
that I agree to join

418
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,350
her club.

419
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,640
I will be there on time tonight.

420
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,310
Qing.

421
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,480
I heard that you set up

422
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,270
a mindfulness club.

423
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,830
Why didn't you invite me?

424
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,070
I was worried that Your Highness

425
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,240
wouldn't have the time.

426
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,510
Why are you so polite to me?

427
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,550
Am I?

428
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,070
I have always been this polite.

429
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,350
Did I do anything

430
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,510
to hurt you by accident?

431
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,590
No,

432
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,070
nothing.

433
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,960
Was it because of the Liu family's case?

434
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,510
I did that because...

435
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,240
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
I am just having a hard time

437
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,830
accepting that someone whom I like

438
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,350
is now flawed.

439
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
If you want to join us,

440
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,590
just come at night.

441
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,030
Gongye Qi.

442
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,590
Your Highness, who are you asking me

443
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,590
to cure this time?

444
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,160
I am not the royal court's physician.

445
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,830
Can I only

446
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,240
come to you when someone is sick?

447
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,270
I am very busy,

448
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,960
and I don't have time for you.

449
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,240
The reason I'm here

450
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,070
is to send you the invitation card

451
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,680
to Qing's mindfulness club.

452
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,550
Mindfulness club?

453
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,480
The mindfulness club

454
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
is where you use

455
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,160
interactive games,

456
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,680
role-playing,

457
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,510
and inner self-narration

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,790
to help channel your emotions.

459
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,440
It is pretty interesting, right?

460
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,240
It is.

461
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,920
Then don't forget

462
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,640
to come on time.

463
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I think this kind of guidance

464
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,350
might help

465
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,200
with Prince Qi's condition.

466
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,400
You're right.

467
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,790
How could I have forgotten about him?

468
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,200
I'll go and tell him now.

469
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
You...

470
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,640
Don't forget to come.

471
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,350
Let's go.

472
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,110
It's very interesting indeed.

473
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,210
[Mindfulness Club]

474
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,550
We shall wait till everyone is here

475
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
before I explain

476
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,880
the specifics of our...

477
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,550
Wan'er,

478
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,240
at least you have the conscience

479
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,720
to invite me

480
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,240
for this group game.

481
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,750
Feng,

482
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,310
we are not playing games.

483
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,030
It's alright.

484
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,240
The more, the merrier.

485
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,070
Recently, I've been bored to death

486
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,350
staying at the residence.

487
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Was I late?

488
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,880
Not at all.

489
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,270
We are just about to start.

490
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,550
Okay,

491
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,790
everyone is here.

492
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,350
First of all, welcome all

493
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,400
to our mindfulness club.

494
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,240
I am your mindfulness counselor,

495
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,550
Qing.

496
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,590
Mindfulness club,

497
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
what does that mean?

498
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,070
A mindfulness club

499
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,550
is about mindful interactions.

500
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,830
It's a club of love

501
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,830
that helps people open up their hearts

502
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,880
and provides them
with counseling guidance.

503
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
It enables everyone

504
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,240
to be optimistic in life.

505
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,550
How profound,

506
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
it sounds as great as the venerable monk

507
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
at Lingguang Temple.

508
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,440
You can read it that way.

509
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,550
This is no fun.

510
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,880
It's nothing but cultivation, after all.

511
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,000
If you think this is no fun,

512
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,960
you may leave first.

513
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,830
Qing,

514
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,750
please go on, we'll do as you say.

515
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,440
Sure.

516
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,790
Well, everyone,

517
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,590
please close your eyes.

518
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,350
Relax.

519
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,780
Take a deep breath.

520
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,640
Let us think about

521
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
the best,

522
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,030
most memorable moments.

523
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,640
I miss the times when I was little.

524
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
I played hide and seek with my brothers

525
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,680
in the royal gardens.

526
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I remember

527
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,510
that Wan'er loved

528
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,750
to hide in the middle of the bush.

529
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
We always found her there.

530
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,160
Feng

531
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,070
always hid under the table.

532
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,270
That's right.

533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,750
Chu always climbed

534
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,400
to the top of the tallest rockery.

535
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,480
We could never find him.

536
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,790
Why do I not recall

537
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,310
anything that you have just said?

538
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,790
The last hide-and-seek game

539
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,200
that I played with you guys

540
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,960
is unforgettable to me.

541
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,790
Ever since Feng was startled,

542
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,240
we never played hide and seek again.

543
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
I don't have any siblings,

544
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,310
so all this sounds wonderful to me.

545
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,960
I wish to go back to when I was young.

546
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,830
If so,

547
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,880
should we play hide and seek again

548
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,400
to fulfill Her Highness' wishes?

549
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,160
That's a great idea.

550
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
Our mindfulness session

551
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,440
is working!

552
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,270
Everyone recalled

553
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
the lovely moments in childhood.

554
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,590
It's quite healing, isn't it?

555
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,640
Five,

556
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,070
four,

557
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
three,

558
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,240
two,

559
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
one.

560
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,240
I'm coming!

561
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,790
I see you.

562
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,880
Show yourself.

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,360
♪Walk idly in the shadow of
falling flowers with floral note♪

564
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,780
♪Separated by death and life,
we can only meet♪

565
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,560
♪In dreams♪

566
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,240

♪Propose a toast to the moon,
I have no one to talk to♪

568
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,480
I see nothing.

569
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,640
Well,

570
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
where's everyone?

571
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
The most dangerous place

572
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,350
is always the safest.

573
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,000
I bet Qing wouldn't have guessed

574
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,240
that I'm hiding here.

575
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,510
Hold on.

576
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,680
What's the point of hiding safely

577
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
through the night?

578
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,110
This is a rare opportunity

579
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,590
to be with Gongye Qi.

580
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,880
This won't do.

581
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,240
I have to go hide with him.

582
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,240
Your Highness.

583
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,160
Who is this?

584
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,920
I have arrived late.

585
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,590
Where did these two people come from?

586
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,070
How did it go?

587
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,030
Why does this scene

588
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,240
look ever so familiar?

589
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,160
We didn't catch them.

590
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,110
Your Highness,

591
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,750
we have placed the poison

592
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,270
