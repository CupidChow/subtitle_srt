[Different Princess]

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
[Episode 9]

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Is there anything else, Your Highness?

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Not really.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,310
But

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
I will come to Mystic Medicine Court
next time.

18
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,760
We are going

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,790
to the Grand Hall for a banquet.

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,790
See you someday.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,350
Alright.

22
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,840
Butterflies.

23
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,840
Zhuangzi's dream of a butterfly asks:

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,590
What is reality?

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,630
What are illusions?

26
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,910
Your Highness,

27
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,960
what are you doing?

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
Your Highness.

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,870
Your Highness.

30
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,310
Qing.

31
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,630
I...

32
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,360
Where am I?

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,800
Did I want to go back and get something?

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,310
You are not far
from the Imperial Food Service.

35
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,800
The Grand Hall is just right there.

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,190
I

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,630
can't seem to remember anything.

38
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,030
I...

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,190
I think I saw some butterflies.

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,190
I...

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,840
I saw the butterflies too.

42
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,120
I saw none of it.

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,470
Your Highness, Imperial Consort,

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,470
time is running late,

45
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,840
let's go back to the Grand Hall.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,910
I am not getting my things anymore.

47
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,960
I am coming with you.

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,150
Hold on.

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,960
I smell some kind of fragrance.

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I didn't smell anything.

51
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,750
It's a fragrance with a bitter scent.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Bitter fragrance?

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Let me think.

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,750
I have read

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,360
about this before in books.

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,560
It's a special kind of incense

57
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,190
that contains bitterness.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,560
It is a rare herb

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
called Butterfly Jiegeng.

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
When grounded into powder and inhaled
in small amounts,

61
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,590
it will cause temporary hallucinations.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,630
After recovering from it,

63
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,680
the person
will lose part of their memory.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,390
How would the Palace be home

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,430
to awful herbs like this?

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,920
I think we

67
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,190
must have met someone just now.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,360
That person

69
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,360
does not want us to remember

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,870
that we met,

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
and that's why he

72
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,120
used this rare herb.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,630
Did Ji Wan'er just met

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,830
Gongye Qi who had been poisoning others?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Your Highness,

76
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,510
let's get back to the Grand Hall.

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,390
The Emperor will be arriving soon.

78
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,070
Let's go, Qing.

79
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,190
Long live the emperor!

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,430
Long live the empress!

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,680
Please rise.

82
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,630
Your Majesty,

84
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,120
we have not seen Princess Consort Lv

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,800
since her marrying into Liang.

86
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,040
We rarely get to meet,

87
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,430
why not ask her to come to the front

88
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,270
so that we can get a better look at her?

89
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,070
Your Highness has a point.

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,190
May Prince Lv and Princess Consort Lv

91
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,190
come and pay their respects.

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,750
Here to pay my respects, father.

93
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,390
Good.

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
Princess Consort Lv,

95
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,680
you are a collateral descendant

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
of the Empress.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,070
You should come

98
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,040
and let Her Royal Highness
have a good look at you.

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
Qing,

100
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,630
come and let me have a look.

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,040
This gold bracelet was worn

102
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,950
by me when I was still in Fuyu.

103
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,560
I gave it to you afterward.

104
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,750
Your Highness,

105
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,070
hold those tears.

106
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,360
The question
of whether Hua Qingge is real

107
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,480
has yet to be answered.

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,920
Your tears can wait

109
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,360
till then.

110
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,750
What do you mean, Your Highness?

111
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,360
What I mean is

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
you have not met for years.

113
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,430
We don't know if she is your niece,

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,160
or if there is anything fishy going on.

115
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,510
Who knows, right?

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,870
Your Highness,

117
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,240
if this is unfounded,

118
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,310
you should keep it to yourself.

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,510
Your Majesty,

120
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I am just worried

121
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,600
that they might mistake someone else
as a relative.

122
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,630
Why don't we test

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,750
and see if she is real?

124
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,270
What are you suggesting?

125
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,270
I heard

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,750
that girls from Fuyu

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
are good at singing and dancing.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,390
I wonder if Princess Consort Lv

129
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
can perform for us

130
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Fuyu's Dance of the Dreams?

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
I'd rather eavesdrop on others

132
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,200
than to dance.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,270
What is Dance of the Dreams anyway?

134
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,790
I mentioned it briefly in the novel,

135
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,380
but who knows what it looks like?

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Even if I know how to do it,

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,200
look at Ji Chu with his preying eyes,

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,440
he just wants proof that I am Hua Qingge

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,870
and kill me.

140
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,030
Well?

141
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,440
You don't know how to?

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Are you not

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
the princess of Fuyu, Hua Qingge?

144
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,840
It's a crime to deceive the monarch,

145
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,120
can you be responsible for that?

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
She is not Princess Consort Lv.

147
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,750
My gosh.

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
How unthinkable.

149
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Why is she like that?

150
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Qing,

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,270
since Her Highness

152
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,600
wishes to see Fuyu's special dance,

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
just dance for everyone.

154
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,870
Princess Wan'er

155
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,030
told me that the Empress is on our side,

156
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,550
but is this how she is bringing us down?

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,360
If you don't dance today,
you have to perform in the future still.

158
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
It is no joke

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,390
when you deceive the monarch.

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,510
It has come to this now,

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,150
why is she hesitating?

162
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,030
If she does not dance,

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,870
she would be deceiving His Majesty,

164
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,630
and death awaits her.

165
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,630
She is such a coward,

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,630
there is no reason
for her to keep her identity hidden.

167
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,200
If Qing proves

168
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,510
that she is Hua Qingge,

169
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,200
Ji Chu will never

170
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,550
let that slip.

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
I don't care
about deceiving the Emperor.

172
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,120
Even if I can't be the crown prince,

173
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
I must protect her still.

174
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,150
If she is no longer Hua Qingge,

175
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,870
she can leave Chu and

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,600
no longer be his consort.

177
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,200
I will be able to then keep her
by my side

178
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,750
and protect her.

179
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,360
Sure,

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,030
I'll dance.

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Your Highness,

182
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,510
may I invite you to dance with me?

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,510
Simply put,

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,150
I have learned duet dancing

185
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,150
with my classmates before.

186
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Any one of you

187
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,510
would like to try doing that with me?

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,630
I do.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
One, two, three. Two, two, three.

190
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,550
Raise your arms.

191
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
Turn around.

192
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,550
Right.

193
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,000
One more time.

194
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,670
With all due respect.

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,790
This..

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,200
This is inappropriate.

197
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
I know, right?

198
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
Princess Consort Lv is married,

199
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,240
how could she hold hands
with the crown prince?

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,870
Right.

201
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,150
This is highly indecent.

202
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,790
You're right.

203
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,870
This is so inappropriate.

204
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,870
This is too...

205
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,120
Too inappropriate.

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,670
Highly unrefined.

207
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,360
Outrageous.

208
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,240
Yes.

209
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,030
Why is Prince Lv not stopping them?

210
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,030
Princess Consort Lv is

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
holding hands with the crown prince.

212
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,510
How indecent.

213
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,600
Yes.

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,030
This is not at all appropriate.

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,510
I have never seen this before.

216
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,000
Sorry that I stepped on you.

217
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,670
It's alright.

218
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,550
You did dance in the end,

219
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,200
but this is not

220
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
Fuyu's Dance of the Dreams.

221
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,750
Only the Empress can tell.

222
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,960
I guess this imperial consort is

223
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,120
not the princess from Fuyu.

224
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
This is not Dance of the Dreams.

225
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,550
It is not even

226
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
a dance from Fuyu.

227
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,510
Heads will roll because of this.

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,750
You brought us a fake imperial consort,

229
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,120
tried to pass her off as a real one.

230
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,150
Prince Lv,

231
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,960
I guess you don't respect

232
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,360
the Emperor very much.

233
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,270
Your Highness,

234
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,440
whether my consort is a real one,

235
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,870
do you think I need someone else

236
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,790
to tell me?

237
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,910
You...

238
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
I knew that Prince Lv is arrogant,

239
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,000
but I never thought he was this rude.

240
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
Yes. I would have never expected that.

241
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,840
What? It hurts.

242
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,670
So,

243
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,790
you were fine dancing with someone else,

244
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,750
but you are hurt by my short grip?

245
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,510
You don't know how strong

246
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,670
your grip is?

247
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,790
Although the dance

248
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,790
is not a dance from Fuyu,

249
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,120
but she is my dear Qing.

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Your Royal Highness,

251
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
are you trying to pacify this incident

252
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,750
by making up nonsense?

253
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,200
Most girls from Fuyu are

254
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,440
good in singing and dancing.

255
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
Dance of the Dreams

256
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,670
is a crowd favorite too.

257
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
But my dear niece Qing

258
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,390
is an exception.

259
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,120
How is she,

260
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,480
by coincidence, an exception?

261
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,360
As opposed to delicate dance moves,

262
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,270
Qing loves wielding swords and spears,

263
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,960
as she grew up learning martial arts.

264
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,120
That is why I have lightness skills.

265
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,150
If I still remember anything,

266
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,960
I might have known a few techniques too.

267
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,240
Your Royal Highness,

268
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,510
all these are your side of the story,

269
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,200
how is that at all convincing?

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,670
Qing,

271
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
let Her Highness feel your palms,

272
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,000
see if your right palm and finger pads

273
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,240
has a thin layer of callouses.

274
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,630
Yes.

275
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,270
These are the callouses

276
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,750
caused by my sword art learning.

277
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,480
Your Royal Highness,

278
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,840
you knew that she

279
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,150
knows nothing of Dance of the Dreams,

280
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,840
why didn't you stop her and

281
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,080
instead let things go out of hand?

282
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,360
Your Highness,

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,030
I too was concerned of

284
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,240
the authenticity of the royal bloodline,

285
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,360
so I had to make Qing dance.

286
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,960
If I did not publicly reveal

287
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
Qing's identity today,

288
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,320
I worry that everyone might have

289
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,150
more doubts down the line.

290
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,670
Now that everything has cleared up,

291
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,840
it is time now

292
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
to go on

293
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,360
with Feng's engagement ceremony.

294
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,360
Now that I am proved to be Hua Qingge,

295
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,240
although I am safe for now,

296
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,670
what the future holds could be worse.

297
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,360
Princess Consort Lv,

298
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,390
are you alright?

299
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm fine.

300
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,640
This is nothing.

301
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,310
Although I was exposed,

302
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,270
at least Liu Xiang is safe

303
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,030
from Ji Chu's evil plans.

304
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,750
Alright.

305
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,440
Feng, Xiang,

306
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,240
come here, both of you.

307
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,440
From now on,

308
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,000
you are Feng's imperial consort-to-be.

309
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,200
When you get married,

310
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,640
you have to be a good wife and mother.

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,790
I understand.

312
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

313
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,440
What's going on with Miss Liu?

314
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,440
She doesn't look well.

315
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,350
She looks very uncomfortable.

316
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,440
She is. What is happening?

317
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Monster!

318
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,110
She is becoming a monster!

319
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,590
I thought her poison had been treated?

320
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,070
Why is this happening?

321
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,790
Miss Liu is a monster.

322
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,200
She is a monster.

323
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,110
Monster! There's a monster!

324
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,440
She became a monster!

325
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,920
Run!

326
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,200
How could Miss Liu be a monster?

327
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,110
Don't come here.

328
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
Don't come over here.

329
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,640
Liu Xiang.

330
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,880
Protect the Emperor!

331
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,350
Protect the Emperor!

332
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
She is transforming!

333
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,030
Run!

334
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,960
There's a monster!

335
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,200
Run! Just run!

336
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,160
Don't come over!

337
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,350
Monster!

338
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
You are a monster.

339
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,920
There is a monster.

340
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,200
Don't come here.

341
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,750
Don't come over.

342
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,640
Don't come over.

343
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,200
Xiang.

344
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,880
Liu Xiang.

345
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,070
Liu Xiang.

346
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,960
Xiang.

347
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,640
Liu Xiang.

348
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,790
Liu Xiang.

349
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,880
Get up, quick.

350
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
Liu Xiang.

351
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,510
I don't want anything to happen to you.

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,640
Princess!

353
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Guards!

354
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,440
Tie her up!

355
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,960
Yun.

356
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,920
Wan'er.

357
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,110
Don't worry, Feng.

358
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,070
Don't worry, Feng.

359
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,440
Mother's here.

360
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,750
Hush.

361
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,960
- Feng.
- Monster.

362
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Don't be scared.

363
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Prince Lv.

364
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,510
Yes, father.

365
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,920
This monstrous incident

366
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,350
has far-reaching impacts.

367
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,350
I am assigning full responsibility
to you.

368
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,920
You must

369
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,750
get to the bottom of this.

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,960
As per your orders.

371
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,110
Ji Chu,

372
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,640
you went ahead and used Liu Xiang

373
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,070
to open up your mother's case.

374
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,400
I devoted my heart and my soul

375
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,790
to celebrate Your Majesty's birthday.

376
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,370
May Your Majesty
live long and prosperous.

377
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,680
May Your Majesty
live long and prosperous.

378
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,160
Please rise.

379
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

380
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,640
Imperial Consort Xian is a monster.

381
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,750
She became a monster.

382
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,110
What is happening to Her Highness?

383
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,550
What do we do?

384
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,200
This...

385
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,880
Monster! That is a monster!

386
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,680
This is a monster!

387
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Protect His Majesty!

388
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
Be careful, Your Majesty!

389
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,440
Your Majesty!

390
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,640
Xian!

391
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,790
Xian!

392
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,270
Wei Zhao is late to the rescue,

393
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,510
and asks Your Majesty for forgiveness.

394
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,590
Mother!

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,070
Mother!

396
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,200
Li De,

397
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,550
do you think I have

398
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,880
wronged Imperial Consort Xian?

399
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,440
She

400
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,310
is not a monster.

401
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,510
Your Majesty,

402
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,310
you have assigned this

403
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,110
to Prince Lv for investigation,

404
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
the findings will be out soon.

405
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,030
Please do not worry about it.

406
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,750
Get some early rest.

407
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,650
[Prince Qi Residence]

408
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,200
Monster.

409
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,440
Hide, quick. Don't worry, Feng.

410
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,000
Mother.

411
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,110
Help!

412
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,960
Help!

413
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,070
There's a monster.

414
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,070
Mother!

415
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,680
Help!

416
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,000
A monster!

417
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,350
It's alright, Feng.

418
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Don't worry.

419
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,590
Mother's here.

420
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,920
Don't be scared.

421
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,350
Their bullying got out of hand!

422
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,110
Dear sister,

423
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,200
calm down.

424
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,790
How can I keep calm

425
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,750
when Feng is

426
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,130
so frightened to this extent?

427
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,070
How can I,

428
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,830
as a mother, calm down?

429
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,110
Your Highness,

430
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,790
what is today all about?

431
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,310
Were you referring to Qing

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,960
or the monster?

433
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,480
Both.

434
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,550
Qing is her usual self.

435
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,440
In just days, however,

436
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,790
her personality has changed quite a bit.

437
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,480
About the monster,

438
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,440
I don't think it has much to do with us.

439
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,590
Please wait.

440
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,110
Your Highness,

441
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,830
my daughter was framed in

442
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,880
the engagement banquet today.

443
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,920
She is kept at the East Office now.

444
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,240
May Your Highness
have mercy and help me.

445
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,640
How do you expect me to help you?

446
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,510
Your Highness can help me

447
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,030
rescue my daughter and

448
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,590
clear the suspicions of her
being a monster.

449
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
If you want to clear
her name as a monster,

450
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,590
it won't be easy.

451
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,110
We need to take some time to plan.

452
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,830
This...

453
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,960
I can take time to plan,

454
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,310
but my daughter and Prince Qi

455
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,310
are about to get married,

456
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,750
and I am worried that Prince Qi
will be affected.

457
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,200
Are you threatening me?

458
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,510
I do not dare so.

459
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,550
I just wish that Your Highness

460
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,750
would not forget that

461
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,240
you and I are

462
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,680
in the same boat.

463
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,510
Of course, I won't.

464
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,750
I will get to the bottom of this.

465
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,790
It is late at night.

466
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,550
Go home

467
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,030
and wait for news from me.

468
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,310
Thank you, Your Highness.

469
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,750
Your Highness.

470
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,550
I have gone through

471
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,200
the files on Fuyu's princess Hua Qingge.

472
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,030
It does have records of

473
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,270
her learning martial arts since young.

474
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,200
This proves
that the Empress wasn't lying

475
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,310
at the Grand Hall today.

476
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,590
This means

477
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,110
that she is my imperial consort.

478
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,880
Yes.

479
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,510
So,

480
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,750
are we getting rid of her?

481
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,270
We shall go on with my mother's
case investigations first.

482
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,960
Duly noted.

483
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,550
Your Highness,

484
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,830
I have some concerns.

485
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,310
Tell me.

486
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,310
I have noticed that Your Highness

487
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,000
have changed over these days.

488
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,200
I am unsure whether

489
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,070
these changes

490
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,200
are for the better or the worse.

491
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,920
She can't really drink.

492
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,350
You are

493
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,790
actually

494
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,200
quite good-looking.

495
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,640
Your skin is so smooth.

496
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,400
Don't let me fall.

497
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,920
I don't want to die yet.

498
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,310
There are too many unknowns,

499
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,640
I would like to keep on observing.

500
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,640
Don't jump to conclusions.

501
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,680
Yes, Your Highness.
