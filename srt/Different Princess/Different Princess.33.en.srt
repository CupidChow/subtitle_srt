if we do that.

378
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
I'll cook today

379
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,510
so that you can enjoy it as well.

380
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,270
Are you going to cook
with medicinal herbs?

381
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,590
That reminds me.

382
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,510
It's time to give Chu something

383
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,790
to replenish his energy.

384
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,510
I never thought

385
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,750
that Chu would become

386
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,960
someone like that.

387
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,200
You've trained him well.

388
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,790
Same to you.

389
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,510
Gongye Qi

390
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,110
dotes on you so much too.

391
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,680
It's like Chu

392
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,960
has turned into another person.

393
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,000
You are quite a good influence on him.

394
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,310
He has turned from a cold-hearted man
into a warm-hearted man.

395
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,790
I'm still getting used to it.

396
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,750
Chu

397
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,110
can be quite scary

398
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,350
when he's being oblivious.

399
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,830
But sometimes,

400
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,680
he's quite good at flirting.

401
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,640
Tell me about it.

402
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,510
Let me tell you.

403
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,750
Lately,

404
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Her Highness has been kept in line.

405
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,160
And I promised Qing

406
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,270
that I would forgive her.

407
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,000
Her Highness is Wan'er's biological mother.

408
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,960
Forget it.

409
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,200
I've also transferred

410
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,680
Xiao Yan back from Nanjing.

411
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,350
I didn't attack anyone

412
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,350
in Nanjing.

413
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,350
You gave up the plan

414
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,480
that you worked on
for so many years for Qing.

415
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,880
But once Ji Yun takes over the throne,

416
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,640
he'll be wary of you.

417
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,880
Do you think

418
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,790
he'll let you live?

419
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,110
In a few more days,

420
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,070
I'll ask my father

421
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,160
to allow me to leave Liang.

422
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,790
I want to live

423
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,270
a secluded life with Qing

424
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,350
and spend the rest
of our time together in peace.

425
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,830
The rest of your time?

426
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,790
The two of you have
a lot of time together

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,920
ahead of you.

428
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,510
Your Highness.

429
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,440
Drink some tea.

430
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,110
You should drink some tea too, Xiyao.

431
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,270
Okay.

432
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,200
Your Highness.

433
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,030
What is it?

434
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,200
I've found the princess.

435
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,270
Is she okay?

436
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,200
Not only she's doing well,

437
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,000
she's also married to Gongye Qi.

438
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,480
And it looks like she's pregnant now.

439
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,550
It's good that she's safe and sound.

440
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,510
Your Highness.

441
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,480
Should we

442
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
tell Mother about this?

443
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm sure she'll be happy.

444
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,440
No.

445
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,270
We should let her

446
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,070
live the life that she wants.
