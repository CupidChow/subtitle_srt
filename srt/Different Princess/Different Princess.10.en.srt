[Episode 10]

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Master.

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,070
Master.

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,950
Master.

17
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,510
Something bad happened.

18
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,150
What happened?

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,230
Your Highness.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680
Liu Xiang died in the East Office.

21
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,310
Your Highness.

22
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,870
Your Highness, you are here.

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,120
What happened?

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
Around one hour ago,

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,560
I heard

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss Liu screaming inside.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,150
I rushed in

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,000
and found her

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
dead.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,590
Where's the culprit?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,750
There's no culprit.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,800
No culprit?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Did she commit suicide?

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,800
Well...

35
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
It's not a suicide.

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
You'll know once you see her.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,630
Open the door.

38
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,080
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,960
What are these?

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,280
These Adamantine Talismans

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
are sent from Prince Qi Residence tonight.

42
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,910
They say that Prince Qi

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
is terror-stricken today.

44
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,400
So, he needs something
to suppress the demonic aura.

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
I didn't think
that a few talismans would

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,280
hurt anyone.

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,430
So, I asked someone to paste these on.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,430
I know how to cook some medicinal dishes

49
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,080
that can help you get accustomed
to the climate here.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
If you don't mind,

51
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,560
I can cook them for you.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
Becoming the best chef in Shengjing

53
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,080
is my dream.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,150
Come back.

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,360
Do you want to ruin the crime scene?

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,150
Liu Xiang

57
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,080
was such a kind girl.

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,960
She had a passion for life.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
And she was loyal.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,590
There was even a spark

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,840
between her and Ji Feng.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
She could have had

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
a blessed future.

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,870
But everything

65
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,560
has been destroyed by Ji Chu.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
Both her hands and legs are tied.

67
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,310
She couldn't have committed suicide.

68
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,430
What is that?

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
This Vajra Weapon

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,590
is from Prince Qi Residence too.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
It is said to be blessed

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
and can be used to defeat evil.

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,830
Are there any other exits in the prison?

74
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,600
Your Highness.

75
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,800
This prison is known as the Steel Box.

76
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,040
It's specially built
for unusual criminals.

77
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
There's only one exit.

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,560
The door, windows and walls

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
are crafted from special materials.

80
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,240
The walls are unbreakable.

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,870
So, you are saying

82
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,630
that this cell is a closed room.

83
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,160
So, it was impossible for someone

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,560
to sneak past the guards,

85
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,070
kill Liu Xiang

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,510
and escape without notice.

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,190
Yes. It was impossible.

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
So,

89
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,630
who killed Liu Xiang?

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,430
Well...

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,430
I have no idea at all.

92
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,950
You were usually very talkative.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,040
What's wrong with you today?

94
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,190
What do you want me to say?

95
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,040
Tell me

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,510
who killed Liu Xiang.

97
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,190
You don't need me

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
to tell you who killed her.

99
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,190
Why not?

100
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,630
You spoke so eloquently

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,830
at the East Office court

102
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,360
for Ji Yun

103
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,750
that day, right?

104
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,750
What's wrong?

105
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,310
Are you being quiet because

106
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,560
this case has nothing to do with Ji Yun?

107
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,190
It has nothing to do
with the crown prince.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,680
Today,

109
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,630
with the exalted Prince Lv here,

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
I

111
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,310
don't dare to speak too much.

112
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,000
When will the coroner be here?

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,510
I already sent someone
to get the coroner.

114
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,680
I think he'll be here soon.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,070
Go away.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Go away.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,830
You demon.

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,750
Go away.

119
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,830
Go away.

120
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,190
Go away.

121
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,240
You demon.

122
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,390
- You demon.
- Feng.

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,240
Feng.

124
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,920
Mother.

125
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,160
Feng, don't be scared.

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Mother.

127
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,390
Mother.

128
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,070
Don't be scared.

129
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,040
You are fine.

130
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't want to marry her.

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,390
It's okay.

132
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,040
I don't want to marry her.

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,600
- You are fine.
- I don't want it.

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't want to marry a demon.

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,240
I want to break off the engagement.

136
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay.

137
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,830
I want to break off the engagement.

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't be scared.

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,070
I won't let you

140
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,950
marry a demon.

141
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll come up with a solution.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,430
Mother.

143
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,040
Is there really a demon in this world?

144
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,680
It doesn't matter
if there's a demon or not.

145
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,070
I'll protect you.

146
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,390
Mother.

147
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,190
Sometimes, I'll dream
about Imperial Consort Xian.

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Is she a demon?

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,750
Of course

150
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,800
she is.

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,830
But our uncle

152
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,830
killed her with an arrow.

153
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,040
She...

154
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,870
Will she...

155
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,390
Will she seek revenge from me?

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,950
Feng.

157
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,480
Don't worry.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
Even if she comes back,

159
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,480
she'll come for me and your uncle.

160
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,190
It has nothing to do with you.

161
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,870
But I don't want to be like this.

162
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,190
Why can't we

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,310
get along with everyone?

164
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,600
Why can't we get along with everyone?

165
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,830
Why?

166
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Why?

167
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,830
Maybe

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,830
this is the tragedy

169
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,360
of being born into the royal family.

170
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,070
Although we live a life of luxury

171
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,430
and get to enjoy

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,510
unattainable privilege,

173
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,600
we walk on a tightrope every day.

174
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,950
Your Highness, it's time to go.

175
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,040
Okay.

176
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,360
Feng.

177
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,750
Feng, don't be scared.

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,310
I'll handle everything.

179
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,630
I have to go back now.

180
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,480
Don't be afraid.

181
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,360
This is not a locked-room murder.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,080
Ji Chu must have sent someone here

183
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
to kill Liu Xiang
through a secret passage.

184
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,320
A sharp instrument pierced her chest

185
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,750
and ruptured her cardiac artery

186
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,200
that caused her to die
from excessive bleeding.

187
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,510
Her time of death was around

188
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,360
two hours ago.

189
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,550
Why did she suddenly transform

190
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,150
during the engagement banquet

191
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,200
and return to her normal self
upon her return

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
to the East Office?

193
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,000
Usually, it happens

194
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,510
under the influence

195
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,240
of special medication

196
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,200
to cause a temporary change
in the color of the pupils

197
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,910
or temporary hair growth.

198
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,750
After the medicine wears off,

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
that person will return to normal.

200
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,670
But...

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,150
But what?

202
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,910
He's such a fox.

203
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,150
You are the one

204
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,200
who poisoned Liu Xiang.

205
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Stop acting like you are innocent.

206
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,150
There's nothing wrong

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,200
with Miss Liu's blood.

208
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
And I don't detect
any poison in her blood.

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,080
It means that she was not

210
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,360
under the influence

211
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,670
of that type of medication.

212
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,550
How is that possible?

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,200
In my novel,

214
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,510
the poison is detected right away.

215
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,910
And it proves

216
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,910
the existence of Demon Poison.

217
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
Why has the script changed?

218
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,790
Calm down, Miss Qing.

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,270
Yes. We can't rush this.

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,550
I wonder what Ji Chu

221
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,960
is plotting this time.

222
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,750
I heard about a rumor.

223
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,200
What rumor is it?

224
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,120
It's said that this Vajra Weapon
from Zhendao Temple

225
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,000
is highly accurate.

226
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,030
As soon as it detects
the presence of a demon,

227
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
it will kill that demon.

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
So, I'm thinking

229
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,480
that maybe Liu Xiang

230
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,600
is really a demon.

231
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,390
That's why she was killed

232
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,320
by the Vajra Weapon.

233
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,910
Do you believe
that there's a demon in this world?

234
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,030
Nothing is too strange
in this huge world.

235
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,360
It's not impossible.

236
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,870
So, based on your theory,

237
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,240
Prince Qi killed Liu Xiang.

238
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,150
I wouldn't dare make that assumption.

239
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
A locked room

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
where no one can enter.

241
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
But the Vajra Weapon from Prince Qi

242
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
stabbed through
the chest of the deceased.

243
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,910
Doesn't it mean

244
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,670
that Prince Qi is the culprit?

245
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,000
Li Yi.

246
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm here, Your Highness.

247
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,030
Go to the Liu family

248
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,240
and inform them that Liu Xiang is dead.

249
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,480
Also, tell them that Prince Qi

250
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,360
is the main suspect.

251
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,320
Yes, Your Highness.

252
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,960
So, Ji Chu

253
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,150
is trying to target

254
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,790
the Wei family behind Ji Feng.

255
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,000
Send the body to the mortuary

256
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,150
and guard it well.

257
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,790
Do not let anyone go near it.

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,790
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
Yes, Your Highness.

260
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,200
Are you going to leave,

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,000
Princess Consort?

262
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,270
No wonder Qing knows Prince Lv

263
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,150
so well.

264
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,000
So, she's the Princess Consort.

265
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,550
Your Highness.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,080
I want to spend some time
at Miss Lin's house.

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,750
Miss Lin.

268
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
You'll take me in, right?

269
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm afraid I'll have to get

270
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,080
His Highness's permission to do that.

271
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,630
I have my own freedom.

272
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
He can't dictate where I go.

273
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
You don't have my permission.

274
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,480
Princess Consort.

275
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,000
You better go back with His Highness.

276
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,600
Now, Ji Chu has confirmed

277
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,510
that I am Hua Qingge.

278
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,360
If I go back with him,

279
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll be walking right into a trap.

280
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
Do you see that?

281
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
The brat who barged
into the dance room last time

282
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,630
is the Princess Consort.

283
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,270
That Princess Consort

284
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,080
is the thief who barged
into the dance room?

285
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Keep it down.

286
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,480
- Stop talking.
- Keep it down.

287
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,080
Xiao Yan.

288
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:15,840
Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,120
Ask the three guards
who are on duty tonight

290
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,670
to come and see me separately.

291
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
Yes, Your Highness.

292
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,000
You have been invited by His Highness.

293
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,550
Roger that.

294
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,200
Roger that.

295
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,600
Are we going or not?

296
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,550
Of course we are going.

297
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,840
Do you want to get beheaded

298
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,910
and have your skull made

299
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
into a wine glass for Prince Lv?

300
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,390
After Liu Xiang was sent
to the East Office tonight,

301
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,910
you were on duty, right?

302
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,840
Yes.

303
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,630
Commander Chang led me
and another guard,

304
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,440
Wang Junior, to guard the place.

305
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,670
During that time,

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,390
who went into Liu Xiang's cell?

307
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,390
The first person who went there

308
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,240
was Xiu, a maid from Liu Residence.

309
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,120
Xiu.

310
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,150
Your Highness.

311
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
She said that she was

312
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,960
Miss Liu's personal maid
from Liu Residence.

313
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,480
And she brought a box of pastries

314
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,790
just for Miss Liu.

315
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,550
I am Miss Liu's

316
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,910
personal maid, Xiu.

317
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,480
This is the identity tablet
from Liu Residence.

318
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:27,910
No chatting.

319
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,000
You have 15 minutes.

320
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,120
I understand.

321
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,360
Did Liu Xiang eat the food?

322
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,320
I don't know.

323
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,200
But I think she ate it.

324
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,120
Why do you say that?

325
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,600
First,

326
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,270
I heard Xiu

327
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,510
asking Miss Liu

328
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,480
to eat the pastries.

329
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,960
Second,

330
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,440
it was nighttime.

331
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,030
The time when people often get hungry.

332
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,790
Why starve yourself
when you have something to eat?

333
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,840
Besides, those pastries

334
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,270
were Miss Liu's favorites.

335
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,270
Come with it.

336
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,670
Roger that.

337
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,200
Does Ji Chu suspect that no Demon Poison

338
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
was detected because Liu Xiang

339
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
ate the pastries

340
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,550
brought by Xiu?

341
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
Do you think

342
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,840
Liu Xiang ate the food or not?

343
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,200
I don't understand what you mean.

344
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,240
It's just a plate of pastries.

345
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,750
Is it that important
whether she ate it or not?

346
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,870
You are acting dumb to me.

347
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,790
I wouldn't dare.

348
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
You are the one who's acting dumb.

349
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,440
You sent someone to poison Liu Xiang,

350
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
kill her

351
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,440
and frame Ji Feng for it.

352
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Now, you are pretending

353
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,150
to investigate the case.

354
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
That's not logical at all.

355
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,000
Looks like you have

356
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,360
a lot of resentment toward me.

357
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,270
That's not true.

358
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,360
All I feel toward you

359
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,870
are awe, veneration and fear.

360
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,600
What do you

361
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,080
fear about me?

362
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,360
Your Highness.

363
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,200
Please have mercy on me.

364
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
What did you do?

365
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,320
Please spare my life.

366
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,790
Don't behead me and

367
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
turn my skull into a wine glass.

368
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,550
If you don't want me

369
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,960
to behead you,

370
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,150
you better tell me the truth now.

371
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,510
I'll tell you.

372
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll tell you everything.

373
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
I'm the only son

374
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,840
in my family.

375
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,600
It...

376
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,790
I've finally become

377
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,440
a guard at the East Office.

378
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,960
I can't just die like this.

379
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,080
I don't want to die
with some missing body parts.

380
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,480
Do you think Liu Xiang ate the food?

381
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
Well...

382
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,550
Well...

383
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm not sure.

384
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,960
What do you mean?

385
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,590
Your Highness.

386
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,640
I heard

387
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,440
Xiu

388
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,270
asking Miss Liu to eat the food.

389
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,270
But Miss Liu

390
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,110
didn't say anything at all.

391
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,160
Could it be

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,680
that Liu Xiang was already
dead at that time?

393
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,510
No.

394
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,750
Miss Liu was still alive at that time.

395
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,000
Because not long after that,

396
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Prince Qi Residence sent someone

397
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
to deliver the talismans
and the Vajra Weapon.

398
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,830
I was

399
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,200
the one who went in
to paste on the talismans.

400
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,880
She's just asleep.

401
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,590
How long did you take
to paste on the talismans?

402
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,510
Around

403
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
fifteen minutes.

404
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,310
And Liu Xiang didn't wake up at all

405
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
during that time?

406
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,590
Yes.

407
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,110
When I saw

408
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,240
that Miss Liu was sleeping,

409
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,440
I was careful

410
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,640
not to wake her.

411
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,240
You can leave now.

412
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,160
Thank you for sparing my life.

413
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll bring Manager Chang in.

414
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,030
Xiao Yan.

415
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,030
Is there a rumor going on

416
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,830
about me having a habit
of beheading others

417
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,270
and turning their skulls
into wine glasses?

418
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,030
It's just a rumor

419
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,030
saying that you loved
doing that in Nanjing

420
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
and that you stopped collecting

421
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
skull glasses after returning to Liang.

422
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,920
After all, you are a citizen of Liang.

423
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
You have more mercy
toward your own people.

424
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,750
Bring Chang Xun in.

425
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,510
Yes, Your Highness.

426
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,240
Are you afraid of me

427
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,030
because of the rumor?

428
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,790
You have a reputation,

429
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,480
how can I not be afraid?

430
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,110
But you grew up in Fuyu.

431
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,350
You've never been to Nanjing.

432
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,070
And you had never visited
Liang before this.

433
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
How do you know

434
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,590
about this rumor?

435
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,200
I...

436
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,790
I know that even if I tell you about it,

437
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,640
you won't believe me.

438
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,510
But I'm really

439
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,200
not your Princess Consort.

440
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,510
At least

441
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm not the Hua Qingge
that you think I am.

442
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,350
Your Highness.

443
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,070
I re-read the dossier

444
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
on Princess Hua Qingge from Fuyu.

445
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,200
There's a record

446
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,440
that she has been learning
martial arts since she was young.

447
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,920
It means that she didn't lie

448
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,070
in the Grand Hall today.

449
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,830
Greetings, Your Highness.

450
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,310
When Liu Xiang died,

451
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,310
you were the first
to enter the cell, right?

452
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,240
Yes.

453
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,350
What did you see?

454
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,350
I was guarding
the cell door at that time.

455
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
Then, I heard a scream

456
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,830
coming from Miss Liu's cell.

457
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,400
So, I went in.

458
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
The room was pitch black.

459
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,480
I was on my guard.

460
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,400
Then, Wang lit the candle

461
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,680
and we found Miss Liu's body.

462
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,030
Before you entered the cell,

463
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,790
you heard Liu Xiang
saying the phrase "Stay away", right?

464
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes.

465
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,200
That's why

466
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,750
I barged into the cell.

467
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,640
When I noticed
that the room was pitch black,

468
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,310
I didn't dare to go forward recklessly.

469
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,480
I drew out my sword to defend myself

470
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
in case there was
anyone else in the cell.

471
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
But you said

472
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,070
that the cell is a locked room

473
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,830
without

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
any secret door or passage.

475
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,350
So, how did that person

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,590
appear out of thin air?

477
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,590
It's something

478
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,000
that confuses me as well.

479
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
So, my guess is,

480
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,480
maybe Miss Liu

481
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,270
was hallucinating due to

482
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,880
the demonic influence

483
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,000
and was killed by the Vajra Weapon.

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,640
You can leave now.

485
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,110
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll take my leave now.

487
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,440
Let's go back tonight.

488
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,240
We'll enter the palace tomorrow
to meet His Majesty.

489
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,240
Xiang!

490
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,200
Xiang.

491
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,640
I will seek justice for you.

492
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,960
Xiang.

493
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,110
My Xiang.

494
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,440
Who is it?

495
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,680
Gongge.

496
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,030
It's you.

497
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,070
Why are you here so late at night?

498
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,270
His Highness asked me
to deliver something to you.

499
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,030
Does he want to treat me
to some pastries?

500
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
There are too few of them.

501
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,790
Something has changed.

502
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,750
His Highness wants you
to check these pastries for him.

503
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,830
[Liu Residence]

504
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,830
This tonic porridge needs
more time to cook.

505
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,920
I'll let it simmer on slow fire

506
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,240
and it'll be ready after the banquet.

507
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,270
Xiang, it's late already.

508
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,790
It's time for you to depart.

509
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,680
Father,
I'm paying attention to the time.

510
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,160
Xiu, let's go and get changed.

511
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,200
Xiang.

512
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,590
What are you

513
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,960
going to surprise me with?

514
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,960
You'll know later.

515
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,070
These are my new recipes.

516
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,110
Give them a taste.

517
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,270
You are indeed

518
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
my extraordinary daughter.

519
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,510
Xiang.

520
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,110
Are you sure you don't blame me

521
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,110
for arranging this marriage for you?

522
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,070
Are you willing to marry Prince Qi?

523
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,440
Yes, I do.

524
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,200
By marrying Prince Qi,

525
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
I can learn from

526
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,160
the top chef in Prince Qi Residence

527
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,480
and have the best cooking skills

528
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,830
in this world.

529
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,160
Then, I'll cook for you.

530
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,270
Xiang.

531
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,310
Getting married
is different from cooking.

532
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,070
They are two different things.

533
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,400
I understand.

534
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,750
Although Prince Qi

535
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,070
is lacking in both
learning and practical ability,

536
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,350
he's not a bad person.

537
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,310
I won't get bullied

538
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
if I marry him.

539
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,000
Xiang.

540
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,550
This is my fault.

541
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,440
I shouldn't have

542
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,200
dragged you into this.

543
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,550
Who is it?

544
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,510
Master, it's Liu Er.

545
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,830
Come in.

546
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,960
Master.

547
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,480
I've sent out someone
to be our informant.

548
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,160
Xiu went to the East Office

549
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,310
to deliver some pastries to Miss Liu.

550
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,270
But she's not back yet.

551
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,030
Go.

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,480
Go and collect more information for me.

553
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,830
Yes, Master.

554
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,540
[Xuanze Hall]

555
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,200
Your Majesty,

556
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,070
Prince Lv is here.

557
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:32,340
[Xuanze Hall]

558
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,200
Your Highness.

559
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,510
His Highness has entered the palace.
He's not here.

560
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,880
It's okay.

561
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,960
I'm not here

562
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,830
to visit Chu.

563
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm here

564
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,550
to visit my sister-in-law.

565
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,310
You are here to visit Qing?

566
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,200
I mean the Princess Consort.

567
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,110
Why?

568
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,200
Mister Song.

569
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,790
Are you sure you want to ask
about the things between ladies?

570
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,310
The Princess Consort
is staying at Anxiang Hall.

571
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,310
Let me lead the way.

572
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,480
It's okay.

573
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,880
I'll go to the pavilion over there.

574
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,310
You can ask her to meet me there.

575
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,960
Yes, Your Highness.
I'll relay the message to her now.

576
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,030
Your Highness.

577
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,200
You know that the player
of the white stones

578
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,480
hasn't been visiting
Prince Lv Residence lately.

579
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,640
Why are you looking for him here?

580
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,640
I'm not here to look for him.

581
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,640
I just

582
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,510
love the scenery at the pavilion.

583
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
And I can pay Qing a visit
while I enjoy the scenery.

584
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,110
Your Highness.

585
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,070
