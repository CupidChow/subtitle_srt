you seem to have done a good job.

191
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,760
I didn't

192
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,280
misjudge you when I chose you

193
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,040
to be Princess Consort Lv.

194
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
Now, I have new instructions for you.

195
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
What's it?

196
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,040
I've heard that a woman
arrived at Prince Lv's residence

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,760
carrying

198
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,760
the Fish-shaped Token

199
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,400
that could threaten the peace of Liang.

200
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,640
Qing,

201
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
before this woman

202
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,960
causes any trouble,

203
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
find a chance to bring
the Fish-shaped Token to me.

204
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Well...

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,120
Do you

206
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
understand?

207
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
Yes, I do.

208
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,120
Good girl.

209
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,000
Gongge,

210
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

211
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,160
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,280
Her Highness sent me

213
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,360
to deliver a letter to you.

214
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,000
She said I must
give it to you in person.

215
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,360
Her Highness also said

216
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
that the empress
is keeping a close eye on her,

217
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,360
so she can't escape for the time being.

218
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
Please wait a couple of days

219
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,120
and she'll find a way to get out.

220
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Gongge.

221
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,400
Gongge,

222
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
how dare you do this?

223
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,320
Your Highness,

224
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,920
I didn't even have time to stop Gongge

225
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,240
before he tore the letter up.

226
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,680
What?

227
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,200
Gongge

228
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,800
has no respect

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
for you.

230
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,280
Wait.

231
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,240
You said he just tore it up

232
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
without even reading it?

233
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,840
What's with the big change

234
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,920
in his attitude?

235
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,720
No way.

236
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,280
I must find a way
to get out of the palace

237
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,800
and ask Gongye Qi about this.

238
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,520
Your Highness,

239
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
why do you bother pursuing him?

240
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,840
Your Highness,

241
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm here to help you
try on your wedding gown.

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
I wonder why Nanqing

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
called me to the courtyard.

244
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,080
Pumpkin,

245
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,360
why do you bring me

246
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,280
to the courtyard?

247
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,920
Father, just follow me.

248
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
We can't afford to waste

249
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,000
a wonderful moment.

250
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
I knew Nanqing had a reason

251
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,880
for calling me here.

252
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,520
Fine,

253
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,200
It's been a long time
since I've had a drink with you.

254
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,000
Chu,

255
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,560
do you remember

256
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
the tavern in Nanjing?

257
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,960
Yes.

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
The three of us used to

259
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,320
sneak out

260
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,160
and get drunk.

261
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Do you know

262
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
that I always wondered

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,000
what kind of woman

264
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,720
would make your heart flutter?

265
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,920
Now that I've met Princess Consort Lv,

266
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,960
I've realised

267
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,640
that a woman who's so straightforward

268
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,280
and fearless can bring

269
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,080
more security for you.

270
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,040
She's

271
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
indescribable

272
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
and irreplaceable to me.

273
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Ji Chu isn't in his room.

274
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,560
Where is he?

275
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,560
I must tell Ji Chu

276
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,280
that the empress told me

277
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
to steal the Fish-shaped Token.

278
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,760
It's about to rain.

279
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,920
Chu,

280
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,720
let's get married.

281
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,960
You should know

282
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,640
that I have fallen for you

283
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
a long time ago.

284
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,680
If you agree,

285
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
I'll give you the Fish-shaped Token

286
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
to help you seek revenge.

287
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,400
Old Witch.

288
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,280
Let's go.

289
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,280
House Master,

290
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
everything else has been moved,

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
except this fish tank.

292
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,800
He Tong,

293
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,960
the money I gave you

294
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,880
should be enough for you to live

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,960
for a while.

296
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,600
Go get yourself a good job.

297
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,000
House Master,

298
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,440
are you really going
to sack everyone in Mystic Medicine House?

299
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Just leave.

You're going to leave
without saying goodbye?

314
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,960
Why did you tear up my letter

315
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,720
without even reading it?

316
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,960
Wan'er is the daughter of the person
who killed your family.

317
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,360
What are you going to do?

318
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,120
Will you put aside your hatred

319
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,320
and be with Wan'er,

320
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,360
or will you seek vengeance

321
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
knowing that the empress

322
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
is Wan'er's mother?

323
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,880
Is it because...

324
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,760
Is it because I

325
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
didn't get to the date in time

326
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,440
that you think

327
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,960
I didn't want to be with you

328
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,800
so you did it on purpose?

329
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
It was hard for me

330
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,080
to escape from the palace today.

331
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't you have anything

332
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,720
to say to me?

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,880
Your Highness,

334
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,600
forget about me.

335
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,000
I...

336
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,320
Did my mother

337
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,240
come to you?

338
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,640
Or do you think

339
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm incapable of adapting to

340
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
life outside the palace?

341
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,280
Don't worry.

342
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,880
I've decided to

343
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
spend the rest of my life with you,

344
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,720
so I'm prepared to live in poverty.

345
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
Whenever and wherever it is,

346
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,120
as long as there's you,

347
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll stick with you.

348
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
Are you going to give up on me

349
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
because of such a difficulty?

350
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
Was all that talk
about spending a lifetime together

351
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,920
a lie?

352
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Gongye Qi, say something!

353
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,120
It's all a lie.

354
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,960
If you take it seriously,

355
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
No.

357
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,720
No, it's not. You're lying to me.

358
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,160
You're lying to me, aren't you?

359
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm a heartless man.

360
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,400
It's just that you imagined me

361
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
too well.

362
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
No.

363
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,720
You're not. No.

364
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
You're not a heartless man.

365
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,280
Otherwise...

366
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,760
Otherwise, you wouldn't

367
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,760
treat Hong that way.

368
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,040
There's nothing

369
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,960
in this world

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,560
we can't give up.

371
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,760
Gongye Qi,

372
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
do you mean

373
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
what you said today?

374
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,680
If you say "yes",

375
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,560
I

376
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,360
won't persist.

377
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,800
Yes.

378
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,640
From now on,

Your Highness,

404
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,760
don't be too worried.

405
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,560
The imperial physician said

406
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,560
the princess just caught a cold.

407
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
She'll be fine after a few days of rest.

408
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
How can I not be worried?

409
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,800
Wan'er is my daughter.

410
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,160
It breaks my heart

411
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
when she usually has a cough.

412
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,160
How did you take care of the princess?

413
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,360
Your Highness, please forgive me.

414
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,560
Your Highness, please forgive me.

415
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,800
Did the princess go out

416
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,200
to meet someone she shouldn't have?

417
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
I knew it.

418
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,880
Chu,

419
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,520
let's get married.

420
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,520
If you agree,

421
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,840
I'll give you the Fish-shaped Token

422
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,560
to help you seek revenge.

423
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,080
No matter what,

424
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,600
I still want to know the answer.

425
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,160
Ji Chu,

426
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,680
I have something to ask you.

427
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,680
Ask away.

428
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Don't you have something to ask me?

429
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,640
No.

430
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,440
I've got the answer.

431
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,240
Qing!

432
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,000
Princess Consort.

433
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,360
Your Highness,

434
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,120
I've got something to report.

435
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,160
What's it?

436
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
The palace maid lurking in Fengyi Palace

437
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,440
heard some words.

438
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,160
Speak.

439
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
It's related to Princess Consort.

440
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,120
The palace maid heard
the empress herself say

441
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,520
that the empress placed

442
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,080
the princess consort at your side

443
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,400
on a task

444
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,000
to make you

445
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,160
fall in love with her

446
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,840
and to gain your trust.

447
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,960
Did she get any new tasks

448
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,640
after our wedding?

449
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,960
The palace maid did not
hear of the new task.

450
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,960
Back then, he used to

451
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,320
drink alone

452
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
like this

453
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,320
and leave us alone.

454
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
He doesn't seem to have changed,

455
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,840
but he's actually changed a lot.

456
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
We're all the same.

457
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,840
We've got the past on our minds.

458
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
Now, those old issues remain unresolved,

459
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
but we've got more to worry about.

460
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
Do you know

461
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,440
why I stepped up

462
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,000
to help Chu back then?

463
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,960
Because he's handsome.

464
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
It's because of his deep

465
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
gaze.

466
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,240
You'll never know how much

467
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,360
sadness and pain he's hiding inside.

468
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
You fell for him

469
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,800
from the first moment you met him?

470
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,560
This isn't a secret.

471
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
Only he doesn't know about it.

472
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,800
Maybe

473
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,520
he just doesn't want to know.

474
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,680
But I know

475
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,520
that Chu's heart

476
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
