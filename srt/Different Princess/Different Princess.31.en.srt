[Episode 31]

14
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,120
It's already daybreak.

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,320
At ease.

17
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,800
Please, have a seat.

18
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,800
Much obliged.

19
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,190
I summoned you

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,190
not because of any serious business

21
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,150
but to show my concern.

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I appreciate that.

23
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,000
It's been some time
since Crown Princess

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,360
got married.

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,190
Duke,

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,590
have you visited Yao?

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
A married daughter

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,830
is lost like a splash of water.

29
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,190
It's inadequate

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,030
for an official to approach
Crown Princess in private.

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,270
Lost like a splash of water,

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,360
you said?

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Perhaps you are

34
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,310
oversimplifying the matter.

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,560
It's time I get to the point.

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,310
Yao

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,360
is now my daughter-in-law.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,360
You are the father
of Crown Princess.

39
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,030
I will

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,960
see you as my family.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,190
It's more honor

42
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,960
than I can ever deserve.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
The couple are like birds

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,470
of the same tree.

45
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,190
They live as one.

46
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,870
When she does well in life,

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
so will you.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
Isn't that right?

49
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,360
Without someone powerful

50
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,270
to support Crown Princess,

51
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,510
I fear that

52
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,920
her life in the palace

53
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,630
will be one full of perils.

54
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,600
If she must tread on thin ice,

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
your career in the Imperial Court

56
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,920
will be full of obstacles.

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,920
Your wish is my command, Your Highness.

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Your Majesty.

59
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,070
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Your Highness,

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
His Majesty is not here.

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,680
The painting is crooked.

63
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,000
These servants are too sloppy.

64
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,920
Imperial Consort Xian?

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
After all these years,

66
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,070
His Majesty

67
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,800
still holds this cursed woman so dearly.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,630
What are you doing?

69
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,270
Your Majesty.

70
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,190
You said

71
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,360
I was your only love.

72
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,040
Why do you have

73
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,040
a painting of this sinner in your room?

74
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,480
Who are you to judge

75
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,680
if she was a sinner?

76
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
As the head of the Rear Palace,

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
you shouldn't let
envy get the better of you.

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,750
My apologies.

79
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,600
It's my mistake.

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,680
Leave.

Hyah.

85

Halt.

What is going on?

87
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,920
Why are we stopping?

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,630
I'll ask the guards.

89
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,920
What's happening?

90
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,480
Your Highness, the bandits!

91
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,560
What?

92
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,190
Watch out!

93
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,830
What now?

94
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,270
Do not hurt Her Highness!

95
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,630
Ru Jiao!

96
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,870
Ru Jiao...

97
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,040
Who sent you?

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,600
Your Majesty,

99
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,150
are you sure about this?

100
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,200
I don't have a choice.

101
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,670
Your Highness...

102
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,510
Thankfully,

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,600
there is still some Demon Poison left.

104
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,240
Your Highness.

105
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,630
He's been keeping

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,600
the painting of that accursed woman.

107
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,910
He must have suspected that she wasn't

108
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,790
a demon.

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Very well.

110
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll convince him once more.

111
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,840
But Your Highness,

112
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,750
Liu Xiang's death

113
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,320
proved the Demon Poison's existence.

114
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
His Majesty

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,750
simply never announced it.

116
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,000
I want the world

117
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,360
to know that Imperial Consort Xian

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
was a demon.

119
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,150
Her son is a demon too.

120
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,550
Even without killing him,

121
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,030
the uproar

122
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,910
will be enough to strip him

123
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,360
of his right to the throne.

124
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,840

His Majesty arrives!

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,870
After a slap in the face,

127
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,120
it's time to give some comfort.

128
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,600
Your Highness...

129
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,870
I wonder

130
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
how much time I have left.

131
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
[Anxiang Hall]

132
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,600
What's the hurry?

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
Did something bad happen?

134
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
These are

135
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,320
premium offerings from various nations.

136
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,320
These are the finest gemstones.

137
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,080
I appreciate the concern.

138
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,270
I am thrilled by these gifts.

139
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,600

Insolence!

143
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,480
We will not tolerate that here.

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Speak.

145
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,910
What is it?

146
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,870
Your Majesty.

A woman claims to be

Her Highness's servant.

149
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,000
She wants an audience.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,320
Send her in.

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,390
Yes.

152
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,120
Bring her in.

Why are you in Liang?

157
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,200
Where is Wan'er?

158
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,870
We were passing by a forest

159
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
near Liang's border.

160
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,750
We ran into a group of bandits.

161
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
The princess...

Are her remains here?

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
They are on the way.

167
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,910
What are you saying?

168
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,150
Who is lost?

169
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,790
Speak!

170
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,670
Your Highness.

171
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,390
When we arrived,

172
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,600
the guards

173
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,480
were already dead.

174
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,670
The princess...

175
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,320
She is...

176
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,510
She is gone.

177
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,910
This is her personal effect.

178
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,670
How can this be?

179
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,750
What?

180
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,790
Say that again!

181
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,550
Her Highness...

182
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,360
was dead!

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,960
She was killed...

184
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,910
Wan'er...

185
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,200

186
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,600
Your Highness!

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,600
Send for the physician!

188
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Father now knows

189
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
that Wan'er was killed.

190
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,320
The words have reached here.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,960
Where is Qing?

192
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,670
Crying in her room.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,600
Ji Chu!

194
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,630
You asked me to trust you.

195
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,440
Is this how you

196
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,240
repay us?

197
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,120
Gongye Qi.

198
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,550
Calm down.

199
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,870
How can I calm down?

200
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,510
To have revenge,

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,870
I abandoned Wan'er,

202
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,870
but

203
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,150
she shouldn't

204
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,750
have died in vain.

205
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,150
Do not act on impulse.

206
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,910
You will have your answer.

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Stop!

208
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,080
Your Highness!

209
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,750
Your Highness!

210
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,480
This is enough!

211
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,120
No!

212
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,200
You had plenty of chances

213
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,910
after learning the truth.

214
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,600
Why did you wait until

215
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,750
Wan'er was married to Nanjing?

216
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,030
Her death

217
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
is your fault!

218
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,480
Qi.

219
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,870
We can't talk about it here.

220
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,670
Ji Chu.

221
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,390
Stay out of it from now on.

222
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
I'll have my revenge.

223
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,270
Qi!

224
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,960
Gongge!

225
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,080
Your Highness.

226
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,390
Are you all right?

227
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,790
You are injured.

228
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,440
It's nothing.

229
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,440
Gongye Qi's wound

230
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,150
is much worse.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,790
Your Highness.

232
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,960
Your Highness.

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
Crying is bad for your health.

234
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,080
Your Highness.

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Wan'er!

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,870
My dear Wan'er!

237
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,790
This is my fault!

238
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,240
You died

239
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,670
because of me!

240
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,240
Your Highness.

241
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,200
Wan'er!

242
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Your Highness.

243
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,670
I must see Wan'er again.

244
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,840
I must see Wan'er again.

245
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,200
Your Highness!

246
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,910
Wan'er!

247
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,270
Your Highness!

248
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,120
Your Highness!

249
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,030
Wan'er!

250
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,600
Your Highness!

251
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,440
Her remains

252
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,360
are on the way here.

253
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,150
You will

254
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
see her tomorrow.

255
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,270
- Wan'er!
- Your Highness!

256
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,390
Your Highness!

257
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,000
I want to see Wan'er!

258
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,270
She is not here,

259
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,270
Your Highness!

260
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,390
Your Highness!

261
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:42,840
Wan'er!

262
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
Your Highness, calm down.

263
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
- Wan'er!
- Your Highness!

264
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,320
Your Highness!

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,270
Wan'er!

266
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,910
Your Highness!

267
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,030
Your Highness!

268
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Help!

269
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,510
We need help!

270
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,200
She passed out!

271
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,750
Your Highness!

272
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,750
Your Highness!

273
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,600
Your Highness!

274
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Your Highness!

275
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,150
Be gentle.

276
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,910
Quick!

277
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Slowly.

278
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,030
Wan'er, sorry.

279
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,790
I was obsessed with

280
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,480
changing the ending.

281
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,200
But my alterations

282
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
caused a chain of changes.

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,080
This is my fault.

284
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,750
You died because of me.

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,390
Princess Consort?

286
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,670
Princess Consort?

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,030
What do you want?

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,670
How is the empress?

289
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,600
She cried so hard
that she passed out just now.

290
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,750
I am the emperor,

291
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,150
but I couldn't even

292
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,600
protect my children.

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,310
Mother.

294
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
Wan'er...

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,790
Her remains...

296
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,680
Are they home?

297
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,830
It will reach the capital tomorrow.

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
She is afraid of cold.

299
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
Make sure she gets

300
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,160
thicker clothes.

301
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,440
Understood.

302
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,070
If I didn't have to
keep Ji Chu restricted,

303
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,830
I wouldn't have

304
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,830
sent her

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,030
to a land so far away.

306
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,590
Yun.

307
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,480
Do you think

308
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,270
I made the wrong decision?

309
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Mother.

310
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Why can't you and Ji Chu

311
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,350
live in peace?

312
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,880
Peace?

313
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,680
Ji Chu now knows

314
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,400
that I got his mother killed.

315
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Do you think

316
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
he would forgive me for that?

317
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,830
But Mother,

318
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,510
why did you

319
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
frame Imperial Consort Xian?

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,750
You don't understand

321
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,880
how hard life is in the Rear Palace.

322
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,440
Your father

323
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,270
wanted to promote her
to the rank of Imperial Consort.

324
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,070
He needed a reason

325
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,920
to abdicate me afterward

326
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,480
and make her the empress.

327
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,830
Had that happened,

328
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Ji Chu would've been

329
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,750
the crown prince.

330
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,350
You would've

331
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,510
faced great
dangers in the Imperial Court.

332
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,200
Mother.

333
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,440
You can't end grudges with more grudges.

334
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,510
Yun.

335
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,350
The affairs in the Imperial Court

336
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,270
are more
complicated than the Rear Palace.

337
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,640
You must never be soft.

338
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,240
Mother...

339
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,350
You are all I have now.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,160
You must take the throne soon.

341
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,480
Otherwise, I will

342
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
be at others' mercy.

343
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,270
Don't worry, Mother.

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
I will keep you safe.

345
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,640
Come.

346
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
Xiyao?

347
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,030
Your Highness.

348
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,240
What are you doing here at this hour?

349
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,480
I was waiting for you.

350
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,640
Even now,

351
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,070
Gongye Qi still picked a fight with you.

352
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,550
It's clear she still has a place

353
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,750
in his heart.

354
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,030
Say,

355
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
I wish the six of us

356
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
could be together

357
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,440
like we did at Jingzhi Library.

358
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Wouldn't that be nice?

359
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,440
But we can't turn back time.

360
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,920
Chu.

361
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
I brought you premium bruise ointment.

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,750
Ask Nanyi

363
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
to treat your injury again.

364
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,750
It was nothing.

365
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,070
Nanyi.

366
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,480
Perfect timing.

367
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,000
We need to have a word.

368
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll leave you two be.

369
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
Is this about

370
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,310
the situation in Nanjing?

371
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,480
Words about Wan'er's death

372
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
have reached Nanjing.

373
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,510
The opportunists know that

374
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,670
Prime Minister Li

375
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,830
won't get Liang's support.

376
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,030
They are now cutting ties with him.

377
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,200
Prime Minister Li

378
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,830
is now alone without allies.

379
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,110
Is it time to

380
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
take him out?

381
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
In a few days,

382
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,200
this evil will be eliminated.

383
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,000
You and Pumpkin

384
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,880
can finally go home.

385
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Thank you, Chu.

386
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,350
Don't mention it.

387
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,350
[Anxiang Hall]

388
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,110
What time is it?

389
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,200
Princess Consort.

390
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,160
His Highness

391
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,110
wants you to rest.

392
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,920
I must attend

393
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,680
Wan'er's funeral.

394
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,640
Sorry.

395
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,030
It's His Highness' order.

396
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,160
I can do

397
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,240
anything for you, except let you out.

398
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,270
Mo...

399
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,110
Mo Yu!

400
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,240
Ji Chu

401
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,030
won't let me go

402
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,030
because he thinks
it'll be too much for me.

403
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,550
I wish

404
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,200
someone could show up

405
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,350
and take me there.

406
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,350
Let's watch a show.

407
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,310
Care to join?

408
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,750
Yes.

409
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,030
But Mo Yu...

410
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,160
She is asleep.

411
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,550
She won't remember a thing.

412
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,480
Your Highness.

413
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,070
His Majesty will arrive soon.

414
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,110
Make sure you keep him safe.

415
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,550
Understood.

416
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,070
Your Highness.

417
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,070
It was right not to keep her

418
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,550
in the room.

419
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,340
If Gongge had acted today

420
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
with the Princess Consort around,

421
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,110
there could have been more trouble.

422
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,070
The empress and the emperor arrive!

423
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,070
Father.

424
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Mother.

425
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,790
Yun.

426
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
At ease.

427
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,000
I can't take Ru Jiao's word for it

428
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,160
and believe

429
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,790
Wan'er is dead.

430
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,680
Your Highness.

431
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,920
Wan'er...

432
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,880
I failed you.

433
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,790
If you could hear me,

434
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,350
would you forgive me?

435
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,400
Close it.

436
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,310
Your Highness.

437
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,680
Your Highness.

438
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,030
Everything is ready.

439
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,680
Yun!

440
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Yun!

441
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:27,880
Yun!

442
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,920
Protect His Majesty!

443
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,030
Protect His Majesty!

444
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,880
Your Highness!

445
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,480
Protect His Majesty!

446
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:36,960
Quick!

447
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,350
Your Highness.

448
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,510
Your Highness!

449
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Protect His Majesty!

450
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,750
Yun!

451
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,000
His Highness...

452
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,030
Protect His Majesty!

453
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
Protect His Majesty!

454
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,640
Yun!

455
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,000
Stop!

456
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,070
Ji Chu, save Ji Yun!

457
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,270
The Demon Poison acts

458
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,440
as an antidote too!

459
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,030
Your Highness!

460
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,000
Move aside!

461
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,070
Your Highness!

462
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,160
Yun!

463
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,200
No! Yun!

464
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,270
No!

465
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,590
Yun!

466
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,000
Come.

467
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,070
Drink this.

468
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,350
Quick.

469
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Empress.

470
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,790
What are you holding?

471
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,750
Ji Chu! Give it back!

472
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,200
This is all
the Demon Poison I have left!

473
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,000
My...

474
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,000
Had I not lied
about it being the antidote,

475
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,070
you never would've

476
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
handed it over.

477
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,790
Ji Chu! How can you...

478
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,400
Your Highness.

479
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,160
Yun!

480
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,030
Send the crown prince

481
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,030
back to his residence.

482
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,750
Yes.

483
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,200
Qing.

484
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,030
Are you hurt?

485
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Send the empress to her room.

486
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,790
She must never leave

487
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,790
without my permission.

488
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,200
Yes.

489
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,680
Your Majesty!

490
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,640
Please hear me out!

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Your Majesty!

492
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,750
Seize her.

493
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Your Majesty! I can explain!

494
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,070
Your Majesty!

495
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,640
[Xuanze Hall]

496
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,880
Are you hurt?

497
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,110
It's all right.

498
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,880
I appreciate the concern.

499
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,160
Chu.

500
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,590
I think you owe me

501
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,880
an explanation.

502
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,960
Why did you have

503
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
the antidote of the Demon Poison?

504
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,510
I am very close with Physician Su's son.

505
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
He developed the Demon Poison.

506
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,160
He must have developed an antidote.

507
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,830
Did you use the Demon Poison

508
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,270
on Yun?

509
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,880
It wasn't me.

510
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,000
You don't believe me?

511
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,830
I do.

512
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,200
The empress was behind my mother's death

513
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,830
15 years ago.

514
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,550
She took out her Demon Poison

515
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,880
right in front of you.

516
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
We have the evidence.

517
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,680
What happened to Yun

518
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,440
was the result of the empress sins.

519
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,270
Chu.

520
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,400
I failed to keep your mother safe

521
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,000
15 years ago.

522
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,510
Father.

523
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,270
At this point,

524
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,550
won't you

525
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,750
prove her innocence?

526
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,200
Bring me the imperial decree.

527
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,110
Yes.

528
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,030
This is the imperial decree
I enacted recently.

529
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,350
Chu.

530
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,510
Have a look.

531
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,680
Liang has prospered.

532
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,640
I've been on the throne
for over three decades.

533
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,830
I am aware of my advanced age.

534
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,440
I've grown weary.

535
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
The throne shall be

536
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
succeeded by Crown Prince Ji Chu.

537
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,480
I will reside in the mountains

538
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,880
as the Retired Emperor.

539
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,270
Before I pass down the throne,

540
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,200
my beloved Imperial Consort Xian

541
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
is given the posthumous title
Imperial Concubine Tai Ming.

542
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,510
She is allowed to be buried

543
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,400
in the Imperial Tomb after my passing.

544
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,480
Thank you, Father.

545
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,550
Thank you for saving her some dignity.
