Qing's reaction toward

is quite normal.

If Ji Chu can't confirm my identity,

How can

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,360
you handle me so roughly?

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
I hate it the most
when someone plays tricks on me.

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,560
You are the one

56
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,070
who played tricks on me first.

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,430
This is the Prince Lv Residence.

58
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,600

Looks like the robe and shoes

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,000
They indeed suit me very well.

65
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,120

that I'm Hua Qingge, right?)

(I won't admit it
no matter what you do.)

During Lady Wuxue's case,

what you were thinking,

I wouldn't be brought here by you.

74
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,070
It's just because I'm cleverer than you.

Whatever.

the robe and shoes for me

87
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,600
because you like me

88
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,310
and want to marry me?

First,

It's best if you can
place your love somewhere else.

You are the role model for all butlers.

130
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,630
Of course I know you.

131

You

132
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,480
are quite sensible.

133
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,750

(will be good for my rest.)

136

But it won't do you any good
to butter me up.

137
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,240

Wait.

141
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,360
Since I'm a lowly servant,

142
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,870
you can ask me to wash the clothes, cook

143
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,550
or even clean the toilet.

144
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,550
But climbing up the beam?

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,670

This is His Highness's order.

147
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,630
I'm just

I climb up to the beam?

153
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,200

So you can definitely climb up.

157

His Highness also said

158
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,030
that you don't have to do anything else

during

your stay in the Prince Lv Residence.

161
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
You just need

162
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,190
to stay on the beam every day.

163
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,750
What if I don't?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,440
We have many guards in the residence.

165
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,670
They can

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,200
help you to get onto the beam.

167
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
Forget it.

168
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,510
I can get onto the beam myself.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,150
Don't worry, Miss Qing.

170
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,270
Although your job

171
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
is simple and easy,

172
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,960
you'll still get paid.

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,910
Besides,
food and accommodation are included.

174
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,200
Thus, please stay on the beam

175

for 16 hours every day.

176

Miss Qing.

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,390
I still have other things to do.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
Please go up now.

180
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,510
What...

181
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,550
Let's go.

The chef in my residence

185

187
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,480
I don't have the appetite.

that it was really Chu

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
who framed Ji Yun.

193
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,440
Not only that,

194
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,840
even Qing,

195
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
your cousin from Fuyu,

196
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,390
was killed by Chu.

197
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Wan.

198
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,200
Where are you going?

199
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,870
I'll go to the Prince Lv Residence now
to ask him myself.

200
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,600
You...

201
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,200
Mister Song.

202
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,030
You can get back to work first.

203
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,150
I'll wait for Chu at the pavilion ahead.

204
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes, Your Highness.

205
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,200
Your Highness.

206
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,510
There's no one else here.

207
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,750
Since Chu's wedding,

208
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,910
this is my third time

209
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,120
visiting the Prince Lv Residence.

210
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,360
But I have yet to see

211
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,510
my sister-in-law.

212
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,670
Prince Lv said

213
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,080
that Princess Consort Lu could not
meet you

214
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,120
because she was sick after the wedding

215
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,670
due to the difference in climate here.

216
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
But Qi said

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,630
that she was killed by Chu.

218
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,960
He also said that Chu framed Ji Yun

219
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,480
for the Lady Wuxue case.

220
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,480
Your Highness.

221
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,960
Don't overthink it.

222
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,150
I'm sure Prince Qi

223
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,840
was just trying to scare you.

224
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,390
Chu has finally

225
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,870
come back from Nanjing.

226
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,200
I thought

227
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,840
that the four of us could go back

228
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,320
to how we were when we were young.

229
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,670
But I was too naive.

230
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,150
If you believe

231
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,200
what Prince Qi said,

232
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,320
why do you want to visit

233
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,390
the Prince Lv Residence today?

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,320
There's no such thing
as too difficult or too easy.

235
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,360
If you work on it,

236
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,150
even difficult things can become easy.

237
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,120
If you don't,

238
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,960
even easy things can become difficult.

239
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,150
So, even though

240
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,360
it's difficult to get along

241
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,200
with Chu,

242
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,630
I'm still going to do it.

243
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
I believe

244
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,550
that the four of us

245
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,150
can go back to how we were
when we were young.

246
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,000
Let's go.

247
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,200
Why is there fish here?

248
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,910
Two cups of tea.

249
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
And a half-played weiqi game.

250
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,600
Chu was playing a weiqi game
with someone just now.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
At the beginning of this game,

252
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,630
they were equally matched.

253
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,030
But in the second half of the game,
it was obvious

254
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,560
that the white stones were losing.

255
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
But

256
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
who was playing the white stones?

257
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,240
That person lost his patience
as the game went on.

258
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
He was greedy

259
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,790
and it cost him the game.

260
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,390
Is it because

261
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,150
that person is too worked up lately?

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,030
But after I made some adjustments,

263
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
both black and white stones

264
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,750
are equally matched now.

265
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Who are you?

266
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,870
Are you

267
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,790
the gardener of the Prince Lv Residence?

268
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,270
No.

269
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,000
Who are you, then?

270
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,390
I am

271
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,480
indeed quite worked up lately.

272
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,670
Please tell me

273
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
what medicine I should take to treat it,
Your Highness.

274
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,550
Chinese thorawax roots,

275
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,390
gentian,

276
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,390
Chinese skullcap

277
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,320
and roasted common gardenia fruit

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,510
are good at cooling you down.

279
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,910
Maybe you can use them
to treat your symptoms.

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

281
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
You are welcome.

282
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

283
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,840
Chu, you are here.

284
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,910
Thank you for your flowers,
Your Highness.

285
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,630
I'll go back and work on my plants now.

286
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,320
Go.

287
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,750
Chu.

288
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
Who is he?

289
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,960
A nobody.

290
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Don't mind him.

291
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,000
I think

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,920
he's a strange person.

293
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,240
What do you mean?

294
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,240
Father said

295
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,960
that the way you play a weiqi game
reflects your personality.

296
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,350
You can read

297
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,070
someone's temper and personality

298
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,790
by looking at how he plays a weiqi game.

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,550
Although

300
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,400
he looks carefree
and live a life of leisure,

301
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
the way he plays the game is laden

302
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,240
with anxiety and secrets.

303
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,110
You could tell

304
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,960
that he played the white stones?

305
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,640
I could tell

306
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,790
that you played the black stones.

307
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Because the way you played
the stones was similar

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,920
to how you played the game
when you were young.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Then, I tried to deduct

310
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,830
who played the white stones.

311
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,160
And he showed up.

312
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,440
You are as clever as ever.

313
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,070
Chu,

314
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,110
where's your wife?

315
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,830
I'm here to visit her.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
She's not feeling well.

317
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,400
You can come back next time.

318
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,680
When?

319
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
Can you give me a specific date?

320
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,400
You'll have a sister-in-law eventually.

321
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,480
You know

322
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,880
that I'm not asking about

323
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,160
your future wife.

324
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,200
But Princess Hua Qingge, my cousin

325
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,000
from Fuyu who came here

326
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,510
half a month ago.

327
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,550
What have you heard?

328
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Did...

329
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,350
Did you do something?

330
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,440
If you already know,

331
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,590
why are you asking me?

332
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,510
I...

333
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,960
Chu.

334
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I don't believe it.

335
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,030
You were not like this

336
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,640
when you were young.

337
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,070
We have all grown up.

338
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
Your Highness.

339
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,350
Send a letter to Gongye Qi.

340
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,350
Ask him

341
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,640
not to visit our residence ever again

342
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,110
and stay away from Ji Wan.

343
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,960
Yes, Your Highness.

344
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,110
Your Highness.

345
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,510
Stop crying.

346
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,030
No matter how difficult it is,

347
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,590
I won't give up.

348
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,270
I believe

349
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,790
that things will get better

350
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,000
between us.

351
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,550
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,640
Don't worry.

353
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,350
Everything will get better.

354
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,830
Your Highness.

355
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,790
Is your left hand feeling unwell?

356
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,750
Why are you clenching your hand
into a fist?

357
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,270
I am

358
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
curious about that man.

359
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,920
After coming back from Nanjing,

360
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Chu has been treating us coldly.

361
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,510
But he played a weiqi game with him.

362
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,750
Therefore, I'm sure

363
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,160
that there is

364
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,920
more to them than it seems.

365
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,480
Maybe I can find out

366
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,310
the real reason behind Chu's changes

367
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,000
through him.

368
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,480
Are we going

369
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,350
to look for that person after this?

370
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,160
There's no need to rush.

371
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,790
As long as he visits
the Prince Lv Residence often,

372
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,400
I'll run into him eventually.

373
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,130
Chinese thorawax roots, gentian,
Chinese skullcap

374
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,270
and roasted common gardenia fruit
are good at cooling you down.

375
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,920
Maybe you can use them
to treat your symptoms.

376
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,030
Young Master.

377
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,880
Young Master.

378
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,750
You've been looking

379
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,200
at these four medicinal herbs
the whole afternoon.

You are the best physician in the world.

Won't it be ridiculous
if someone finds out

383
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,070
that someone else

384
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,480
has given you a prescription?

A physician can't treat himself.

386
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,200
It's common for a physician

388

Why are you here in my study

404

so early in the morning?

405
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,440
I heard that you didn't
return to the palace.

run into someone there?

I'm just curious.

Since young,

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,510
you've liked fish.

420
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
But you never had a pet fish.

421
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,200
You've always liked weiqi games.

422

Is that wrong?

426
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,880
You used to say

427
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,350
that fish would have more freedom
