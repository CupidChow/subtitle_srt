13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
[Episode 8]

14
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,590
I've already put in so much effort.

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,870
Why does

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,200
Ji Chu show no signs

17
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,070
of changing at all?

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,960
Your Highness,

19
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,240
Qing has been acting strange lately.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,030
For some reason,

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
she became very close to Prince Lv.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
She fancied Chu in the first place.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,190
I guess

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
she's getting what she wished for.

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,520
It's fine as long as she's safe.

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,240
Qing actually fancies Prince Lv?

27
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,630
But I do think

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,310
Prince Lv is nicer to Qing

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
lately.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,910
Miss Lin,

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
there were plenty of cases
in the East Office lately.

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,190
It must've been tough on you.

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,150
The male lead is here?

34
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,870
This is great.

35
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,590
My main couple storyline

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,150
is finally starting.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,630
What plot did you intend to devise?

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Nothing.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,030
It's nothing.

40
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,030
Is that Miss Lin?

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,360
No. You must be mistaken.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,630
Feng,

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,840
are you satisfied with Miss Liu?

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,190
What if I say I'm not?

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
This marriage was arranged by me.

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
Your father has already agreed to it.

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,360
You have to say yes.

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,470
Besides,
Imperial Physician Liu's daughter

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,840
is intelligent, virtuous,

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,190
gentle, and charming.

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,080
She can look after you

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,630
since you're so careless.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,680
In my opinion,

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,750
she's a great match for you.

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,960
Look after me?

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,310
So, did I get myself

57
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,430
another mother?

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,400
What are you saying?

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,590
Nothing.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,910
Someone.

61
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,520
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
I will hold a banquet

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
in the palace in two days.

64
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,520
I will announce
the second prince's engagement.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
By then, I will invite

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,190
all nobles to the banquet.

67
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,750
Those who do not attend the banquet

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,430
will be disrespecting me.

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,240
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
I will get to it immediately.

71
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,800
Besides that,

72
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,190
invite Prince Lv and his consort

73
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,430
to the banquet as well.

74
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,510
Tell them that I've reserved

75
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,240
the best seats for them.

76
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,040
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,630
Mother,

78
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,160
didn't you say

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,070
that Chu was someone
we shouldn't trifle with?

80
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,040
And, you knew

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,600
that he killed the royal consort.

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,240
And now, you're inviting him
and his consort

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,830
to the banquet.

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,480
Aren't you doing this on purpose?

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,870
That's right.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,190
But why?

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,680
The East Office

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,270
was supposed to be yours,

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,680
but he just had to interfere.

90
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,240
He annoys me.

91
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,430
I'll let him know

92
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,270
that I'm not someone
to be trifled with either.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,360
That empress is something else.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,600
When she knew

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
that the crown prince might lose
his position in the East Office,

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,040
she tried to please His Majesty

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,750
and recommended Ji Chu

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,630
to take over the East Office.

99
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,560
He's provoking me on purpose here.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,950
Mother,

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,950
I'm sure you're overthinking it.

102
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,160
Her Majesty just thinks

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
that I'm not good enough

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
to manage the East Office.

105
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,040
That's why she recommended Chu.

106
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,830
Besides,

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,510
Father also intended
to select Chu for the post.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,830
That's why

109
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,270
he took over the East Office.

110
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,000
Why do you always praise others

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,240
and undermine yourself?

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,360
It's because

113
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,430
I know my capabilities fully well.

114
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,950
I don't wish to manage something
I cannot handle.

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,120
Besides,

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,950
isn't it better to be rich

117
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,000
and free?

118
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,160
You!

119
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,480
Why do I have a son like you?

120
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,630
I have something to do in the residence.

121
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll make a move first.

and courageous!

125
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,630
Why did I give birth

126
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,190
to a useless fool like him?

[Noble Ambitions, Lofty Aspirations]
Your Highness,

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,190
no one in the imperial court
ever inquired about

129
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,190
Hua Qingge.

130
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,480
But now, Imperial Consort Wei

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
is inviting you and your consort

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,190
to the banquet.

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
What exactly is her motive?

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
A banquet?

135
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Could it be the engagement banquet

136
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,070
between Ji Feng and Liu Xiang?

137
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,070
She did provide me

138
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
with an opportunity here.

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,040
Your Highness, do you mean
you want to do it

140
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,070
in public?

141
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,800
However,

143
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm a little worried.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm no longer worried.

145

What are you doing here?

I'm his servant.

What are you doing here?

151
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,950
I heard about Feng's banquet.

152
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
That's why I came to check on you.

153
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,070
What do you think?

154
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,070
Unless, we allow
your real wife to come back.

155
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,950
I have a great idea.

156
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,190
Your Highness,

157
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,190
bring me with you.

158
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,920
You want to go?

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,390
I haven't been to the palace before.

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,680
I wish to check it out.

161
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
If so, you can tell me

162
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,270
about your great idea.

163
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,120
How can you resolve the issue

164

where I lack a consort?

165
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,190
Your Highness,

166
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,480
I heard that your consort

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,000
was the princess of Fuyu.

168
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,560
She just married into Liang
not long ago.

169
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,600
Only the empress

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
knows what she looks like.

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,680
You just need to find someone

172
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,430
to impersonate the consort.

173
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,160
This won't do.

174
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,870
You'll be deceiving the emperor.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,750
Moreover,

176
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,000
Mother has seen Qing before.

177
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,190
I don't think your mother

178
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,510
will expose her in public.

179
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,630
After all, this concerns the diplomatic
tie between the two kingdoms.

180
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,870
Great idea.

181
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,750
I'm sure Ji Chu will
stir up trouble again

182
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,190
on Ji Feng's engagement banquet.

183
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,630
This time, I must stop him.

184
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,120
You look like a suitable candidate.

185
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,270
A suitable candidate?

186
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,830
What do you mean?

187
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,320
You can impersonate my consort.

188
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,200
Your Highness,

189
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

190
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,030
I've testified for the case

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,870
with Lady Xue in court before.

192
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,360
Everyone knows who I am.

193
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,630
If I impersonate the consort,

194
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,910
I'm afraid they'll see through me.

195
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
Even I'm not afraid of it.

196
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,550
What are you afraid of?

197
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,270
I'm not afraid.

198
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,960
Prince Lv,

199
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm doing this for your sake.

200
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,630
If you wish to attend the banquet,

201
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,030
this is the only identity you can use.

202
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,690
[Invitation Letter]

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Your Highness,

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,080
Imperial Consort Wei invited
you and your consort

205
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,390
to the banquet specifically.

206
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm sure she has

207
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
calculated everything.

208
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,150
She intends to convict you of

209
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,030
deceiving the emperor.

210
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,150
And now, you want me
to impersonate your consort?

211
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,200
If so, we'll be playing into her hand.

212
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,670
Regarding that,

213
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
I think I can ask Mother to help us out.

214
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,670
After all,

215
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,870
my mother is the only person

216
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
who has seen Qing before.

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,750
As long as she thinks that you're Qing,

218
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,750
Chu won't be convicted

219
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,870
of deceiving the emperor.

220
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,960
Your Highness,

221
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I thought you disagreed

222
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,440
with my suggestion just now.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Indeed.

224
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,790
But now,

225
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
there's no other solution, am I right?

226
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,150
Chu,

227
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,910
if you bring Qing to the banquet,

228
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,480
and if I ask Mother to help us

229
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,630
to verify her as your consort,

230
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,600
that means

231
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,390
she'll be your consort for real.

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
You have to consider that

233
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,550
very carefully.

234
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,630
Since I've intended to do so,

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,150
I will bear the consequences myself.

236
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,200
Does that mean

237
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,550
I'm going to become

238
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,480
the devil's consort again?

239
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,320
I actually implicated myself again

240
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
to stop him

241
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
from causing trouble, huh?

242
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,550
Help the consort to get changed.

243
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes, Your Highness.

244
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,080
Since you've allowed me
to enter the palace,

245
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,510
I won't let you get your way again.

246
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,750
So,

247
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,910
what's your name?

248
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,910
Your Highness,

249
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm Mo Yu.

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,790
I'll be your servant

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,960
starting from today.

252
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,600
That's a great name.

253
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,240
Your Highness, please stand up
and get changed.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,750
Ji Chu actually sent someone

255
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,030
this powerful to serve me?

256
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
What is he up to?

257
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,150
Could it be that he intended to kill me
whenever he liked?

258
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,480
Thank you, Miss Mo Yu.

259
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,600
Your Highness,
you don't need to be so courteous.

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't tell me Ji Chu's true intention

261
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,790
is to verify whether or not

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm the real Hua Qingge
during the banquet?

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,600
Does he intend to assassinate me

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,670
with this fake servant of his?

265
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
But according to the novel,

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Ji Chu attended the engagement banquet

267
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,320
to harm Ji Feng's fiancee,

268
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,150
Liu Xiang,

269
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,150
during the banquet,

270
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,960
thus, reopening

271
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
the case of his mother,

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,270
Imperial Consort Xian.

273
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,360
I shouldn't be his target.

274
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,510
Could it be that he intended
to kill two birds with one stone?

275
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,080
Isn't this

276
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,750
the gold bangle that Hua Qingge
brought from Fuyu?

277
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
I guess I'm cursed to be stuck with it.

278
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Your Highness, are you satisfied with
how you look?

279
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm very satisfied.

280
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,550
Your Highness,

281
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,360
let's go.

282
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,510
Why are you staring at me?

283
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,150
Your Highness,

284
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
can you shift your position

285
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,870
a little

286
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,240
and give me some space to sit?

287
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,480
Sit on the mat.

288
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,670
But why?

289
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,600
Don't forget.

290
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,150
Your true identity

291
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,600
is my servant.

292
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,200
You don't deserve to sit beside me.

293
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,030
Why would you go so far as to test me

294
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,510
if you truly believed
that I was a servant?

295
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,790
Fine, I'll sit on the mat.

296
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,960
I can't afford to offend him now.

297
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,960
Your Highness,

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,790
do you like

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,510
pure and cute ladies?

300
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,320
Or do you like

301
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,630
charming and seductive ladies?

302
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,200
What have those types of ladies

303
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,390
got to do with you?

304
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,750
Initially,

305
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I thought I could

306
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,080
move him with my charm

307
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
before he kills me.

308
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,390
I never expected him

309
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,120
to be an idiot with no sense of beauty.

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,240
I wasted my time on him.

311
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,910
Sir,

312
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
are you heading out?

313
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,550
I'm going to catch a show.

314
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
If so, why didn't you
bring Hong with you?

315
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
It's a thrilling show.

316
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm afraid Hong can't take it.

317
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,150
He's treating a fish and a flower
as his precious treasures.

318
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
My master is a freak indeed.

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,360
Your Highness,

320
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,840
Prince Lv has entered the palace

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,030
together with his consort.

322
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,870
That Ji Chu

323
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,200
actually dared to bring
a fake consort princess with him.

324
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,200
He's pretty bold, isn't he?

325
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,670
Why are you sighing again?

326
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,630
Mother,

327
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,200
today's my engagement banquet.

328
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,670
Can't you just stay put for once

329
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
and not provoke Chu?

330
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,270
Can you do that?

331
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,550
What do you mean by provoke?

332
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,200
He brought a fake consort here

333
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,480
to attend your engagement banquet.

334
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,510
Can't I even tell him off?

335
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,550
Look at you.

336
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,870
Do you know how old you are?

337
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,120
You still can't dress yourself properly.

338
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,960
Feng,

339
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,670
promise me this.

340
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
You should perform well

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,750
during the banquet,

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,630
okay?

343
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,870
I'm just an accessory for the banquet.

344
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm just a tool.

345
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,630
I don't even need to perform.

346
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,750
How could you say that?

347
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm doing this

348
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,120
for your sake.

349
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,150
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,150
I got it.

351
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,030
I'll head to the banquet first.

352
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
What's wrong with this child lately?

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,070
He kept sighing.

354
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,790
Was it because he couldn't breathe well

355
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,920
due to his weak lungs?

356
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,790
I have to find
a reliable imperial physician

357
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
to examine him later.

358
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,830
Your Highness,

359
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,070
we've arrived.

360
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,480
What are you doing?

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,110
I will get off the carriage first.

362
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,790
If so,

363
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,510
why did you make me sit here?

364
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,480
Just for the fun of it.

365
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,920
I can't afford to curse him out yet.

366
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,110
If so, you should keep quiet.

367
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,880
Your Highness, are you done?

368
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,030
May I get off now?

369
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,510
You may.

370
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,400
Are all bossy rulers

371
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,590
as prideful as him?

372
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,790
Major figures are attending
the banquet today.

373
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,200
I hope I can survive

374
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,590
and save Liu Xiang successfully.

375
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
[Liu Xiang, Daughter of the leader
of Imperial Academy of Medicine]

376
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,960
This smells great.

377
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,240
Young Lady,

378
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
today's your engagement banquet.

379
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,270
Why are you still in the kitchen?

380
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,750
My herbal porridge isn't done yet.

381
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,590
I'll keep it on the stove.

382
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,160
It'll be done when I come back.

383
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,960
Xiang,

384
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
[Yang Liusheng,]
it's getting late.

385
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,270
You should depart now.

386
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,480
Father, I was keeping track of the time.

387
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,550
Xiu,

388
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
let's go and get changed.

389
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,110
Yes, Young Lady.

390
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,310
Make haste.

391
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,920
Imperial Consort Wei

392
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,640
has always been prideful.

393
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,200
Why would she

394
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,310
take a liking
to an imperial physician's daughter?

395
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,310
It's not that hard to understand
the logic behind it.

396
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,830
After Imperial Consort Xian's passing,

397
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,110
Imperial Consort Wei

398
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,270
received His Majesty's attention
for 15 years.

399
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,510
And, General Wei has won

400
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,400
one war after another.

401
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,350
He also received the title
of Glorious General.

402
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,510
The Wei family has
all the power in the world now.

403
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,270
If they don't keep themselves in check,

404
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,510
bad things might occur.

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
Glorious General, Wei Zhao, has arrived!

406
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,880
General Wei, please.

407
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,790
Uncle,

408
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,200
you're here.

409
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,480
Prince Qi,

410
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,640
[Wei Zhao, Glorious General]
congratulations on your engagement.

411
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,400
Uncle,

412
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,240
when will you bring me

413
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,310
to the military camp?

414
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,200
The military camp is dangerous.

415
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,480
It all depends on

416
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,160
the will of Imperial Consort Wei.

417
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
All right, then.

418
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,270
What about this?

419
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,070
Your Highness,

420
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,590
I'll request Her Highness's permission
to take you to the military camp

421
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
after the banquet.

422
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,110
Okay.

423
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,070
Thank you, Uncle.

424
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,510
I shall take my seat first.

425
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,110
Duke.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,110
General Wei.

427
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,680
I heard that Prince Lv's consort,

428
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,070
the princess of Fuyu,

429
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,310
Hua Qingge,

430
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,030
would be attending the banquet too.

431
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,880
But I heard

432
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,550
that this princess was born
with a weak constitution.

433
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,310
She died not long

434
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,200
after marrying
into the Prince Lv residence.

435
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,640
That rumor is a bit far-fetched.

436
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,790
However,

437
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,510
if she did die,

438
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,480
Fuyu would never

439
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,310
let us off easily.

440
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
That's why it was kept

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,270
as a secret.

442
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,590
If what you said wasn't true,

443
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,880
who is

444
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,830
the current Princess Consort Lv, then?

445
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,550
You see...

446
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,960
Prince Lv and Princess Consort Lv
have arrived.

447
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
We're pretty early, huh?

448
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,550
The major figures haven't arrived yet.

449
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,200
Prince Lv, Princess Consort Lv, please.

450
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,590
Why are you everywhere?

451
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,830
Prince Qi,

452
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,000
your mother invited me here.

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,880
I've finally arrived
at the beautiful palace

454
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,350
I wrote in my novel.

455
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,270
It's a shame that Ji Chu

456
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
is up to no good again.

457
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,310
How did he

458
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,640
turn Liu Xiang into a monster

459
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,550
in public?

460
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,790
It's you again?

461
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,000
I've already brought you
into the palace.

462
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Why are you still haunting me?

463
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,310
Mr. Hong,

464
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,200
why would you fear me

465
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,070
if you weren't guilty
in the first place?

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,110
What exactly are you up to?

467
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,440
Official Liu, please.

468
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,030
Young Lady Liu, please.

469
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,830
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

470
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,790
Is that Liu Xiang?

471
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,640
She's beautiful.

472
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,920
Sit beside me.

473
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,880
Sit beside me,

474
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,750
and I can protect you.

475
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,640
Official Gao.

476
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,680
Official Li.

477
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,590
Congratulations.

478
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,750
Hello, Miss Liu.

479
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,790
You must be Princess Consort Lv.

480
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,160
I've heard about you.

481
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,960
Am I famous?

482
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,200
I heard that you were bedridden

483
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
after you married into Liang
as you couldn't

484
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
get used to the environment.

485
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,830
Therefore, you've never been outside

486
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,830
before.

487
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
So, I'm notorious, huh?

488
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
I know how to

489
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,920
make medicinal meals
that can cure you of your condition.

490
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,830
I can make them for you

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
if you don't mind.

492
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,830
Sure.

493
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,400
She's so kind.

494
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,270
By the way,

495
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,350
Miss Liu,

496
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,070
do you have any wishes?

497
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,070
To get married to Prince Qi.

498
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,000
Someone actually

499
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,790
fancies a person like Ji Feng?

500
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,790
Don't you know?

501
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,880
Prince Qi Residence

502
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,270
has the best cooks

503
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,640
in the entire Shengjing.

504
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
What has this got to do

505
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,640
with their cooks?

506
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,750
Once I get married to Prince Qi,

507
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,270
I can

508
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,200
learn how to cook from the head cook
in his residence.

509
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
And, I can learn

510
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,830
the best recipes in the world.

511
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,640
Becoming the best cook in Shengjing

512
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,830
is my dream.

513
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,270
You have a noble dream.

514
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,590
What an outstanding girl.

515
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,640
Thank you.

516
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,270
However,

517
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,440
you have to pay for the price
with your marriage.

518
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,790
Is that worth it?

519
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,880
To me, Prince Qi

520
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,000
isn't as useless

521
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,200
as what the rumors made him to be.

522
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,240
Getting married to him

523
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,350
is a great thing for me.

524
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,640
Moreover,

525
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,590
I get to work with
the head cook every day.

526
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,070
I hope you can realize your dream.

527
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Thank you.

528
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Come.

529
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,640
Please.

530
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,350
Official Liu, let's have a toast.

531
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Please.

532
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,960
Official Liu, congratulations.

533
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,590
Congratulations.

534
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,680
Oh yeah.

535
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,160
I remember now.

536
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Ji Chu poisoned Liu Xiang

537
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,750
with the fish dish

538
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,270
in the novel.

539
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,750
This liquor is superb.

540
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,750
Here.

541
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,640
No.

542
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,750
I can't allow a kind lady like her

543
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
to be turned into a monster.

544
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,400
Where are you going?

545
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,790
My legs are numb.

546
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm going to take a walk outside.

547
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,350
I'll be back soon.

548
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,960
There's no fish to be seen, huh?

549
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,110
That means I can make it in time.

550
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,240
Your Highness,

551
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,550
what are we doing here?

552
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,350
We're here to wait.

553
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,110
Wait for what?

554
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,750
We're here to wait until

555
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,350
the current batch of servants
leave the place

556
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,000
and before the next batch of servants

557
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,550
come back.

558
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,640
This is the period

559
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,960
when the Imperial Food Service
is least guarded.

560
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,030
This is the moment.

561
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,050
[Imperial Kitchen]

562
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,960
Mo Yu,

563
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,830
go inside and knock out

564
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,830
the two people.

565
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,640
Your Highness, why are we doing this?

566
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,270
It's because I need to
steal some dishes.

567
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,350
How can I enter the place

568
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,310
if you don't knock them out?

569
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,350
Why are you stealing dishes?

570
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,310
What's with that question?

571
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm a princess consort.

572
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,350
Do I need

573
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,750
to explain myself to you?

574
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,310
You...

575
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,750
Aren't you going to do it?

576
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,960
Fine.

577
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,510
I'll go inside myself.

578
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,590
I'm sure I can't defeat them.

579
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,790
If they arrest me,

580
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,960
I'll shout

581
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,240
that I'm Princess Consort Lv.

582
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,590
If people hear about this,

583
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
your master will be embarrassed.

584
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,480
You can weigh the pros and cons yourself

585
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,480
and decide

586
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,070
whether or not you should help me.

587
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
I understand.

588
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,510
She's so fast.

589
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,350
They were knocked out instantly.

590
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,750
So, the fish dish is the last dish.

591
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,200
Luckily, I made it in time.

592
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,110
Your Highness,
which dish will you be stealing?

593
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,200
I have nothing to choose from.

594
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,960
All the other dishes were served.

595
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,110
This is the last dish.

596
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,000
Your Highness,
you wish to steal all of these dishes?

597
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,160
That's right.

598
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,350
But why?

599
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,030
Which dish belongs to Liu Xiang?

600
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,510
Which dish is it from the second row?

601
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,550
Do I count them in ascending

602
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,030
or descending order?

603
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,510
I got it.

604
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,240
Your Highness, do you intend
to bring them back to our residence?

605
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,920
Nope.

606
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
Since I don't know which dish is which,

607
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,510
I'll pour all of them away.

608
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,480
Ji Chu,

609
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,200
since you told Gongye Qi

610
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,000
to poison the fish dish,

611
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,960
I'll make sure

612
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,960
all of them are gone.

613
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,510
I'll see how you can harm Liu Xiang now.

614
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,310
So, it turns out that
you're one of the imperial musicians?

615
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,070
I am,

616
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,270
but I'm not at the same time.

617
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,830
I'm a jack-of-all-trade.

618
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
I've been to Prince Lv Residence
several times.

619
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,200
But I didn't encounter you there before.

620
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,830
I only found out that
you hadn't played chess

621
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,480
with Chu for some time

622
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,200
after inquiring about you from Qing.

623
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,070
Your Highness,
do you need anything from me?

624
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,200
It seems like you like to play chess.

625
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,880
I like to play chess too.

626
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,920
Therefore, I wish to spar with you.

627
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,070
And,

628
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,590
I'm equal to Chu

629
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,270
when it comes to my chess skills.

630
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,200
I'm afraid

631
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,640
I don't have the time
to play chess with you.

632
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,200
That's fine.

633
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,960
We're living in the same palace anyway.

634
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm sure we can play chess someday.

635
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,480
I don't live in the palace.

636
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,830
So, you aren't an imperial musician?

637
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,160
If so, why are you inside the palace?

638
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,000
One of my musician friends

639
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
was unwell today.

640
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,350
He requested me

641
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,790
to replace him for the banquet.

642
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,400
I see.

643
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
Where do you live, then?

644
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,790
I can go and find you...

645
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,110
Your Highness, that's unnecessary.

646
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,270
I'm sure we'll meet again
if we're destined to meet.

647
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
I live at the Mystic Medicine House.

648
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,070
My name

649
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,310
is Gongye Qi.

650
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,070
Gongye Qi?

651
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,000
So, you're Gongye Qi

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
of the Nangong Physicians?

653
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,590
I thought

654
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,960
you would be an eccentric old man.

655
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,830
I didn't expect you...

656
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,920
So, it turns out

657
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,070
that I was an eccentric old man

658
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,400
in your heart, huh?

659
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,480
You can't blame me for that.

660
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,750
Everyone was praising you

661
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,200
for your medical skills so much

662
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,200
that it made me think

663
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,510
that you were an eccentric old man.

664
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,000
Old mister,

665
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,590
I didn't expect you to be this young.

666
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,200
They do put me on a high pedestal.

667
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,510
Your Highness, is there anything else?

668
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Not really.

669
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,880
However

670
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,680
I'll visit Mystic Medicine House
someday.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
I have a banquet to attend

672
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,270
today.

673
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,270
See you next time.

674
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,920
