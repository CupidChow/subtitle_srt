00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,630
In that case,

197
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,480
based on the novel's story,

198
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,790
he and Ji Chu

199
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,750
will be at each other's throats.

200
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,390
It took great effort

201
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,270
to turn Ji Chu into a good guy.

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,270
He's like a little angel to me.

203
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,870
What should I do

204
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,910
if a fight breaks out between them?

205
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,030
Sister!

206
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
Nanqing.

207
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Slow down.

208
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,200
Sister!

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,270
I've missed you.

210
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,390
Nanqing, watch your steps.

211
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,320
Sister!

212
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,510
Keep it down!

213
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,440
I need my sleep!

214
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,840
You're finally here, Sister!

215
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I've missed you!

216
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,360
Pumpkin!

217
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,200
What's with the noise?

218
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
What are you? A rooster?

219
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,600
Sister,

220
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,840
the tigress is here to eat someone up.

221
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,150
Sister.

222
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,480
Nanqing.

223
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,960
Don't be rude.

224
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
Qing.

225
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,270
Chu, is this Princess Consort Lv?

226
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,390
After we parted ways,

227
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,390
you got married.

228
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,030
Sister, this doesn't count.

229
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,120
When Father goes back

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,960
to Nanjing with us,

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,270
you will marry him.

232
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,080
That counts as a family.

233
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,630
Nanqing,

234
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,200
you're being silly again.

235
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,480
Did you run into any danger

236
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,080
on your way here?

237
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,600
Thanks to your protection,

238
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,630
we had a safe journey.

239
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,120
We'll discuss the details inside.

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,440
This is embarrassing!

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
I met my love rival

242
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
looking like a total mess!

243
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
That was a total disaster.

244
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,200
No.

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,390
How can I salvage this?

246
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,750
Your Highness, where have you been?

247
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I was going to

248
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,000
groom you just now.

249
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
That's it! Mo Yu,

250
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,200
quick.

251
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,550
I need my makeup now.

252
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,790
Let's go.

253
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,270
Chu.

254
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,840
After you left Nanjing,

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,440
the factions there

256
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,840
were eager to make a move.

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,270
Prime Minister Li Dianzhao

258
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,480
even planned to usurp the throne.

259
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,080
He is forming cliques.

260
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,870
He officially questioned
your ability as a regent.

261
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,150
He spread rumors

262
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,550
that you conspired with hostile nations

263
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,320
and were in contact
with Prince Lv to exchange

264
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,390
information.

265
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,200
I did as you said.

266
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,270
I tried to dissolve

267
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,510
Li Dianzhao's faction.

268
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
But I didn't think

269
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,030
he'd try to assassinate Nanqing

270
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,790
when he was out on the street.

271
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,550
I saved Nanqing in time

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and sent him to Liang.

273
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,120
A nation cannot last without its ruler.

274
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,200
By sending him here,

275
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,600
you put yourself in greater harm.

276
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,480
It was the only way I could think of.

277
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,670
Nanqing draws
too much attention in Nanjing.

278
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,150
You're the only one who can help us.

279
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,200
According to my agent,

280
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,550
Li Dianzhao branded you the traitor,

281
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,670
claiming that you wanted to kill Nanqing

282
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,960
to usurp the throne.

283
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,200
His claims have made waves in the city.

284
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
You two

285
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,200
should stay here

286
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,510
to wait it out.

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
We'll discuss our next course of action.

288
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,390
But with no one in the Imperial Court,

289
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,960
Li Dianzhao might use
this chance to rebel.

290
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,910
Don't worry about that.

291
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,150
Li Dianzhao won't get
the throne for now.

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
How so?

293
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,320
Nanyi,

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,910
do you have

295
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,630
the Fish-shaped Token on you?

296
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,550
The Glorious General
was taken out by Li Dianzhao.

297
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,790
At his dying breath,

298
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,440
he handed me the token.

299
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,510
It controls
the 100,000 elite soldiers of Nanjing.

300
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Without it,

301
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,440
Li Dianzhao won't usurp the throne.

302
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,960
However,

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
we must plan our next move.

304
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,360
By the way,

305
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
it seems the assassins
who attacked Nanqing in Nanjing

306
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,510
weren't working for Li Dianzhao.

307
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,840
We found

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
a mysterious tattoo

309
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,670
on the body

310
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,320
of one of the assassins.

311
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,440
A mysterious tattoo?

312
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Is this the tattoo?

313
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,310
Yes.

314
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,350
It seems I underestimated

315
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,160
the empress of Liang
who is known for her virtues.

316
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,550
I never thought

317
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,880
she'd go after Nanjing.

318
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Well?

319
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,240
How do I look?

320
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,070
Gorgeous.

321
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,880
Princess Consort Lv,

322
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,510
you are the most elegant of all.

323
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,030
Where is he?

324
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,270
Where is everyone?

325
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,070
I don't see...

326
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,880
My head. I can feel it falling...

327
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,440
Where is Wei Nanyi?

328
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
Where are you going

329
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,920
dressing like this?

330
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,070
This is my usual appearance.

331
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,240
What do you want?

332
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,830
Sit still. Don't move.

333
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,030
Does it hurt?

334
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,350
I'll try a different way.

335
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,480
Ji Chu.

336
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,790
Are you really

337
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,510
a two-timer?

338
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
You're two-timing me

339
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,960
with Nanyi?

340
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
You should
make a living writing stories.

341
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,550
If I did that here,

342
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,400
all the writers here

343
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,270
would become unemployed.

344
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,920
How conceited.

345
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Take it easy.

346
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,000
Take it easy.

347
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,350
How did you fit all of these

348
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,680
on one head?

349
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,790
Stay still.

350
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm done.

351
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,270
It's a bit messy,

352
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,310
but it looks unique.

353
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,000
Unique?

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,550
I look

355
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,160
like a madman.

356
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,310
I like you anyway.

We'll attend

367
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,200
Xiyao and the crown prince's wedding.

368
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,550
I'll use this chance

369
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,160
to introduce you to my mother.

370
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,830
You need not worry.

371
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,310
She has a kind heart.

372
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
She won't give you a hard time.

373
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,640
Wan.

374
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,200
Are you sure you want to

375
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
spend the rest of your life with me?

376
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,640
Of course.

377
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
I am a beauty

378
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,270
of my word.

379
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,310
Wan.

380
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,270
I, Gongye Qi,

381
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,750
will never let you down.

382
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,790
If you ever did,

383
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,110
I'd hunt you to the edge of the world

384
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,110
and bring you down with me.

385
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,590
Sure.

386
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,880
Chu.

387
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,350
Qing.

388
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,270
We are a family.

389
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,110
There's no need to feel constricted.

390
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,550
No, I'm not.

391
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,790
You shouldn't feel constricted.

392
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,030
Why would she?

393
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,550
Father's home is also her home.

394
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,590
Where is Gongye Qi?

395
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,880
I thought you two were inseparable.

396
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,000
He is busy
with his romantic relationship.

397
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,680
He has no time for us.

398
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,400
Even Gongye Qi has fallen in love.

399
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
It seems

400
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,400
I missed out on too much.

401
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,680
It's all right, Sister.

402
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,680
You were in

403
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,200
Father and Qi's life

404
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,200
for ten whole years.

405
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,830
Your absence is nothing

406
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,350
compared to those days.

407
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,200
When we were little,

408
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
we were inseparable.

409
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,070
We even found our place

410
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,550
outside Nanjing's palace.

411
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,270
We were wayward and reckless.

412
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,830
Tell me about it.

413
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,960
I want to know

414
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,880
your story outside the palace.

415
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,790
I feel like

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,510
an outsider

417
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,240
watching a family-friendly movie

418
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,000
starring these three.

419
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,510
Qing.

420
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,350
Aren't you hungry?

421
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,440
Miss Qing

422
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
is always hungry.

423
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
She almost emptied

424
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,750
the storeroom here.

425
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Pumpkin.

426
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,200
Don't bully my consort.

427
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,350
This is so touching.

428
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,000
He's the dream boyfriend.

429
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,640
Sorry, Qing.

430
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,200
I had spoiled Nanqing.

431
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,000
It's all right.

432
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
He is still a kid.

433
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
[Anxiang Hall]

434
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
Who is writing this story?

435
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,270
I never wrote about them

436
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,350
in my own novel.

437
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,830
When I go back, I'll write about

438
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,680
my childhood memory with Ji Chu.

439
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,920
I bet you'll envy us, First Princess.

440
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,510
The First Princess...

441
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Yeah.

442
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
The young emperor's arrival

443
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,350
was enough to make Ji Yun

444
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,960
attempt murder.

445
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,350
Now that the First Princess is here,

446
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,750
Ji Chu

447
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,920
will become targeted.

448
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,030
Ji Chu would never

449
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,550
put up with this.

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,510
He is certain to retaliate.

451
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,830
Oh no.

452
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,350
The story

453
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,400
is leaving me with no way out.

House Master
of the Mystic Medicine House,

482

outside the palace.

I welcome you.

thanks to your upbringing.

489
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,830
Mother,

490
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
I brought Qi here because

491
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,030
there is something to discuss with you.

492
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,350
Before,

493
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,920
there is something

494
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
I have to tell you.

495
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,680
What is it, Mother?

496
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,550
Your brothers

497
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,510
had already formed their families.

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,030

What?

502
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,110

506
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,200
How could you

507
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,070
decide everything

508
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,550
without discussing it with me?

509
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,160
It's a parent's duty to find
their child a good spouse.

It's in your best interests.

511

That's enough.

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,310
do you want to marry a commoner?

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,640
