00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,750
Hello?

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,920
Is it Dohoe?

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,150
Lee Dohoe?

10
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,780
Juyeong.

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,570
Where the hell are you?

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,970
I couldn't reach you and you didn't go home.

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,560
I messed up my exams.

14
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,730
I have to retake it.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,960
Why are you apologizing?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,730
It has nothing to do with you.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,940
Still, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,740
I'll explain to you when we meet.

20
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,780
Where are you?

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,310
It's a critical point in time for me.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,680
Dohoe.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,280
To be honest,

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,220
I don't understand you this time...

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,900
nor do I want to.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,650
Let's talk later.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
How should I take it?

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,740
Turn around a bit.

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,310
Ready. One, two.

30
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,710
Isn't that Shin Juyeong?

31
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,419
Juyeong!

32
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,930
You're right, it's the guy from Seoul!

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,520
I guess we're classmates now.

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Why are you here?

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,540
Didn't Dohoe come?

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,050
-We were going to ask you that.
-We were going to ask you that.

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,800
-Jinx!
-Ouch!

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,260
I was going to ask you that.

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,530
So he isn't contacting you too.

40
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,630
Don't worry too much.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,350
He's always done well, so he'll be fine.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,800
Dohoe...

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,860
said that because of something unrelated to me,

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,290
he screwed up his exams, and that it's a critical point in time for him again.

45
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,670
-Come on.
-Come on.

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,060

-Two.

-In one go!

-Hey!
-Hey!

57
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,800
Where are you going?

58
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
What's with him and snow?

59
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,410
Gosh.

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,650
That fool.

61
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,090
He goes crazy whenever it snows.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,510
I waited quietly

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,440
for that day to be over.

64
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,480
After that day,

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,800
I want to tell him everything.

66
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,800
How could you...

67
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,670
How could you...

68
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,530
Who the hell did this to you?

69
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,990
Stairs. Stairs.

70
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,050
The college entrance exams are over.

71
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,370
Why didn't you call me?

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,360
You fool.

73
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,850
How could you...

74
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,110
-Don't you think about the person waiting?
-Sorry, I'm out.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,010
You cry whenever it snows,

76
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,940
repeating the same thing.

77
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,850
If I meet the bastard who made you cry,

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,079
I'll teach him a lesson.

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,990
I don't know him.

80
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,290
But since that day,

81
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,550
we've never met once.

82
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,490
Goodness.

83
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,990
I was abandoned again.

84
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,659
Grandmaster never saw Dohoe too.

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,200
Because of me.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,410
Grandmaster, I'm here.

87
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,750
Why do you keep coming to Haseong?

88
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,410
Because you feel guilty?

89
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,740
He's Dohoe's father.

90
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,810
And 12 years went by.

91
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,860
Take off your coats and bags,

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,010
and get ready.

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,659
-Yes.
-Yes.

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,690
No phones are allowed in here.

95
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,970
Warm up first.

96
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,750

112
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,690
There's a gym right beside us by people from Hohoon University.

113
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,620
How can they open a gym within 500 meters?

114
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,340
Taekwondo's already less popular because parents prefer academic classes.

115
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,430
As fellow taekwondo athletes, they can't even have some manners.

116
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,800
So did you fight it out with them?

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,790
They've put up their sign. What can I do about it?

118
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,370
Let's just go eat.

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
I... have a sudden appointment.

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,220
You said you wanted to have stir-fried chicken yesterday.

121
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,460
Let's eat it next time.

122
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,950
Next time?

123
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,300
Even if we're friends, where are your manners?

124
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,690
I didn't eat supper last night because of you!

125
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,020
I'll treat you next time, okay?

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,970
Next time.

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,400

Here.

131
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,730
I ordered three servings of, what, stir-fried chicken?

132
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,659
Did I order it right?

133
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,990
You should've ordered more.

134
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,540
I'll do it.

Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

139
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,350
I had to go to a nearby gym, so I stopped by.

140

How long are you going to be an instructor?

141
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,640
What?

142
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,900
It's time to open your own gym.

143

The rent alone is a headache.

144
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,550
I can't beat athletes from the national team.

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,010
And there are countless taekwondo gyms everywhere.

146
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,200
You've grown so tall for nothing.

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,930
You should have worked harder.

148
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,600
I know.

-Right?

-The place that rents the whole building.
-Mm.

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,080
Wait. Be careful. Slowly.

188
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,290
What's 3 times 124?

189
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,400
High five.

190
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,380
High...

191
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,850
The kids don't like you anymore.

192
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,510
Why?

193
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,440
Because I ask them math questions?

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,730
Maybe?

195
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,420
You can know someone by the questions they ask.

196
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,400
Huh?

197
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,750
When is the happiest time in your life?

198
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,750
You should ask deeper questions like this.

199
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,080
You're so smart, Gwangmo.

200
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,290
Like my parents, I'll make it to Hanseol University.

201
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,570
That's still many years away!

202
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,240
Take your time! You look tired.

203
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,050
Take over...

204
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,670
my taekwondo gym.

205
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,840
What?

206
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,310
I told you to take over my gym.

207
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,520
Dohoe Taekwondo gym?

208
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,180
I'm old now.

209
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,280
Other gyms are led by young kids.

210
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I want to retire.

211
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,820
Are you interested?

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,160
It's too sudden.

213
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,550
Take over.

214
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,000
You said you'd be my son.

215
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,320
Though a son who fights with his fists is immoral...

216
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,450
Grandmaster, you said you wouldn't bring this up again.

217
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,840
Please.

218
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,550
Okay?

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,540
The person you have reached is not available...

220
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,130
Breaking news.

221
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,240
Around 5:40 p.m.,

222
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,550
around the Gyeongbu Expressway intersection in Haseong,

223
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,020
eight vehicles collided successively,

224
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,030
including five cars and a bus.

225
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,140
Among the drivers and passengers

226
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,640
in this accident,

227
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,540
three died and thirteen were sent to the hospital...

228
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,870
Hello?

229
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,720
Grandmaster.

230
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,960
Hey, Byunggyu.

231
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,740
(Cremation Room 5, Lee Joongseok) (Son: Lee Dohoe)

232
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,740
Juyeong.

233
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,060
Juyeong!

234
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,670
Dad.

235
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,380
He's Juyeong,

236
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,480
Grandmaster Lee's student.

237
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,010
Oh.

238
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,620
I hope his son gets here soon.

239
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,290
It rarely snows here.

240
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,650
To think it's snowing so much now.

241
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,600
Want one?

242
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,730
But I heard you quit.

243
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,290
I'm teaching kids.

244
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,660
Nam Seongmin also quit smoking

245
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,070
since he's teaching kids.

246
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,120
Guys.

247
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,480
You're here.

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,090
Yeah.

249
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,540
You're already smoking?

250
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,440
How long has it been?

251
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,040
Shin Juyeong.

252
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,770
Are you okay?

253
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,100
I heard a classmate's parents passed away in this accident too.

254
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,940
What a tragedy.

255
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,880
What a huge accident in our little countryside.

256
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,480
Wow. Look at that handsome car.

257
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,900
It looks good with the snow.

258
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,480
Look at that shade of white. Amazing.

259
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,810
Isn't it an imported car?

260
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,190
It's from Germany. Germany.

261
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,870
Germany.

262
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,420
Isn't that Dohoe?

263
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,190
Huh?

264
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,620
No way.

265
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,920
It's him!

266
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
-I told you it's not.
-It is Dohoe.

267
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
Isn't that Hyeonho with him?

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,440
Hyeonho?

269
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,700
Gosh, you're right.

270
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,710
-Hey.
-It's Dohoe!

271
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,000
Dohoe! Hyeonho!

272
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,250
What? It's Dohoe!

273
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,420
Dohoe? Hey, Lee Dohoe!

274
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,020
Hey, Dohoe!

275
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,500
Goodness.

276
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,930
How have you been?

277
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,000
I thought you weren't coming.

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,110
I know, right?

279
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,450
Long time no see.

280
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,810
Thank you for coming.

281
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,850
I didn't expect you to come.

282
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,900
Have you all been doing well?

283
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,980
-Yes.
-Oh... Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,880
-What's this?
-Huh?

285
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,550
Let's go in.

286
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,230
Let's go in.

287
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,260
At least he still came to his father's funeral.

288
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,650
Yeah, of course.

289
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,690
(Dacham Hospital)

290
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,480
-Where's our seat?
-Let's go in.

291
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Okay.

292
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,849
Let's go inside.

293
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,680
Hey, what happened? I heard you weren't in touch.

294
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,140
Why did you come together?

295
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,010
Think about Dohoe's stance.

296
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,210
Wow, you speak like you're from Seoul now.

297
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,200
What's wrong with you?

298
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,900
Are you no longer using your dialect?

299
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,080
You guys are still the same.

300
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
So cool.

301
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,070
You're so cool now.

302
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,550
How have you been?

303
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,850
Why are you speaking formally with him?

304
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,610
Hey, look! Son!

305
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,510
What?

306
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,220
Isn't that Dohoe?

307
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,280
Yes, that's right.

308
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,380
Not a single tear even though his father passed away.

309
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,740
Eat up. Eat up. Sorry. Eat up.

310
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,740
What's going on between you and Dohoe?

311
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah, what happened between you and Dohoe?

312
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,150
Tell us the truth.

313
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,820
It's nothing.

314
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,360
When I was a freshman,

315
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,350
I saw him at Hanseol University.

316
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,050
Hanseol...

317
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,140
I knew it.

318
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,110
Korea's top university.

319
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,600
I have a good friend who studied there,

320
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,270
so I went there often.

321
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,870
I did hear that he got into Hanseol University.

322
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,670
I want to go to Seoul too.

323
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,000
-Gosh, impressive.
-By the way...

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,450
Seongmin, you became a teacher.

325
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,690
What about you, Byunggyu?

326
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm doing real estate here,

327
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,530
like my father.

328
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,120
You'll need help when carrying the coffin.

329
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,550
-I'll come back then.
-Okay.

330
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,750
-Let's go.
-Okay.

331
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,430
I'll be at my parents' place. Call me if you need help.

332
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,860
You must be busy. Go back.

333
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,850
See you in Seoul.

334
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,880
No.

335
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,980
It'd be great if he comes carry the coffin.

336
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,530
It's supposed to be done by the deceased's friends.

337
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,390
I still have time to spare. My dad's coming soon too.

338
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,770
Go home and rest.

339
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,510
Okay, then. Take care.

340
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,220
Should you wear this funeral armband instead?

341
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,110
I heard you'd been in touch.

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,880
You're really something.

343
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,650
Would you like anything else?

344
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,740
Yes.

345
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,910
Okay, I'll bring it right away.

346
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,390
This was so sudden.

347
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,380
Isn't this Juyeong?

348
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,670
Poor you.

349
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,260
It must be tough on you, Juyeong.

350
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,820
You must've been startled.

351
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,310
-I'm fine.
-How's that... Dohoe been doing in Seoul?

352
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,130
-How long has Dohoe been gone?
-Ten years?

353
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,400
Ten years? More than that.

354
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,610
Look at that brat.

355
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,370
He's not even greeting us.

356
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,760
He's such a rude kid.

357
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,400
His father passed away, but he's...

358
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,790
(Lee Dohoe)

359
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,920
He'll be cremated,

360
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,520
so you won't be carrying the coffin for too far.

361
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,020
Can the one who'll carry the memorial portrait step forward?

362
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,870
Yes, I'll do it.

363
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,850
Let's talk somewhere else.

364
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,670
I'm already delayed at work because of the funeral.

365
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,790
I have to go.

366
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,530
Where have you been?

367
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,830
-I've been in Seoul.
-Where in Seoul?

368
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,870
Don't you have anything to say to me?

369
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,860
Juyeong.

370
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,440
I think I'm finally free.

371
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,470
I'll see you again if need be.

372
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,480
I'm glad you look fine too.

373
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,400
Well...

374
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,330
Contact me if you need my help.

375
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,270
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

376
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,150
Let's go.
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

377
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,110
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

378
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,400
Are you okay?

379
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,380
No, I'm not.

380
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,560
Attention.

381
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,990
Salute.

382
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,540
-Taekwondo!
-Taekwondo!

383
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,930
Taekwondo. Good work, everyone.

384
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,340
-Taekwondo.
-Bye.

385
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,790
-Bye.
-Bye.

386
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,110
Take your belongings.

387
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,860
Did you come back yesterday?

388
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,740
Yes, last night.

389
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,990
You came later than promised.

390
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,980
Because of you,

391
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,740
do I have to tuck my tail between my legs

392
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,400
and beg those guys from our rival gym to drive our students around?

393
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm sorry.

394
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,430
You look very tired.

395
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,370
You were spacing out during class.

396
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,350
I'm not tired. I just don't know what to do.

397
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,850
What else can you do? Get over it.

398
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,140
I know you don't have much empathy,

399
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,160
but do you have to be so direct?

400
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,470
I really don't get the big fuss about empathy.

401
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,330
Just go drive the kids.

402
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,980
Drop them off at that English tutoring center.

403
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,710
Even the younger ones

404
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,500
attend that center?

405
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Yeah, they do.

406
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,450
Everyone's there now.

407
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
More of our kids dropped out.

408
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
Right. By the way,

409
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Cheolmin and Kanghyun's out too.

410
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,910
Suddenly?

411
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,870
They enjoyed taekwondo.

412
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,980
You're a taekwondo instructor,

413
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,210
not a driver offering free rides.

414
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,260
I told the parents you can't drive into the alley,

415
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,870
so they quit.

416
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,080
To be honest...

417
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,940
Juyeong.

418
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,980
Mm?

419
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,220
I don't know. I'm drained.

420
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,530
I shouldn't say this right now.

421
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,680
But you should look for other jobs.

422
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,090
You want me to quit too?

423
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,440
I don't have many students. Do I even need two instructors?

424
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,260
I can't believe you.

425
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,600
Mr. Shin! Are you angry?

426
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:59,940
(Hongik Ihwa Taekwondo)

427
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,040
-Taekwondo.
-Taekwondo.

428
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,130
Good job.

429
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,120
-Taekwondo.
-Taekwondo.

430
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,780
Slowly.

431
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,700
Taekwondo.

432
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,750
You've to exercise and learn English. It must be hard.

433
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,100
You look more tired.

434
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,770
-Taekwondo.
-Taekwondo.

435
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,230
-Taekwondo.
-Taekwondo.

436
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,000
-Hello, Gwangmok's mom.
-Mr. Shin!

437
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,750
He missed the truck.

438
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,020
I see.

439
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,540
I'll go pick him up now.

440
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,640
I'm really sorry.

441
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,560
It's okay.

442
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,140
-Thank you. See you later.
-Okay.

443
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,440
Hello, Gwangmok's mom.

444
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,540
-Thank you, Mr. Shin.
-Hello.

445
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,690
He suddenly didn't have to go to his previous tutoring center,

446
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,220
and I'm busy.

447
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,040
It's okay. It's on my way.

448
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,340
Is your house okay?

449
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,790
Of course. It's thanks to you

450
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,250
that I found a nice and comfortable place.

451
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,730
It's a little small,

452
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,470
but it's a well-built place.

453
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,830
-I hope it becomes your home.
-Okay.

454
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,360
Thank you, Gwangmok's mom.

455
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,180
Mr. Shin, did something happen?

456
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,540
You seem different today.

457
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,140
I'm fine.

458
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,150
-I'll get going. Bye.
-Okay.

459
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,970
Thank you.

460
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,630
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

461
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,170
What is it?

462
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,150
I think Lee Dohoe runs a tutoring center in your neighborhood.

463
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,370
Isn't this the so-called right under your nose?

464
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,800
(Hongik Ihwa Taekwondo)
Isn't this the so-called right under your nose?

465
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,520
Did you know?
(Hongik Ihwa Taekwondo)

466
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,120
Did you know?

467
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,950
Yeah.

468
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,860
You knew?

469
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,420
I just found out.

470
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,770
What about this?

471
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,430
Dohoe has put up his dad's house and gym for sale

472
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,930
through my real estate agency,

473
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,120
when it's only been a day since his father's funeral.

474
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
Hello?

475
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,030
Hello? Can't you hear me?

476
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,510
Is this Seoul?

477
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,270
To be precise, it's Ilsan, Gyeonggi-do.

478
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,410
Didn't you know I was an instructor here?

479
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

480
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,250
I just found out.

481
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,220
Well,

482
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,050
this is your neighborhood.

483
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,020
It's my neighborhood.

484
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,120
I used to come here with you too.

485
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,080
Did we?

486
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,330
I didn't tell you because I didn't want this to happen,

487
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,180
you misunderstanding things and come looking for me.

488
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,860
Lee Dohoe!

489
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,840
Do you work around here?

490
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,570
We're the same age. Speak casually.

491
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,130
Just like before.

492
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,580
It's been a while since I met someone uncomfortable with formal speech.

493
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,910
I'm just glad to see you.

494
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,640
-Are you ready to go?
-Do you really have nothing...

495
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,470
-They're waiting.
-If you have plans...

496
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,040
Let's talk tomorrow.

497
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,050
If you're free now, let's have dinner together.
