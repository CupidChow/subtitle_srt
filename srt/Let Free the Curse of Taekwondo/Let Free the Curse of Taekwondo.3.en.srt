7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,470
G-Grandmaster.

8
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,880
G-Grandmaster?

9
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,200
See you later.

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,830
What do you think?

11
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,170
Interesting.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Going for a double denim look,

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
with a pop of red with the coat.

14
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,100
What about me?

15
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,039
I jazzed it up with

16
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,710
this green shirt.

17
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,660
Not bad.

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,970
Not bad? You should say it's nice.

19
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,060
Yeah?

20
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,620
It's nothing compared to my look.

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,590
What do you want to do there?

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,670
What should we do?

23
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,539
Do you even have money for food?

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,500
We'll just find a way to earn some.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,900
You drew this, right?

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,310
-It wasn't me.
-You're so bad at drawing.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,660
Hey, come here.

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,330
Where are you going? It's this way.

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,590
One minute. I'll show you something fun.

30
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,820
Come here.

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,980
What are you doing?

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,520
-Come in.
-Let's not...

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,440
There are blankets in Seoul. Don't bring one!

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,310
It might get cold in the bus.

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,510
Wow.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,240
Oh, right.

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,150
-I didn't pack this.
-What if Grandmaster sees us?

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,579
-I wanted to study this.
-What are you on about?

39
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,980
Wait. Since I've opened it, let me read a bit.

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,150
Interesting.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,329
Wait. I'm sorry!

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,310
What are you doing?

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,350
Let's go.

44
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,690
(Bus ticket: Haseong -> Seoul)
("Loveable" by Kim Jongkook)

45
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,680
(Bus ticket: Haseong -> Seoul)

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,350
This is real snow.

47
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,450
I told you it snowed yesterday.

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,660
But...

49
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,300
it's different from what you made.

50
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,820
Hey, I worked so hard to make it.

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,920
Well... it's quite similar.

52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,740
(Let the Curse of Taekwondo Be Free)

53
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,050
Is it really okay to visit unannounced?

54
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,670
What if you get caught?

55
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,180
I don't think anyone's here now.

56
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,050
I just need to take my piggy bank in my room.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,070
-No, forget it. Let's just go.
-Why?

58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,930
Shin Juyeong.

59
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,070
Aren't you Shin Juyeong?

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,810
Hello, sir.

61
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,160
Are you visiting home?

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,020
I heard you left Seoul.

63
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,180
Have you been... keeping up with taekwondo?

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,540
Your parents keep having to apologize for your mistakes.

65
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,040
They have it really tough.

66
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,650
Don't let me see you again.

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,700
How haven't you had coffee as a student?

68
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,010
I'm still a student, so I'm holding back.

69
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,220
Pft.

70
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,350
It's really all or nothing with you.

71
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,610
All?

72
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,780
Nothing?

73
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,990
All and nothing?

74
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,220
All but nothing?

75
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,640
What is it?

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,560
What's wrong with you?

77
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,220
Y-You look like a weasel.

78
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,080
You look like a fish.

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,090
-A fish?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,190
What fish? What kind?

81
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,860
Do you have to do all this?

82
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
Just in case.

83
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,490
If it's someone I know,

84
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,890
I might have to listen to an hour's lecture.

85
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,200
Wow, do you understand all that?

86
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,110
I'm just studying.

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
Let me see.

88
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,740
Let me read it.

89

In the Shark's body,

90
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,800
-Pinoccio...
-What's Pinoccio?

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,690
Pinoccio.

92
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,830
It's Pinocchio. Pinocchio.

93
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh, Pinocchio.

94
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,430
Pinocchio finds whom...

95
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,340
There is no time to lose.

96
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,140
We must eskape...

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
It's not eskape but escape.

98
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,260
Oh.

99
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,360
Escape how

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,690
we can run out of the shark's mouth

101
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,120
and dive into the sea.

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,320
I want to read more...

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,060
Just do your job.

104
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,190
If we want to get to Seoul, you should support me to study.

105
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,050
Pft.

106
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,870
Then... I'll read this book.

107
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,420
That book is really hard.

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,990
It's easy.

109
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,340
It says to let go of your greed.

110
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,220
If I live here, I might succeed.

111
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,640
It's not the place but because you're with me.

112
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,450
I've finished it.

113
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,270
How's that possible? It's so thick.

114
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,480
It says to let go of the greed to read too.

(Hanguk Seoul University)

116
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,720
Aren't you curious about me?

117
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,120
What? About your expulsion?

118
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,490
Not really.

119
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,360
What do you want to major in?

120
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,790
Architecture.

121
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,190
Oh? Why?

122
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,220
I just think... it's nice.

123
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,210
Because wherever I am...

124
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,770
I can build a home for myself.

125
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,870
That's cool.

126
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,660
When I turn around, call my name.

127
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,680
Lee Dohoe!

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,640
Did you call me?

129
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Nice! So natural!

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,600
Nice!

131
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,980
No, no. We can't accept minors.

132
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,570
(Hotel)
No, no. We can't accept minors.

133
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,750

No, no. We can't accept minors.

No way!

142
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,670
Is it fun?

143
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,710
Is it fun?

144
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,440
Yeah.

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,490
You look the most suspicious. Keep up.

146
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,610
Do I?

147
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,090
Wait.

148
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,920
I... was expelled because I hit a teacher.

149
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,160
It wasn't intentional.

150
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,230
That teacher always hit my friend.

151
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,020
While trying to stop him, the desk fell down and...

152
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,120
You don't have to explain to me.

153
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,710
I believe you.

154
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,810
I think there are exceptions.

155
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,410
I know there shouldn't be exceptions,

156
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,630
but since it's about you, I didn't want to ask

157
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,360
because I feel like I'll accept it no matter what.

158
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,530
I promise I won't do it again.

159
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,690
And...

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,240
Thank you for understanding.

161
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,110
I thought nobody would understand it,

162
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,430
especially you.

163
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,350
Hey... People will see us.

164
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,920
What do you mean? There's no one here. Stop nagging.

165
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,320
The exam...

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,970
-The exam...
-Well...

167
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,070
-The exam is coming.
-Yes.

168
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,380
-Have you studied?
-Nope.

169
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,530
Let's study then.

170
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,460
They say you suffer whenever you leave home.

171
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,190
Exactly.

172
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,570
You need to train harder,

173
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,410
and I'll study harder. Let's make it to Seoul.

174
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,640
Together.

175
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,740
Whenever I look at you,

176
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,700
I feel stimulated.

177
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,140
What stimulation?

178
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,190
What are you talking about?

179
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,750
I never thought of becoming a national team athlete,

180
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,720
but now I want to try harder and work towards it.

181
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,490
That's what I meant.

182
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,110
What are you thinking?

183
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,310
Huh?

184
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,660
What are you thinking?

185
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,470
Huh?

186
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,670
What are you thinking? Huh? Huh?

187
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,870
-What could I be thinking?
-What are you thinking?

188
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,940
B-Because I'm smart,

189
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,200
I tried to come up with other interpretations. That's all.

190
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,510
If you're smart, you should know

191
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,860
what was trying to be conveyed.

192
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,790
Sentences with just one interpretation are boring.

193
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Woah...

194
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm serious.

195
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,420
For the first time, I have something I want to work towards.

196
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,830
I used to just think about surviving the day.

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,970
Come here.

198
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,600
It's cold.

199
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,500
I like you because you are who you are.

200
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,990
What?

201
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,850
Did you... just say...

202
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,180
you... you like me?

203
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,650
No, wait.

204
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,740
What I meant was...

205
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,970
I did, I said it.

206
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,090
-But a sentence can have various interpretations...
-I'm right.

207
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,280
You said you like me.

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,030
Yes, I did,

209
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,990
but there are different ways of liking someone.

210
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,940
What'd you have done if you slept here with me?

211
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,320
-What do you mean?
-What were you expecting?

212
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,270
What can I expect?

213
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,260
This?

214
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,430
-What's that?
-Ready.

215
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,630
Here I come.

216
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,870
No, no, wait. Okay.

217
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,370
Wait a minute.

218
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,760
Close your eyes and wait.

219
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,860
Close my eyes? I'm getting shy.

220
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,930
-Don't open your eyes.
-Mm.

221
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,170
I almost forgot this.

222
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,000
Ready. Here it comes.

223
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
What is this?

224
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,430
You need something to keep your money.

225
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,900
I bought it on the street of Sinchon.

226
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,360
Hey...

227
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,660
Hmm?

228
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,010
I'm... really touched.

229
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,820
Thank you.

230
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,790
Hey. This... is nothing.

231
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,020
No, thank you so much.

232
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,410
Korea!

233
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,560
Korea!

234
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,510
-Korea!
-I need to sleep.

235
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,520
For 1988 babies,

236
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,240
it's a must to watch the Olympics World Cup.

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,620
In two years, when we're watching the Summer Olympics taekwondo games,

238
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,180
we'd both be of age!

239
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,930
We'd really be of age.

240
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,640
Hey, let's watch it together.

241
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,420
How can you spar like this?

242
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,510
What are you talking about?

243
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,370
You're revealing all your moves.

244
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,500
You don't use fake outs. You've to trick them.

245
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,980
Get up. Again.

246
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,690
I can't do it anymore.

247
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,590
Hurry up.

248
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,450
Get up.

249
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,740
What should I do?

250
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,820
You're good at the back kick,

251
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,420
but your shoulders are already tilted.

252
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,810
So it's obvious.

253
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,230
Tilt like you're doing a back kick

254
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,050
as a fake out, then do a side kick.

255
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,640
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

256
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,290
Of course I'm crazy! How can I not be?

257
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,310
I live with the person I like

258
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,460
and always train together. Dopamine explosion every day!

259
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,330
Be quiet.

260
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,080
-Thank you so much.
-Hey...

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,230
I can't see anything.

262
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,030
It's good that you can't see anything.

263
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,920
Why?

264
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
I told you not to turn on the lights.

265
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,940
I can't see anything.

266
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,410
Moonie!

267
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,640
Moonie?

268
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,350
Wow, you really...

269
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,190
You really are a pervert, you know?

270
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,750
I'm not.

271
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,810
Don't deny it.

272
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,800
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,260
Don't you have anything to confess to me?

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,410
What?

275
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,790
What have you been doing at night?

276
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,920
I've been surfing the internet.

277
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,760
When you first came here, you did something weird.

278
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,280
-What did I do?
-I heard everything.

279
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,579
What did you hear?

280
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,760
Being on the phone with my mom?

281
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,970
Not that.

282
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,950
You were watching porn.

283
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,870
Porn? I don't watch that.

284
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,690
They say it interferes with the formation of proper sexual values.

285
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,970
I heard everything.

286
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,230
Seriously!

287
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,420
I must've clicked a pop-up ad by mistake!

288
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,830
There aren't ads like that.

289
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,790
-Hwang Moonie!
-Gosh.

290
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,300
Change the light.

291
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,830
Need me to change it for you?

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
It's nice like this.

293
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,020
What's nice about this?

294
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,320
By the way...

295
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,180
are you sure this is delicious?

296
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,430
Try it.

297
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,650
Just try it first.

298
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,190
Speak after you try it.

299
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,400
Here.

300
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,940
The owner invented it himself.

301
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,660
I think it's only available here.

302
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,070
Green onions... and fried chicken?

303
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,620
Try it. Just try it.

304
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,260
Try it. Try it together.

305
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,370
In three or four years,

306
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,230
I bet the whole country will be eating this chicken.

307
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,900
-It's good.
-Right?

308
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,680
Mm.

309
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,040
It really... makes me dance.

310
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,380
Fried chicken with spring onions!

311
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,060
-Spring onions. Sprung out of nowhere.
-Sprung out of nowhere!

312
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,920
-Spring onions!
-Spring onions!

313
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,590
There's only one month left.

314
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,350
So don't bother me.

315
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,570
Speak for yourself. Don't come touch me while pretending

316
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,210
to help me with taekwondo.

317
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,930
Me?

318
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,850
Yes, you.

319
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,090
Hey! People will think it's real if they hear you.

320
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,320
But it's true!

321
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,050
What are you talking about?

322
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,750
Anyway, my exam's earlier.

323
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,610
I'll work part-time to get the house deposit ready.

324
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,360
Up to you.

325
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,560
Hello?

326
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,420
Are you prepared and on your way?

327
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,490
Of course.

328
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,270
See if you forgot anything.

329
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,590
(Application for Yongeun University)
See if you forgot anything.

330
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,720
Don't be nervous. Do your best.
(Application for Yongeun University)

331
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't be nervous. Do your best.

332
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,670
Don't worry.

333
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,490
Okay, I trust you.

334
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,840
You don't have to go to school today, right?

335
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,540
Why are you up so early?

336
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,200
To support you.

337
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,230
I'll be back before your college entrance exam.

338
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,240
Up to you.

339
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
I'll make you lunch. Wait for me.

340
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,450
You can't even cook.

341
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,800
Tomorrow is the day of the final battle.

342
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,900
Yes!

343
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,410
-Go on now!
-Okay.

344
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,450
Good luck, everyone.

345
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,890
Bin, do your best.

346
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,900
Please wish me well too.

347
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,240
-Do your best.
-Yes, ma'am!

348
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,460
Go on, guys.

349
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,820
Hey, Dohoe.

350
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,620
-What?
-What should we eat?

351
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,490
Time flies.

352
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,830
Time flies.

353
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,930
Hey, Byunggyu.

354
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,500
Let's go eat tteokbokki.

355
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,210
Hey, how can we eat spicy stuff before the exam?

356
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,300
Lee Dohoe.

357
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,340
How could you not talk to me once?

358
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,470
There he goes again.

359
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,760
Hey.

360
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,770
You were the one who started ignoring us...

361
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,740
Get lost.

362
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,250
It was out of respect.

363
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,370
Respect?

364
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,220
What damn respect is this?

365
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,850
Hey, hey. It's the exams tomorrow.

366
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,760
Why are you doing this now?

367
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,890
You said it's collective punishment.

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,880
If you need to beat me up more to feel better,

369
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,100
do as you wish.

370
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,950
-Don't just try to stop them.
-Damn you...

371
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,050
-Hyeonho!
-Hey, you!

372
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,130
What are you doing? It's the exams tomorrow!

373
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,020
Let go of him while I'm still being nice.

374
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,010
What's going on?

375
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,470
Didn't Shin Juyeong say he's going to Seoul?

376
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,660
Whatever it is, let's talk after the exams.

377
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,430
It's an important opportunity for both of us.

378
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,710
You've to do well too.

379
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,890
What happened? Should I go deal with him?

380
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,000
-Forget it.
-Don't stop me. Hey...

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
My exams are tomorrow.

382
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,660
-Don't make a scene.
-Count yourself lucky.

383
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,420
Hyeonho.

384
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,670
Is there anyone of us who didn't get beaten up by his dad?

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,980
It's not the first time. Why are you like this all of a sudden?

386
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,970
What do you know? Shut the hell up.

387
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,430
-That's not what Byunggyu meant.
-Get lost!

388
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,680
Are you okay?

389
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,210
You really came.

390
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,540
Of course.

391
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,640
I told you I'd prepare your lunch.

392
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,510
Gather all the energy!

393
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
-What are you doing?
-What's wrong.

394
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
You know what...

395
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,690
What?

396
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,700
Nothing.

397
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,630
Let's go. I won't bother you.

398
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,290
It's an important day for you.

399
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,840
The weather is nice.

400
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,480
Why? Is something wrong?

401
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,680
Nothing.

402
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,640
Why? What's the problem?

403
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,800
Nothing. Nothing.

404
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,360
Really. Really.

405
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,930
I'll be quiet. Go study inside.

406
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,590
-I'm... I'm really start studying then.
-Yeah.

407
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,130
I'll give you one last chance.

408
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,930
Three, two, one.

409
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,240
It's really nothing. Nothing.

410
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,790
-I'll study then.
-Okay.

411
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,490
We can hang out after today. Hang in there.

412
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,710
Okay, got it.

413
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,930
I...

414
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,980
really missed you a lot.

415
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,710
-So?
-So...

416
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm not trying to get in your way. I'll just say this.

417
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:02,520
(Acceptance Letter)

418
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,170
I passed!
(Acceptance Letter)

419
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,970
I passed!

420
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,710
Hey.

421
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,170
You should've told me right away!

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,600
And when I was taking the exam,

423
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,210
I was scouted for the national team tryout.

424
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,350
-Really?
-They asked me to prepare for it.

425
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,060
This is insane.

426
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,510
Yeah! So it's your turn now.

427
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,270
But...

428
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,610
You've always done well. I don't need to worry about you.

429
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,590
Hey...

430
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,110
What was that?

431
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,180
Why? Congrats.

432
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,710
From the bottom of my heart.

433
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,120
Hang on.

434
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,200
-Are you okay?
-Don't... Let go.

435
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,350
Let go.

436
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,610
Are you okay?

437
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,540
Gosh...

438
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
This won't do.

439
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,940
What?

440
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,310
I'll just leave.

441
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,820
It'll be better. I'll come back in the morning.

442
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,920
So just study, okay?

443
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,030
-Okay.
-You knew I was already going crazy

444
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,360
because I haven't seen you for a long time.

445
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,940
Hello?

446
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,110
Yes, I'll be there.

447
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,340
Did I wake you?

448
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,610
Sleep well. Don't worry.

449
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,290
Oh, right.

450
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,830
I heard it might snow today.

451
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,280
Good night. See you later.

452
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,460
Come on. Call!

453
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,630
-What is this?
-Hurry over!

454
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh! I heard you passed.

455
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,670
Congrats, kid.

456
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,910
-As always, Lee Joongseok is really good at mentoring.
-Buy me cigarettes.

457
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,070
-Here. Take it.
-It's okay.

458
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,430
-Take it. It's from your elder.
-Take it.

459
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,150
Just take it.

460
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,560
I want these cigarettes.

461
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Get me some water.

462
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,440
Is your son the only one left?

463
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,170
I'm sure Dohoe will get into Hanseol University.

464
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,110
Because it's the exams tomorrow,

465
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,320
Hyeonho's dad left early.

466
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
Should we be playing here?

467
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,500
Grandmaster Lee is

468
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,410
taking a long time with his cards today.

469
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,250
If it's bad, just hurry up.

470
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,320
If Dohoe goes to Seoul...

471
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,800
-Director Lee's freedom will be over!
-Over!

472
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,370
Damn it!

473
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,340
Don't talk to me now! Grandmaster Lee is...

474
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,630
He's not doing well.

475
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,300
Anyway, he's sending his grown-up son away.

476
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,880
It must be hard.

477
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,950
Your wife won't call anymore. How nice is that?

478
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,690
Deal the cards.

479
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,010
-Hurry up!
-Excuse me.

480
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,380
I'm really sorry,

481
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,190
but can you keep your voice down?

482
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,430
It'll be dawn soon and the exams will start.

483
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,340
Please stop.

484
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,410
-Ace the exams!
-Ace the exams!

485
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,630
Ace the exams!

486
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,090
-Ace the exams!
-Ace the exams!

487
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,120
Isn't your exams still going on?

488
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,880
Right?

489
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,090
Clean it up.

490
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,090
That scoundrel Shin Juyeong

491
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,090
came here because he hit his teacher.

492
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,160
His parents told me I must whip him into shape.

493
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,180
He needs to be disciplined more.

494
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,300
Why did you hit him?

495
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,400
Why did you hit Juyeong?

496
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,990
-Why are you hitting others...
-Why?

497
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,850
To whip him into shape, of course.

498
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,560
You seemed to get along well. Got attached already?

499
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,660
He's not as kind as you think he is.

500
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,450
As an athlete, he got physical off the bat.

501
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,960
Unlike his kind parents.

502
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,030
Is it because he's adopted?

503
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,600
It can't be helped if he's born rotten.

504
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:14,020
I'd prefer... if he were really rotten.

505
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,470
Cut the crap.

506
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,130
That brat's parents came

507
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,900
and apologized solemnly at the police station,

508
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,730
begging again and again

509
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,390
and apologizing for not teaching him well.

510
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,120
How dare he disrespect his mentor?

511
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,180
He should've just taken the beating.

512
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,670
Because of the cold air from the north,

513
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,580
the exams...

514
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,989
Give me your phone.

515
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,940
The morning temperature dropped to -2 degrees celsius.

516
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,090
Count yourself lucky they were friends with the cops

517
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,710
and didn't pursue it.

518
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,409
If not, your college admissions could be revoked,

519
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,710
Juyeong.

520
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,159
When will you come to your senses?

521
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,550
What more do we have to do for you?

522
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,270
Since 1993, it's the first time it's snowed on the day of the college entrance exam.

523
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:58,220
It'll be an unforgettable day for all of us.

524
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,620
(12 years later)

525
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,920
High five!

526
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,940
Careful.

527
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,650
Wait at the lift!

528
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,290
Be careful. Slowly.

529
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,060
That's right.

530
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,750
I'll move the seat forward.

531
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,570
Here.
