00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,420
Sit down and eat.

188
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,470
Um...

189
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,020
Can I ask you something?

190
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,990
What is it?

191
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,140
Have you tried garlic ice cream?

192
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,460
Huh?

193
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,560
I heard that it's only sold in this area's Datull.

194
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,960
But no matter where I looked, I couldn't find it.

195
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,410
Is this a joke?

196
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,700
W-What is?

197
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,200
There's no ice cream with garlic.

198
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,620
There is! This area's known for garlic.

199
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,860
It must be some collaboration.

200
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,570
Hang on.

201
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,990
I don't know what garlic ice cream is,

202
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,090
but Datull's about a 40-minute walk from here.

203
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,140
Are you done asking?

204
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,410
[Datull garlic vanilla ice cream]

205
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,600
Do you want some ice cream?

206
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,020
I'm going to buy it.

207
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,490
No?

208
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,670
Or... there's also just ice.

209
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,230
Wow.

210
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,270
What a nice room.

211
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,100
You have a lot of books too.

212
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,410
Um...

213
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,930
Tell me if you need anything.

214
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,410
As an athlete, I always carry ice packs.

215
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,030
Just go back to Seoul.

216
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,370
Me?

217
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,200
Suddenly?

218
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,090
It's an important time for you. Don't waste your time here.

219
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,860
Go back to Seoul.

220
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,970
But I can't go back to Seoul.

221
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,840
Didn't you say you came from Seoul?

222
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,100
To be precise, it's Ilsan, Gyeonggi-do.

223
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,140
My family kicked me out.

224
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,310
I was expelled from school and have nowhere to go.

225
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,950
What do you think about what happened?

226
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,510
What?

227
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,090
We don't know each other well.

228
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,950
Let's stay out of each other's business.

229
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,500
Get out.

230
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,640
And please be quiet in your room.

231
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,200
You're so noisy.

232
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,980
Tsk.

233
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,260
The walls are so soundproof.

234
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,470
Yes.

235
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,800
Yes, I'll be right there.

236
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,540
Take this. Take this.

237
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,360
Take it.

238
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,140
Eight.

239
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,060
Eight. Eight.

240
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,530
Got it.

241
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,700
Eight.

242
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,090
-Eight.
-Okay.

243
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,420
-You lost.
-Right?

244
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,460
Let's continue.

245
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,180
-Come on.
-Come on.

246
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,140
What's that? Let me see.

247
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,370
How can you order your studious son around like that?

248
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,840
I heard you got first place again.

249
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Hyeonho's always second because of Dohoe.

250
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,050
-Goodness.
-Didn't Hyeonho say he wants to become a cop like his father?

251
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,930
What happened?

252
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,380
He's always wandering around the neighborhood.

253
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,200
How can he be a cop?

254
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
He can do something better.

255
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Buy me cigarettes and soju.

256
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,650
What do you want?

257
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,750
-These cigarettes.
-Even the cigarettes you smoke are stupid.

258
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,160
Damn it! I lost again!

259
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,310
-The change is yours.
-Damn it!

260
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,370
I lost again.

261
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,050
Damn it, I lost again.

262
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,320
-Five.
-Okay.

263
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
I gave it all to you.

264
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,140
Do you still want to stay here after seeing that?

265
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,640
What can you learn from someone like him?

266
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,130
I just need to learn taekwondo.

267
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,120
It's because of people like you who

268
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,010
don't care about anything.

269
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,700
Is there

270
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,880
a store that's open at this hour?

271
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't look down on Haseong.

272
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,710
We have 24-hour convenience stores too.

273
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,090
What are you doing?

274
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,060
Me?

275
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,840
Going to buy some ice cream.

276
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,440
Ice cream in this freezing weather?

277
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,870
There's no need to pity me.

278
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,840
You must've sensed it from the start.

279
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,610
I don't have a mom,

280
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,130
and I basically don't have a dad.

281
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,010
Hey, actually, you've grown up well.

282
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,850
To be honest, how many families are normal?

283
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,680
My family is the same.

284
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,530
My parents look loving on the surface,

285
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,880
but they're just acting.

286
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,370
My mom's a pastor at a church.

287
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,490
That's why she abandoned me.

288
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,060
If I weren't punished for my mistake,

289
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,520
it'd go against what a pastor should do.

290
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,070
So she banished me here

291
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,340
to make a statement.

292
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,430
I'll move out soon.

293
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,690
Where? Out of your home?

294
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,120
Mm.

295
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,800
So you should move out too.

296
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
Where are you going? You have a place?

297
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,170
I really have nowhere to go!

298
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,810
How could that be? You must've more options than me.

299
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,010
Think carefully.

300
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,310
I'm saying this because you seem like a good kid.

301
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,140
A good kid?

302
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,070
Really?

303
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,970
How do I seem so?

304
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,230
I think you're a good kid too.

305
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,750
We're quite similar in some aspects.

306
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,260
I have to be a role model for my parents too.

307
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
What?

308
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,680
Hey, don't cook for me anymore.

309
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,870
Just study.

310
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,960
I'll take care of myself.

311
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,170
It's all included in the expenses your parents paid.

312
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,500
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

313
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,750
So just accept it without guilt.

314
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,240
Did they pay a lot?

315
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,150
I heard that delinquents in the countryside are scarier.

316
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,720
It's freezing, but he's wearing a leather jacket.

317
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,380
Isn't that a soju bottle?

318
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,990
-They're really...
-Hey.

319
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,830
-W-What are you doing?
-Don't tell me you know them.

320
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,120
-I heard everyone knows each other in the countryside.
-Damn it, Dohoe!

321
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,470
What the hell?

322
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,040
Are you friends with them? Fess up.

323
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
Can't you tell?

324
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,980
It's so nice to see you at night.

325
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,500
[Open 24 Hours]

326
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,980
Your dad beat us up again today.

327
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,050
-Didn't you see that?
-See this?

328
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,080
It's all swollen.

329
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,690
Just passing by the gym gives us the creeps.

330
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,120
We're not even his students anymore. What's wrong with him?

331
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,580
We can't stand it anymore.

332
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,630
We're no longer friends anyway.

333
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,790
Right?

334
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,810
That's right.

335
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,400
I'll have to punch you now.

336
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,520
You should get home before I report you

337
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,770
for underaged drinking.

338
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,720
Goodness. Cringe.

339
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,500
You live here but don't speak in the dialect.

Wait, wait.

342
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,900
Quit it. You're all drunk.

343
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,280
R-Right?

344
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,450
Who's this fool?

345
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,560
Who are you?

346
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,140
Who are you?

Are you that guy?

348
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,110
The kid from Seoul?

349
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,190
Is that him?

350
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,360
To be exact, Ilsan, which is in Gyeonggi-do.

351
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,760
Bastard.

352
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,470
You came here to get into college, right?

353
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,470
Right?

354
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,280
Oh? Fighting back?

355
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,200
You've never learned manners, have you? Use your words.

356
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,310
Pft!

357
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,470
Same goes for you.

358
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,660
You'd better leave if you don't want to become crippled.

359
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,730
Let me warn you.

360
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,550
Even my cop dad has to listen to his dad.

361
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,070
The elders in this neighborhood are crazy.

362
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,600
Especially Lee Dohoe's father.

363
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,000
Do you want to fight?

364
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,480
Look at his eyes. Gonna hit me?

367
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,560
Catch up with them!

00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,920
Wait till I catch them...

Damn it.

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,380
Where did they go? Damn it.

371
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,460
Where are they?

372
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,660
I think they ran this way.

373
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,550
Or that way?

374
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,610
Damn it.

375
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,270
Hey, is this right?

376
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,280
What?

377
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,650
You know each other anyway.

378
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,790
What if this happens again?

379
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,490
I'll tell the teacher.

380
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,850
Huh? Are... Are you serious?

381
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,750
Wow. You really... I'm so disappointed.

382
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,310
You're such a coward.

383
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,180
Just beat them in a fight and shut them down.

384
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,140
-Hey, hey.
-Ah!

385
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,370
Didn't you see how many people there were?

386
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,120
You've got killer kicks. What are you afraid of?

387
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,840
And I'm here too!

388
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
What if you get hurt?

389
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,990
Want to spend your career in rehab?

390
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,910
Oh... you're right.

391
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,400
I was thoughtless.

392
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,020
-You're thoughtless.
-Hey!

393
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,100
The most foolish thing an athlete can do is to get into fights

394
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,180
because you're complacent.

395
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,580
I... I think so too.

396
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,340
But about your dad's errand...

397
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,620
Don't look down on Haseong.

398
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,790
Do you think we only have one convenience store?

399
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,890
Right. You even have Datull.

400
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,960
But is it okay to take this long?

401
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,590
They're all drunk. They won't know.

402
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,500
Really?

403
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,850
Looks yummy.

404
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,630
I should've got that.

405
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,830
You have one too. Eat yours.

406
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,340
Didn't you say it's too cold for ice cream?

407
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,030
Hey. Just one bite.

408
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,830
Saliva.

409
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,010
I hate sharing saliva.

410
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,790
Please, I won't get my saliva on it.

411
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,450
How'd that work with ice cream?

412
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,560
Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,980
Want me to show you?

414
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,860
Ridiculous.

415
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,620
Yeah! I told you I could do it!

416
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,820
The tail of ice cream cones is the yummiest.

417
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,610
Poor you! Now you don't get the chocolate chunk!

418
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,620
Bleh!

419
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,030
Someone's angry. Someone's angry.

420
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,870
Someone's angry. Someone's angry.

421
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,100
Here.

422
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,760
[Happy Shin Juyeong's blog]
[Guys, I miss you so much. But this place is nice too. Come visit! With my friend Dohoe.]

423
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,610
[Posted]

424
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,980
I heard you almost got into a fight.

425
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,670
Don't tell your dad about that.

426
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,920
Or you're dead.

427
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,500
Think of it as collective punishment.

428
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,070
Can a friendship between guys be so shallow?

429
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,610
How ridiculous!

430
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,550
Hey.

431
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,070
Ha Hyeonho! Was it really because of his father?

432
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,370
-What happened to you?
-Scram.

433
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,270
Yes. Bye, Hyeonho.

434
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,080
If I scram, can I have scrambled eggs for breakfast?

435
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,540
Bye, Hyeonho!

436
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,750
Don't you even watch the weather forecast?

437
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,510
You brought an umbrella?

438
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,870
Share it with me!

439
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,090
By the way, what's collective punishment?

440
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,510
Goodness. You idiot.

441
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,780
-You guys go first.
-You really...

442
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,180
I'll run home.

443
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,660
There's still room. Join us.

444
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,700
There's no room.

445
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,170
Hey, join us. It's acid rain.

446
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,160
Yeah, hurry up.

447
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,620
My mom said she grilled mackerel for dinner.

448
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,020
Hey! Dohoe! Dohoe! Is he crazy?

449
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,240
-Where is he going?
-That dummy!

450
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,030
Hey!

451
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,420
It's raining. Why did you run here?

452
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,390
I was going to you anyway.

453
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,020
Aren't you happy that I'm here?

454
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,410
Why didn't you bring two umbrellas?

455
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,500
Just one?

456
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,930
What for? Friends should share one.

457
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,180
Give it to me.

458
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,290
Hey, hey! Wait for me!

459
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,460
It's raining so heavily.
