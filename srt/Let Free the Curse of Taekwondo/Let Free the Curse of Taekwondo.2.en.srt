191
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,750
Why did you stop?

192

Do it!

194
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,800
It's enough.

195
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,320
Why?

196
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,380
If we go on,

his dad will kill us.

198
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,520

Damn it.

201
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,560
If you tell your dad, you're dead.

202
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,510
Just tell him you fell down.

203
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,900
Got it?

204
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,260
Damn it.

205
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,390
Back then...

206

there were many things I didn't understand.

207

He fell at the back.

217
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,390
You should have held on.

218
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,320
Is it because we're in puberty?

219
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,800
Are you okay?

220
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
What now?

221
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,700
You on attack again?

222
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,630

-Come on.

-Huh?
-What's wrong with him?

230
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
-I don't know.
-Did we say something wrong?

231
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,310
I didn't think a close friend

232
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,860
would suddenly become the one I hate the most.

233
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,180
And a stranger that I thought I couldn't be friends with...

234

Actually became someone close.

things I don't understand.

238

Hey.

239
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,090
What's wrong?

240
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,640
What happened?

241
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,650
Did someone beat you up?

242
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,580
Hey, hey!

243
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,740
Who did it?

Did those bastards hit you?

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,700
Why are you covered in dirt?

246
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,280
Gosh.

247
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Can I make it?

248
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,740
Everything seems to be cursed.

249
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,140
I want to...

250
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,740
get out of this place.

251
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,720
You're smart, and you work so hard.

252
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,619
You can do anything.

253
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,829
Anything you want.

254
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,730

I'm sure it hasn't melted.

258
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,530
Let's go home. I'll help you apply ointment.

259

I'm fine.

Hey.

263
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,570
If they hit you again, tell the teacher.

264
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,250
You said that was cowardly.

265
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,940
That's the best way.

266
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,280
Do you really not need my help?

267
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,990
I said I don't.

268
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,410
Apply it carefully.

I heard it snowed a lot in Seoul.

274

Even if it snows, it's super light.

I'm already drained from this and that.

375
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,410
I don't want to have to care about if someone's beating you up.

376
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,380
Did I ask you to?

377
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,350
You said you don't want to go pro.

378
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,140
Then just take it easy and leave when you're done.

379
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,650
Don't act tough and take beatings

380
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,130
just because you're an athlete.

381
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,060
No matter how stupid you are, you should know better.

382
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,720
Back then...

383
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,140
things I couldn't understand kept happening to me too.

384
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,970
I was so dense,

385
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,100
but why did I feel like I understood Lee Dohoe whenever he got angry?

386
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm sorry.

387
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,990
I just don't understand.

388
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,730
Hitting someone...

389
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,680
It's ridiculous.

390
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,380
That winter... was filled with enigmas.

391
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,780
Are you asleep?

392
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,690
I like you.

394
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,950
I really care about you too.

395
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,760
Lee Dohoe!

396
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,900
Come out, you bastard!

397
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,900
Because you hate your dad,

398
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,690
you even gave up your passion of taekwondo.

399
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,520
Come out!

400
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Come out now!

401
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,240
-Grandmaster.
-Who's this?

402
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,330
He keeps going on about Seoul. Take him with you.

403
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,630
What? Want to talk back?

404
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,990
Okay, come here.

405
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,870
Are you so eager to get to Seoul?

406
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,400
Speak up.

407
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,470
Answer me!

408
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,970
Stop it.

409
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,330
I told you not to speak like you're from Seoul.

410
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,120
Are you protesting?

411
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,980
Are you protesting to me to follow your mom?

412
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,440
Not answering again?

413
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
But you can't leave. What can you do?

414
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,040
I said you can't leave.

415
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,090
Your mom was always like that.

416
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,420
She never kept her promises.

417
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,620
She never planned to keep her promises!

418
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,660
I told you to stop.

419
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
How dare you glare at me, you bastard?

420
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,010
Mom...

421
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,020
became happy after she left us.

422
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,770
I actually prefer this.

423
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,060
Because she won't have to come back to this hole anymore.

424
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,860
You're really asking for it.

425
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
Hey, come here.

426
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
No, Grandmaster.

427
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,770
You bastard.

428
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,870
-Let's talk after you sober up.
-Come here!

429
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,870
You should've given me some time to get dressed.

430
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,060
Yeah.

431
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,680
It's so cold.

432
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,890
Damn. It.

433
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,230
Say that again.

434
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,570
Curse again.

435
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Are you a pervert?

436
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,810
Give me a cigarette.

437
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,540
Do you have one?

438
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,480
Cigarettes?

439
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,400
Are you kidding me, kid?

440
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,850
Now you want to curse and smoke?

441
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,450
What a joke.

442
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,140
Just now...

443
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,610
You misunderstood.

444
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,600
I really got hurt during a sparring session.

445
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,870
I didn't get hit.

446
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,020
Hey.

447
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,300
Here... Here?

448
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,710
Then what?

449
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,510
Can we do it at home?

450
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,350
Well... no.

451
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,520
Forget it. Go away.

452
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,080
You're such a bummer.

453
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,440
Should we go down there?

454
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,700
Kiss at the underpass?

455
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,150
Who'd kiss at a underpass?

456
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,590
Is that so?

457
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,730
What about the pavilion over there?

458
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,700
It looks nice.

459
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,610
It's kind of... cold here too.

460
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,180
We should've stopped by the house.

461
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,340
I... like it.

462
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,560
I didn't say I don't.

463
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,670
It's warm.

464
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,060
Um... What... What should I do?

465
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,380
I'll... tilt to the right.

466
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,800
-To the right...
-Yeah.
