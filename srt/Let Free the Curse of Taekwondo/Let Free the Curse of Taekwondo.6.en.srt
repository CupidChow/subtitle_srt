Hello, this is Ola Restaurant.
(Walden Law Firm) (Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

13
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,230
I'd like to reserve a table for tonight.
(Walden Law Firm) (Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

14
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,830
Sure, may I know how many

(Walden Law Firm) (Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,070
Okay.
(Walden Law Firm) (Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,750
Okay.

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,330
What did I say comes after "because of"?

24
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,440
-A noun.
-A noun.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,150
Yes, a noun.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,620
"The amount of hiding places" follows.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,560
And after that, the clause starting with "that" follows.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,490
Please read the "that" clause.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Gwangmo.

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,720
Can you see me later?

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,410
Mr. Lee.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,270
Hmm?

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,010
I won't do it again.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,670
Please don't tell my parents.

35
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,050
I'm not going to scold you.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,160
You did nothing wrong just now.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,120
I was very distracted.

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,210
Wasn't I distracted?

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,030
You looked unwell, so I wanted to ask

40
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,430
if something's bothering you. You aren't usually like this.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,510
I'm completely fine.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,450
I just... didn't sleep well.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,050
Did you study until late?

44
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,250
Yes.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm... aiming for A-Asia International Middle School.

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,670
Gwangmo, do you like ice cream?

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes!

48
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,810
(Juyeong: What are you doing tonight?)
(Dohoe: I'm going straight home to rest.)

49
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,829
Where?

50
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,860
Let's go.

51
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,610
Where are we going?

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,390
Not for drinks.

53
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,490
Let's go have some good food.

54
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,480
Why are you here?

55
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,280
I want to talk to you.

56
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,040
You should've called first.

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,460
Then why is he here?

58
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,560
Do you live together?

59
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,990
Why do you come here all the time like you own the place?

60
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,910
I left this behind last night.

61
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,220
I slept over.

62
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,680
Let's have a drink if you want.

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm tired.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
Ha Hyeonho.

65
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,040
If you're close to Dohoe,

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,710
we should get close too. Even though we aren't classmates.

67
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,730
Can you handle it?

68
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,300
What do you mean?

69
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,050
Well...

70
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,200
Because I know him better than you do.

71
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,770
So? Why are you smirking at me?

72
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,680
Want to punch me?

73
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,870
I could if you want.

74
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,290
Hey, Shin Juyeong!

75
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,620
-So what I'm saying is...
-You're saying that...

76
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,850
You're saying that we can't dine at a restaurant like that together.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,230
Then what are we?

78
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,830
Let's end this.

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,960
End what?

80
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,560
Nothing's even started yet.

81
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,180
I should go see Juyeong.

82
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,680
You said you were resting at home.

83
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,570
My head hurts.

84
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,050
Let's talk later.

85
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,120
Are you okay?

86
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,460
I'm fine.

87
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,040
It happens sometimes when I think too much.

88
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
I came here because this reminded me of you.

89
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,450
Did I stupidly interrupt something again?

90
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,450
Should I've just gone home like last night?

91
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,940
Is it because you saw me coming back with Hyeonho?

92
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,950
It's natural for friends to eat together.

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,930
Isn't it?

94
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,020
I can sense when things are off.

95
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,740
Hey!

96
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,880
I don't do this with him.

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Isn't this what you want to know?

98
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,500
Sure.

99
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,000
That's exactly what I want to know. Thanks for telling me.

100
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,900
-It's settled then.
-No.

101
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,580
We haven't had a proper talk yet.

102
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,790
I was really excited last night.

103
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,880
I couldn't wait to show you the places I frequent

104
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,710
and talk about things we haven't had a chance to.

105
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,100
But it's like we're back to being strangers again today.

106
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,260
Talk about what?

107
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Didn't we talk everything through?

108
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,270
I...

109
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,600
I want to ask if you drew this too,

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,340
when you drew it,

111
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,950
when you graduated, if you took a gap year,

112
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,470
who else you're close friends with,

113
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,300
if your job suits you,

114
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,720
where you were and what you did before getting here...

115
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,050
Ha Hyeonho knows everything. I want to know too.

116
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,930
Juyeong.

117
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,730
Why do you have so many questions?

118
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,820
Unlike you, I don't like reminiscing on the past.

119
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,040
Time can only move forward. It won't turn back.

120
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,340
But the past can still be repeated.

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,100
The winter we broke up is gone,

122
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,580
but it's winter now again.

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm happy as long as I'm with you,

124
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,900
just like in the past.

125
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,290
Isn't that all that matters?

126
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,130
Do you want wine or whiskey?

127
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,060
-You just took medicine. If you drink...
-It's fine.

128
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,900
Let's drink whiskey.

129
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,120
I just... want to know the you now.

130
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,150
Let's do things we couldn't do and enjoy life.

131
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,030
Let's start afresh.

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
My college life...

133
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,780
was just like everyone else.

134
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,400
I started teaching because I wasn't sure if architecture was my calling.

135
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,050
There's nothing else interesting or special.

136
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,860
Let's...

137
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,220
just talk about the present.

138
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,870
How much can you drink?

139
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,010
What does your house look like?

140
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,040
Are you still bad at throwing things away?

141
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,430
Do you dress only for comfort?

142
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,040
Is your music taste

143
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,060
-still as bad?
-Hey.

144
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,400
Do you still snore?

145
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,170
I don't snore.

146
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,630
Are you good at driving?

147
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,310
Yes.

148
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,460
I'll give you a ride in my van if you're okay with it.

149
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,670
No thanks. Just drive my car.

150
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
I'll add you to my insurance.

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Did you dress up for me?

152
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,440
Hmm?

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,540
Hmm?

154
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,910
Ah... I'm so tired.

155
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,290
Wait... Well...

156
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,850
-Shall we...
-Ah!

157
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,730
Should we...

158
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,220
turn off the lights?

159
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,330
Why did you ask to spar all of a sudden?

160
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,390
Dissatisfied with your severance pay?

161
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,330
No.

162
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,700
Then why?

163
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,890
Gosh, I'm all sweaty.

164
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,410
Well...

165
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,590
I don't know either.

166
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,930
I just feel weird and anxious.

167
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,610
I think I've seen this face of yours before.

168
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,440
Did you... meet him?

169
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,110
The one who makes you cry?

170
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,960
-No.
-That must be it!

171
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,990
-Shut up.
-No wonder...

172
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,540
you've been so distracted and out of sorts.

173
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,590
Forget it.

174
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,830
Whatever advice I give you, you never listen.

175
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,360
You're just like the kids.

176
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,290
Even when I explain why they should learn taekwondo a million times...

177
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,340
they just want to play soccer. You're just like them.

178
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,950
Anyway, I hope you don't regret it this time.

179
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,230
Do whatever you can

180
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,180
while there's still a chance.

181
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,080
Hello?

182
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,490
Have you talked to Lee Dohoe

183
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,090
about selling the gym to you?

184
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,070
Hey... Give me two more days.

185
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,470
I knew this would happen.

186
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,540
I'll talk to him.

187
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,640
I doubt he'd sell it to you.

188
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,690
Just give up.

189
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,690
Why do you have to go to such lengths?

190
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,340
He might regret it later.

191
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,820
I don't want that.

192
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,720
(Yongeun Uni's Taekwondo Dept was here!)

193
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,050
You... came here often?

194
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,390
Yeah.

195
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,950
Shall we go elsewhere?

196
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,660
No. We're already here.

197
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,560
Let's go eat something better next time.

198
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,930
It's not that I don't like this place.

199
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,820
I just want to buy you something better.

200
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,870
We can afford that now.

201
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,550
Yeah. Okay.

202
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,530
I said you can just go home.

203
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,190
It's fine. I'll take you home.

204
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,300
Get in.

205
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,120
Wait... Isn't that Gwangmo?

206
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,140
Gwangmo's mother is there too.

207
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,930
Wait. Don't you know Gwangmo too?

208
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,830
What's wrong with you?

209
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,270
Gwangmo, let's go.

210
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,230
Gwangmo seems reluctant.

211
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,650
Wait.

212
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,680
Gwangmo is with his mom and dad.

213
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,530
We shouldn't interfere.

214
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,900
But still...

215
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,460
That's how kids grow up.

216
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,930
Don't think too much.

217
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,350
I'm late. I need to prep for classes tomorrow.

218
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Throw away your old one and use this.

219
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,800
-No thanks.
-No.

220
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
Use it.

221
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,250
I can't stand yours. It's really ugly.

222
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,400
Mr. Shin!

223
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,340
Oh, Gwangmo's mom.

224
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,440
Having coffee at this hour?

225
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,440
Well... Yes.

226
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,340
You got takeout?

227
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,740
Well, Gwangmo wanted some.

228
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,840
Um...

229
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,250
I saw you with Gwangmo and his dad just now.

230
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,810
Really? Where?

231
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,980
Around here.

232
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,400
I was taking Gwangmo to the hospital.

233
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,660
Is Gwangmo sick?

234
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,180
He seems to be taking medicine too.

235
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,880
He's not sick. What's wrong with Gwangmo?

236
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,310
He looks tired these days.

237
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,040
Kids these days are all tired with their studies.

238
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,860
By the way, what's that?

239
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,130
Which one?

240
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,920
Your phone background.

241
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
So you're interested in architecture.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,060
I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,160
That's not it. A friend I like drew it.

244
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,960
I thought it was pretty, so I made it my background.

245
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,130
What's... wrong?

246
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,160
This is a floor plan by the architect Dais Kahn.

247
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,520
What?

248
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,360
It's called Dais House,

249
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,570
where you can't enter directly from the entrance.

250
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,580
You've to go through the garden to enter the living room.

251
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,910
Each room has a different route. That's what it's known for.

252
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,670
It's really famous.

253
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,570
I drew it for my graduation work.

254
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,970
You drew it yourself?

255
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,760
Mm.

256
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,100
Of course. Who else could it be?

257
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,200
You're here.

258
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,250
Want to drink something?

259
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,350
How about whiskey?

260
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,450
Let's not drink today.

261
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,140
You were complaining about having to leave early yesterday.

262
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,390
Why don't you wash up first?

263
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,590
(Byunggyu)

264
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,560
Why are you using that as your background?

265
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,950
What did you say this was again?

266
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,290
What else could it be? A house.

267
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,060
The house you want to live in?

268
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,410
It's just a house.

269
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,530
Why?

270
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,630
It's amazing.

271
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,270
Really cool.

272
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,370
Any architect can draw that.

273
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,470
So don't use it as your background.

274
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,110
Since you don't want to wash up,

275
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,820
I'll wash up first.

276
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,230
(February 2015)

277
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,060
(2012 college entrance exams results)

278
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
You've been weird since yesterday.

279
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,510
Do you have something to say?

280
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,230
About the taekwondo gym?

281
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,860
The real estate agency's boss told me

282
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,660
Byunggyu said to wait as someone has their eyes on the gym.

283
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,830
It's you, right?

284
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,430
Yes.

285
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,310
Regardless, for us to really start afresh,

286
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,420
-we should talk about the gym...
-You aren't wearing the necklace.

287
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,550
Have you decided to be selfish again?

288
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,520
-What are you talking about?
-Be it then or now...

289
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,450
when it comes to things that I hate,

290
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,930
things that scare and torture me,

291
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,050
you're still selfishly choosing to uphold

292
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,550
your great moral beliefs.

293
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,950
Unlike you, I'm not carefree and didn't grow up with love.

294
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,270
Just thinking for myself is exhausting.

295
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,090
Hey.

296
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,770
Be honest with me.

297
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,310
Do you really want to get the gym?

298
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,820
No.

299
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,810
You just feel guilty toward that man who died.

300
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,070
You're not doing it for me, the one standing in front of you,

301
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,920
but for that person.

302
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
I made a mistake.

303
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,880
We shouldn't have gotten back together.

304
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,270
You really...

305
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,050
To you, we are... No.

306
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
I'm...

307
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,190
really insignificant.

308
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,670
If that's what you think, you could've just told me.

309
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,040
-What'd change if I told you?
-You could give me a chance

310
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,010
to explain or apologize.

311
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,700
You never try to fix things! Never!

312
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,370
I don't dare to say anything now...

313
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,260
because you don't like it.

314
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,490
When I talk to you,

315
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,860
it's like there's a brick wall between us.

316
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,940
It scares me too.

317
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,530
It's hard to ask you anything directly...

318
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,520
So quit it and leave!

319
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,970
You really...

320
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,670
Why did you change so much?

321
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,820
It'd be nice if you changed too.

322
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,420
Thank you for everything.

323
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,150
Let's end things here.

324
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,260
Don't lie!

325
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,410
It's true. My dad is Superman.

326
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,400
-No way.
-Can you hurry up and move forward?

327
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,900
-Hurry up! Move!
-My dad... My dad can fly whenever he drinks.

328
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,070
Don't lie.

329
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,550
-It's true.
-It's a lie.

330
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,610
Hey, hey, hey! Why are you fighting?

331
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,610
-Why are you fighting?
-She keeps saying I'm lying...

332
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,320
Thank you.

333
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,880
Thank you.

334
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,490
Um... Miss Na.

335
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,910
Yes?

336
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,010
That stick...

337
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,940
Can you refrain from using it?

338
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,400
Why? It's just for gesturing.

339
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,280
You'll use your hands a lot while lecturing.

340
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,390
The kids might feel threatened.

341
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,960
You're so thoughtful.

342
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,420
Is that why you're more popular than me, even though I graduated from Boston Uni?

343
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,280
But really, why are you teaching English?

344
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,670
You majored in engineering.

345
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,250
-Because my students' grades were improving faster with English than math.
-I see.

346
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,130
Oh, right.

347
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,230
I saw Gwangmo's mother outside.

348
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,330
Did you invite her here for a meeting?

349
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,580
Thank you for everything.

350
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,990
Stay glued to your seat and eat everything before you go.

351
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,500
It's already the sixth serving. How can we finish it?

352
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,100
We were classmates, but business is business.

353
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,850
It's a proper farewell for my former employee.

354
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,020
But you're unemployed now.

355
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,410
Why are you so busy this morning?

356
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,710
You're so eager to leave.

357
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,760
-What about the seafood noodles?
-Hey.

358
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,110
I had a really good meal.

359
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,210
I'm so full. I'll pay for this.

360
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,550
Gosh. Hey!

361
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,490
Don't you dare pay.

362
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,220
Just pay attention to Gwangmo.

363
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,250
Gwangmo? Hey!

364
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,940
Please enjoy.

365
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,580
Thank you.

366
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,600
Gwangmo said

367
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,870
he takes these pills daily

368
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,810
and gets two injections a week.

369
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,730
If it's for ADHD, let's say he needs the meds,

370
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,600
but it has nothing to do with brain-stimulating injections.

371
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,460
I heard you even installed a CCTV in Gwangmo's room.

372
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,870
I might be overstepping my bounds,

373
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,440
but Gwangmo has changed a lot recently.

374
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,830
Actually, I'm really tired. I want to rest.

375
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,320
But if I don't do it,

376
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,590
my parents will fight and get mad at me.

377
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,910
But I...

378
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,010
find studying really tiring.

379
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,300
I just want to sleep and never wake up.

380
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,790
I heard that you're my junior.

381
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,620
Yes.

382
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,980
Gwangmo's dad and I were ambitious,

383
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,230
be it with work or studies.

384
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,030
Maybe because we had Gwangmo late in life, but we feel like we owe him a lot.

385
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,800
Brain-stimulating injections sound scary,

386
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,730
but all the kids get it.

387
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,370
It's just vitamins. Don't worry.

388
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,820
I guess you thought too much because he mentioned injections...

389
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,920
Gwangmo is only in sixth grade.

390
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,130
You know I'm a professor at Hanseol University, right?

391
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,720
We might have met at school before.

392
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah?

393
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,690
Do I have to call you more than three times

394
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,300
for you to pick up once?

395
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,060
Let's meet today.

396
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,570
We have to talk.

397
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,140
Today won't work. I'll call you tomorrow.

398
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,460
If we just ridiculously break up again and I don't get to see you,

399
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,550
I might regret it till the day I die.

400
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,130
You said you wanted me to drive you around.

401
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,080
It's not the van.

402
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,080
Did you rent it?

403
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,180
Of course.

404
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,750
Are you...

405
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,300
good at driving?

406
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,470
Yes.

407
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,770
Hang out with me.

408
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't you have the day off tomorrow?

409
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,160
I'm sorry.

410
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,670
I was thoughtless.

411
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,360
I won't talk about things you don't like to hear anymore.

412
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,330
Let's go together.

413
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,080
Hang out with me.

414
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,080
