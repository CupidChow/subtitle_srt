(Let the Curse of Taekwondo Be Free)

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,360
Lee Dohoe!

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,600
Do you work around here?

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,620
We're the same age. Speak casually.

10
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,980
Just like before.

11
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,570
It's been a while since I met someone uncomfortable with formal speech.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,630
I'm just glad to see you.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,380
-Are you ready to go?
-Do you really have nothing...

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,170
-They're waiting.
-If you have plans...

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,510
Let's talk tomorrow.

16
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,030
If you're free, let's have dinner together.

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
Are you okay?

18
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,440
You said you didn't sleep much.

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
I did some work and went to bed.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,810
It's all because of coffee.

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,990
I told you not to drink too much.

22
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,830
I'm fine even if I drink it at night.

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,250
How is that possible?

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,759
Cut down on coffee.

25
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,440
Do you need a coat?

26
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,290
I get hot easily anyway.

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,079
I think... everyone will like him.

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,220
They don't meet many like him.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,150
Hurry up.

30
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,700
I'm sorry I'm late.

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,920
Oh, he is Dohoe's friend.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,480
We ran into him, so we came together.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,579
-Oh.
-It's fine, yeah?

34
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,680
Of course. Do you have to ask?

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Since you're Dohoe's friend,

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
are you also from Hanseol Uni?

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,100
Taekwondo?

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,240
Or is it just a hobby?

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,530
-I teach it.
-Oh.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,540
You run a taekwondo gym?

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,550
I'm an employee.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Excuse me.

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,540
Add a set of tableware.

44
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,840
We're college friends.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,380
Hey, he'll think we're from Hanseol Uni too.

46
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,130
Don't embellish things.

47
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,000
We met in our college years and got close.

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,760
What took you so long?

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,020
Something came up.

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,190
She's a teacher at Dohoe's tutoring center.

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,990
She wanted to know Dohoe better.

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,890
Is this the lawyer?

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,690
Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,860
Nice to meet you.

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,980
The director thanked me for introducing

57
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,320
such a good teacher.

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,790
I'm the one who should be thankful.

59
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,270
Minji's happy that a handsome teacher has joined them.

60
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,070
Who doesn't like handsome guys?

61
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,030
He introduced him to the tutoring center.

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,090
That's why he's treating us today.

63
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,090
The director's so satisfied. He said you're popular.

64
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,250
That tutoring center's really lucky.

65
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,310
-An educational TV show wanted to recruit him, remember?
-You're right.

66
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,350
The director's son got into Hanseol Uni's architecture major.

67
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,250
Have you heard?

68
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,840
I've never heard of it.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,060
It's good news.

70
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,530
Many of my friends are engineering majors from Hanseol Uni.

71
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,340
Gosh, I'm hungry.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,320
Have you ordered?

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,350
Dohoe's treating.

74
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,090
Of course, I ordered a lot.

75
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,470
Are athletes discriminated based on degrees too?

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,190
It's crazy in the financial sector.

77
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,899
Since I'm not a Hanseol graduate,

78
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,850
it's so stressful.

79
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,570
Gosh, be thankful for what you have.

80
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,900
How was your blind date?

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
Order whatever you want.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,760
If you're uncomfortable, I'll call a taxi for you.

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,010
So don't drink too much and take care of yourself.

84
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,990
Look at your skin.

85
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,450
(Pasta set: 390,000 won)
Look at your skin.

86
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,450
We have a new guest today.
(Pasta set: 390,000 won)

87
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:34,630
We have a new guest today.

88
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,560
(Filet mignon set: 420,000 won)
We have a new guest today.

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,890
Let's talk about something fun.
(Filet mignon set: 420,000 won)
We have a new guest today.

90
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,640
Let's talk about something fun.

91
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,500
-Something fun.
-Something fun?

92
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,370
Do you teach adults there too? I want to find my youth again.

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,510
You're going back to your gym, yeah?

94
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm going to walk back.

95
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,690
Okay, bye then.

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,880
You've made it, just like you said you wanted to.

97
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,510
Congrats.

98
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,870
Didn't you bring me here to show me that?

99
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,770
So don't sell the taekwondo gym.

100
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,090
If you're not short of money, you don't have to sell it.

101
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,300
Grandmaster's belongings aren't sorted yet.

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,090
There's a lot at home too.

103
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,150
Even if you want to sell it, sort things out...

104
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,530
Do you still not know when to not interfere?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,150
On the day Grandmaster passed away,

106
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,280
he brought up the taekwondo gym to me.

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,380
How could I not care?

108
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,670
Juyeong.

109
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,180
Are you doing this because you still have feelings for me?

110
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,980
What if I do?

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,350
Don't do this.

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,400
It was such a long time ago.

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,910
Even so, we have to clarify things before we move on.

114
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,150
Back then,

115
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,940
you never asked me about what happened.

116
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,470
We met after a long time, yet you treat me like a total stranger,

117
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,610
acting like we don't have a past.

118
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,240
What are you trying to say after ten years?

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,070
About that incident?

120
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,830
You fighting with my dad on the day of my college entrance exams?

121
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,340
I'm sure you got beaten up because you were nosy.

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,530
What else is there to it?

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,210
Oh, that you didn't just accept the beating?

124
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,900
Is that what you want to say?

125
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,890
But there are no desks in the gym.

126
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,540
Did you throw the mats at each other?

127
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,810
Or did you

128
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,350
flip the desk in the office?

129
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,320
Hey, Lee Dohoe.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,860
As you said, I'm doing just fine without thinking about the past.

131
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,270
There's nothing to clarify,

132
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,860
so why are you bringing up the past that I hate?

133
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,170
Anyway, thank goodness

134
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,040
you didn't shirk all responsibility

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,590
by using a cowardly excuse like you did it all for my sake.

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,310
If you did, you'd really become a total stranger to me.

137
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,180
Otherwise, I would've had a few more drinks.

138
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,350
Why did you leave first?

139
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,900
(Let the Curse of Taekwondo Be Free)

140
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,480
Hey, it's me.

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,660
Why are you calling me after work?

142
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,990
Where are your manners?

143
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,620
I get severance pay, right?

144
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,570
Leaving so early?

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,270
Yeah.

146
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,590
I have stuff to prepare.

147
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,660
Get some rest before you leave.

148
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,800
Do you see the cute picture in front of us?

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,510
-Yes.
-Yes.

150
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,650
Now, let's look at the picture and describe it.

151
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,360
Okay.

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,200
Please raise your hand if you have a pet dog!

153
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,450
Its feelers are hidden in this donut.

154
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,430
-Yes!
-Yes!

155
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,450
What is this?

156
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,570
-Tree!
-Tree!

157
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,040
-S. P.
-S. P.

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,420
One, two, three.

159
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,790
What form should we use?

160
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,700
-Infinitive.
-Infinitive.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,050
Use the infinitive form.

162
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,150
Now, let's parse out this sentence.

163
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,460
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

164
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,890
There's a buyer already?
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

165
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,610
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

166
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,720
When you go there on Sunday, send me a copy of the contract
(Lawyer: Ha Hyeonho)

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,520
and the certificate of real estate registration.

Make sure you check them carefully.

(Dacham Village)

171
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,110
Gosh. How can they be late for this?

172
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,630
Seriously.

173
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,940
Have some coffee.

174
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,300
Oh, you're here.

175
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,280
Sorry, we're late.

176
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,200
It's okay.

177
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,460
We came because you told us to check it out again,

178
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,810
but we went the wrong way.

179
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,310
Can we look at it again?

180
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,630
Well then... let's go together. Want to join us?

181
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,020
This is the seller.

182
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,830
-Oh.
-Oh.

183
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,120
Hello.

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,460
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

185
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,760
Let's go.

186
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,170
Let's go.

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,650
Aren't they fussy?

188
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,850
I told them to check it out one last time.

189
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,000
I heard they're revamping the gym into a restaurant.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,520
I'll be right back. Enjoy the coffee.

191
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,810
Goodness.

192
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,570
You're here.

193
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,340
It was just put up, and it's already sold out.

194
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,400
What's taking them so long?

195
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,220
Hello?

196
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,320
What?

197
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,450
Got it.

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,350
Dohoe.

199
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,470
They need you there.

200
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,630
There seems to be a problem.

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,870
We're buying it, not just renting it.

202
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,400
How can we buy it when it's so ominous?

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,520
-Seriously.
-That's not it.

204
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,780
We were already bothered that

205
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,100
-the owner died in a car accident.
-Listen to me.

206
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
But it's actually more complicated?

207
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,690
It's not like that. Since a long time ago...

208
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,050
Forget it, goodbye.

209
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,760
We're frustrated too. We wasted our time coming all the way here.

210
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Why don't we go back to the agency...

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,180
Please stop.

212
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,010
Get a hold of yourself, please.

213
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,330
Oh, you're here.

214
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,880
I said I'll leave after I clean up.

215
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,140
They're not buying it?

216
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,320
Is it because they're from Seoul?

217
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,360
You know that too, right?

218
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,000
Seoul and Ilsan are really different.

219
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,480
People from Seoul are quite cold-hearted.

220
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,880
If it's urgent,

221
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,300
want to sell it to me?

222
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,100
Hey, Lee Dohoe.

223
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,640
I just wanted you to see it all tidied up.

224
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,900
-So I...
-So?

225
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,470
You want to buy this taekwondo gym?

226
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,350
Yeah.

227
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,940
Do you have money?

228
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,410
Yes.

229
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,810
I'll find a way, so...

230
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,030
So I'll never sell it to you.

231
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,990
I don't want any trace of this place to remain.

232
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,220
Hey.

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,290
Because I did something you hate,

234
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,420
I can understand why you're like this.

235
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,120
But is there really no turning back?

236
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,050
With you treating me like a stranger, I can't focus on anything.

237
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm so frustrated.

238
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,980
Are you an idiot?

239
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,670
What?

240
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,790
Who do you think called the police?

241
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,020
How do you think the police came while you were beaten up?

242
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,720
I knew you'd be screwed if you were involved in it.

243
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,770
If I tried to stop you, you'd be beaten up less.

244
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,420
It could've ended simply. I knew that too.

245
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,560
But if I saw it with my own eyes, I was worried I'd ruin my exams.

246
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,700
That's why I pretended not to know.

247
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,340
Since you're someone who hit your teacher,

248
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,400
I thought it didn't matter, so I left.

249
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,850
Actually, I knew it from the beginning...

250
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,580
That my dad beat you up all the time,

251
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,690
and that something like that'd happen eventually.

252
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,600
I just pretended not to know.

253
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,540
I'm not who you think I am.

254
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,200
I can't be the person you want, nor is it what I want.

255
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,090
So please stop showing up in front of me.

256
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,210
Don't interfere or help with my affairs.

257
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,420
Please just treat me as a stranger!

258
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,710
Please.

259
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,109
You're the idiot.

260
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,680
You ruined your dream because of me.

261
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,480
Why didn't you tell me that?

262
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,440
You should've made me kneel in front of you every day.

263
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,050
You should've cursed at me and vented at me!

264
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,690
I was so stupid to even realize that,

265
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,599
and I'm still...

266
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,700
If you understood what I just said,

267
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,130
you should curse at me for being despicable.

268
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
No.

269
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't think like that.

270
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,870
I'm the one who's at fault.

271
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,270
Why'd I call you despicable?

272
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,880
I pretended not to know too.

273
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,460
What if you came to me that morning?

274
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,770
What if you found out

275
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,260
and weren't able to complete your exams?

276
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,000
It must've been harder on you.

277
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,130
I'm sorry for not realizing it earlier.

278
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,610
I just saw this note.

279
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,290
Someone once asked me what the happiest moment in my life was.

280
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,240
(Where's my lunchbox? I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I didn't say bye.
I'll do my best. Let's go to Seoul together after. Wait for me.)

281
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,300
I only thought of you.
(Where's my lunchbox? I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I didn't say bye.
I'll do my best. Let's go to Seoul together after. Wait for me.)

282
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,180
(Where's my lunchbox? I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I didn't say bye.
I'll do my best. Let's go to Seoul together after. Wait for me.)

283
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,580
Back then, to stay together,
(Where's my lunchbox? I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I didn't say bye.
I'll do my best. Let's go to Seoul together after. Wait for me.)

284
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,270
Back then, to stay together,

285
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,920
we gave our all in everything.

286
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,530
We had nothing...

287
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,880
but I was the happiest then.

288
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,800
It was my first time yearning for someone else to be happy.

289
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,020
You said you wanted to go to Seoul with me.

290
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:04,510
(Taekwondo gym)

291
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,130
(Taekwondo gym)

292
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,510
Let's... go to Seoul together.

293
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,540
How did you get here?

294
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:57,990
Me?

295
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,720
I drove the taekwondo van here.

296
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,110
Then how can we go back together? I have my car too.

297
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,820
We can meet after we get there.

298
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,570
Want to go eat?

299
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,270
Let's go home first.

300
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,860
Home?

301
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,570
Your home or mine?

302
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,460
What are you looking at?

303
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,420
It's fascinating.

304
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,040
He can't get home whenever he's drunk.

305
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,250
You didn't send me the contract.

306
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,310
You didn't even contact me.

307
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,320
Were you too busy coming back with him?

308
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,140
You should go home.

309
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,170
I'll call you tomorrow.

310
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,470
-He's drunk.
-Why?

311
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,830
We could sleep together.

312
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,270
Right here.

313
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,760
I'll call you tomorrow.

314
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,400
What do you mean by tomorrow?

315
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,400
Call me before you sleep too.

316
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,680
If you don't want me to come, change the passcode.

317
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,610
Go on dates.

318
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't always organize weird dinner meetings.

319
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,220
Weird dinner meetings?

320
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,190
Am I doing it for my own sake?

321
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,160
You said you didn't want to go back to the past.

322
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,980
I'm not going back...

323
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,630
but continuing from the moment I stopped.

324
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,480
I can be your drinking buddy,

325
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,940
but don't come to my house anymore. It makes me uncomfortable.

326
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,350
I make you uncomfortable?

327
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,210
I can't say you don't.

328
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,100
If I had known you were this honest,

329
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,380
I should've been honest with you from the get-go.

330
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,920
Right?

331
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,530
I'm never bored.

332
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,050
Because we're always together.

333
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,260
Sleep on the bed.

334
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,020
I'll sleep on the sofa.

335
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,690
Why don't we both...

336
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,640
not date?

337
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,170
I'll tidy up the bed for you.

338
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,250
You said you don't want to make any more mistakes.

339
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,280
(Juyeong: Has Hyeonho left?)
(Dohoe: Yeah. Rest well)
(Juyeong: Sleep well! Sleep well!)
(Juyeong: Did you sleep well? Had breakfast?)

340
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,590
What's up?

341
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,310
Hey, what's wrong with you?

342
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,530
Did you have a safe trip back to Seoul yesterday?

343
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,630
Of course.

344
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,940
I was worried.

345
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,360
You should've updated me on what was going on.

346
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,570
I'm sorry. I was a bit busy.

347
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,940
So...

348
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,600
So has he agreed to sell the taekwondo gym to you?

349
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,250
I haven't brought it up to him yet.

350
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,080
You haven't?

351
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,060
Hey. Give me just one more day.

352
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,980
One day?

353
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,530
No, no... two days.

354
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,720
-Two days? No.
-Two days.

355
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,110
-You always say two days.
