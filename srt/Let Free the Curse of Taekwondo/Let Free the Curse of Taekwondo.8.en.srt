I called to thank you.

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh, it's nothing.

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,310
I just posted that I know a great lawyer

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,660
on an online forum for mothers.

But...

21
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,480
There's something I'm curious about.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,370
Go ahead.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,010
The kid doesn't seem like he has ADHD,

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,220
but he's being fed pills.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,740
He's even being monitored through a security camera.

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,039
Are parents allowed to do this to their child in Korea?

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,190
I heard you even installed a security camera in Gwangmo's room.

28
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm a very curious person.

(Ha Hyeonho)

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,850
Answer it.

31
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,010
You look very calm.

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,570
Did you...

33
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,920
stay by my side because I know about you?

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,690
In case I expose you if we fall out?

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,960
What should I do to get through to you?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,060
It's been ten years, but I still haven't figured it out.

37
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,329
Shin Juyeong...

38
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,570
came to me and grabbed me by the collar.

39
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,620
But he didn't say anything until he saw the legal complaint.

40
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,540
What did he find out before he came?

41
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,390
Why?

42
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,350
Are you anxious after hearing about the complaint?

43
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,250
Do whatever you want.

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,160
Do whatever I want?

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,350
Please.

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,480
Do whatever you want.

47
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,390
Among your students' parents,

48
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,350
there's an architecture professor at Hanseol Uni.

49
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,610
She found out that you lied about graduating from Hanseol,

50
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,610
so she came to me about suing you.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,529
But I heard her son is being abused.

52
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,030
-I'm not absolutely sure.
-You don't have to be sure to report them.

53
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,490
If we can find an excuse that threateans her,

54
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,610
we can keep this under wraps.

55
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,740
Emotional abuse is also abuse.

56
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,400
What's there to be sure about?

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,590
I heard a lot from Ms. Na Minji.

58
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,600
It's enough to conclude that she's hindering the child's normal development.

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,659
Do you understand?

60
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,030
She's a professor.

61
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,400
If her reputation is even slightly damaged,

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
it will be a huge blow.

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,450
Especially if it's about the education of children.

64
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,220
I'm more assured in my decision now.

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,330
Don't you hear what I'm saying? It's not about reporting her...

66
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,760
Let's do a deal with her.

67
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,870
We know your secret too,

68
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,610
so let's agree to keep things under wraps.

69
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,340
If you report it to the police, you're doomed too.

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
That's why I came here, Hyeonho.

71
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,130
Then why didn't you do it in the first place?

72
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,210
Why did you drag it on?

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,080
I know, right?

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,159
Everything that was obscure is now clear to me.

75
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,000
This is just the beginning, right?

76
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,060
Actually, I'm unemployed.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,630
I got fired.

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,900
So what?

79
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,390
You can start over.

80
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,850
That's what I wanted to say.

81
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,580
Did your talk with Ha Hyeonho go well?

82
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,130
He said there was a way

83
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,810
to maintain my lie.

84
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,370
But

85
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,320
I can't stop think about the look in Gwangmo's eyes.

86
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,850
Do you think parents can change?

87
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,510
What I'm sure of is... minors can't do anything on their own.

88
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,940
Go to sleep.

89
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,840
You didn't get much sleep.

90
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,840
Get some sleep and then think about it.

91
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,320
I'm sleepy, but I can't sleep.

92
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,260
I don't think I've ever slept properly.

93
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,510
It is said that you can get the benefits of sleep

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,880
even just by shutting your eyes.

95
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,070
I'll go in myself.

96
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,740
I'll wait for you at that cafe.

97
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,100
I'll be back soon.

98
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,030
You said you have a lot of stuff there. Take your time.

99
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,050
Have a good talk with him.

100
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,390
Go inside.

101
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,690
Come to your senses!

102
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,730
You said you wanted to attend the weekend class.

103
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,400
It wasn't your dad or mom!

104
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,330
Why won't you be responsible?

105
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,299
I don't want to!

106
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,720
I changed my mind!

107
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,460
I really don't want to do anything!

108
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,570
And we all have to cooperate

109
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,570
just because you changed your mind?

110
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,290
Your parents already mapped out your schedule!

111
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,290
What should we do?

112
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,210
Then I'll stay here alone.

113
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,690
What are you doing?

114
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,950
Oh, it's you, the teacher who falsified his academic credentials.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,740
Are you kidding me?

116
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,480

117
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,420
Come here!

118
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,070
Let go!

119
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,270

-Hello.
-Hello.

129
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,830
Grandmaster, did you hear about the tutoring center Little America?

130
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,460
No, what is it?

131
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,610
One of their teachers was exposed for lying about graduating from Hanseol.

132
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,440
He's just a high school graduate.

133
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Falsifying academic credentials in this day and age?

134
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,580
He sent an apology text to all the parents.

135
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,370
I really don't know what to do.

136
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,390
To be honest, my child's grades improved because of him, so I've nothing to say.

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,420
Is that why Mr. Shin quit too?

138
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,210
-Huh?
-Because of fake credentials?

139
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,600
No.

140
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,640
Mr. Shin is too timid to do such a thing.

141
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,770
This area's cursed.

142
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
Gwangmo's parents were even summoned to the police station.

-What?
-I knew it.

144
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,210
Something was off with her.

145
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,010
She's always bragging about being a Hanseol professor

146
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,520
and acting all sophisticated.

147
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,590
She feeds her kid all kinds of pills.

148
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,330
No wonder her kid's grades improved so quickly.

149
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,010
By the way, did you ask where it was?

150
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,080
I heard it's a hospital in front.

165

Hello?

166
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,580
I thought about it...

167
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,980
How I'm different from Shin Juyeong.

168
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
I used to think

169
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,430
I had a weapon

170
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,870
that can break your bond clean.

171
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,340
Because before the college entrance exams,

172
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,600
I told you everything.

173
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,540
I thought you weren't coming.

174
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,240
My dad said the police got a report about a fight in your house.

175
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,960
But you ignored everything and went in.

176
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,630
So I thought if Juyeong found out, he'd be really turned off

177
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,280
and call it quits

178
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,460
with you.

179
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,050
But Juyeong was just worried about how distraught you must've been

180
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,110
to act like nothing happened.

181
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,090

00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,270

183
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,490
opened my heart to you earlier,

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,020
would it be different?

185
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,380
What difference could there be?

186
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
On the exam day...

187
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,860
Do you think my mistake is worse than Juyeong's?

188
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,560
If I hadn't told you,

189
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,760
you wouldn't have messed up your exams.

190
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,490
Or was it wrong of me to run into you in Hanseol Uni?

191
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,860
(Lee Dohoe)

192
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,220
You pretend you don't hate it even though you do,

193
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,320
always acting like you're fine.

194
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,390
But you never let me go near you.

195
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,180
Why did you stay by my side then?

196
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,570
Even now, if you won't even see me,

197
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,430
you shouldn't have stayed by my side.

198
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,040
It's the same as back then.

199
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,430
When the other kids and I were beating you up,

200
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
you never shed a single tear.

201
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,370
You wouldn't even beg for forgiveness,

202
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,680
But to Shin Juyeong, whom you just met,

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,100
you knelt down and cried.

204
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,490
I realized it then.

205
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,160
I bullied you because I like you.

206
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,350
We've known each other for more than a decade,

207
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,860
but you never showed me that side of you.

208
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,510
You never smiled to me too.

209
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,710
Hyeonho.

210
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,250
On the exam day,

211
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,500
before you told me,

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,750
I already knew Juyeong was beaten up.

213
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,870
I just pretended not to.

214
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,050
I ended up like this because that's who I am.

215
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,090
After hiding that,

216
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,720
I wanted to hide everything about me.

217
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
I can't even take care of myself,

218
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,720
so I didn't have the energy to take care of you.

219
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,990
Regardless,

221
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,290
the reason I could hang on until today...

222
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,130
was because you were my friend.

223
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,710
That's why I could survive.

224
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,829
I'm indebted to too many people.

225
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,640
Don't say things you don't mean.

226
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,270
Forget it.

227
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,200
I can't do this anymore.

228
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,940
Is it because I'm from the Gyeongsang Province?

229
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,840
From now on, live a happy life.

230
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,910
Don't turn down my help for this matter.

231
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,790
I called for this.

232
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,040
That's why I yapped about all that cheesy stuff.

233
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,410
Thank you.

234
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,210
I'm hanging up.

235
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,460
What do you want to eat tonight?

236
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,070
Rice.

237
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,290
Let's eat rice.

238
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,740
But I don't like rice.

239
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,800
I like bread.

240
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,730
Let's eat bread today. Yay, bread!

241
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,000
Bread again?

242
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,030
Let's eat bread.

243
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,390
What bread?

244
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,360
(Walden)
What bread?

245
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,930
(Walden)

246
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,830
Uh...
(Walden)

247
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,850
(Walden)

248
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,770
Pizza bread.
(Walden)

249
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,830
-It's been ten years and you still aren't tired of it?
-Yeah.

250
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,710
It's yummy.

251
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,380
It has ham and cheese.

252
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,630
(Court)

253
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,650
Falsifying documents and using them are clearly crimes.
(Court)

254
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,260
(Court)

255
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,460
But considering that
(Court)

256
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,030
a petition for leniency from the victims has been submitted,

257
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,090
that the defendant is a first-time offender who is sincerely remorseful,

258
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,680
and that all the profits he earned

259
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,330
would go to the social development fund,

260
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,650
he is sentenced to six months in prison and two years of probation.

261
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,990
Want to...

262
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,520
eat together before you go?

263
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,970
Sure.

264
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,540
Thanks for your hard work.

265
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,530
-By the way...
-Mm.

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,360
Where do you go every day

267
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,750
without me?

268
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,080
Early this morning too.

269
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,800
Does it bother you?

270
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,200
What's with that reaction?

271
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,540
Come here.

272
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,440
-What is it?
-Drum roll...

273
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,620
Drum roll...

274
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,870
Tada!

275
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,070
Look.

276
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,460
This is a two-year tutoring center.

277
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,940
You can study architecture but you don't get a diploma.

278
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,450
This is a two-year institution where you get a diploma.

279
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,330
This institution focuses more on design, but you get a diploma too.

280
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,130
Or what about...

281
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,940
I've researched about studying abroad too.

282
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,960
With good English grades,

283
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,700
some art learning experience,

284
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,680
and a decent portfolio, you can apply for schools abroad.

285
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
Schools in America, Germany, and Australia.

286
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
So many schools.

287
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,370
Even I got interested while researching it.

288
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,330
To be honest, going abroad is nice too.

289
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,620
I can find a job there.

290
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,640
What about taekwondo?

291
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,700
Huh?

292
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,180
What job? Taekwondo's your calling.

293
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,630
No, I'm looking for something new too.

294
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,950
What do you think I'm suited for?

295
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,750
Be honest with me.

296
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,910
Be honest if you want to be with me forever.

297
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,190
Don't ever sacrifice for me.

298
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't want that. It's burdensome too.

299
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,210
You like teaching kids.

300
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,990
Just do what you like.

301
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,690
I'll prepare for the college entrance exam again.

302
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,610
I know it's not a good idea.

303
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,270
But I guess I can't help it.

304
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,300
I want to do what everyone deems as right.

305
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,020
I want to be a good person.

306
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,820
But I just can't do it.

307
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,360
I know life's not just about success,

308
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,860
but I think there's no other way

309
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,850
I can forgive myself.

310
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,950
I think I must make it.

311
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,960
Maybe I can really do it this time.

312
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,390
Because you're by my side.

313
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,750
I want to try it one last time.

314
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,120
No matter what you do,

315
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,590
what kind of person you are,

316
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,070
and how you turn out,

317
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,260
I like it all.

318
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,330
For a year,

319
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
I might be of no help to you.

320
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,680
I have nothing now too.

321
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,000
So...

322
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,430
-Let's live separately for just a year...
-Hey!

323
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,470
Are you serious?

324
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,190
Separate again?

325
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,380
Just live here with me.

326
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,230
I'll do everything for you.

327
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,330
I'll hold down the fort no matter what.

328
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,280
Just stay here.

329
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,300
Just start over afresh.

330
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,160
That... What was that again?

331
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,980
I read it in a book.

332
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,450
Don't be greedy.

333
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,290
You just need a place to sleep comfortably.

334
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Let's start over like this.

335
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,410
Then try to fix me.

336
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,470
Just like you always do.

337
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,470
Look at you.

338
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
You...

339
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
You'd better not try to leave again.

340
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,470
I'm just a loser with too much pride.

341
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,670
Even so, don't abandon me.

342
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,110
Okay?

343
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,170
What are you talking about? Are you being coy with me?

344
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,020
That's what I should say to you.

345
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,010
Hey! What are you doing here?

346
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,190
Well...

347
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,470
-I want you to meet someone.
-Hello.

348
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,680
Wow! You are...

349
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
The man who makes you cry.

350
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,200
Sorry?

351
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,530
Wow, it's really you...

352
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,920
Wow. Seriously. Hello.

353
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,860
Hello.

354
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,040
-Wow, this is so fascinating.
-Why?

355
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,410
-You're totally a celebrity at our school.
-Sorry?

356
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,930
-What are you talking about?
-There's a legend in our school.

357
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,770
-About me?
-Yes.

358
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,100
-Hey...
-The man who makes him cry.

359
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,200
Snowman? Makes him cry?

360
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,030
He becomes a zombie whenever he sees snow.

361
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,050
-Really?
-Stop it.

362
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,420
Stop what? It's true. Don't you remember?

363
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,890
-We were drinking at a bar.
-I see.

364
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,630
-While we were drinking...
-Yeah, and?

365
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,110
-You...
-It started snowing outside.

366
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,310
All of a sudden... I'm totally serious.

367
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,780
He saw the snow and...

368
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,180
walked like this.

369
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,860
-Whenever it snows?
-No.

370
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,180
Wow, it's snowing!

371
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,740
-Like this.
-Really?

372
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,900
You remembered it wrong because you were drunk.

373
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,090
And you... I wanted to stop him,

374
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,090
but his walk shocked me that I froze.

375
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,240
-Really?
-Then he was on the ground crying.

376
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
-He cried?
-Yes, he did.

377
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,550
Our friends ignored him in the end.

378
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,820
Hey. Only I took care of you.

379
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,840
Be grateful.

380
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,070
I should thank her then.

381
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,000
You're welcome.

(The Future of Exam Questions)
(Compilation of questions and question types for the past 4 years)

383
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,280
(Soju)

384
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,350
Should I take the exam too?

385
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,750
I'm lacking in history knowledge.

386
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,290
But I don't want to do Korean, math, and foreign language.

387
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,220
What did you say?

388
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,690
These days, they call it

389
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,140
Korean, math, and English.

390
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,600
You're so old-fashioned.

391
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,220
-Why did it suddenly change?
-What do you mean suddenly?

392
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,300
Korean, math, and English?

393
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,540
Must it be English? In this global era?

394
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,850
Are you okay?

395
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,020
Why would I not be?

396
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,270
I'm just paying my respects.

397
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,250
We even kissed here.

398
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,800
You remember?

399
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,350
We almost kissed.

400
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,050
It's the same.

401
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,170
Speaking of which, am I your first kiss?

402
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,770
Are you serious?

403
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,910
Do you think people would leave me alone?

404
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,510
You're neither my first love nor my first kiss.

405
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,010
But it is for me.

406
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,690
Wait...

407
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,050
It is?

408
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,580
I only focused on studying.

409
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,970
Of course, it is.

410
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,530
It wasn't my first kiss.

411
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,750
So are you saying I'm still your first love?

412
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,170
Yes, you're right. Of course it is.

413
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,900
When we first kissed here,

414
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,750
it was the first time that I started to dream of happiness.

415
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,970
No matter how hard it is, I can make it through.

416
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,070
I'll be happy as long as he's with me.

417
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,740
If things got better,

419
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,260
if things got easier,

420
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,510
if I got into my dream university,

421
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,740
I'd have looked for you with a smile on my face.

422
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,870
But you came to me first in the end.

423
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,450
But...

424
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,760
I think I unconsciously knew it.

425
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,640
If I go to where Shin Juyeong is,

426
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,820
I can go back to the moment I stopped living.

427
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,640
I think that's why I had to go there...

428
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,810
To meet you.

429
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,080
You're really smart. You came to me at the perfect timing.

430
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,110
We're still young.

431
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,220
And now,

432
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,360
we've found love that others take a lifetime to find.

433
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,840
That's a big deal.

434
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,050
With that alone,

435
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,420
I think I've achieved a big goal in life.

436
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,530
I look forward to your assistance.

437
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,340
But...

438
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,610
You know what...

439
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,000
Hmm?

440
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,260
When you're studying,

441
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,840
will kissing hinder you?

442
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,430
Kissing? I don't think it's a good idea.

443
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,930
You talk too much.

444
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,980
I said no.

445
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,500
Yeah? Watch yourself.

446
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,210
It's always up to you.

447
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,660
You do it whenever you want,

448
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,320
but I can't do it when I want to.

449
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,230
You talk too much.

450
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,170
What did you say?

451
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,000
I keep unconsciously speaking like you.

452
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,450
Do you know how hard I worked

453
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,510
to fix this habit?

454
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,750
Poor thing, you worked really hard to fix it?

455
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,440
The man who makes you cry?

456
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
No matter how I think about it, I don't like that nickname.

457
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,830
Right?

458
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,680
I don't like it either.

459
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,070
How can you call someone that?

460
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,490
Hey, wait. My eyes...

461
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,150
-What's wrong?
-I think something got in.

462
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,570
-Wait.
-Huh? Let me see.

463
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,970
I've to kiss you as much as I can now!

464
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,080
I can't do it when you start studying!

465
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,680
Shin Juyeong!

466
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,960
Thank you for being my family.

467
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
Don't make me blush.

468
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,350
Thank you.

469
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,570
Hey!

470
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,000
Thank you.

471
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,640
Not for that.

472
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,390
Thank you.

473
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,590
Come here. Hey!

474
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,390
-Juyeong.
-Yeah?

475
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,940
-Come here.
-Why?

476
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,940
-Juyeong.
-Hmm?

477
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,200
-Did you just shower?
-Mm.

478
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,310
-Come here.
-What is it?

479
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,070
Come here.

480
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,700
What is this?

481
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,030
-Huh?
-The bathroom.

482
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,750
Are you going to keep doing this?

483
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,270
-Why? It's clean.
-What did I say?

484
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,430
Don't splash water on the toilet before you take a shower.

485
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,080
And what's with all that hair?

486
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,760
-Who ends up cleaning it?
-Okay, okay.

487
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,580
-I'll clean it up.
-I said don't splash water on the toilet.

488
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,060
I'll clean it up!

489
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,800
I'll clean it up!

490
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,460
Even though we're average people without any so-called success,

491
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,409
we're spending our life together

492
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,670
where we fight sometimes,

493
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,110
sulk sometimes,

494
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,889
laugh a lot, and love each other a lot.

495
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Even if everyone,

496
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,560
even my family, abandoned me,

497
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,150
I still have myself, you,

498
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,370
and us.

499
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,300
-Isn't it good?
-It's really good.

500
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,230
-Isn't it decent?
-Mm.

501
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,360
-Isn't it good?
-Mm!

502
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,639
It's good.

503
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,960
Well...

504
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,070
What was that for?

505
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,700
Well... Just...

506
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,130
It's been a week.

507
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,950
What has?

508
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,110
I'm just saying.

509
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,560
What are you trying to say?

510
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,120
Do you know it's Christmas Eve tomorrow?

511
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,110
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow?

512
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,860
Go get changed.

513
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,870
Is this a signal?

514
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll change right away.

515
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,600
-It's not a signal.
-I'm going in.

516
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,510
You smell of sweat. We're eating.

517
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,910
Go on.

518
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,570
You're full of sweat. Go wash up.

519
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,780
Okay.

520
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,740
To create a romantic mood, I lit candles and made pasta,

521
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,020
but you're still so dense.

522
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,270
Goodness.

523
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,070
Christmas present.

524
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,090
Happy?

525
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,470
No, wait.

526
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,210
This is just the beginning.

527
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,560
What are you doing?

528
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,290
Hmm?

529
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,850
Come and sleep.

530
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,980
I'll go to bed after I finish this.

531
