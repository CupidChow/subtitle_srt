But just because he had to act like he didn't know about the physical abuse,

182
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,630
he's been in agony for 12 years.

183
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,280
You and Dohoe are not the same.

184
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,280
Don't you dare assume things about him

185
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,400
ever again.

186
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,369
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,680
I won't talk about things you don't want to hear anymore.

188
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,930
Let's just go.

189
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,060
I'll throw away the envelope. Don't worry.

190
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,510
Shin Juyeong.

191
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,580
Why do you keep crying?

192
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm asking you. Why do you keep crying?

193
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,360
When did I cry?

194
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,740
Because my eyes are pretty.

195
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,590
Say it.

196
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,100
Say what?

197
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm stupid and thoughtless.

198
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,530
What would I know?

199
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,700
Leave.

200
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,870
If you found out, leave.

201
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,880
You can stop the pretence now.

202
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,170
Save your tears and just go.

203
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,670
What do I know? I really don't know.

204
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,650
You should mock me

205
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,220
for being so full of myself,

206
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,340
or call me a monster and run away.

207
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,290
Why the hell are you crying?

208
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,540
This is who I am.

209
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm just a useless nobody.

210
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,730
It must've been tough on you.

211
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,160
You had to pretend

212
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,230
like you didn't know all this time.

213
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,620
Do you really want me to leave?

214
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,630
Let's go our separate ways.

215
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,130
I'll go back on my own.

216
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,380
What would you do if you were me?

217
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,770
I ruined the dream of the person I love.

218
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,680
Then he disappeared from my life and I couldn't even say sorry.

219
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,140
Then we finally reunited.

220
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,930
If you keep denying me and the past...

221
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,710
But it was all my fault.

222
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,910
What do you want me to do?

223
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,730
Did I ask you to do anything for me?

224
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,820
Dohoe.

225
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,310
Listen to me.

226
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,890
I don't want to leave you anymore.

227
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,980
If it's not because you hate me or want me out of your sight,

228
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,140
then don't say that.

229
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,520
Why do you keep wanting to abandon me?

230
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,780
Please don't abandon me.

231
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,370
No matter what happens,

232
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,110
until you beg me to get lost because you can't stand me,

233
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,140
I'll always be by your side.

234
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,410
It was not your fault.

235
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,810
You didn't do anything wrong at all. Don't say that.

236
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,070
I wanted to prove that I'm different from my dad.

237
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,990
But when people heard that I'm from Hanseol Uni,

238
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,260
they trusted me and liked me regardless of my past.

239
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,710
I felt on top of the world.

240
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,550
Even if I have nothing,

241
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,120
people still like me.

242
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,750
This is the only way...

243
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,330
I could prove myself.

244
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,950
That's why I did that.

245
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,400
Dohoe! Dohoe! Dohoe!

246
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,330
Hey!

247
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,170
It's so hard to see you!

248
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,110
I heard you took a leave of absence again.

249
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,640
Are you that short of money?

250
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,190
No way.

251
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,640
He's already famous in the Gangnam district

252
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,630
for his tutoring.

253
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,960
-Wow.
-Woah...

254
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,820
Are you okay?

255
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,190
Are you tired?

256
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,560
I'm fine.

257
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,510
(Certificate of Enrollment) (Hanseol University)
(Lee Dohoe, Sophomore) (Engineering Department, Architecture Major)

258
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,990
(Certificate of Enrollment)

259
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,340
(I certify that the above information is true and correct.)
(2015.02.27)

260
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,490
I just...

261
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,200
I got off on the wrong foot.

262
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,620
I don't know what to do anymore.

263
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,540
You can start over again.

264
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,370
Look at the air.

265
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,430
Doesn't it look like I'm smoking?

266
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,880
I told you to quit smoking.

267
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,520
Look who's talking. You should quit drinking, little one.

268
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,850
I'm not little anymore.

269
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,000
Aren't you hungry?

270
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,070
I only had a cup of coffee all day.

271
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,140
Because of you.

272
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,240
What do you want to eat?

273
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,600
I want rice with soy sauce and fried eggs.

274
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,750
Rice with soy sauce and fried eggs?

275
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,470
I'll make it for you. Let's go.

276
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,050
Okay.
