(Nothing in this series has anything to do with real life.)

00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm living like in a dream...

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,482
This day was really cool!

6
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,637
Mom, let's go quickly!

7
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,797
Yes, mom is already leaving.

8
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,710
Let's ride in a carriage.

9
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:07,306
Did you see that?

10
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:15,914
Okay, let's go.

00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:20,095
[Job House: Your job application results have been announced.]

(No Internet connection at this time.)

13
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:35,772
Hey, Min Na?

14
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,132
Min Na!

15
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,092
Min Na!

16
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,412
Min Na?

17
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:49,732
Min Na!

18
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:52,268
(Children's toy sector.)

19
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,159
Min Na!

20
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:56,380
Don't leave mom's side!

21
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,411
I told you to stay close.

22
00:02:57,628 --> 00:02:59,916
It's dangerous because there are a lot of people here.

23
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,388
I want this.

24
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,450
Mom also bought you a doll last time.

25
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,890
Mom is busy today, so leave it for next time.

26
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,330
Okay, so let's go?

27
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,650
No mother!

28
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,730
And a promise from mom.

29
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,544
I will definitely buy it next time.

30
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:31,196
What is that?

31
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:41,479
(Hello. I'm a recruitment manager at K-Mart. Congratulations on passing the document screening for cashier staff recruitment.)

32
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:45,128
Min Na, let's go!

33
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:51,469
Let's go this way.

00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:55,183
(Tarot: Episode 1)

35

(Title: Santa's Visit.)

36
00:03:58,523 --> 00:03:59,323
This is unbelievable.

37
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:02,036
Tinkerbell is running out of steam!

38
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:03,563
Peter Pan is...

39
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,000
Holding Tinkerbell in his arms,

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,156
And shedding your tears.

41
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:07,721
No no!

42
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,401
If children don't believe in fairies,

43
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,401
Tinkerbell will die.

44
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:14,361
If you believe in fairies...

45
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:15,801
Clap your hands, children.

46
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:17,880
quick now!

47
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:21,675
Min Na, do you also believe in fairies?

48
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,404
Yes I believe!

49
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:25,484
Wow!

50
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,235
Thank you to all of you who believe in fairies.

51
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,323
Tinkerbell is alive again!

52
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,934
Is it true mom?

53
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,025
Clear!

54
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:34,804
All of us...

55
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,235
We have a fairy in our hearts.

56
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,624
But if someone says there are no fairies...

57
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,055
That moment,

58
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,424
Even the fairies disappear!

59
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,144
So I'll never see them again?

60
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:49,695
Yes!

61
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,624
You will never see them again.

62
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,055
Therefore...

63
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:57,304
Min Na must also continue to believe in fairies.

64
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:58,935
Did you understand?

65
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:14,752
Didn't you play with Lily today?

66
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,327
No.

67
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,992
Lily only comes when she has no one around.

68
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,302
Well, is Lily shy?

69
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,542
No, she came to my house too.

70
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,982
Mom, didn't you know?

71
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:32,825
Really?

72
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:35,665
Where...

73
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:37,215
Is Lily there?

74
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:07,733
You can't look at that!

75
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,956
Lily gets shy!

76
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
All good!

77
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:20,945
Min Na is...

78
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,094
She is very good at making up lies.

79
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,414
I think I'll make her a novelist later.

80
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,720
Will it be like Joanne Rowling from Harry Potter?

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,465
You understand?

82
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:33,922
It's all because she looks like you.

83
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,122
My god, why are you making this up?

84
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:37,922
Because there was no girl to follow you.

85
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,282
I don't scold like my mother.

86
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,082
I'll let her keep lying.

87
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,922
This is how you write great works.

88
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,820
By the way, Dong In...

89
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,340
What do you expect from this job?

90
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,820
I need to find out too.

91
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:56,040
Anywhere,

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,121
Don't work cheap.

93
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,841
That's not why I sent you to college.

94
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,807
Oh my god, don't worry mom.

95
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,186
Card of luck and opportunity?

96
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:39,035
Hi, I'm Dong In.

97
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:40,755
Did you work on Choi Seung-il?

98
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:43,915
During college, I worked part-time at a convenience store for about three months.

99
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,570
It's completely different from a convenience store.

100
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,610
Oh, right...

101
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:55,700
If you plan to survive after graduating from college,

102
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,806
Don't start at all.

103
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,406
The ladies here too...

104
00:07:58,673 --> 00:07:59,846
They are generally university graduates.

105
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,751
Oh, right...

106
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:05,751
You will work from Christmas onwards.

107
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:07,306
What?

108
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,328
Are you talking about...

109
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,231
Christmas tomorrow?

110
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:11,568
Yes.

111
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:12,831
Why, will you be busy?

112
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:14,631
Get real.

113
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:17,608
Yes.

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,509
Oh, more...

115
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,509
How do you know,

116
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,844
At Christmas we are also on vacation.

117
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,709
Yes I know.

118
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,509
Oh, I'm sorry, teacher.

119
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,229
Thanks!

120
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,019
Hi Mom.

121
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,820
Maybe on the twenty-fifth...

122
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,860
Can I drop Min off at your house?

123
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,860
It's my first day of work that day.

124
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:55,780
I have nowhere to leave Min na.

125
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,500
Isn't the twenty-fifth a holiday?

126
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:00,720
But what company is this?

127
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,997
Going to work on holidays?

128
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,117
It's not a company, it's just a part-time job.

129
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,197
I told you not to do that.

130
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:10,397
So what should I do?

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,917
Right now, I have nowhere to find money for the next month.

132
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:16,117
What should I do?

133
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
All good!

134
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:36,037
[Jong-Hoon Yoon.]

135
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,503
Gregor's gaze turned to the window.

136
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:49,463
The cloudy weather...

137
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,343
left him depressed.

138
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:52,780
Raindrops,

139
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,560
on the window sill.

140
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,823
And he heard a loud sound falling.

141
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,200
Min Na, is this book boring?

142
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,600
No, it's fun!

143
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,236
But I'm sleepy.

144
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,977
"Sleepy?"

145
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,182
Let's go to sleep!

146
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:13,417
Ready!

147
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:18,753
Min Na.

148
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,233
Mom has to go to work tomorrow.

149
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,757
Can you be alone at home?

150
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:27,488
Yes.

151
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:29,511
Everything is fine?

152
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,960
Mom has lunch and dinner,

153
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,271
I'll also pack all your lunch boxes.

154
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,431
I'll put it in the fridge.

155
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,511
Can you take it out and eat it alone?

156
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,485
So can I bring a friend?

157
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,234
"Friend?"

158
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:45,794
Do you mean Lily?

159
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:49,711
Okay, you can bring Lily.

160
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:51,431
All good.

161
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:55,608
And if someone rings the doorbell or knocks on the door,

162
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,031
You must never open the door.

163
00:10:57,888 --> 00:10:59,071
As if there was no one home.

164
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,231
You have to be silent.

165
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:03,405
Why must it be this way?

166
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,725
If a stranger comes in...

167
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,405
Lily will be embarrassed.

168
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:13,685
I understand.

169
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,445
OK mother!

170
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,743
Sleep!

171
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,932
I hate Christmas.

172
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:33,052
Ji Woo, do you know this?

173
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,532
They say that when Jesus was born,

174
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,532
Hundreds of babies were sacrificed.

175
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh my God!

176
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,732
I'm doing this because I'm broke.

177
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:40,892
I really do not understand.

178
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:43,635
Take a good look.

179
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,284
If the...

180
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,900
item is like this...

181
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,155
This means the customer leaves.

182
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:50,315
Well, what do I mean...

183
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,140
Take it directly to the customer service center.

184
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,955
And you have to report it.

185
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:54,220
however...

186
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,915
There are a lot of people who don't come looking.

187
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,475
When you see something like this,

188
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:58,995
Keep it under the counter.

189
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:02,692
And then?

190
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,067
Well, when you come and pick it up at the checkout,

191
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:05,947
Just delivered.

192
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,820
But hey!

193
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,667
The ladies who live at Hicle Premium,

194
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,707
Don't come here to look for little things like that.

195
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,172
It's annoying!

196
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:15,747
So in a few days we will...

197
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,067
Take care of it.

198
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,574
Is this right?

199
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,208
No one cares!

200
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,271
And the manager clearly knows...

201
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,711
Looks like he's leaving it alone.

202
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,551
It's 194,000 won.

203
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:43,128
C'mon C'mon!

204
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:43,928
Thanks!

205
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,367
Excuse me?

206
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,592
Min Na, I called you because Mom is free.

207
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,461
Is having fun?

208
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:28,047
You ate?

209
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,632
Yes, I ate.

210
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:33,354
Good job. Are you having a lot of fun with Lily?

211
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,340
No.

212
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,274
Today I went with a friend who isn't Lily.

213
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,405
Who?

214
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:41,594
A Santa Claus.

215
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,222
"Santa Claus?"

216
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:46,506
Yes!

217
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:49,434
We are playing together now.

218
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,800
You didn't open the door right, Min Na?

219
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
I didn't open the door.

220
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
A Santa Claus,

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,640
I heard he came down the chimney.

222
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,840
What?

223
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,681
Now I have to hang up, mom is busy.

224
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:07,992
Have fun.

225
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,281
Yes.

226
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:15,528
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,641
Wow, it looks delicious!

228
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:23,638
[Ji Woo] (Min Na, are you okay?)

229
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:24,438
Let's go.

230
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:25,801
We need to eat quickly.

231
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:28,241
We have to eat now.

232
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:30,118
[Min Na] (Santa also gave me a gift.)

233
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,241
She is the spitting image of my daughter.

234
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,140
[Min Na] (Santa also gave me a gift.)

235
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,321
You will regret it if you don't eat it now.

236
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,537
[Min Na] (Santa also gave me a gift.)

237
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:40,935
[Ji Woo] (What kind of gift is this?)

238
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:43,640
We have to go to the bathroom after eating.

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,490
You will regret it if you don't go now.

240
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,490
I'm not tight.

241
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,210
I'm in a hurry, let's go to the bathroom.

242
00:14:53,908 --> 00:15:01,399
[Ji Woo] (Was that something Onji gave you a while ago? I don't remember.)

243
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,918
[Min Na] (I heard Santa Claus would give it to me next month.)

244
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,430
[Ji Woo] (What's Santa Claus like?)

245
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,358
[Min Na] (He is very big and has a lot of beard.)

246
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:21,196
[Ji Woo] (Is his beard as white as snow? Is he wearing red clothes too?)

247
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:25,199
[Min] (No, it's a white beard. It's not even a red suit.)

248
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,720
Ji Woo, did you come here for a picnic?

249
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,680
Did you come here for lunch or to check your cell phone?

250
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,079
I'm sorry!

251
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,440
I told you today was a busy day.

252
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,200
Leave quickly!

253
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,880
I'm sorry!

254
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:49,941
Thanks.

255
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:58,426
[Ji Woo] Min Na, I'm leaving soon, so you can tell Santa to leave now. )

256
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,868
[Min Na] (I'm going through a transformation right now.)

257
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:07,803
What are you doing?

258
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,723
Did Ji Woo lose concentration?

259
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,716
Yes...

260
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,923
Hey manager, let me ask...

261
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:18,563
Can I go home now?

262
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:21,148
What did you say?

263
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,251
I don't know if I heard right...

264
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:26,714
Are you begging for a job and now you want to leave?

265
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,868
I'm really sorry...

266
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,460
I have someone in trouble.

267
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,500
You also have no idea how we are.

268
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,048
I'll give you 35 minutes, so go and come back as quickly as possible.

269
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,008
If it's too late, don't think about working here in the future.

270
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,603
His call was not answered.

271
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,083
My God.

272
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,692
Jong-Hoon Yoon.

273
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:36,362
Kindness.

274
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,722
Hello?

275
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,357
When it turns 22:00,

276
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:40,957
Please go find Min Na.

277
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,402
Could it be?

278
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,122
Why are you suddenly acting like this again?

279
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,317
I'm going through a difficult time.

280
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,968
Min Na. may be in danger now.

281
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:50,728
I will send you my password.

282
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:53,288
Just make sure she's okay, I'm busy.

283
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,528
I can not do this. I'm out of the country now.

284
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,688
No no...

285
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,151
What?

286
00:17:58,671 --> 00:17:59,471
"Outside the country?"

287
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:03,814
Did you go out again?

288
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,025
Serious?

289
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,374
You son of a bitch.

290
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,060
You bastard!

291
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,454
I'm home alone on Christmas Day.

292
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,094
Is it worth traveling with just any woman?

293
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,091
Go and have fun.

294
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:21,611
If you come back here, I will kill you!

295
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,686
Min Na!

296
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:51,525
Mom, look, these clothes still fit me.

297
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:55,477
I was worried about you!

298
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:57,965
Let me show you how to do ballet.

299
00:18:58,714 --> 00:18:59,514
Right.

300
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:22,736
Who is with you?

301
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:23,536
Who...

302
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:25,943
Who is filming now?

303
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:28,456
Min Na!

304
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:30,496
Min Na!

305
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,935
I think you came here to see something big happen.

306
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,175
Manager Choi...

307
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,975
I really haven't been feeling well since this morning.

308
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:53,608
Can you release me early today?

309
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,514
sorry.

310
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:55,654
All good.

311
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,655
I thought your face was a bit pale.

312
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,167
You can quit whenever you want.

313
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,807
Let's discuss what needs to be discussed first.

314
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:10,752
Why are you doing this?

315
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:16,448
Follow me for a moment.

316
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:26,536
Please explain to me.

317
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,060
The customer forgot this and I left it at the register.

318
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,460
I thought she was going to come back for it,

319
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:34,740
That's why I left it at the checkout.

320
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,300
What did you learn from taking something from a customer?

321
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,179
Repeat with me.

322
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,060
I did not have time.

323
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,580
Tell me what you learned!

324
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:53,023
Put it in the customer service center.

325
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,463
Ji Woo, didn't you have time?

326
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,543
He didn't eat what he was supposed to eat.

327
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,103
She was caught texting.

328
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:00,823
He stayed in the bathroom for 10 minutes.

329
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,423
and you still haven't had time?

330
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:04,985
sorry.

331
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:06,785
It's because...

332
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:08,854
My daughter is home alone now.

333
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,580
I'm so worried,

334
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,614
Because I can't get in touch with her.

335
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:12,734
The ladies here...

336
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:15,974
They all have children that they leave alone at home.

337
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,494
Do you think you are the only one?

338
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,054
Do you think you're better, just because it's your first day?

339
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:24,752
Manager Choi...

340
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,712
When a person speaks you have to concentrate!

341
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:31,232
Don't worry about other things that make you lose attention.

342
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:33,112
I need to contact my daughter.

343
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:34,392
Please return it for a moment.

344
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,301
I know what robbery is.

345
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,101
I'll call the police if there's anything suspicious.

346
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,421
I'll check the CCTV and come back.

347
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:43,861
wait here.

348
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:45,618
Director choi!

349
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:55,538
We will see.

350
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:59,092
It's hard to tell if she's stealing.

351
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,372
You can't blame her...

352
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,052
Because it was placed inside the store.

353
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,052
So this woman didn't steal?

354
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,492
Even if she's not guilty.

355
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,532
For this to happen,

356
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:12,652
Something like that should have been filmed.

357
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,652
This is a mess.

358
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,514
I'll go to the police station.

359
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,085
I will sue you.

360
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:21,725
I'm going to talk...

361
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:25,369
That you took my cell phone.

362
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,104
Excuse me, I will leave now.

363
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,998
If anything happens to Min Na.

364
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,998
I will come back and kill you!

365
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:09,242
Min Na, I'm leaving.

366
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,082
What happened today?

367
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,737
Today I played with Santa Claus all afternoon.

368
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:15,882
I also did ballet.

369
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,057
That's not what I'm asking!

370
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:20,745
Try to say everything.

371
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:24,985
I got a gift, it was really fun.

372
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:26,460
Santa Claus,

373
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,905
She also taught me magic.

374
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:30,305
Mom, should I show you now?

375
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,345
That's not it, when will you understand me?

376
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,323
What did you do with that fake Santa?

377
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:38,563
Where he came from?

378
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,260
In?

379
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,763
Everyone but you are bandits.

380
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:42,676
I really do not understand!

381
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:44,396
Mother.

382
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,776
Why do you answer correctly?

383
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,383
you now...

384
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:50,623
this alone?

385
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:52,776
Have someone with you?

386
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:54,776
No.

387
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:58,136
There is no one here.

388
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,058
I'm already leaving.

389
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:04,778
Stay still and don't move.

390
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:20,366
Min Na!

391
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,080
Mom was worried!

392
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,836
Min Na, let's eat.

393
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,760
Min Na?

394
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,310
Min Na.

395
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,292
Do you want to play hide and seek with mom like last time?

396
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,110
Right.

397
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,289
Mom will look for it.

398
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,569
Were you surprised because your mother screamed?

399
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:04,292
Mom is...

400
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:06,760
Milae and Santa Claus are beautiful.

401
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,867
I think I may have scared you.

402
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:09,907
I did it because I was worried.

403
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:18,376
Right...

404
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:20,624
Now there's only one place left...

405
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,744
Mom will give you a surprise when she opens it.

406
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:25,584
I am scared!

407
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:28,496
Right...

408
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,424
Mom will open it now.

409
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:15,609
Min Na.

410
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:19,835
Min Na.

411
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,205
where are you now?

412
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,280
Min Na!

413
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,920
Min Na!

414
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:36,933
Min Na!

415
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:39,053
Min Na, where are you?

416
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:42,393
Min Na?

417
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:43,873
Min Na?

418
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,726
Where are you Min Na?

419
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,526
Mom is not in the mood for games.

420
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:51,553
Leave quickly.

421
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:52,646
Min Na.

422
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,369
( Peter Pan )

423
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,880
Min Na.

424
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
All of us...

425
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
We have a fairy in our hearts.

426
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,800
But if someone says there are no fairies.

427
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,200
That moment,

428
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,200
Even the fairies disappear.

429
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,185
So I'll never see them again?

430
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:47,334
Yes.

431
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:49,385
You'll never see it again.

432
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:05,558
Min Na!

433
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,583
Where are you?

434
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:12,271
Min Na!

435
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:16,285
Min Na, where are you?

436
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,055
Min Na...

437
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:21,305
What are you doing with the fake Santa?

438
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:22,545
Where he came from?

439
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,760
Everyone but you are bandits.

440
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,560
I really do not understand.

441
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,265
Answer me correctly.

442
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,318
you now...

443
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:30,838
This alone?

444
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:32,522
Have someone with you?

445
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,278
In?

446
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:36,922
The number you are calling does not exist.

447
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:38,640
Please check again...

448
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,922
Whether the number dialed is correct.

449
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,722
I don't scold like my mother.

450
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:44,522
I'll let her keep lying.

451
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,402
Only then will you be able to write great works.

452
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,042
It's time to stop talking about Min Na.

453
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,280
She's home alone in the middle of Christmas!

454
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:57,002
What if something happens to her?

455
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,659
Please stop talking about Min Na.

456
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:00,722
I'm also going through difficult times since she left.

457
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:02,082
You bastard!

458
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:04,562
Hello, mom.

459
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,040
I think about you every Christmas.

460
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,642
I understand you are calling.

461
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,722
Please stop sending me folktales now.

462
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:29,310
Min Na.

463
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,310
Where you...

464
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:38,640
where are you?

465
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,230
What happened then?

466
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,550
I remember that...

467
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,610
When I was leaving the dorm, and something unfortunate happened.

468
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,930
Is that what happened next?

469
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:05,280
(Elevator: under renovation)

470
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,900
What is that?

471
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,004
(Elevator: under renovation)

472
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,060
My legs already hurt.

473
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,830
Yeon, how long ago did you join our company?

474
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,250
5 years.

475
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,970
"5 years?"

476
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,472
The toilet paper fell out on the 300th time, the bedsheet fell out on the 307th time, the trash can wasn't emptied.

477
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:24,050
and most importantly, why is the ballpoint pen like that?

478
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,230
They make me come down from my room, why?

479
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,310
Did I tell you to take care of the ballpoint pen or not?

480
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,470
I'm sorry.

481
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,470
What?

482
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,970
Excuse me.

483
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,850
This is already the fifth box of ballpoint pens I have purchased.

484
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,850
Why don't you always take good care of your ballpoint pen?

485
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,230
sorry.

486
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,530
I always use a ballpoint pen...

487
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,060
Damn it...

488
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:59,890
I was curious about the letter, so I looked it up and found out what the paper was.

489
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,950
It's not normal paper, but it's not ordinary paper.

490
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,830
Who cares about that?

491
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,355
"Who cares?"

492
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,900
I...

493
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,680
I'll tell you everything now.

494
00:32:23,272 --> 00:32:26,334
(Tarot: Episode 2)

495
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:29,219
(Title: Going home.)

496
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,220
It is not a general dinner, but a team dinner.

497
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,460
The manager is so crazy and crazy.

498
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,160
If not me, who will take care of it?

499
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,140
You are alone now?

500
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm hearing a strange sound.

501
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:42,580
What?

502
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,780
And that the manager is vomiting there and making noise.

503
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,180
Take a taxi and come quickly.

504
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,060
I have to take him home. How can I just get a taxi?

505
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,280
So when will you come?

506
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,520
The manager is here.

507
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,320
Wait a moment, I'll be gone soon.

508
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,300
What?

509
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,960
Did I become the manager again?

510
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,200
Do you accompany the manager?

511
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,020
don't do that.

512
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,300
Manager Gyeong Rae, try attacking the coach again.

513
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
I have to go, something bad is happening at home.

514
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,630
What is wrong? She can find out right away.

515
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,650
You know that letting a woman sleep alone in a motel is really rubbish, right?

516
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,142
I came here because I was worried!

517
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,810
I can make excuses later, but today is very difficult.

518
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,090
"Difficult?"

519
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,230
So I can't do that either.

520
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,950
If you go now, I'll have to call Jiheon directly.

521
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,290
What?

522
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,590
Did you think I didn't even know your wife Gyeong Rae's number?

523
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,450
There is no number.

524
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,470
Yes there is.

525
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:18,630
GyeongRae!

526
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,262
I told you not to do that, it's annoying.

527
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,030
Joohee, please don't do this.

528
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,990
Ji-heon has a shitty personality, so I changed everything about her.

529
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,710
It won't be good for you if rumors spread.

530
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:35,410
Gyeong Rae...

531
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,670
Do you think I can't do this?

532
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,180
Sorry?

533
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,860
Do you think I only have you?

534
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,620
It's not like this.

535
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,296
Love.

536
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,260
I'm in gangnam

537
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm in the middle of Gangnam Station.

538
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,260
Today is Friday. How can I get a taxi at this time?

539
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,220
What a pain in the ass.

540
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,380
Should I...

541
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,320
Should I just rest in the sauna and get a taxi early tomorrow morning?

542
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,480
No. I took a taxi earlier, but these shitty cars go so slow at this time.

543
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,480
it's fine, it's fine.

544
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,540
I'll keep going then.

545
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
I love you dear.

546
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,440
Dude, please charge my phone.

547
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,820
Clear.

548
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,887
"Are you in the middle of gangnam station?"

549
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:09,531
What a lie. the building was demolished years ago.

550
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,054
I am wrong?

551
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,668
What?

552
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,187
Face...

553
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:19,594
Why are you lying?

554
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,640
Is nothing...

555
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,780
It's a long story, but I got fired from my job.

556
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,480
I couldn't tell my wife.

557
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
As soon as I saw it, I was lying to her.

558
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,360
Everything is fine.

559
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,480
Because we all lie.

560
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,200
Women interfere a lot in what is done abroad.

561
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,828
We all fucking hate it.

562
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,780
If you live with this, you have to keep quiet.

563
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,040
I am not right?

564
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,400
What?

565
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,600
"What?"

566
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,920
This drug is not like it used to be.

567
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,360
I have to go back and forth and still earn little.

568
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,038
My temper is not good at all.

569
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:03,934
Damn it...

570
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,000
Damn, these men nowadays don't know how to walk like they used to!

571
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,660
Fuck you, you fucking bastard!

572
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,101
Damn, you asshole walk straight!

573
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,560
That little bastard...

574
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,350
Sir, give me my cell phone.

575
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,330
At this moment it's not possible.

576
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,190
Because of that braggart Byeongjin!

577
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,390
It reminds me of the old days.

578
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,490
I ate national rice a long time ago.

579
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,290
And I hit people.

580
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,130
I met all kinds of men back then.

581
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,030
These bastards who are being rude, I don't know what to do with them.

582
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,530
Look at this bastard.

583
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,950
I was shaking.

584
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,190
What?

585
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,550
Look what I've become, you bastard!

586
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,782
This country is being rude to the end!

587
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,220
I'm going to hang him upside down.

588
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,220
And then?

589
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,660
I'm going to pee in his face.

590
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,440
I was cut off from my night's sleep, so I didn't get a good night's sleep you bastard.

591
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,800
My God, you damn bastard!

592
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:38,484
( Driver's license  )

593
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,170
What are you doing?

594
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,584
I?

595
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:48,108
I'm taking off my shoes.

596
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,230
what?

597
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,470
Look forward!

598
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,630
Oh that?

599
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:01,669
This is my personal taxi.

600
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,630
It's just that my wallet in the photo is not updated.

601
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,530
And at night...

602
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,700
Damn you, do you think I would have killed someone and stolen a car?

603
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,020
In?

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,080
If that were the case, I would have sold the car and fled a long time ago, you idiot.

605
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,420
What it was?

606
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,960
Brother, where are you?

607
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,880
We are almost there?

608
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,140
I'm holding the door...

609
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,460
Okay, I'll finish my work quickly and go.

610
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,440
Yes.

611
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:47,810
Is this the right way?

612
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:48,990
What?

613
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,410
I had to go another way.

614
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,210
Let's get there faster.

615
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,670
Man, I'm in a hurry.

616
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,670
By now your wife must be sleeping, relax.

617
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:34,578
The meter...

618
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,840
It didn't go up.

619
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,060
Right?

620
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes.

621
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,100
I need to see what happened.

622
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,300
Why don't you answer your phone, Mr. Lee?

623
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,410
I'm holding him now, why aren't you answering?

624
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,630
How much was there when all the blood was removed?

625
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,050
But the liver and kidneys must be just as fresh, so why not buy them?

626
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:00,790
but this time it is very big, so you have to pay the right price.

627
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,250
Right?

628
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,490
And be on time for your fucking appointment, you bastard!

629
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,710
Go search the mountain today, you bastard!

630
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,570
You bastard!

631
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,980
That hurts.

632
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,300
what?

633
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

634
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,180
Did you get here after I finished peeing?

635
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,560
I asked if it got here after I peed.

636
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,920
Yes.

637
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:55,395
All very well...

638
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,820
Let's go inside, it's cold.

639
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,200
What are you waiting for?

640
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,420
Right...

641
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,280
The weather is cold.

642
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,560
Get in the car.

643
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,690
(Taxi 24 hours)

644
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,190
Enter quickly.

645
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,845
What are you doing?

646
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,764
All very well.

647
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,530
My phone...

648
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,250
Unbelievable, your cell phone is missing.

649
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,130
He is not here.

650
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:09,870
What?

651
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,430
That always happens here.

652
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,210
I should have bought cellular equipment a long time ago.

653
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,570
Shit...

654
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,330
Who is coming here?

655
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,630
You are very curious.

656
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,200
Did you really not hear me?

657
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,480
Just a person who buys things.

658
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,680
It's like a used transaction, a used transaction.

659
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,200
When I drive, my income is good.

660
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,110
What were you trying to do you burglar?

661
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,460
Die, die, die...

662
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,300
Die, you bastard!

663
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,140
It's self-defense, you bastard.

664
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,900
What do I do?

665
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,500
We just talked on the phone and met for the first time.

666
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,440
You have arrived friends.

667
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,260
Welcome.

668
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:32,960
And things?

669
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:41,273
Help me get the car out of the hole.

670
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,470
Please help me.

671
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,089
let's go fast.

672
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,340
You just have to keep going, just like that.

673
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,650
Everything is alright.

674
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,590
This calligraphy guy...

675
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,620
thanks.

676
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,490
and the items?

677
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,320
I organized it well in the back seat.

678
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,890
You bastard!

679
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,970
No matter how much I said, I did the work first.

680
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,410
I sweated a little.

681
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,870
But I'm sorry.

682
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:47,414
Sir.

683
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,020
Please open the trunk.

684
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,380
All good.

685
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,010
Baby, I'm so sorry.

686
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,290
Now is not a good time...

687
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,930
Suddenly an accident occurs...

688
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,450
No, I found a taxi, but...

689
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,070
What is that?

690
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,170
I don't know.

691
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,350
Wasn't it about selling deer?

692
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,690
I don't know.

693
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,590
This guy doesn't know everything.

694
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,120
Just act like you understand.

695
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,920
But now the taxi driver got lost on the way out.

696
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,000
So I was spinning...

697
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,520
It's getting dark out here...

698
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,920
Sorry.

699
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,860
Have you seen?

700
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,760
No, the item is a little big, so I will do some groundwork.

701
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,730
How much was there when all the blood was removed?

702
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,560
But the liver and kidneys must be just as fresh, so why not buy them?

703
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:25,304
Shit...

704
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:26,810
Should I report this?

705
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,730
Let's catch that bastard first.

706
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,320
We need help moving the crow.

707
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,248
Are you asking me to help you?

708
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,900
Someone has to do this.

709
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,060
Because it has to be prepared by a person.

710
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,980
Grab the front leg first, quickly.

711
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,460
One two three!

712
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,110
But what are you working on?

713
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:10,610
Oh, it's nothing special.

714
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,210
Because I have to draw the blood first.

715
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,010
Cover your upper body first, quickly.

716
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,510
I need to quickly cover your upper body first.

717
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,770
One two three!

718
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:24,750
Go up, quickly.

719
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,560
Wait, go down, go down.

720
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,400
Get down, I have to get from behind.

721
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,580
Because you have to get the position right.

722
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,240
One two three!

723
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,180
Let me go!

724
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,820
What are you doing?

725
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,500
Hey, are you okay?

726
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,000
Hey, where's the rope?

727
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,860
Where did he go?

728
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,740
Shit!

729
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,620
Where did he go?

730
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,570
Why can't I see?

731
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,030
Come back here man.

732
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:21,820
Let's resolve this peacefully.

733
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,250
Show up now!

734
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,070
Or should I call the police?

735
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,180
Stop it you bastards!

736
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,940
Did you see the photo I sent?

737
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,580
That's where I was.

738
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,820
Why can't you trust me?

739
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,400
Manager Gangnam san, right?

740
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,300
Then turn on the GPS, capture it now and send it.

741
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,980
I can't believe you now.

742
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:55,520
hello?

743
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,360
hello?

744
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,180
Do not be silly.

745
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,920
Send me a photo of your current location.

746
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,200
The call was disconnected.

747
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,180
I'll call you later.

748
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,300
Can you hear me?

749
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,490
Sir.

750
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,250
Are you Gyeong Rae?

751
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,330
Can you come with me for a moment?

752
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:38,890
It is me.

753
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,870
why?

754
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,790
I didn't report anything.

755
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,210
You stayed in room 513 at the Woosang Motel, right?

756
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,810
Today at 7pm.

757
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,650
What does it have to do?

758
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,430
I'll explain as we go along, so let's move on.

759
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,140
What did this guy do this with?

760
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,960
Please take a closer photo.

761
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,080
Tell me step by step what happened after you and Lee Joo-hee entered the motel.

762
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:31,460
After about an hour, she spoke to me on the phone.

763
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,520
But I thought I heard someone knocking outside the door.

764
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,260
Don't make things up.

765
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,120
There was never an outside intrusion.

766
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,080
It was self-defense.

767
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,020
What did you say?

768
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,440
Self-defense?

769
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,840
You think I can't do this.

770
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,720
Sorry?

771
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,040
Do you think I only have you?

772
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,820
It's not like this.

773
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,240
Oops!

774
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,700
I'm literally going to call your wife, Gyeong Rae, directly.

775
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,180
By calling 010 -5013.

776
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,861
Shall we see it together?

777
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:20,840
Wow.

778
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,840
Are you Jiyeon, manager Gyeong Rae's wife?

779
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,220
I have a deep relationship with my husband.

780
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,220
Do you know what he just told me?

781
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,880
He told me I'm not the only one.

782
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,330
In fact, it was very scary.

783
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,030
It's been a while since I was threatened by her to tell my wife.

784
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,810
And she conspired with the taxi driver to kill me and sell my organs.

785
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,190
What does that mean?

786
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,430
The police officer knows this too.

787
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,010
The world is very difficult.

788
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,273
You know...

789
00:57:16,273 --> 00:57:19,608
I try to step on others, but if I want to protect myself and my family,

790
00:57:19,608 --> 00:57:21,610
I have to retreat with the same force!

791
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:21,810
Yes.

792
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:22,210
Yes!

793
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,510
Say the same thing at the police station!

794
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,210
What is that?

795
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:33,910
What?

796
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,670
Why is it so difficult today?

797
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,850
I almost died trying to get a taxi again.

798
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,950
What's happening today?

799
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,210
Are you lying again?

800
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,190
I contacted Assistant Manager Park.

801
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,170
I heard there was no company dinner today.

802
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,610
No, the manager called us separately and we went alone.

803
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,930
Does it have to be a company dinner together to be considered a company dinner?

804
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,535
After feeding the team members,

805
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:26,010
I heard that an acquaintance of the manager had opened a bar, so it was just the two of us.

806
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:30,470
You are lying too much today.

807
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,650
Bo.Ram said she fought with her friend at school.

808
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:34,510
What?

809
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,110
She was so upset that she was just waiting for her father.

810
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,110
Will this really happen?

811
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,190
Dad, why don't you come?

812
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,970
Good. Ram...

813
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,230
Dad had a hard time getting off work today.

814
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:50,890
You've already slept?

815
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,990
I just woke up.

816
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,290
But why did you fight today?

817
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:58,970
We don't fight.

818
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,390
It's because the teacher misinterpreted it.

819
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,250
Good. Ram is not cheating his father, right?

820
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,390
You can tell daddy everything.

821
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,990
She hit me first.

822
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,330
That's why we fight.

823
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,910
Dad said...

824
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,330
That you can't seem rude.

825
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,110
What?

826
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,390
You can't live being beaten!

827
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,090
But I hit more.

828
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,510
good job.

829
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,270
Good. Ram!

830
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,470

01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:29,214
815 gold, she adds hearts to her orders.

930
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,691
So cute.

931
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,180
hello.

932
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,920
Thanks.

933
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,320
I'm going to eat with my friends.

934
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,620
Be careful not to fall.

935
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,100
Bon appétit girl.

936
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,120
goodbye.

937
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,320
Hang on.

938
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,760
You're going through a difficult time, right?

939
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,820
Delivery work is difficult.

940
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,160
Have a glass of water.

941
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,020
Do you have chocolate milk?

942
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,240
Okay, I'll drink.

943
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,700
You can drink.

944
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,280
It's cold, right?

945
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:14,780
Yes.

946
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,640
Water is good for your health.

947
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:28,960
I'll take it all at once.

948
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,340
All good.

949
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,060
All good...

950
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,240
Why is the water so salty?

951
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,060
I know I'm beautiful, but why did she give me water?

952
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,500
She could give me some chocolate milk.

953
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,100
But she only gave me pure water...

954
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,140
It's really annoying.

955
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,480
Hey Dong In!

956
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,480
What are you doing, dude?

957
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,060
Come out and spit!

958
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
There was almost no time.

959
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,922
Right...

960
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:52,900
House 12.

961
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,340
No. 816.

962
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,100
How much delivery do you order?

963
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:02,650
is here?

964
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:03,550
no.

965
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:08,034
Is here.

966
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,150
You scared me!

967
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,450
Enjoy.

968
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,070
Are you hungry?

969
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,290
no.

970
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,950
It's a great meal.

971
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:24,370
I got a call.

972
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,770
hello?

973
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,110
You didn't receive a call.

974
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,590
You are very perceptive.

975
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:30,770
But why are you so affectionate?

976
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,000
So take this.

977
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,380
Just a tip.

978
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,840
Hey.

979
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,326
Yes?

980
01:08:56,581 --> 01:08:57,638
Look!

981
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:07,540
Isn't it amazing to see so many delivery people every day?

982
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:09,500
It's not surprising at all.

983
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,865
It's so amazing.

984
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,500
I can definitely make you come here.

985
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:19,789
Every day at 6:55 pm.

986
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,570
I will order every day, so accept delivery.

987
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,890
What a smell...

988
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,670
What a fishy smell.

989
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,260
No matter how urgent it is...

990
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,000
Why am I coming here?

991
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,540
Can I talk to you for a moment?

992
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:21,980
no.

993
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,340
Do you have a girlfriend?

994
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:23,760
no.

995
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,100
Do you often see women during the day?

996
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,460
Are there any women you like?

997
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,180
Hey.

998
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,380
Why are you curious about this now?

999
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,280
If you like it this way...

1000
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,400
Grab one of these and get in quickly.

1001
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,620
If you don't like it, I won't do it.

1002
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:59,580
If you have someone you like, I won't insist.

1003
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,400
Love means making sacrifices for each other.

1004
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,580
You don't have much to say.

1005
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,700
You and my ideal type is a very quiet person.

1006
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:15,820
Hey.

1007
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,560
I don't think you know much about me yet.

1008
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:18,720
I really talk a lot.

1009
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,000
There was one time I went to a cafe with my friends.

1010
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,580
I was alone talking for 4 hours...

1011
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,340
They asked me if I had moss on my tongue just because I couldn't stop talking.

1012
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,420
Are you think I'm quiet?

1013
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,020
I think it's okay to talk a lot.

1014
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,000
Would you like to come inside?

1015
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,960
Would you like to go out?

1016
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:36,781
Come!

1017
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,300
You really don't get tired of people.

1018
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,060
Hey.

1019
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,320
There's no need for that, so don't call me again, okay?

1020
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,270
It's so irritating...

1021
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:25,050
Chart success is determined by 300 days.

1022
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,720
Is Exity's success worth hundreds of billions of short-lived won?

1023
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,120
right.

1024
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,530
Damn it...

1025
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,180
What it was?

1026
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,040
Bro, bro!

1027
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,400
The woman you deliver every day you mentioned.

1028
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,160
It's house number 816, right?

1029
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,080
Right?

1030
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,500
Kihoon.

1031
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:47,820
Yes?

1032
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,460
Do you know what I just read?

1033
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,160
What is it?

1034
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,160
A startup's success is determined by 300 days.

1035
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:53,800
What?

1036
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,500
But know that you are interrupting one day of these important 300 days.

1037
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,440
What are you talking?

1038
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,800
I'm so crazy now.

1039
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,860
There is a call every 30 minutes from her.

1040
01:13:01,969 --> 01:13:03,838
When the delivery men arrive at her house,

1041
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,201
She wants it to be you and asks the other delivery guys not to accept it.

1042
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,620
Is she looking for you?

1043
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:09,560
Hey.

1044
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,220
I'm not going to her house again, so stop calling.

1045
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:12,800
What?

1046
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,240
You're saying something strange.

1047
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,260
Sir?

1048
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:21,990
Sir?

1049
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,810
Are you still sick?

1050
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,620
Sorry.

1051
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,240
All good...

1052
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,520
Has there been a strange rumor going around lately?

1053
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,340
Oh, the rumor that we're dating?

1054
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,260
No, dare that...

1055
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,220
Are you sure the delivery is going well?

1056
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:44,880
Yes, why?

1057
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:47,920
Delivery king.

1058
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:49,920
Yes, king of Delivery.

1059
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:50,600
I will go now.

1060
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,780
My God.

1061
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,260
Did you receive the delivery?

1062
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,173
You have completed another delivery.

1063
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:09,467
Who...

1064
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:13,880
hello?

1065
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,320
hello.

1066
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,940
This is the headquarters of Food Call.

1067
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,400
You are Dong In's number 1 from Naedong District, right?

1068
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:20,760
Yes, that's correct.

1069
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,980
Have you been to Rosiel for delivery recently?

1070
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,160
Well, I guess it wasn't just delivery to one or two places.

1071
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:27,880
why?

1072
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,700
The customer who placed the order filed a complaint about sexual harassment.

1073
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,000
" Dong In looked at me sinisterly. "

1074
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,660
Hey.

1075
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,060
No matter how you look at it, it looks insidious.

1076
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:40,440
Yes?

1077
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,960
What facial expressions should I pay attention to during delivery?

1078
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,599
So you didn't do it?

1079
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,112
I did not do it.

1080
01:14:47,223 --> 01:14:48,719
No matter how much I say...

1081
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,700
It's really an abuse of power to just trust the customer and do that.

1082
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,040
you understand?

1083
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,620
But because of regulations.

1084
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,300
Your call will be canceled until the complaint is resolved.

1085
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,660
That's not fair!

1086
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,530
The call was cancelled.

1087
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,820
Hey.

1088
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,040
Do you think it is right?

1089
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,320
That's right...

1090
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,120
Let's not do that.

1091
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:25,780
Are you my enemy?

1092
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,160
I said I wanted to see you every day, but you ignored me.

1093
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,060
Cancel the complaint first then.

1094
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,720
I will answer your call every day.

1095
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:33,680
OK?

1096
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:37,560
What?

1097
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,880
Did you slam the door while someone was talking?

1098
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,040
Throw it in the trash.

1099
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:57,850
Is it 10,000 won again?

1100
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,930
Could you give me more money?

1101
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,540
I don't know why she's doing this...

1102
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,600
Is it for exercise?

1103
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:14,660
Why does she do this?

1104
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,200
This is unbelievable!

1105
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:34,930
After 3 years with this shoe, I really had problems.

1106
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,470
I can't throw it away either.

1107
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:42,970
But what the hell is this?

1108
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,470
There is no answer? there is no answer!

1109
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,100
Then...

1110
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,820
I might just buy another one.

1111
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,590
Yes you too!

1112
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:08,110
The last time I went to take out the trash, something strange fell out of it.

1113
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,270
Don't add anything extraneous.

1114
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,390
I had to throw away my shoes!

1115
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,590
These are new shoes.

1116
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,120
I said don't put weird stuff in, so will I have to play weird stuff again?

1117
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:24,510
Did you put a rock in it?

1118
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,372
This is unbelievable...

1119
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:31,950
What's in it?

1120
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:31,829
What was that?

1121
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,140
Is there a delivery person in this neighborhood that you can't talk to?

1122
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,000
I told you this last time.

1123
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,180
This is a boy named Lee Wan.

1124
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:42,380
How long has he been gone?

1125
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,000
Has it been two weeks?

1126
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:45,680
2 weeks?

1127
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,780
There was raw meat in that woman's trash and it had a strange smell.

1128
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:51,560
Am I making a fool of myself?

1129
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,380
Couldn't it just be raw meat or something?

1130
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,160
Hey, is there anyone who just throws away something like that?

1131
01:19:02,235 --> 01:19:03,120
Hey, Kihoon...

1132
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,020
You said you were in a lab before you did this, right?

1133
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,970
What is your specialization?

1134
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,350
It's biotechnology.

1135
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:16,690
"Biotechnology?"

1136
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,930
Is there any way to distinguish between animal blood and human blood?

1137
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:25,380
Here I am again.

1138
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,180
Give me the trash.

1139
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,470
Did you think I would suffer taking out the trash?

1140
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,630
When determining blood type, you look at the agglutination reaction.

1141
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:50,550
If it is human blood, it will clump together in this human blood clot kit.

1142
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,970
I will bring, then you will bring a sample of the meat.

1143
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,620
I think she actually killed someone.

1144
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,660
Hey, Kihoon...

1145
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,460
You said there was a man who disappeared, right?

1146
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,880
Would you like to try looking for him?

1147
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,750
Hey, why aren't you answering me?

1148
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:39,150
If you throw it away, it will be sticky, so I cut the pulp little by little so that it doesn't grill.

1149
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,350
Oh, it's terrible!

1150
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:41,890
Where will she bury the bones?

1151
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:43,890
brother.

1152
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,970
Go get another piece of meat.

1153
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,410
Hey, how do I get there again?

1154
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:52,990
But this is easy!

1155
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,130
If you don't go, I will.

1156
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:57,530
I'll go ahead and report this.

1157
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,530
Okay, hold on a little, Kihoon.

1158
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,870
Did you really kill a person?

1159
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,450
Do I report it to the police?

1160
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,670
You are here again.

1161
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,523
(ACCEPT/DECLINE)

1162
01:21:24,553 --> 01:21:27,658
(ACCEPT/DECLINE) What do I do?

1163
01:21:29,662 --> 01:21:31,476
You have a new delivery!

1164
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,990
It's very big?

1165
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,800
I won't take it.

1166
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:13,864
(Please leave the order in your shoes. Do not enter the house.)

1167
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,110
Let's see what the surprise is today.

1168
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:29,440
Shouldn't I go?

1169
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,080
no.

1170
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:40,940
Hey!

1171
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,810
Is my voice too loud?

1172
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:49,470
Hey.

1173
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,050
Please open the door.

1174
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:51,990
Are you there?

1175
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,250
I have no time...

1176
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:59,080
The door is open?

1177
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,170
excuse me.

1178
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:22,950
excuse me...

1179
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:33,910
What is that smell?

1180
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:47,960
What is all this?

1181
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:53,050
Hey.

1182
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:00,820
Hey.

1183
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:19,580
What is all this?

1184
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:22,860
Is this all human blood?

1185
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,970
Is there someone here?

1186
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:17,790
What is all this?

1187
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,300
You like skinny girls, right?

1188
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:52,400
Who are you?

1189
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,100
who are you?

1190
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,357
You like thin women.

1191
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,100
You know me?

1192
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:08,020
Dong In, do I look like your ideal type now?

1193
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,178
Thank you for coming here.

1194
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,820
You bitch!

1195
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,020
What are you doing now?

1196
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,340
You are crazy?

1197
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,010
Don't fucking come.

1198
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,190
Dong In...

1199
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:44,660
Do not come here!

1200
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,400
Let's talk...

1201
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,180
To talk...

1202
01:27:04,714 --> 01:27:06,037
That hurts!

1203
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:08,858
Dong In...

1204
01:27:08,858 --> 01:27:11,192
Why are you doing this?

1205
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,980
My ideal type is a quiet man.

1206
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,700
Love means making sacrifices for each other.

1207
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:28,730
You understand me?

1208
01:27:31,673 --> 01:27:33,366
Please...

1209
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:34,990
You are driving me crazy...

1210
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,320
Do not come here!

1211
01:27:44,408 --> 01:27:46,452
More than just shit...

1212
01:27:46,452 --> 01:27:48,635
Stop, please!

1213
01:27:48,635 --> 01:27:52,380
Calm down, Dong In...

1214
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,260
You'll like this...

1215
01:27:56,043 --> 01:27:58,327
Calm...

1216
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:06,390
Where should I start to be beautiful?

1217
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:10,648
Where...

1218
01:28:10,648 --> 01:28:15,816
Should I start?

1219
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,250
Where is the apartment?

1220
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:43,030
Not here.

1221
01:28:45,967 --> 01:28:47,444
Unbelievable...

1222
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:51,310
Order dog treats?

1223
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:52,590
I think it's there.

1224
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:02,010
Is there anyone at home?

1225
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:10,650
It's open, so you can come in.

1226
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,150
What do you mean by enter?

1227
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,460
Can I leave it here?

1228
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,760
Please enter more.

1229
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,300
What...

1230
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:36,430
What a smell...

1231
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,260
What is that smell?

1232
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,170
It must be the dog.

1233
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,800
Can I leave it here?

1234
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,900
I have a severe allergy to dog hair.

1235
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:00,700
no.

1236
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,720
Enter more.

1237
01:30:12,632 --> 01:30:13,954
What...

1238
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:20,640
Hey...

1239
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,433
What is that?
