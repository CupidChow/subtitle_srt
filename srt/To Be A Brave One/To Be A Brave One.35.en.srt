00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,030
If it's serious, he might even get bronchitis.

176
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,400
My nose will bleed too.

177
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,230
And I'll cough a lot.

178
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,080
Today is Saturday.

179
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,110
I'll pick him up now.

180
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,150
I almost forgot.

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,790
Let me get him a coat.

182
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,400
No need.

183
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,880
Either way,

184
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,520
Yiyi has started to accept you.

185
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,030
And I need more time to know him better.

186
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,150
Let's work hard together.

187

Okay.

[Zhuoyue Shares Transfer Agreement]
When I woke up in the morning,

189
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,350
this agreement was lying in the living room.

190
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,150
My dad said he was tired.

191
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,840
He wants to rest

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,110
somewhere.

193
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,470

Thank you, Fei'er.

we won't let you down.

Thank you.

(Ouch! Ouch!)

Yiyi, look.

204
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,640
Does that cloud look like a bear?

205
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,760
Daddy used to play sword fights

206
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
with me too.

207
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,400
He would also play lego with me.

do you miss your daddy?

210
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,520
Moon, is it true

211
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,440
that Daddy will never come back?

212
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,230
No, it's not true.

213
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
Your daddy will come back.

214
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,640
But he has never been away from me for this long.

215
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,710
That's because when your daddy was working,

216
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,640
he ran into a monster.

217
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,880
He needs some time

218
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,280
to defeat the monster.

219
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,440
Once he has managed that,

he'll return to you.

Can we help him then?

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,840
Well,

223
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,230
everyone will have to defeat

224
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,150
their own monster alone.

225
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,000
Therefore, we can't help him.

Will I find my monster too?

227
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,550
Do you have a monster?

228
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,790
I do.

229
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,400
You'll find yours

230
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,150
after you grow up.

231
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,640
Can you see your monster then?

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,150
Close your eyes.

Can you hear it?

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,550
It might be around us.

235
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,440
It's just

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,000
invisible.

237
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,060
However, we can trace it.

Should we go find it?

He looked upset just now

so I proposed to play a game with him.

252

He then disappeared on me.

253

What kind of game were you playing?

254
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,460
You shouldn't have let him wander off from you.

You could have told me.

285

when you took him away like that?

I could revoke your visitation rights.

You can't do that, An Yu.

You have no right to separate us.

what should I do?

317

Next time when I take Yiyi out,

Yiyi.

348
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,980
Yiyi.

349
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,790
Mommy's here.

350
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,590
Where are you?

351
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,950
Yiyi.

352
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,030
(Yiyi.)

353
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,830
(Yiyi.)

354
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,710
Yiyi.

355
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,590
Yiyi.

356
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,070
Mommy's here for you.

357
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,860
Yiyi.

358
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,590
Mi Lu?

359
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,620
How did you get in here?

360
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,430
An Yu.

361
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,380
Did you hide Yiyi somewhere?

362
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,910
How did you get in here?

363
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,830
How did you sneak into my house?

364
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,500
You must have hidden Yiyi somewhere.

365
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,100
He must be inside. Right?

366
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,100
Let me see him.

367
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,790
How many drinks have you had?

368
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,030
Did you treat him kindly?

369
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,500
Are you drunk?

370
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,030
An Yu.

371
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,140
I have nothing left.

372
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,460
Can you please give Yiyi back to me?

373
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,980
What do you want?

374
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,670
I can give you everything.

375
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,500
Even my life.

376
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,030
Just give Yiyi back to me.

377
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,460
You're mentally unstable.

378
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,910
Please return home.

379
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,460
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

380
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,030
No.

381
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,590
If you don't give Yiyi back to me,

382
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,620
I won't leave.

383
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,950
If I call the police,

384
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,860
you will lose your right to visit Yiyi.

385
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,620
An Yu.

386
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
You can't do that.

387
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,140
I will see him now.

388
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,310
Give me back my child!

389
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,260
(Open up!)

390
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,310
(He's mine.)

391
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,260
(Yiyi.)

392
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,910
What's going on, Madam?

393
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,030
(Yiyi.)

394
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,950
(It's me.)

395
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,260
Shao Moli?

396
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,980
Mi Lu suddenly appeared in my house.

397
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,460
Can you come over right now?

398
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,380
Hurry up!

399
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,430
What's going on, Madam?

400
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,260
It's okay.

401
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,950
It's fine now, Yiyi.

402
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,430
Yiyi can stay over at my place.

403
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,950
I'll be in the same house with him.

404
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,860
You should come too.

405
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,460
Okay.

406
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,340
I hope Mi Lu won't go there.

407
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,500
It was so scary just now.

408
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,140
(Your child custody modification request)

409
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,710
(was rejected by the court.)

410
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
I won't let you visit him anymore.

411
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,380
An Yu.

412
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,980
I rushed everything

413
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,910
and I forgot the Little Red Riding Hood
that Yiyi takes with him to sleep.

414
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,910
I have to get it.

415
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,030
Otherwise, he won't be able to sleep.

416
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,740
Okay.

417
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,380
An Yu!

418
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,710
(From now on, they will be your parents.)

419
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,380
Let's go.

420
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,310
Let's go home.

421
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,340
Come. Let's go home.

422
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,670
Where are you going?

423
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,950
He'll be back.

424
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,430
His favorite crayon is here.

425
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,790
Perhaps he wants to say goodbye to someone.

(He sustained several injuries
from the accident.)

452
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,790
(First, it was the broken ribs.)

453
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,550
(Then, his limbs were fractured.)

454
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
As to why he's still unconscious,

455
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,830
it's most probably

456
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,590
because he suffered from a severe concussion

457
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,140
that triggered intracranial hemorrhage.

458
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,630
Further examination is needed

459
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,140
to pinpoint the exact reason.

460
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,630
When will he wake up?

461
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,590
It depends on how quickly his brain
can absorb the clot.

462
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,260
I don't have an answer.

Hello?

471
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,870
Yes, I'm with Lailai.

472
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,420
We...

473
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:44,990
Okay. Got it.

474
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,630
I'll be there now.

475
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,260
What happened?

476
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,070
Shao got into an accident.

477
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,780
What's going on?

478
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,950
Mister, can we change the destination?

479
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,180
Drive there as quickly as possible.

480
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,110
But be safe.

481
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,750
Okay.

482
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,900
Let me do it.

483
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,470
Where are we going?

484
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,830
Where is it?

485
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,260
An'an, what's the situation?

486
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,590
His operation just ended.

487
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,500
The doctor said he had multiple fractures.

488
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,070
He's still under anesthesia at the moment.

489
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,590
The thing

490
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,910
is that he also has intracranial hemorrhage.

491
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,430
We don't know when he'll wake up.

492
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,500
What about Mi Lu?

493
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,940
The police have taken her away.

494
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,110
I guess she'll be charged.

495
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,020
Don't worry.

496
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,630
It'll be fine, An'an.

497
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,430
We're here.

498
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,020
I'm fine.

499
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,670
An'an, you must be tired.

500
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,540
Go rest.

501
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,500
We'll look after him here.

502
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,430
It's okay.

503
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,350
I can't sleep well anyway,
knowing that he's like this.

504
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,980
I'm just worried

505
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,740
about Yiyi.

506
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,350
An Yu.

507
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,430
You know what?

508
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,150
Take Yiyi

509
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,350
to our place.

510
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,740
We'll look after him.

511
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,190
Yes.

512
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,740
Then, we'll keep Shao company for 24 hours

513
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,540
on different shifts.

514
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,190
Yes.

515
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,540
Make sure there's someone taking care of him.

516
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,980
I'll call Su and ask him to deliver

517
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,460
food or whatever

518
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,300
we need here.

519
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,980
Shao has always been a lucky man.

520
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,350
It'll be fine.

521
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,300
Maybe

522
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,780
once the anesthetics subside,

523
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,740
he'll wake up.

524
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,110
It'll be fine.

525
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,300
I'll check with the doctor.

526
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,630
It's okay, An'an.

527
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,500
We're here.

528
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,020
You have to take good care of yourself

529
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,430
before you can take good care of him.

530
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,740
Eat on time.
