00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,740
Yes, I've been here for three years.

345
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,740
Forget about Mr. Yang.

346
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,830
I've never seen anyone
from the Internal Audit Department.

347
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,590
There, look.

348
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
Let's get started.

349
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Mr. Yang.

350
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,710
Your name?

351
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,550
An Yu.

352
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,670
You were in charge of this contract.

353
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,460
The signature on it is yours,

354
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,500
correct?

355
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,220
Yes.

356
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,430
I did sign this deal.

357
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,220
Where is the security token
used for the contract?

358
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,140
It's in the safe at the Chuanhe branch.

359
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,380
From the day you signed the deal until now,

360
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,140
did anyone else

361
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,070
come into contact with the token?

362
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,790
No one.

363
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,220
The security token has always been kept by me.

364
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,590
It's locked inside the safe.

365
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,380
No one else has access.

366
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,260
Hand over the key to the safe.

367
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,030
My bag was taken away

368
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,500
the moment I arrived at the headquarters.

369
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,100
The key is in the bag.

370
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Go and get it.

371
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,190
Mr. Yang.

372
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,740
What is this about?

373
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,430
An Yu.

374
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,310
This is Miss Mi Lu's account you're in charge of,

375
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,860
correct?

376
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,790
Yes.

377
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,790
And this is your business account,
with the card number ending 246,

378
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,710
correct?

379
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,980
That's right.

380
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,860
It's my card.

381
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,070
Last Thursday,

382
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,310
a sum of five million was transferred

383
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,950
from Miss Mi Lu's account

384
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,910
into an online financial product.

385
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,550
The sum was returned early this morning.

386
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,620
At the same time,

387
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,860
an amount of more than 13,800 yuan

388
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,830
was remitted into

389
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,860
this account ending with 246.

390
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,670
Did I explain that correctly?

391
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,980
Are you aware of it?

392
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,430
That's incorrect.

393
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,310
And I'm not aware.

394
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,070
I didn't do it.

395
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,740
Excuse me, may I know

396
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,260
what it is that happened with An Yu?

397
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,140
It's none of your business.

398
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Just keep your mouth shut.

399
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,190
Then why are you searching her safe?

400
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,140
Don't touch me.

401
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,670
Can't you see they're searching the safe?

402
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,500
They're from the Internal Audit Department.

403
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,790
Internal Audit Department?

404
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,590
Take them all back for questioning.

405
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
Why are they taking us?

406
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,740
Enough chit-chatting.

407
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,790
Cooperate with the investigation.

408
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,380
Let's go.

409
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,550
What is going on?

410
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,830
Let's just go along.

411
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,950
But we...

412
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,430
Get in the car. Stop talking.

413
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,980
Hurry up.

414
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,190
Okay, okay.

415
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,070
It's going as planned.

416
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,030
I reckon she's going to confess soon.

417
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,500
[I'll be right there.]

418
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,550
Otherwise, be it Party B,

419
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,980
or any of Party B's blood-related relatives,

420
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,790
as well as companies or business entities

421
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,980
Party B has invested in,

422
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,140
may not directly, or indirectly,

423
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,100
-be it...
-Gentlemen.

424
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,430
Sir.

425
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,950
I'll say it one last time.

426
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,910
I did not touch any of Mi Lu's money.

427
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,340
And I did not profit from it.

428
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,030
An Yu.

429
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,380
Don't you know your current predicament?

430
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,790
There's no point denying it.

431
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,140
You said it yourself.

432
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,790
The security token was either on you
or inside the safe.

433
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,460
Apart from you, no one else had access.

434
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,430
But your business debit card

435
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,910
received a deposit the same time

436
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,740
the money was transferred.

437
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,140
The evidence is clear.

438
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,790
Why are you still trying to deny it?

439
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,860
It's because I didn't do it.

440
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm not denying it.

441
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,980
I'm explaining the truth.

442
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,070
So is there anything else

443
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,310
you have to add regarding this matter?

444
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,910
What I wish to say is

445
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,500
that aside from me,

446
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,140
Mi Lu also has

447
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,380
a security token.

448
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,950
An Yu.

449
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,860
So are you saying

450
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,980
that Miss Mi Lu stole what was entrusted to you

451
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,790
to sabotage you?

452
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,100
You're a newly hired low-rank employee.

453
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,380
She entrusted you with so much money.

454
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,980
You should be grateful.

455
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,590
First, you let your greed take over,

456
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,500
and then you bit the hand that feeds you.

457
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,950
Knowing I have a staff like you makes me...

458
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,740
-Makes me feel ashamed!
-Mr. Fu.

459
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,710
Calm down.

460
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,220
Okay.

461
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm calm.

462
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm calm.

463
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,220
Let me ask you.

464
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,310
You claim Miss Mi is framing you.

465
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,620
Why?

466
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,070
Does she have any bad blood with you?

467
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,070
Why would she risk

468
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,980
losing so much money just to frame you?

469
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,430
On the night when money was transferred
out from Miss Mi's account,

470
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,430
at approximately 7:55 PM on Thursday,

471
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,710
where were you?

472
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,380
Thursday night?

473
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Before 8 PM...

474
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,910
I... I don't remember.

475
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,030
Let me help you recall then.

476
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,190
From the security footage, we can see

477
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,910
that after 7:38 PM that night,

478
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,380
you were the only one left.

479
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,140
Until 7:40 PM...

480
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,950
Fast forward.

481
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,190
Yes, right here.

482
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,950
You left through the main door.

483
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,620
The CCTV inside was turned off
three minutes later.

484
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,790
Twelve minutes later,
the account was tampered with.

485
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,910
Do you remember now?

486
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,740
I remember.

487
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,830
That night,

488
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,260
I saw an old lady outside the door.

489
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,100
She couldn't remember her way home.

490

[Zhuoyue Finance]

491
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,100
Hi, madam.

492
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,260
Do you need help with anything?

493
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,460
I can't find the way home.

494
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,830
Don't panic.

495
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,620
-No need to panic.
-Thank you, miss.

496
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,710
(So I walked with her.)

497
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,910
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

498

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,500
-Yes.
-Okay.

502
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,550
Let us wait a bit.

503

Here, board the bus.

506
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,740
She's getting off at Dingbai Village.

507

She took...

508
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,460
I think it was bus 109.

509
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,030
I helped her board the bus.

How old?

512
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,220
What's her name?

513
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,260
Is she our client?

514
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,500
She isn't our client.

515
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,430
I don't know what her name is.

516
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,550
It was my first time seeing her.

517
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,740
An Yu.

518
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,500
Are you trying to insult Mr. Yang's intelligence?

519
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,460
You conjured a nameless person out of thin air

520
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,100
and spun a story like that so you could get a pass?

521
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,430
Were there any security cameras on the street

522
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,500
or passersby who could back up what you said?

523
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,620
I didn't see anyone else that night.

524
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,070
Because that area is very remote.

525
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,710
I'm not sure if there are any security cameras.

526
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,430
Enough.

527
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,190
An Yu.

528
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,830
I think

529
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,830
you need a bit more time to think this through.

530
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,950
We'll be back in 30 minutes.

531
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,550
(I missed Yiyi.)

532
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,100
-(I wanted to see...)
-(An Yu.)

533
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,950
If this happens again,

534
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,710
I won't let you off easily.

535
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,860
Let's go.

536
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,220
You'd like to use
the five million sitting in your account

537
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,260
for rational allocation.

538
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,380
But you didn't state any requirements

539
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,340
in the risk and earnings section.

540
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,030
I'm going to say this one last time.

541
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,950
I will only sign
a sole agency contract with An Yu.

542
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,140
I'm letting her handle

543
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,500
my five million worth of funds.

544
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,670
Mi Lu.

545
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,910
You're despicable.

546
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,310
That's what happened.

547
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,030
When I noticed the problem,

548
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,740
I immediately called your company.

549
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,190
Is there anything else you wish to ask?

550
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,220
Miss Mi.

551
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,260
The security token you've entrusted to An Yu,

552
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,710
aside from her,

553
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,220
is it true that you have another one?

554
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,070
That's right.

555
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,340
I do have another security token.

556
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,860
What is it, Mr. Yang?

557
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,340
Are you suspecting me?

558
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Just a routine question.

559
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,260
The token is kept at home.

560
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,100
Aside from the day the incident happened,
no one else had touched it.

561
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,260
If you don't believe me,

562
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,310
you can ask my family.

563
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,380
They can be my witness.

564
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,790
Of course,

565
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,910
my house is equipped with CCTVs too.

566
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,500
You're free to go through the footage.

567
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,590
Miss Mi.

568
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,950
Please don't get us wrong.

569
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,430
There's no way we'd suspect you.

570
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,070
You are Zhuoyue's most valuable client.

571
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,030
Even though such a big incident happened,

572
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,860
you

573
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,340
chose to trust our internal handling mechanism

574
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,190
and did not go to outsiders for help.

575
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,790
On behalf of Zhuoyue Group,

576
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,860
I express our utmost gratitude.

577
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,950
Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Mi.

578
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,550
And also for your trust in Zhuoyue Group.

579
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,340
Trust is mutual.

580
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,590
I do not wish to make a big deal out of it.

581
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,910
But more importantly,

582
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,950
I wish to have a fair and just outcome.

583
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,310
Rest assured, Miss Mi.

584
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,260
That is our duty.

585
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,030
We will make sure you receive
a satisfactory answer.

586
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,460
Right now,

587
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,100
judging from An Yu's behavior,

588
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,590
it's unlikely that she'd yield.

589
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,710
What if she refuses to give in

590
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,910
and pushes for an investigation?

591
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
After all, there is no proof

592
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,030
that she did it.

593
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,550
There is also no proof

594
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,910
to say that she didn't.

595
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,380
So what are you suggesting?

596
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,980
As long as she's being suspected,

597
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,310
it is a blemish.

598
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,430
For Zhuoyue,

599
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,460
such a person would be fired
sooner or later.

600
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,260
With those unsavory records,

601
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,950
she wouldn't be welcomed by other companies.

602
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,140
That's what I'm after.

603
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,790
Take care, Miss Mi.

604
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,380
Bye.

605
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,950
We're arriving at the headquarters soon.

606
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,670
Please hand over your phones.

607
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,740
What for?

608
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,460
Yeah.

609
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,950
Why do we have to hand over our phones?

610
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,670
Don't worry.

611
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Once we've finished questioning you,

612
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,460
we'll return your phones

613
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,710
in their original state.

614
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,830
Just hand it over.

615
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,460
Hand it to him.

616
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,620
Are you trying to see what's on my phone?

617
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,860
No, we won't.

618
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,460
Ms. Xu.

619
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,860
Mobile phones nowadays

620
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,140
are protected by passwords.

621
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,790
It will be fine.

622
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,380
Yes.

623
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,790
-There are passwords.
-Yes.

624
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,860
That troublemaker An Yu.

625
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,710
She's just wasting our time.

626
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,030
Xu Jingya, stop kicking someone
when they're down.

627
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,550
We don't know what really happened with An'an.

628
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,030
Since joining the company,

629
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,070
this is only the second time I've seen
people from the Internal Audit Department.

630
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,220
I don't think An Yu

631
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,190
will escape unscathed this time.

632
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,470
Do you think An'an

633
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,110
is going to lose her job?

634
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,870
An Yu.

635
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,630
Have you thought it through?

636
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,470
If you refuse to be frank with us,

637
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,900
we will have no other option.

638
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,180
We can't help you.

639
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,140
I want to make a police report.

640
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,140
I want to make a police report.

641
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,350
An Yu.

642
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,540
Calling the police isn't a small matter.

643
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,750
An Yu.

644
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,230
Look, you already have a criminal record.

645
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,710
If you call the police,

646
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,470
who do you think they'll choose to believe?

647
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,180
The police believe in evidence.

648
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,990
I want you to call the police right now.

649
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,630
Before we get to the truth of the matter,

650
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,070
you going to the police

651
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,420
will mean you're liable for any negative impact

652
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,180
thrust upon Zhuoyue.

653
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,140
Think carefully,

654
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,140
then tell us your decision.

655
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,940
Hello?

656
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,940
Miss Mi.

657
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,150
We've got trouble.

658
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
An Yu is calling the police.

659
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,940
Doesn't she know the gravity

660
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,190
of going to the police?

661
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,540
Of course she does.

662
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,110
But she's very persistent right now.

663
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,740
Okay.

664
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,740
We'll see who will have the last laugh.

665
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,430
But...

666
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,150
Come on.

667
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,910
Play with him.

668
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,275
[Mr. Fu]

669
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,670
Hello?

670
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,070
Mr. Zhou.

671
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,780
Here's the thing.

672
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,910
After much pondering, I think I should tell you.

673
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,430
What is it?

674
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,830
It's like this.

675
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,260
Where were you?

676
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,980
I was working.

677
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,740
What work?

678
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,980
Something to do at the company.

679
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,260
What do you want to eat tonight?

680
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,190
I'll buy it later.

681
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,190
Have you ever thought about
what will happen to you

682
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,020
