[Episode 25]

18
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,510
Hello.

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm Shao Moli.

20
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,400
Hello.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
It's me.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,760
I know you took a huge risk in coming here.

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,080
However, please don't worry.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,830
I've already switched off my phone.

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,830
I won't record our conversation.

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,830
And I won't try to find out who you are.

27
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,360
What I need now

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,830
is for you to tell me everything you know.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,910
I graduated from university four years ago.

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,630
After that, I joined Kaiyuan Trading.

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,830
It was a huge enterprise.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,270
There were more than 100 employees
in the company.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,830
I was still a newbie

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,960
when I first joined them.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,910
I was at the bottom of the food chain.

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,000
Our boss

37
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,160
was Wang Kai.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,030
However,

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
we only saw him once

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
during the new staff induction.

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,190
We then went for the staff training.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,390
After that,

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,720
I did my internship in the Finance Department.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
One day,

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,110
I worked overtime until it was almost midnight.

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
I went home directly after that.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
When I reached home,

48
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,110
I realized that I left my phone in the office.

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,440
After that, I went back to retrieve it.

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,830
I overheard a conversation

51
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,360
between our boss and a stranger.

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,750
How confident are you in this?

53
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,750
How could you be sure

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,000
that An Wenbin would take the risk?

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,110
Did you think his company
went out of business

56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,440
by coincidence?

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,630
Since I could make his company go out of business,

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,600
of course I could make him take the last resort.

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,670
Don't worry.

60
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,750
Back then, I had no idea
what they were talking about.

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,160
After that, my family
told me to get a Master's degree.

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
Therefore, I resigned.

63
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,360
And after that,

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,600
I read about An Wenbin's contract fraud case

65
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,670
on the news.

66
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,720
It reminded me

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,030
of their conversation.

68
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,270
If so, do you still remember

69
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,080
the stranger you saw back then?

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,830
No, I don't.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,190
I hadn't seen his face.

72
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,360
I have something to tell you.

73
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Come on, have a seat.

74
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,750
What's the matter?

75
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,080
I've made up my mind.

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,670
From this weekend onward,

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
I will bring Yiyi to visit An Yu.

78
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,750
You must be out of your mind!

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,390
Calm down.

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,440
Let me finish my words.

81
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,630
Back then, when my father, Lin Zhanhong,

82
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,190
and An Wenbin first established Zhuoyue,

83
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,600
they split the shares into three portions.

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,750
Each of them possessed one portion.

85
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,230
I've obtained my father's portion.

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
That means

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,390
An Yu has obtained her father's portion too.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,600
However, if I could get my hands on her portion,

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,040
I'd have the chance to become
the largest shareholder of Zhuoyue.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
By then,

91
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,230
it would be a piece of cake for me

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,480
to topple Lin Zhanhong.

93
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,440
So, are you going to use Yiyi

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,830
so that you can dupe An Yu and get her portion?

95
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,200
I've thought about it for a long time.

96
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,670
It's quite difficult for me
to topple Lin Zhanhong

97
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,920
with my shares alone.

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,110
However, I'll have

99
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,760
a much greater chance of winning

100
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,830
if I get my hands on An Yu's shares too.

101
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,790
So, you're bringing Yiyi

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,040
to visit An Yu because of that reason alone?

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,600
Not only that,
but you'll also visit her every week?

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,320
Now, I have no choice
but to let her see Yiyi more often.

105
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
That way, I might stand a chance to persuade her

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,040
to sell her shares to me.

107
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
You do know

108
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,880
how important this matter is to me, right?

109
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,110
You know that this is my sole purpose

110
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,920
of living, right?

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,040
No.

112
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,320
I won't agree to it.

113
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,480
What if you fail?

114
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,110
I couldn't care less about that!

115
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,550
There's no turning back now!

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,270
I've already suspended

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,230
all projects below the A+ grade for Yimi Capital.

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,350
I've also cut down the manpower

119
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,440
of all important departments.

120
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,320
That's my final preparation.

121
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,350
It's getting chilly. Let's head inside.

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
(I witnessed my father jumping off the building.)

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,550
(My mother fell unconscious
due to excessive grief.)

124
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,720
Since then,

125
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,720
my life became different.

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,510
My mother didn't recover from her sickness

127
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
ever since my father passed away.

128
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,480
I know An Wenbin was the culprit
behind everything.

129
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,270
My mother entrusted me to your family

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
at her very last moments.

131
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,230
You guys were nice to me.

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
I wouldn't even have a home

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,830
if you guys didn't take me in.

134
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,350
Even so, I still reminded myself

135
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,670
that I must study hard,

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,920
and I must get into Xingchen Financial.

137
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,830
I must take back everything
that belongs to my father

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
from An Wenbin.

139
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,200
Was that why you took the exam
three times in a row

140
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,830
and insist on joining the Faculty of Finance
at the University of Finance and Economics?

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
Was this the reason?

142
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,440
Yes.

143
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
I can only get closer

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,830
to An Wenbin by doing so.

145
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,760
Is this all there is to your life?

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,070
You wouldn't ask me this question

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
if you witnessed your father
committing suicide

148
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,880
and if your mother told you the same thing.

149
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,160
Fine.

150
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,440
An Wenbin

151
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,200
is out of your league.

152
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,830
How do you plan to approach him?

153
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
I got to know his daughter, An Yu.

154
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
I think I can approach An Wenbin

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
by getting closer to An Yu.

156
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
What about me?

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,350
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
A person like me

159
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,070
has no right to be together with you.

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,160
Have you heard?

161
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,790
Yimi Capital is up to something lately.

162
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,040
They even gave up on Soul App,

163
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,950
which they had spent so much effort on.

164
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,200
With your ability, I'm sure you could tell.

165
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
Zhou Yuan is gathering capital right now.

166
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,550
His target is Zhuoyue.

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,670
When two giants clash, one of them
is bound to get hurt.

00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,380
That's right.

337
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,110
Not the right place.

338
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,310
Who do you plan to find?

339
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,940
Our colleagues.

340
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,110
I want them to try it out

341
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,910
and see if they like it.

342
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,230
I'll show them my business proposal
while we're at it.

343
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,500
Baby, I don't think

344
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,580
this is appropriate.

345
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,870
What do you mean?

346
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,580
Listen to me.

347
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,590
You see,

348
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,790
you're making desserts

349
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,740
for our colleagues.

350
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,830
Don't you think people
will think that you're trying

351
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,070
to do it through the back door?

352
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,620
We should keep the goodies among our own kind.

353
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,910
That's not right.

354
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,220
Think about it.

355
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,190
What if they fail your dessert

356
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,790
after you told them to try it?

357
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,910
It's just

358
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,430
a hypothesis.

359
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,860
If so, doesn't it seem like

360
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,830
you're goofing around?

361
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,790
I think you have a point.

362
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,740
Yeah, right?

363
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,950
Let's forget about it.

364
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,140
No way.

365
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,190
I could tell them that it was made by my friend.

366
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,500
No way!

367
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,980
People will think that it's you

368
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,220
when you say it's a friend of yours.

369
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,980
It'd be fine if I said it was your friend.

370
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,070
My friend?

371
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,790
Yeah.

372
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,910
I'm so smart.

373
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,430
Hurry and pack it for me.

374
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,980
It won't taste as good
if we leave them out for a long time.

375
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,500
Let's go.

376
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,140
Hold this for me.

377
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,550
Hurry.

378
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,380
Hurry up.

379
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,070
Come on.

380
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,910
What kind of expression is that?

381
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,790
Speak up.

382
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,070
How do I put it?

383
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,430
It's not so terrible that I want to spit it out.

384
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,500
But I don't feel like swallowing it either.

385
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
How could that be?

386
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,790
I think it's pretty good.

387
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,340
At least it's sweet.

388
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,710
Of course, it's sweet.

389
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,430
You can enjoy it then.

390
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,070
Hurry up.

391
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,220
Try the strawberry-flavored one.

392
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,710
It's fine.

393
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,340
A friend of mine wishes
to open a trending dessert shop.

394
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,500
I want to hear your opinions on them.

395
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,740
Try the other flavors.

396
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,030
No, thanks.

397
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,070
They're different.

398
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,460
Here you go.

399
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,550
You can have more since you like them.

400
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,620
What are you guys doing?

401
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,500
Kai said that his friend

402
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,590
wanted to open a dessert shop.

403
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,500
He asked us to try the desserts
his friend had made.

404
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,590
However, the taste is...

405
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,620
An Yu, try it.

406
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,740
But I think it looks great.

407
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,380
-Yeah, right?
-It looks amazing.

408
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,950
Look at this.

409
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,260
Your friend has a delicate pair of hands.

410
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,670
Not only that,

411
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,980
but she's also cute.

412
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,860
I'm sure she's a cutie pie too

413
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,670
if she can make such a cute dessert.

414
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,950
The dessert is a representation of her.

415
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,860
You guys are celebrating it already?

416
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,980
What's the occasion?

417
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,550
It's good.

418
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,030
Where did you buy them?

419
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,620
His friend made them.

420
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,620
Due to the completion

421
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,310
of the Hongxing Telecom project,

422
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,430
the company has decided to reward your team

423
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,740
with cash bonuses.

424
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,740
Congratulations.

425
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,710
That's great.

426
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,980
How much will we get?

427
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,500
An Yu,

428
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,830
from now on, you're a manager.

429
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,070
You can lead your own project now.

430
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,620
Congratulations.

431
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,500
Congratulations!

432
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,430
Ms. An!

433
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,860
Thank you, everyone.

434
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,460
It's all thanks to you guys.

435
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,590
Let's celebrate the occasion.

436
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah.

437
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,190
I would like to thank your friend

438
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,500
for preparing the cake for me in advance.

439
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,460
She made it on purpose.

440
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,460
An Yu,

441
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
come to my office.

442
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,980
I'll make a move first.

443
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,550
Go ahead.

444
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,500
An Yu,

445
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,190
Mr. Lin is planning to assign

446
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,380
the Smart Desk project to you.

447
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,100
Are you interested in the project?

448
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,260
I've heard about this project before.

449
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,740
I think it'll serve the public

450
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,980
and bring commercial value to the company.

451
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,950
I'm very interested in it.

452
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,950
These are the materials related to the project

453
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,740
and the proposal which I had edited thrice.

454
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,380
Next,

455
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,550
you get to decide what to do with them.

456
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,220
However, I'll insist on one thing.

457
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,500
I'll include a contact function

458
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,740
for the left-behind children

459
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,670
to keep in touch with their parents.

460
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,100
Their parents work outside all year long.

461
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,950
They desire company.

462
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,140
I wish

463
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
that we could provide a medium
for them to keep in touch

464
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,590
as we promote

465
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,860
the Smart Desk project,

466
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,260
even if it is just a basic call function.

467
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,430
This is a great idea.

468
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,710
I agree.

469
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,670
Alright,

470
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,590
you can review the materials for now.

471
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,460
Let's keep in touch.

472
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,340
Alright.

473
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,550
If so, I'll modify it
according to your suggestions.

474
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,590
Alright.

475
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,190
An Yu, come here.

476
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,590
What's wrong, Su?

477
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,030
An Yu.

478
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,620
Su,

479
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,980
why did you bring me here?

480
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,460
What did Ms. Fang tell you

481
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,550
when she told you to see her?

482
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,860
Nothing.

483
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,910
She just told me about the Smart Desk project.

484
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,190
So,

485
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,460
how was she doing?

486
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
She was doing fine, I guess.

487
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,950
How do I look?

488
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,590
You look fine, I guess.

489
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,070
Forget it.

490
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,030
What's the matter?

491
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,860
I wish to tell her the truth.

492
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,550
I'm going to tell her
that I'm Vitality Guy on Soul App.

493
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,910
If not,

494
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,190
it feels like I'm deceiving her.

495
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,500
I know who she is,

496
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,100
but she doesn't know who I am.

497
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,220
If so, you can go ahead.

498
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,340
But what if she ignores me

499
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,830
once I tell her the truth?

500
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,830
Wouldn't it be embarrassing?

501
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,500
If so, you can find a suitable opportunity
to tell her the truth.

502
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,590
But you do know her temper.

503
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,100
I'm afraid it'll become a mess

504
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,430
if I drag this out.

505
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,830
If so, you should tell her then.

506
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,590
