at home just now.

173
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,200
To me, all of that

174
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,080
feels like something from a past life.

175
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,590
Now, I'm like an outsider looking in.

176
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,840
You don't have to be concerned at all.

177
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,960
I know.

178
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,000
It's presumptuous of me to ask to meet you today.

179
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,670
But I'm out of options.

180
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,760
Just now at home,

181
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,350
I received his house mortgage notice

182
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,520
as well as all the contracts pertaining to Yimi.

183
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,200
He's lost all semblance of sanity.

184
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
At that moment, I felt

185
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,110
like he was standing alone
at the edge of the cliff.

186
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,710
If he acquired your shares too,

187
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,400
he could very fall into the abyss.

188
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,320
So please, An Yu.

189
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,230
Don't sell him your shares.

190
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,840
Think of it as saving him.

191
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,080
Don't worry.

192
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,320
I won't sell them to him.

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,230
Actually, before coming here,

194
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,910
I've already made a decision.

195
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,280
Give this equity transfer contract

196
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,640
back to him

197
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,590
and tell him

198
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,230
that it's all over.

199
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,670
If there's nothing else,

200
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,230
I'm leaving.

201
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,790
An Yu.

202
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,080
Thank you so much.

203
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,470
If you wish to see Yiyi,

204
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,590
you can visit him every week.

205
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,150
Thank you.

206
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,640
I hope you can talk some sense into him.

207
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,300
You're back.

208
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,780
Why do you have this?

209
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,820
An Yu won't sell her shares to you.

210
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,330
I've told her everything.

211
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,130
What on earth?

212
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,540
Why did you do that?

213
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,330
Because I want to protect this family.

214
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,450
With Yimi's current assets,

215
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,660
there's no way it can compete with Zhuoyue.

216
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,970
You put a mortgage on all the assets.

217
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,300
Not just Yimi, right?

218
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,610
You even mortgaged the house!

219
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,250
Once I've attained my goal

220
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,180
and acquired Zhuoyue,

221
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,850
I can get all those things back.

222
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,780
Don't you know

223
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,330
you just

224
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,540
ruined everything I've done so far?

225
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,370
Zhou Yuan.

226
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,020
It hasn't been easy for us to get here.

227
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,580
Please stop.

228
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,540
-I'm begging you.
-How can I stop?

229
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,820
It's not too late to stop.

230
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,610
If you won't stop now,

231
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,900
it will really be too late to go back.

232
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,210
There's no going back!

233
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,210
I've already come this far.

234
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,940
Do you think I can still back out?

235
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,450
What do you mean by you can't back out?

236
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,210
Tell me the truth.

237
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,330
Do you think An Wenbin did those things

238
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,130
of his own volition?

239
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,300
If not for me,

240
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,210
he wouldn't have done so.

241
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,180
So you've been lying to me all this while.

242
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,780
An Wenbin going to jail

243
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
and everything that happened after.

244
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,330
You set all of it up, didn't you?

245
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,660
He deserved what he got!

246
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,020
All this while,

247
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,180
I thought I was the one who knew you best.

248
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,210
Now you just seem like a stranger to me.

249
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,720
Don't show any mercy.

250
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,020
A debt must be paid. It's only right.

251
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,900
A debt must be paid. It's only right.

252
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,580
Who are you people?

253
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,610
We came to demand payment.

254
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,900
Mr. An.

255
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,490
The money he owes me

256
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,730
is more than all of you combined.

257
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,300
You guys stay out of it!

258
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,250
Scram!

259
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,060
You heard us. Scram!

260
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,780
You two, guard the entrance.

261
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,210
Hu.

262
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,300
You two guard the staircase.

263
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,940
Stop anyone

264
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,900
asking for payment.

265
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,020
Got it, Mr. An.

266
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,500
[A debt must be paid. It's only right.
Pay up, Xiao Feng!]

267
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,940
I met with Mi Lu.

268
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,700
I gave her back the contract.

269
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,820
You have to sell those shares to me.

270
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
You have to sign it.

271
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,130
I'm not selling you anything.

272
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,850
I know what Mi Lu said to you.

273
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,850
Don't listen to her.

274
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,700
With my capabilities,

275
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,820
I can buy all the shares, no problem.

276
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,420
You don't have to worry about me.

277
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,300
Actually,

278
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,970
I made the decision before Mi Lu came to me.

279
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,370
At first,

280
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,180
I did want to get revenge.

281
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,450
So I went along with your plan.

282
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,700
But later I realized.

283
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,730
Even if you lost everything,

284
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,250
what joy would that give me?

285
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,580
So I won't sell

286
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,180
the shares to you.

287
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,020
So, why wouldn't you continue playing along?

288
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,580
You should've continued
with the act a little longer.

289
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,180
That way, you would know
what I've been through over the years.

290
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,060
Do you think what you know is the whole truth?

291
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,370
You have no idea

292
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,940
why I'm doing all this.

293
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,780
So why?

294
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,580
When I was 13,

295
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,020
my dad died in an accident.

296
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,180
But it wasn't an accident.

297
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,370
He jumped to his death because of dunning.

298
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,330
On that day,

299
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,090
I saw my father fall to his death

300
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,420
with my own eyes.

301
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,060
And the person who pushed him to death

302
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,130
was your father, An Wenbin.

303
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,250
And Zhou Yuan isn't my real name.

304
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,300
My name is Xiao Yong.

305
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,940
I'm Xiao Feng's son.

306
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,330
So right from the start, our relationship,

307
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,780
even our first meeting,

308
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,180
was part of your plan.

309
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,130
Those things I did to your dad,

310
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,250
I never once regret it.

311
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,700
But that's in the past.

312
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,490
You're the exception.

313
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,330
I really feel bad.

314
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,730
How could you not feel regretful

315
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,490
for the things you did to my dad?

316
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,420
That's what he owed my dad.

317
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,780
Why would I regret it?

318
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,370
No way.

319
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,660
My dad wasn't that kind of person.

320
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,850
He wouldn't do such a thing.

321
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,370
I saw it with my own eyes.

322
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,490
How could it be wrong?

323
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,730
And Lin Zhanhong.

324
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,660
If he hadn't refused

325
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,020
to save my dad,

326
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,370
my dad wouldn't have died.

327
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,210
So I'm going through with this no matter what.

328
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,900
You must sell me the shares.

329
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,780
Zhou Yuan.

330
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,700
After everything that has happened,

331
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,700
you are now standing at the edge of the cliff.

332
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,940
For the sake of Yiyi

333
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,970
and Mi Lu,

334
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,610
won't you stop this insanity?

335
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,180
So,

336
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,210
you're set

337
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,420
on not selling me the shares,

338
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,940
right?

339
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm not selling them to you.

340
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,700
Okay.

341
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,020
I got it.

342
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Hello, Mr. He.

343
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,850
I've decided.

344
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,210
I'll sign the contract.

345
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,370
Come in.

346
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,130
Ms. Fang.

347
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,700
What is it?

348
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,580
Anything you need?

349
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,970
It's nothing.

350
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,540
You've been busy the whole day.

351
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,940
You probably haven't had dinner.

352
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,420
I happen to have some supper.

353
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,730
Would you like to eat?

354
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,780
No, thanks.

355
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,780
I'm in a rush.

356
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,420
It's late.

357
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,450
Are you still going to the hospital?

358
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,300
Does that concern you?

359
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,490
No.

360
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,940
I don't mean anything else, Ms. Fang.

361
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm just saying

362
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,850
that if you're tired,
you should go home and rest.

363
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,730
I can go on your behalf.

364
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,020
This is my personal matter.

365
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,300
It has nothing to do with you.

366
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,180
I know, I get it.

367
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,940
It has nothing to do with me.

368
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,450
I see how tired you are.

369
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,610
I think you should take more rest.

370
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,420
I can go to the hospital and look after Fangfang.

371
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I hear you.

372
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,210
Thanks for the offer.

373
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,900
But in the future,

374
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,660
please don't meddle in other people's business.

375
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,490
Yu.

376
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,210
What's up?

377
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,580
I'd like to ask you about

378
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,580
some things from the past.

379
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,850
Things from the past?

380
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,820
Regarding Mr. Xiao Feng's suicide

381
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,540
20 years ago.

382
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,330
How are you and my father

383
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,900
related

384
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,450
to the incident?

385
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,730
Zhou Yuan told you?

386
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,450
Yes.

387
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,820
He told me everything.

388
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,540
What about you?

389
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,130
Did you come clean with him too?

390
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,020
Regarding the shares,

391
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,580
I've decided to stop deceiving him.

392
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,250
Yu.

393
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,330
How could you be so foolish?

394
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,060
Don't you want to avenge your father?

395
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,450
What happened at the time is old history.

396
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,490
The people involved are gone.

397
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,090
Who can provide the truth?

398
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,970
But four years ago,

399
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,850
Zhou Yuan caused Xingchen Financial

400
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,490
to go bankrupt.

401
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,490
Because of him, you and your father
were sent to prison.

402
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,130
That's an undeniable fact.

403
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,090
Didn't we agree?

404
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,660
That we'd take back

405
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,180
what your father had lost?

406
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,700
To accomplish our plan,

407
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,700
and to give

408
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,700
the Smart Desk project

409
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,780
you value highly a push,

410
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
I've exchanged much of Zhuoyue's assets

411
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,970
with He Shuo.

412
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,780
We're already at this step.

413
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,610
How could you just give up like this?

414
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,660
Did you really do all that

415
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,130
just to help me?

416
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,330
Yu.

417
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,820
You know what?

418
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,900
Twenty years ago,

419
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,820
when this building was still unfinished,

420
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,020
your father, Mr. Xiao, and I

421
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,180
had stood at this spot too.

422
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,370
Back then, the three of us

423
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,490
didn't even have 10,000 in our pockets.

424
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,420
For that entire night, we shouted

425
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,730
how we wished to become
China's biggest financial corporation.

426
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,940
When you're older,

427
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,180
it's easy to get sentimental.

428
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,540
Every time I see you,

429
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,300
I am always

430
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,700
reminded of your father.

431
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,610
I remember those days
when we worked hard together.

432
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Back then, together with my buddies...

433
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,730
Then can you tell me

434
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,940
what really happened back then?

435
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:51,970
Hello?

436
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,780
Are you sure?

437
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,370
Okay.

438
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,540
Alright.

439
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,730
Got it.

440
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,700
An Yu.

441
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,090
The things that happened 20 years ago,

442
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,420
let's not worry about that.

443
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,900
Let's put it behind us.

444
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,820
I have to go.

445
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,700
Mr. Lin.

446
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,820
Madam.

447
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,490
You're here.

448
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,540
Is Fangfang all right?

449
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,730
He's fine.

450
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,130
I fell asleep last night

451
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,090
and couldn't come.

452
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,450
You must be tired,

453
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,210
handling everything yourself.

454
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,700
It's taking a toll on you.

455
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,490
Thankfully, you have help now.

456
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,130
It will lighten your load.

457
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,180
What do you mean?

458
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,330
Su.

459
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,610
He's been here since last night.

460
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,850
I think he hasn't left.

461
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,610
Go on.

462
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,540
Ms. Fang.

463
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,370
Didn't I tell you not to come?

464
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,420
Ms. Fang, please don't get me wrong.

465
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:25,970
I...

466
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,370
My neighbor upstairs got a new dog.

467
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,020
I think it's a husky.

468
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,420
It's always barking.

469
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,700
I couldn't sleep at all.

470
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,370
I just paid the rent.

471
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,130
It will be my loss if I moved out.

472
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,450
I'm timid.

473
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,940
I don't feel comfortable troubling others.

474
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,730
So I thought I could sleep here.

475
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,580
It's quiet

476
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,490
and without disruption.

477
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,730
At the same time,

478
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,250
I could accompany Chen Fang.

479
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,300
Ms. Fang.

480
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,420
Think of it as helping me out.

481
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,180
Next time, you take Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.

482
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,370
I'll take Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

483
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,660
I'll be able to sleep three nights a week.

484
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,210
You can have more rest too.

485
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
It's decided then.

486
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,060
I'll go get breakfast.

487
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,650
Ms. Fang.

488
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,700
These are the project reports you asked for.

489
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,490
Are these all?

490
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,060
What about those that weren't voted in?

491
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,620
The fire-fighting drones,

492
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,700
Pony Online Education,

493
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,010
and the peptide biopharmaceuticals.

494
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,650
You want those too?

495
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,370
Of course.

496
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,410
Those are still in the preliminary assessment

497
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,620
and are held at the Risk Management Team.

498
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:19,980
Yes.

499
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,770
Go get them

500
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,010
and add them to the report.

501
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,340
Particularly on the expected revenue segment.

502
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,770
Alright.

503
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,170
Okay.

504
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,410
Look at this part.

505
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,290
Where is An Yu?

506
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,650
-An Yu...
-I'm here.

507
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,530
Okay, I'll get to it.

508
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,620
I got the reports from the Risk Management Team.

509
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,530
The fire-fighting drones project

510
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,580
has signed a pre-sale contract
with the government.

511
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,060
So its valuation

512
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,250
needs some adjustment.

513
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,700
Noted.

514
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,410
The equity relationship between Pony Online

515
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,100
and its mother company, Stallion Education,
needs more clarification.

516
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,620
Okay.

517
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:47,379
Next, the targeted experiments

518
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,460
and clinical trials

519
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,980
by the peptide bio-pharmaceuticals
need to be verified.

520
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,250
Also, they made available

521
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,130
16.7 points of their shares.

522
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,130
This needs to be confirmed

523
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,130
with the intention of the team of scientists.

524
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,490
Mr. Wang's company

525
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,170
also sent us the latest report.

526
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,170
I will follow up with it.

527
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,130
Alright, carry on.

528
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,450
Ding said you went out.

529
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,411
Where have you been?

530
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,290
I went to sign a contract with He Shuo.

531
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,660
Why did you sign a contract with him?

532
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,930
Lin Zhanhong is not an easy opponent.

533
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,010
Have you thought that maybe this is all a ruse?

534
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,660
I'd know if it was a ruse.

535
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,530
He Shuo is about to leave Yuqing.

536
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,690
I'd have missed the chance

537
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,730
if I didn't sign with him now.

538
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,970
Did you think I'd be stumped

539
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:46,930
because An Yu wouldn't sell me her shares?

540
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,060
I got in touch with Zhuoyue's other shareholders.

541
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,820
If they agree to sell their shares to me,

542
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,180
I can still achieve my goal.

543
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,210
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

544
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,140
Okay.

545
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,140
Okay.

546
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,100
I'll be right there.

547
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,820
You went to Yuan Wei?

548
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,770
You're taking an usury?

549
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,250
Tell me, are you?

550
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,420
Everyone already knows

551
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,660
that I'm using Yimi as leverage.

552
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,820
If I don't do this,

553
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,060
I won't have the money
to acquire Zhuoyue's shares.

554
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,930
So I have to do this.

555
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,140
Zhou Yuan!

556
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,420
Get out of the car.

557
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,660
Come out!

558
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,100
If you must be so reckless,

559
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,490
our family will be wrecked.

560
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Yiyi is waiting for you at home.

561
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,580
Come out right now!

562
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,770
Zhou Yuan!

563
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,140
We managed to get through

564
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,660
all the things life threw at us before, no?

565
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,620
Get out of the car.

566
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,380
Come out!

567
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,420
We can talk this through...

568
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,660
I'm sorry.
