18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,440
Mr. Shao Moli.

19
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,830
You made a name for yourself overseas,

20
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,190
but this time, you returned to take up
a project from Wei'er Hotel.

21
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,310
It is a resounding success so far.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,080
What is your next plan?

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,040
Will you continue to stay here?

24
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,230
Even though I grew up overseas,

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,830
I consider myself from Yuqing.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
This city

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,630
contains many precious memories
from my childhood.

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,670
And when I came back,

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,670
I realized Yuqing had undergone major changes.

30
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,960
It's now cozier, more mesmerizing.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,320
It makes me fall in love further with the city

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
and the people who live there.

33
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,270
I plan to stay,

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,190
but there's one challenge in front of me.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
I still can't handle chilies very well.

36
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,720
How humorous of you.

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,110
The acquisition of Wei'er Hotel

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,470
was flawlessly executed.

39
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,630
I heard this project was an urgent one,

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,190
and you even encountered some difficulties.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,470
Can you tell us more?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
When I took over this project,

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,110
it was,

44
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,390
like you said, very tough.

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,960
And we only had two months

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,830
to complete everything.

47
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,880
Fortunately,

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,470
I have a very talented team

49
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,160
with good teamwork.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,550
We had several emergencies,

51
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,720
but we powered through them.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,390
In this joint effort,

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,000
An Yu was the team leader.

54
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,830
She is competent, gifted,

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,240
and steadfast.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
She was the key player

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
who turned the tide

58
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,960
when we were stuck in a pinch.

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,720
Miss An.

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,880
Can you tell us the role you played

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,670
in this acquisition, as well as your feelings?

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,190
To good business.

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,240
Mr. Shao here exaggerated my performance.

64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm also a rookie in this field.

65
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,110
It was Mr. Shao

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
who helped me immensely.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,270
Both of us believe

68

Yes.

It got my attention right away.

I think it goes very well with your skin tone

and you can pair it with anything.

I know you usually wear luxury brands,

so you might not like it.

No.

But when I was younger,

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
I always watched my father's interviews.

I picked up the skills like that.

my advantage

was that I packed a strong punch.

But that

156

I'll let you in on a secret.

175
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,390
Su just told me

176
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
that we would still work together

177
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,040
but in a different department.

178
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,320
I wonder if it's good or bad.

179
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,070
It's good, of course.

180
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,440
If I'm with you,

181
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,950
I can fight 100 Xu Jingyas.

182
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,760
But I'm so nervous.

183
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,070
I wonder which department we will get.

184
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
An'an, which department do you want?

185
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,320
If it's up to me,

186
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,160
of course, I'll choose

187
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,040
the Investment Department.

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,070
So will I.

189
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,830
Unfortunately, Mr. Wolf
and Zhuoyue's partnership has ended.

190
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,200
If he could be the managing director of Zhuoyue,

191
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,950
I would feel more reassured.

192
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,480
We have to rely on ourselves now.

193
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
No.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,550
You're famous now.

195
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,600
I'll rely on you.

196

Keep a low profile.

197
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,440
Okay.

He's just a kid who returned from overseas.

201

What's there to interview?

202
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,320
He is quite humble

203

Everything is going well for An Yu now.

a sizable income,

I'm sure she came back to fight
for Yiyi's custody.

Don't worry, Lulu.

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Why did they

348
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,910
tie-dye it?

349
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,110
Shao.

350
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,960
Don't worry.

351
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,590
I'll ask Lailai to buy you another one.

352
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,350
It's just 30 yuan anyway.

353
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,520
Shao.

354
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,880
Did you see Lailai's posts on WeChat?

355
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,520
Weren't they offered full-time positions?

356
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,550
Shouldn't they work on a new project then?

357
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,030
Why are they laboring?

358
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,820
Kai.

359
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,140
When we took over Wei'er Hotel's project,

360
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,790
didn't you research Zhuoyue?

361
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,580
How many branches do they have?

362
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,430
If I'm not mistaken,

363
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,310
37.

364
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,990
How many in Chuanhe?

365
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,550
Time to get off work.

366
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,790
Oh.

367
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,790
You scared me.

368
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,790
What the heck?

369
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,670
This first day is exhausting.

370
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,190
Some didn't do anything
but they started complaining

371
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,430
that it was tiring.

372
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,710
Jin Lailai.

373
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,100
Mind your manner.

374
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,500
Respect your branch manager.

375
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,070
Unbelievable.

376
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,220
The one who did well was exiled,

377
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,950
but the one who didn't do anything
got a promotion.

378
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,500
Bring your complaints

379
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,310
to the headquarter if you can.

380
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,860
We'll see

381
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,140
if they'll take you back.

382
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,790
Enough.

383
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,380
Today is a good day.

384
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,830
Don't get riled up.

385
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,460
Let's go.

386
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,310
Work is over.

387
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,860
The cab is here.

388
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,860
I'll leave now.

389
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,260
Bye.

390
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,030
All right.

391
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,710
You two should leave too.

392
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,380
Go back early.

393
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,460
All right.

394
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,380
We'll leave then.

395
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,260
Go.

396
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,790
You went to Chuanhe Branch with your team?

397
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
That's not what you would do at all.

398
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,740
Your team will be sent to a branch.

399
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
You will go with them.

400
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,310
And you will go

401
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,430
as the branch manager.

402
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,790
Going to Chuanhe

403
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,790
is to set up the perfect trap

404
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,790
for the future.

405
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,550
I see.

406
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,670
Why do you have to hide anything from me?

407
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,380
When did you become this ambitious?

408
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,310
Is this about An Yu?

409
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,550
Why?

410
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,380
You feel sorry for her now?

411
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,910
Nonsense.

412
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,070
I just feel like you're setting up
a trap for someone else.

413
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,910
Mr. Fu assigned your group to Chuanhe.

414
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,460
He and you...

415
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,100
What about us?

416
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,620
I was assigned to Chuanhe,

417
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,030
but I'm the branch manager.

418
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,340
An Yu has to work under me.

419
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,030
Are you jealous?

420
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,340
Jiang Haoran.

421
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,910
You are jealous.

422
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,820
[Zhuoyue Finance, Chuanhe Branch]

423
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,100
What are you doing?

424
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,740
There's no client,

425
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,500
so we were trying to promote our branch.

426
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,340
Here, please.

427
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,310
Feel free to contact me
for any financial consultations.

428
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,430
We're Zhuoyue Finance.

429
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,380
So this is the client you speak of?

430
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,030
She's just here to use our toilet.

431
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,380
So far,

432
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,980
people either walk in to use the toilet

433
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,710
or the photocopy machine.

434
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,500
What now?

435
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,310
Are we a public service center here?

436
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,340
From now on,

437
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,670
if they are not our clients,

438
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,670
do not entertain them.

439
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,220
Ms. Xu,

440
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,100
where are you going?

441
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,550
To look for clients.

442
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,950
Pray

443
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,590
for yourself.

444
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,550
Careful, Ms. Xu.

445
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,950
I actually

446
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,070
agree with her.

447
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,070
We can't just wait for clients here.

448
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,100
I know a high-end place.

449
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,100
It has a golf park and a gym.

450
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,790
Perhaps we can find potential clients there.

451
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,070
I'll come with you.

452
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,790
Let's go.

453
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,310
It seems like we don't have to go.

454
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,030
We meet again.

455
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,070
What a coincidence.

456
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,340
Are you here for me?

457
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,430
Excuse me?

458
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,340
Is this how you treat your client?

459
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,670
Have some water.

460
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,980
You want us to manage,

461
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,670
in a reasonable fashion,

462
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,670
the disposable 5 million yuan you have.

463
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,710
But you do not have any specific requirements

464
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,620
for the risk and the yields.

465
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,790
Your husband

466
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,590
is the president of a financial company.

467
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,790
Your family owns many properties and cars.

468
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,310
And you

469
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,430
are a senior partner in a law firm.

470
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,950
Considering your income level,

471
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,140
I suggest the following distribution.

472
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,950
You have a healthy source of income,

473
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,860
which means high-risk resistance.

474
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,190
I suggest

475
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,460
that 10% of the fund

476
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,620
can be used on volatile assets

477
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,980
such as money market funds.

478
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,790
20%

479
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,460
will go to

480
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,140
the bond fund, which has a lower risk.

481
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,140
Another 30%, that is 1.5 million,

482
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,460
can be placed into a trust fund.

483
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,710
The overall earnings yield

484
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,980
will be around 8% to 10%.

485
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,860
As for the last 40%,

486
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,100
you can look around the primary market.

487
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,260
It's filled with small companies

488
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,910
with good potential that haven't gone public.

489
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,830
I will have my colleagues

490
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,140
explain it to you in detail.

491
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,740
You're a professional.

492
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,460
However, you forgot a crucial element.

493
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,070
Education fund.

494
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,220
My child will be attending
an elementary school next year.

495
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,070
I want a healthy fund for him.

496
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,950
He'll go to the best school

497
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,790
and grow up in the most conducive environment.

498
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,790
International school,
extra-curricular activities,

499
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,910
summer camps during the vacation...

500
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,790
In that case,

501
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,100
raising a child sure costs a lot of money.

502
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,740
A child can spend much more money than an adult.

503
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,100
Have you looked into

504
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,860
education funds?

505
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,740
I have.

506
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,590
It has to fulfill three criteria.

507
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,740
Low risk, high liquidity, long term.

508
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,550
It seems like this is not your expertise.

509
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,980
It's normal.

510
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,550
I understand.

511
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,190
Ms. Mi.

512
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,190
You can leave if you have nothing else to do here.

513
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,550
I don't understand.

514
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,380
Your husband owns a financial company too.

515
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't see

516
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,260
what you can find here.

517
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,190
I have never

518
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,950
seen An Yu like this.

519
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,620
Is she that fierce?

520
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,910
You only met her.

521
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
You have never seen when she's truly serious.

522
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,140
Lawyers get paid hourly too.

523
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,950
I'm not doing this for fun.

524
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,310
I have a career, a child,

525
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,310
and a husband.

526
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,140
Every second counts.

527
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,430
Never have I seen a rude staff member like you.

528
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,430
A five million contract.

529
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,430
Do you want it or not?

530
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,030
Allow me to repeat myself.

531
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,790
I will only sign a sole agency contract with An Yu.

532
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,380
She will handle this five million alone.

533
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,380
Is this too outrageous a request?

534
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,550
No, of course not.

535
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:43,980
Not at all.

536
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,070
Come on.

537
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,430
We will happily offer our service.

538
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,550
Sit. Calm down.

539
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,950
An Yu.

540
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,860
It'll be fine. Sign it.

541
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,340
Seize the opportunity.

542
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:56,860
Sit down.

543
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,550
An Yu, sit down.

544
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,740
Sit down and talk it out.

545
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,550
Ms. Mi.

546
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,790
Let's be seated.

547
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,140
We can discuss the contract in detail.

548
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,740
Oh, right.

549
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,830
Get rid of the counterfeit bag.

550
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,140
It doesn't suit you.

551
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,380
Sorry, An'an.

552
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,620
I gave you the bag.

553
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,830
I embarrassed you.

554
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,100
It has nothing to do with you.

555
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,070
I was her target from the get-go.

556
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,460
Look at her.

557
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,260
It makes me

558
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,910
want to learn Muay Thai now.

559
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,950
She gets on my nerves.

560
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,550
Congratulations, An Yu.

561
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,790
You got your first contract this soon.

562
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,140
And it's an important client.

563
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,140
Su,

564
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,220
can associates like us

565
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,740
sign a sole agency contract with a client?

566
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,980
Of course,

567
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,910
many clients,

568
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,310
like your friends or relatives,

569
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,980
only trust a certain person from the company.

570
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,100
In this case, they sign this kind of contract.

571
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,950
Don't worry.

572
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,550
It's normal.

[The Secret Garden]

574
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,070
What's on your mind?

575
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,790
Nothing.

576
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,830
Nothing.

577
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,950
Are you feeding the cat?

578
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,070
I think this is the cat food from this morning.

579
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,830
When you were sitting there,

580
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,980
did you see the cat?

581
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,980
No.

582
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,190
And I was wondering why it's so quiet today.

583
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,950
Weird.

584
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,190
Where did it go?

585
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,380
Kitty?

586
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,070
Kitty?

587
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,790

Kitty?

590
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,830
You know,

591
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,740
if we manage to find it,

592
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,910
we need to give it a name.

593
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,340
It'll be easier to call it or find it

594
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,550
like that.

595
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,980
But its activity is usually fixed.

596
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,950
It's its meal time now.

597
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,910
Where did it go then?

598
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,830
Kitty!

599
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,430
Let's check there.

600
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,710

Did you hear that?

606
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,590
Is it over there?

Kitty.

608
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,740
Kitty.

609
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,190
I think it's stuck in a mouse trap.

610
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh my god.

611

Can you do it?

612
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,980
I can't reach it.

Hold on.

Can you move this?

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,260
Are you all right?

Careful.

Are you sure your back is not hurt?

620
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,790
It hit very hard just now.

621

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,670
-I shouldn't be allergic to it.
-Ice Cream, go play there.

694
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,790
I don't think so.

695
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
An'an, listen to me.

696
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,910
My dad has the same symptoms.

697
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,340
He's allergic to cat fur.

698
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,670
It's fine.

699
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,100
Even if I'm allergic,

700
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,260
it's not a serious one.

701
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,380
Some medicine will cure it.

702
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,830
Don't worry.

703
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,030
No, you can't dismiss it like that.

704
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,380
An allergy is no joking matter.

705
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,430
Why don't we let our neighbor babysit it
for a few days?

706

We'll pick it up after you're healed.

if I can't even raise a cat.

710
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,500
Maybe the allergy will disappear
a few days later.

711

Okay.

712

You live here?

May I ask

720
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,580
why do you live in a place like this?

721
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,770
Is there a problem?

722
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,820
It doesn't match

723
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,130
your social status.

724
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,290
Mr. Zhou, does the fact that An Yu and I
are neighbors bother you?

725
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,100
No.

726
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,980
Why would I mind?

727
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,220
Good then.

728
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,740
Do you work out often, Mr. Zhou?

729
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,250
Yes.

Mr. Shao.

732
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,460
I came here today

733
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,130
to invite you

734
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,370
to join Yimi Capital.

735
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,650
Tell me what you want,

whether it's the share
or the shareholder position.

737
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,700
I'll draft you
the most satisfactory contract there is.

738
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,290
Mr. Shao.

739
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,130
Ever since our first meeting,

740
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,530
I know straight away that we're similar.

741
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,290
If we fight,

742
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,860
we will both lose.

743
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,100
If we work together,

744
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,010
trust me,

745
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,340
we will both

746
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,770
be the winner.

747
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,010
It sounds enticing,

748
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,490
but I don't believe we're the same, Mr. Zhou.

You can't come today?

All right then.

751
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,820
Seriously?

752
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,770
Why are you here?

753
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,380
What brings you here?

754
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,340
I was doing something nearby

755
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,730
and it's freezing today.

756
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,250
So I'm here for a free hot drink.

757
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,140
Unfortunately,

758
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,580
we have no more water here

759
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,770
and the heater broke down.

760
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,580
Then,

761
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,530
why didn't you call a technician to fix it?

762
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,690
I did.

763
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,140
But they told me
the temperature has dropped lately

764
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,380
and many people asked for their service.

765
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,450
They could only come tomorrow morning
at the earliest.

766

Close the store then.
