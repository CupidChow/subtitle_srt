00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,940
When you're my age,

336
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,140
you will know

337
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
miracles don't happen in life.

338
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,540
Sorry.

339
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,900
Development proposal.

340
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,660
Asset evaluation.

341
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,820
Where is An Yu's
employee equity acquisition proposal?

342
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,860
It's here.

343
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,100
Here.

344
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,100
Where is she?

345
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,660
I was investigating Hongxing Telecom's asset

346
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,860
with Su there.

347
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,460
An Yu was investigating
with their staff members.

348
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,540
Perhaps she had something else to do,

349
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,580
so she asked us to bring the report back.

350
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,540
I'll call her right now.

351
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,860
Can she not attend the meeting
after submitting the report?

352
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,060
Why does An Yu have special treatment,

353
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,660
Mr. Shao?

354
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,420
Ms. Fang.

355
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,060
I've been working with An Yu for a long time.

356
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,620
I dare not say much about other aspects,

357
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,420
but in terms of work,

358
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
her ability and attitude

359
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,100
is the best among us.

360
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,900
No matter what relationship

361
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,180
she has with whom,

362
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,620
she has never felt that she's special.

363
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,500
Instead, she is
the most hardworking person among us.

364
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,900
Are you saying that I blamed her wrongly?

365
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,940
Ms. Fang.

366
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,300
All of us know what An Yu
had gone through in the past.

367
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,780
She also knows

368
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,620
how people around her perceive her.

369
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,620
But she is still so hardworking,

370
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,340
persistent, and brave

371
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,580
because she knows

372
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,500
hatred doesn't solve any problems.

373
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,980
It will only hurt ourselves.

374
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,580
If someone else speaks to me with that tone again,

375
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,540
I'll fire them even if they are under Shao Moli!

376
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,620
What's wrong with Ms. Fang today?

377
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,500
Su.

378
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,420
Su!

379
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,380
Are you crazy? Why did you offend her?

380
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,620
But Su acted manly just now.

381
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,100
Actually, she...

382
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,460
Maybe she's just a bit upset.

383
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,220
What are you thinking?

384
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,740
Why are you still siding with her?

385
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,300
Ms. Fang.

386
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,980
Where have you been?

387
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,140
Something happened to Hongxing Telecom,

388
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,540
so I...

389
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,700
Was that why you could skip the meeting

390
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,460
and ask someone else to submit your report?

391
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,780
Sorry.

392
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,860
Come with me.

393
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,980
Follow me.

394
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,860
Do you still remember this place?

395
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Fangfang jumped down to save you

396
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,700
at this very spot.

397
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,620
Sorry.

398
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,540
Fangfang was three

399
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,340
when I divorced.

400
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,060
He might be young,

401
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,980
but he's been sensible.

402
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,620
He never mentioned his father in front of me.

403
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,500
He was weak when he was young.

404
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,780
To make him stronger,

405
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,940
I made him learn to swim.

406
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,940
Fangfang likes Wuxia novels.

407
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,380
He respects the warriors

408
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,020
who fight for righteousness.

409
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,820
That was why

410
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,020
he jumped down to rescue you without hesitation.

411
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,740
All these years,

412
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,420
I've never felt tough

413
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,100
raising Fangfang alone.

414
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,860
He brings me a lot of joy and happiness.

415
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,140
Although your son

416
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,300
isn't by your side,

417
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,660
he's healthy at least.

418
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,780
What about my son?

419
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,940
He is lying there

420
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,420
and can't do anything.

421
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,780
He is still young.

422
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,460
He hasn't got to study at university,

423
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,100
hasn't been in a relationship,

424
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,900
and hasn't enjoyed his life yet.

425
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,500
It has already been four years.

426
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,900
There's no longer any possibility.

427
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,540
Sorry.

428
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,860
An'an.

429
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,980
Where have you been?

430
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,740
Mr. Wolf is worried about you.

431
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,880
What's wrong, An'an?

432
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,740
I'm fine.

433
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,980
Leave me alone.

434
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,700
An'an.

435
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,340
Mr. Wolf.

436
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,900
An'an is back,

437
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,780
but I think she's in a bad mood.

438
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,020
Do you want to come and visit her?

439
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,660
(He is still young.)

440
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,380
(He hasn't got to study at university,)

441
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,060
(hasn't been in a relationship,)

442
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,260
(and hasn't enjoyed his life yet.)

443
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,180
(It's all because of you!)

444
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,900
When he jumped down,

445
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,140
he didn't even know

446
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,620
what kind of person he was rescuing!

447
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,940
Mr. Wolf.

448
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,740
Where's An Yu?

449
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,780
She's in her room.

450
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,420
An Yu.

451
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,860
An Yu.

452
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,700
An Yu, are you alright?

453
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,140
Shao Moli.

454
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,380
Husky.

455
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,380
You were

456
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,180
waiting for me the whole night?

457
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
I'm fine now.

458
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,820
Go and wash up.

459
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,060
Otherwise, we'll be late again.

460
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,020
Okay.

461
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,900
See you in the office.

462
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,460
I'm going to wash up.

463
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,260
Ms. Fang.

464
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,500
Here's the analysis report you asked for.

465
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,820
Leave it there.

466
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,020
Do you have a stomachache?

467
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
It happens to me too when I'm in a bad mood.

468
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,300
Drink this.

469
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,540
It helps a lot.

470
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,380
An.

471
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,060
You got me transferred from the workshop
to the Research and Development Department.

472
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,380
The factory is in trouble now,

473
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,580
and I failed to save it.

474
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,260
Your daughter is here to save it.

475
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,900
Your daughter, Yu,

476
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,180
is very capable.

477
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,500
She can play an important role now.

478
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,940
[In Memory of My Father, An Wenbin]
She's just like you.

479
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,580
You can rest in peace now.

480
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,180
I have things to do at the factory.

481
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,420
I'll be leaving.

482
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,140
All right.

483
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Don't mind me.

484
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,900
I'll accompany my dad for a while longer.

485
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm leaving.

486
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,260
Goodbye, Mr. Ma.

487
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,900
Dad.

488
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,020
The last time you gave me orders,

489
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,060
you wanted me to take good care of myself

490
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,420
and take good care of Yiyi.

491
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,620
I've already done half of them now.

492
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,780
I take care of myself very well.

493
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,940
My work is fine,

494
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,980
and my life is not too bad.

495
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
However,

496
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,780
I still can't take care of Yiyi.

497
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,980
Yiyi has grown taller.

498
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,660
He is about this tall now.

499
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
He's strong.

500
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,820
One day, perhaps.

501
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,140
One day,

502
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,540
Yiyi will be back to my side.

503
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,700
By then,

504
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,860
I will make up to him

505
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,780
what I owe him all these years.

506
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,300
Recently...

507
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,820
Recently, I met someone.

508
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,300
His name is Shao Moli.

509
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,820
He's not bad.

510
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,980
We are in a relationship now, I guess.

511
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
But I still need to test him out.

512
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,700
I'll bring him here to see you

513
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,180
when he passes the test.

514
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,940
No need for tests.

515
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,340
I'm already here.
