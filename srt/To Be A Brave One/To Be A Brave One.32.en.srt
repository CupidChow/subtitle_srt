If we are truly impartial and objective,

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,600

That's why I didn't approve them.

343
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,550
Thank you.

344
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,620
How unprofessional.

345
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:45,356
Kai,

346
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,990
you're wearing a suit and tie

347
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,060
to Lailai's hometown.

348
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,620
Are you there to show off your wealth?

349
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,230
No.

350
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,910
I didn't know I had to go today.

351
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,550
I look so out of place.

352
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,180
It's awkward.

353
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,110
Not at all.

354
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,700
You can be my model.

355
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,030
Let me adjust the color temperature.

356
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,740
Come.

357
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,910
What a good-looking pair of couples.

358
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,990
[Portrait]
A good-looking pair of couples.

359
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,550
I have to be the pretty one.

360
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,380
Of course, you are.

361
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm the eye candy.

362
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,590
What are you doing?

363
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,220
Mr. Wolf, you stalker.

364
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,590
You didn't get the right angle.

365
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,380
Delete it.

366
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,310
Delete it.

367
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,030
I have to spend a fortune

368
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,670
to buy back the photos taken.

369
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,340
Hi.

370
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,460
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

371
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,860
-Hi.
-Hello.

372
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,980
-Hi.
-Hello.

373
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,740
-Welcome.
-Hi.

374
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,710
The van is here.

375
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,590
Let's help out.

376
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,460
-OK. Let's go.
-Let's go.

377
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,190
Let's go.

378
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,980
You can't work in that attire.

379
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,100
You told me to come right away.

380
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,030
I did

381
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,220
but didn't you know to get changed first?

382
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,500
I was just being the obedient boyfriend.

383
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,590
Get changed now then.

384
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,550
All right.

385
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,100
Hurry up

386
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,790
and help us.

387
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,340
Hi.

388
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,500
How is the installation?

389
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,070
Mr. Shao.

390
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,308
The equipment has been installed.

391
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,430
Ye Kai.

392
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,430
Are you done changing?

393
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,430
Come help us.

394
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,590
Coming!

395
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,980
I'm here.

396
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,030
Put it there.

397
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,790
Where?

398
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,460
There.

399
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,100
Here?

400
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,100
Hi, everyone.

401
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm Jin Lailai.

402
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,340
You can call me Miss Lailai.

403
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,860
-Hi, Miss Lailai.
-Hi, Miss Lailai.

404
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,790
Hi.

405
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,340
This is Miss An Yu.

406
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,030
-Hi, Miss An Yu.
-Hi, Miss An Yu.

407
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,220
Hi, everyone.

408
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
This is Miss Fang Li.

409
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,620
-Hi, Miss Fang Li.
-Hi, Miss Fang Li.

410
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,740
Hi.

411
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,670
This is Mr. Ye Kai.

412
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,740
-Hi, Mr. Ye Kai.
-Hi, Mr. Ye Kai.

413
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,830
Hello.

414
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,030
Everyone.

415
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,500
Now, we'll have a drawing class.

416
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,670
Today's theme

417
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,140
is me.

418
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,140
This is Mr. Shao Moli.

419
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,340
-Hi, Mr. Shao Moli.
-Hi, Mr. Shao Moli.

420
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm Mr. Su.

421
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,910
The golden sunlight...

422
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,980
-The golden sunlight...
-The golden sunlight...

423
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,790
washed through the meadow.

424
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,790
-washed through the meadow.
-washed through the meadow.

425
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,500
In the following days,

426
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,550
the teachers here

427
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,710
will deliver different lessons.

428
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,860
I hope you will like us.

429
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,190
When I was little,

430
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,190
I was like you.

431
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,380
I hated maths.

432
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,790
So, why do we need to learn maths?

433
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,430
Come.

434
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,140
The countdown starts now!

435
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,670
Because of the sunlight...

436
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,220
-Because of the sunlight...
-Because of the sunlight...

437
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,380
It's taller.

438
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,100
Don't move!

439
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,190
And now,

440
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,670
I'll show you the Smart Desk.

441
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,500
It has a super useful function.

442
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,980
Press this green button

443
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,140
and you can video call your parents.

444
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,220
It's because

445
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,070
we already

446
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,070
keyed in your parents' phone numbers

447
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,590
inside.

448
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,260
If your parents didn't pick up,

449
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,220
you can press the button next to it

450
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,430
to leave them a message.

451
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,670
Does any of you want to give it a try?

452
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,260
I do.

453
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,380
What is your name?

454
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,830
They call me Dapeng.

455
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,430
Should we try it then?

456
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,620
Dapeng, right?

457
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,460
Let me see.

458
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,340
I found your mother's number.

459
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,950
Come.

460
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,190
Press it to call her.

461
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,340
Pengpeng?

462
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,740
She picked it up.

463
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,790
Mommy, how are you lately?

464
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm good.

465
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,430
I can't talk to you now.

466
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,260
I have to deliver a food order now.

467
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,790
Pengpeng,

468
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,980
listen to your grandparents, okay?

469
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,460
Wait.

470
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,950
Dapeng.

471
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,380
Kiss your mom.

472
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,620
Tell your mom that you love her.

473
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,830
Mom, I love you.

474
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,860
Love you too.

475
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,430
Me next!

476
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,310
-You too?
-You too?

477
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,910
Who else?

478
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,190
All right. All of you can try it.

479
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
One by one, please.

480
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,590
What is your name?

481
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,790
You're awake.

482
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
I made breakfast.

483
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,340
Come and eat it.

484
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,790
I'll wake Yiyi up.

485
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,590
Time to get out of bed.

486
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,380
Breakfast is ready.

487
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,620
Hot!

488
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,310
Come, Yiyi.

489
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,620
It's so hot.

490
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,380
You have to try this.

491
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,910
I baked it for a long time this morning.

492
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,830
I added cinnamon to it.

493
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,620
Yiyi,

494
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,030
I'll get you a toast,

495
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,620
okay?

496
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,380
Cranberry jam?

497
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,830
Yes.

498
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,310
Okay.

499
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,100
I'll spread it on the toast.

500
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,220
I love it.

501
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,550
Cranberry jam with a lot of cranberries.

502
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,220
Okay.

503
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,910
It looks delicious.

504
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,070
More jam please, Daddy.

505
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,860
It's enough.

506
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,670
Now, take a huge bite.

507
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,310
It's delicious.

508
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,860
Then you drink some milk.

509
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,910
Good.

510
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,670
Feed me too.

511
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,590
You must have cooked for the entire morning.

512
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,380
Yes.

513
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,550
Have some more.

514
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,790
Look, Yiyi.

515
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,070
You attach the Bumblebee's wings like this.

516
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,670
See?

517
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,550
Daddy, you're truly a genius!

518
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,500
Come.

519
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,070
I love you a lot.

520
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,550
I love you too.

521
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,380
Yiyi's finally asleep.

522
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,460
Thank you so much.

523
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,670
You cooked and played with him the whole day.

524
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,340
Thank you.

525
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,190
You know what?

526
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,260
We've been married for four years.

527
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,740
Four years?

528
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,430
You have worked

529
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,620
so hard these four years.

530
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,550
You had to develop your career

531
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,140
while looking after this family.

532
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,260
From now on, we will have more time

533
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,550
to do what we did today.

534
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,380
We can cook breakfast together,

535
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,380
and we can travel with Yiyi.

536
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,260
We can also...

537
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,830
Lulu,

538
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,190
why are you telling me all this suddenly?

539
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,220
Nothing.

540
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,550
It's just that these few days,

541
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,710
I have cleared many things from my mind.

542
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,590
Don't overthink.

543
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,310
It's all history now.

544
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,790
Right.

545
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,310
I have an idea.

546
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,430
I want to create a fund for the kids.

547
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,860
Bestie!

548
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,790
I have the same idea too.

549
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,860
I'm in.

550
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,590
I'm in.

551
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,550
Me too!

552
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,710
So everyone has the same idea.

553
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,830
Let us plan it out once we're back.

554
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,740
-Okay.
-Okay.

555
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,980
[Zhou Yuan]
Sorry. Goodbye.

556
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:11,675
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

557
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:12,400
Sorry.

558
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
What happened?

559
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,100
"Sorry. Goodbye"?

560
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,030
What does it mean?

561
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,260
What is Zhou Yuan up to this time?

562
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,790
Ding?

563
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,260
Pick it up.

564
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,030
Yes, Ding?

565
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,620
It's bad, Mr. Shao.

566
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,260
Zhou Yuan wants to jump off Zhuoyue Tower.

567
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,740
Call the police

568
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,860
and we'll go there right now.

569
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,070
Su, head to Zhuoyue.

570
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,670
Noted.

571
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,830
Zhou Yuan is a father.

572
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,190
Why would he give up his family

573
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,460
and his kid that easily?

574
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,910
Not all parents

575
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,620
are strong.

576
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,740
We all despair sometimes.

577
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,460
When some parents are in despair,

578
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,860
they will even drag their kids to die with them.

579
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,460
Li, cordon off the area. Quick.

580
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,590
Stay back.

581
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,910
Remain calm.

582
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,220
Stay back.

583
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,190
Don't come near me.

584
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,030
If you do, I'll jump!

585
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,740
Don't do anything reckless.

586
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,460
Calm down.

587
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,070
Think about me

588
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,950
and Yiyi.

589
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,500
Don't do anything stupid.

590
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,980
I have nothing left now.

591
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,340
No need to persuade me, Lulu.

592
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
It's okay if Yimi is gone.

593
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,100
We can start over.

594
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I'll keep you company.

595
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,710
Yiyi will keep you company.

596
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,550
The three of us can start over. All right?

597
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,710
I'm begging you.

598
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,860
Start over?

599
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,830
It's not that easy.

600
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,190
Not everything can be reset.

601
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,740
It's okay even if you can't make it.

602
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,190
You don't have to.

603
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,220
I'll stay by your side.

604
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,860
Think about

605
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,710
yesterday, when we were home,

606
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,710
you had breakfast with Yiyi.

607
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,950
You played with him.

608
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,950
The three of us

609
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,550
can live a happy life.

610
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,860
Please stay.

611
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,590
Don't do this.

612
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,100
I no longer want anything!

613
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,140
Calm down.

614
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,910
Don't come near me!

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,940

616
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,030
Calm down.

617
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,070
Be careful.

618
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,860
His kid is here.

619
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,140
[Zhuoyue Financial Group]
Stop making a scene here.

620
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,100
Why is Yiyi here?

621
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,500
Shao Moli, bring Yiyi away.

622
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,550
What are you doing?

What is the matter?

I don't understand.

I failed you.

670

I failed Mi Lu.

If Mi Lu didn't meet me,

672
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,140
she would have a better life now.

673

Don't you understand?

680
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,500
I lied to you from the get-go.

681
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,980
I planned our encounter.

682

I already knew Mi Lu back then.

683
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,030
I approached you intentionally

685
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,460
And the umbrella? It was my doing.

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,910
From the beginning,

687
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,500
I hurt both of you.

688
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,220
I'm a jerk.

689
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,100
I don't deserve to live.

690
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,430
No! That's not true!

691
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,190
You take good care of others.

692
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,790
You are a kind person.

693
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,430
It was all a lie!

694
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,350
You took my umbrella away
but you didn't let me get soaked.

695
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Zhou Yuan.

696
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,710
You are capable.

697
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,910
Not everyone can run

698
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,500
a huge corporation

699
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,790
with several hundred members.

700
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,980
Think about Yiyi.

701
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,430
He's so loveable, obedient, and sensible.

702
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,070
Didn't you raise him to be like that?

703
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,340
He has your genes.

704
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,030
You just have a very strong sense
of responsibility.

705
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,070
You want to be a good son.

706
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,740
You don't want to see your father get hurt.

707
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,430
I don't want to see my father get hurt.

708
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,340
But I witnessed him

709
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,860
jump off the building in front of me.

710
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,550
He was staring at me.

711
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,380
I was so scared.

712
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,140
So scared.

713
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,590
Let go of me!

714
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,620
Let go of me!

715
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,830
-Let go of me!
-The pain you have endured

716
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,950
should not be passed down to Yiyi.

717
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,950
Don't do that to Yiyi!

718
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,100
Stop shoving, everyone.

719
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,790
Stay back.

720
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,460
It's over. Thank you.

721
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,380
Thanks.

722
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,790
Are you all right?

723
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,310
What about Yiyi?

724
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,500
Lailai is looking after him.

725
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,340
It's over now.

726
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,030
Everything is all right now.

727
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,260
I was so scared.

728
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,830
There, there.

729
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,620
Hush.

730
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,950
Yiyi.

731
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,110
You're a bad guy.

732
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,900
I don't want you.

733
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,180
Go away!

734
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,990
Yiyi.

735
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,380
You can't yell at people like that.

736
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,750
He's my good friend

737
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,300
and your good friend too.

738
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,900
No!

739
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,750
He's a bad guy.

740
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,020
He didn't let me see my daddy.

741
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,630
He's a bad guy.

742
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,710
I don't want him!

743
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,540
Yiyi.

744
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,260
Let's talk by the couch,

745
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,870
okay?

746
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,420
He's a bad guy!

747
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,110
I don't want him!

748
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,230
Go away!

749
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,070
He's a bad guy!

750
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,630
I don't want him!

751
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,590
I don't want him!

752
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,020
Can you calm down?

753
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,950
Stop it, Yiyi.

754
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,110
Stop it.

755
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,350
Stop it.

756
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,260
A lot has happened today.

757
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,470
He must be overwhelmed right now.

758
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,630
Please don't take it to heart.

759
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,020
Should I find a hotel?

760
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,830
No need.

761
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,230
Just wait in your room.

762
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,470
Let me comfort him.

763
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,420
He'll be better

764
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,590
after tonight.

765
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,070
Can you stay with me at a time like this?

766
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,590
I'll check on him.

767
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,500
Yiyi.

768
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,260
Yiyi.

769
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,670
From now on, we shouldn’t yell

770
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,630
at anyone, okay?

771
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,830
Okay.

772
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,590
Madam.

773
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,110
Can you tell me a story?

774
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,260
Sure.

775
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,870
Then I'll tell you

776
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,150
the story of the Dark Knight.

777
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,260
Dark Knight?

778
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,390
I have never heard that story.

779
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,390
Never?

780
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,350
Then I'll tell you this story, okay?

781
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,110
Come.

782
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,540
Let's keep you tucked.

783
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,190
Once upon a time,

784
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,300
there was a nation on the other side of the ocean.

785
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
It was forever spring there

786
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,070
and flowers were everywhere.

787
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,220
Really?

788
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,780
It was very beautiful.

789
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,540
And one day,

790
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,870
a prince

791
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,110
was born.

792
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,830
After he was born,

793
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,740
his parents showered him with love.

794
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,980
The prince was like you, Yiyi.

795
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,460
Everyone adored him,

796
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,460
right?

797
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,830
But one day,

798
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,220
something happened

799
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,190
to this nation.

800
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,190
His parents

801
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,500
had to go somewhere far away.

802
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,500
They couldn't keep him company.

803
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,500
And at this moment,

804
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,390
the prince made a new friend.

805
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,590
It was the Dark Knight.

806
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,430
The Dark Knight never took his mask off

807
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,700
so no one knew what he looked like.

808
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,780
But why didn't he

809
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,830
let others see his face?

810
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,740
He must have his reason
to conceal his face from others.

811
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,700
But after the prince met the Dark Knight,

812
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,870
whenever he had a problem

813
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,460
or when he was in a pinch,

814
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,350
the Dark Knight would appear immediately

815
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,540
to help him and protect him.
