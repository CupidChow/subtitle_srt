Actually, we're the same age.

I'd like to correct you.

to be judged and ashamed

189
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,830

Goodbye, Yiyi.

194
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,200
I've been thinking about a problem for years.

196

Today, I understood.

197

I was wrong.

198
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,230
I was wrong with still thinking

199
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,400
of this problem.

200
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,320
Is it meaningful for you to say this now?

201
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,080
If you want the best for him,

202
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,440
stay away from him.

203
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,350
All right.

204
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,400

I haven't eaten it yet.

(I'm not used to the way you are now.)

403

Do you watch this drama as well?

404
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,500
I watch it every day.

405
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,190
It's quite romantic, right?

406

You repeat that.

Mom.

408
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,220
I don't want to play the piano.

409
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,550
I just want to use the tablet.

410
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,310
Yiyi.

411
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,740
We had a deal.

412
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,860
Learn the piano

413
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,740
before using the tablet.

414
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,310
Okay?

415
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,950
I don't want to practice anymore.

416
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,030
I want to use the tablet.

417
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,220
Be good.

418
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,830
Let's learn for a little while.

419
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,340
Okay?

420
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,260
I want to use the tablet.

421
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,980
You can't.

422
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,260
Yiyi, how about this?

423
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,140
Let's

424
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,670
play something else.

425
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,980
We can play in the yard

426
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,190
or play with toys.

427
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,590
Okay?

428
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,740
No!

429
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,140
I just want to use the tablet!

430
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,830
Mom, I hate you!

431
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,740
(Madam.)

432
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,100
(Do you know me?)

433
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,380
Of course, I do.

434
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,340
Yiyi.

435
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,100
Do you remember me?

436
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
You can't remember?

437
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,190
Madam, let's play with me.

438
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,550
Okay.

439
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,140
Big tank.

440
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,220
No.

441
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,460
What's that?

442
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,430
An Yu.

443
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,190
How did you get in here?

444
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,460
Ms. Chen.

445
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,550
Take Yiyi back to the room.

446
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,740
All right.

447
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,430
Yiyi, let's go.

448
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,980
Let's go back to the room.

449
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,710
Okay.

450
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,380
Goodbye.

451
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,910
I missed him so much.

452
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,260
So I came to see him.

453
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,550
Oh, right.

454
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,550
I bought him some clothes.

455
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,260
I think he will like this.

456
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,310
This is too small for him.

457
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,860
Yiyi has grown up. He can't wear it.

458
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,590
Besides, our family doesn't need these.

459
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,260
You don't have it easy either.

460
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,590
Don't spend your money on this again.

461
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,430
I'm doing okay now.

462
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,670
I got a job.

463
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,460
I'm working at Zhuoyue.

464
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
Then work well.

465
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,860
The three of us will be doing fine.

466
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,340
Let's not disturb each other.

467
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,460
I hope you won't come again.

468
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,550
Don't pull me.

469
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,710

I know.

481
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,460
It's a sunny doll.

482
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,910
You still remember it, right?

483
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,910
Do you like it?

484
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,980

This lady gave me this gift.

490
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,340
It's called a sunny doll.

491

Yiyi.

492
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,380
How many times have I told you?

493
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,340
You can't take things from strangers.

494
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,830
Give it to me.

495
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,670
Mom.

496
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,830
This is my gift from this lady.

497
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm not a stranger.

498
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,710
I'm his mother.

499
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,380
Can't I come to see him?

500
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,190
Can't I buy him a gift?

501
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,620
But how could you come to his kindergarten?

502
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,910
It's been many times.

503
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,500
You've gone too far, An Yu.

504

Wait a minute.

[Exemplary investments, Shao Moli]

To get to know Shao Moli.

519
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,710
Let me tell you something.

520
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,950
An Yu went to Yiyi's kindergarten today.

521
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,950
I have to do something.

522
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,190
Yun.

523
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,430
Try the tea I brewed.

524
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,670
It looks good.

525
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,030
Let me taste it.

526
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,950
How is it?

527
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,790
It tastes good.

528
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,070
There's a special fragrance.

529
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,070
And it brings a peaceful feeling.

530
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,950
I added passion fruit and lavender to it.

531
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,670
Sunny doll?

532
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,670
I made it for my son.

533
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,260
I also used to make one for my son.

534
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,430
But he's not with me now.

535
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,100
I'll miss him more.

536
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,860
My son isn't with me now either.

537
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,070
He has gone abroad to attend college.

538
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,980
He's already in college?

539
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,590
I felt bad when he went abroad

540
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,980
to college.

541
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,910
I felt empty

542
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,670
all of a sudden.

543
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,860
Over these years,

544
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,620
it suddenly dawned on me

545
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,310
that women should live their own lives.

546
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,030
If you're happy,

547
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,430
everything will be fine.

548
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,380
So,

549
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,980
as long as a woman lives a wonderful life

550
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,550
and is happy,

551
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,260
she will win back her child's heart.

552
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,430
It makes a lot of sense.

553
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,950
Try the cookies I made.

554
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,740
It's delicious.

555
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,740
It's so cute.

556
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,140
It's tasty.

557
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,950
Let me introduce myself first.

558
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,500
I'm Mi Lu.

559
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,740
I'm a lawyer

560
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,670
and Zhou Yuan's wife.

561
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,590
Zhou Yuan?

562
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,830
An Yu's ex-husband?

563
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,220
You're the woman

564
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,430
who took her husband and child away from her.

565
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,260
Incredible.

566
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,910
Why did you want to see me today?

567
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,140
Talk about yourself.

568
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,260
Me?

569
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,030
There's nothing to talk about.

570
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,620
Without high professional competence

571
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,460
and a humble attitude,

572
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,030
it's hard to work in such a big company

573
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,260
like Zhuoyue.

574
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,380
You've been living in comfort
since you were young.

575
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,260
You thought you could succeed at work

576
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,830
with those means.

577
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,220
But you didn't expect

578
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
countless women would be resting
under such a big tree

579
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,310
as Jiang Haoran.

580
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
How would you know which tree is reliable

581
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,590
if you weren't exposed to the sun and rain?

582
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,100
I don't think you're like a lawyer.

583
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,030
Are you a private detective?

584
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,670
I can find it out if I want to get to know you.

585
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,220
I just asked

586
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,220
about your matter.

587
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,430
What does my matter have to do with you?

588
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,550
Women should plan for themselves.

589
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,910
Only women can help women.

590
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,620
You have your career.

591
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,670
I have my family.

592
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,980
I'm here to offer my help sincerely.

593
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,950
Madam.

594
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,740
What on earth do you want?

595
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,860
Your team will be transferred to the store soon.

596
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,380
You're going, too.

597
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:46,507
Not only will you go,

598
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,590
but you'll also become the store manager.

599
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,140
What are you talking about?

600
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,030
What store? What store manager?

601
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,740
I said

602
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,620
we could help each other.

603
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,220
As long as you listen to me,

604
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,260
your dream will come true.

605
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,980
An'an!

606
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,620
What's the matter?

607
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,860
We got paid!

608
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,740
Really?

609
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,430
This is our first salary since we joined Zhuoyue.

610
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,380
That's great.

611
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,430
I'll transfer the rent

612
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,310
to you later.

613
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,830
How great.

614
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,550
An'an, I'm telling you.

615
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:34,815
I'm so happy.

616
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,100
It's not my first job,

617
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,590
but I'm happier than getting paid

618
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,590
for the first time
after graduating from college.

619
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,140
Because it wasn't easy, right?

620
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,670
But the only flaw is

621
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,860
that we didn't have a bonus last month

622
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,910
during the probation period.

623
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,590
We got nothing

624
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,620
but a sense of achievement and honor

625
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,190
for completing such a big case

626
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
as Wei'er Hotel.

627
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,500
But the sense of achievement and honor

628
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,790
is the hardest to earn, right?

629
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,740
Xu Jingya

630
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,500
didn't exert efforts

631
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,550
but made a lot of money.

632
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,790
All right.

633
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,790
The meal is ready.

634
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,830
I'll brush my teeth.

635
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,550
Let's celebrate after I have my teeth brushed.

636
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,980
♪Be your biologically unrelated family♪

637
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,670
♪Share happiness and pain,
and always lean on each other♪

638
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,070
An'an, what's your plan for the afternoon?

639
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,260
Nothing.

640
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,590
Let's go shopping.

641
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,140
Okay.

642
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,260
Hello?

643
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,790
Project of Wei'er Hotel?

644
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,620
Okay.

645
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,340
I'm free.

646
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,740
Sure.

647
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,950
See you later.

648
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:36,062
So our plan is ruined.

649
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,230
Mr. Shao.

650
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,630
You wanted to see me?

651
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,350
Why do you just come like this?

652
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,830
Didn't you say something about the project?

653
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,500
There's something about the project.

654
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,590
But...

655
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,870
But...

656
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,230
But what?

657
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,350
Nothing.

658
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,020
It doesn't matter. Follow me.

659
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,500
Mr. Shao.

660
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,750
Why did you bring me here?

661
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,780
Choose some clothes.

662
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,180
Are you joking again?

663
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,630
Look at my serious face.

664
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,260
Trust me.

665
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
This is all for work.

666
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,990
Okay.

667
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,710
I'll trust you this time.

668
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,070
Let's go.

669
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,420
I'm just kidding.

670
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,660
That's it.

671
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,070
Didn't you say you wanted
to choose gifts for everyone?

672
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,740
Why don't we go to the mall?

673
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,260
You don't understand.

674
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,910
There's a thrill of flash sale

675
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,430
shopping here.

676
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,780
I think this bag looks good on An'an.

677
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,190
She doesn't even have a decent handbag now.

678
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,670
And I just observed.

679
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,390
This bag is available in several stores.

680
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,390
It must be the hot-selling item of the season.

681
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,740
Ma'am.

682
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,430
How much is the wholesale price

683
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,390
of this handbag?

684
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,780
How many do you want?

685
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,630
Wholesale?

686
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,430
Ma'am.

687
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,500
How much is the wholesale price?

688
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,700
This costs 288 yuan.

689
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,300
Miss.

690
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,350
You have good taste.

691
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,390
This is our best-selling item.

692
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
It's in tip-top condition.

693
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:12,910
Ma'am.

694
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,940
Make it cheaper.

695
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,630
Eighty-eight yuan.

696
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,070
Are you kidding me?

697
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,780
Eighty-eight yuan?

698
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,590
I can't even sell it.

699
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,350
I'll lose money.

700
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,460
Forget it. Let's go to another store.

701
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,500
Miss.

702
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,630
Well.

703
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,630
Add some more money.

704
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,540
The lowest I can offer is 120 yuan.

705
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:32,590
Well.

706
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,260
Ma'am.

707
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,670
Let's have some give-and-take.

708
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,910
Round it up.

709
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,020
How many do you want?

710
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,020
One.

711
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,150
One?

712
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,150
You can't get a wholesale price
if you buy one only.

713
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,430
Let's go then.

714
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,390
Forget it.

715
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,300
Here you are.

716
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,590
I'll sell you one for nothing.

717
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,460
Then wrap it for me.

718
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,070
I'll make the payment.

719
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,830
You're so good at fooling others.

720
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,300
It's nothing.

721
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,020
Bargaining is a zero-sum game,

722
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,430
after all.

723
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,350
You won by using

724
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,390
the game theory here.

725
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,700
Don't you want to thank An Yu?

726
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,540
You only bought a 100-yuan bag.

727
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,350
Aren't you close sisters?

728
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,190
The bag has a price,

729
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,540
but friendship is priceless.

730
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,110
Ma'am.

731
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,110
I've paid you.

732
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,430
Okay. I got it.

733
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,780
Thank you.

734
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,700
Let's go.

735
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,590
It's only 30 yuan.

736
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,460
Excuse me.

737
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,670
How about 50 yuan for two pieces?

738
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,940
A hundred yuan is really a big deal.
