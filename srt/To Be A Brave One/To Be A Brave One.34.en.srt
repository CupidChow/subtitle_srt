because he can use the hiking prices

If Lin Zhanhong

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
If that happens,

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,030
Lin Zhanhong's image will be affected.

173
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,550
Even if we don't stage it up

174
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,960
and report the issue without being biased,

175
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
it's still beneficial to us.

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,670
Does anyone here
know someone working for the press?

177
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,710
I have someone in mind.

178
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,670
Zhou Min.

179
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,960
You mean that wealthy undergraduate?

180
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,590
Yeah.

181
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,710
She's doing her internship
in a new media company right now.

182
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,350
I think we can ask her
to write some articles for us.

183
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,350
An Yu,

184
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm confident

185
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,677
that I can turn this into the first popular
article that I have ever written.

186
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,550
I'm glad that you're interested.

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,350
What about this?

188
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Later,

189
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,960
I'll organize the materials

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,520
and email them to you.

191
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,320
You're also welcome to interview
the employees in Zhuoyue.

192
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,230
Sure.

193
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,280
Although the total shares
that An Yu and I possess

194
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
are lesser than Lin Zhanhong's,

195
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,150
the number is quite close.

196
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,230
If we can win the support
of the other shareholders,

197
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,350
we might be able to turn this around.

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,110
However, according to what I know,

199
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,000
Lin Zhanhong has a great relationship with them.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,080
And he pays them excellent dividends each year.

201
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,080
I was acquainted

202
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,440
with some of Zhuoyue's
veteran shareholders in the past.

203
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,400
I can give it a try

204
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,840
and see if I can win them over.

205
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,760
Mr. Ke.

206
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,000
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,590
Are you Fang...?

208
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm Fang Li.

209
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,150
Yeah.

210
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,790
You were working
in our investment department, right?

211
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,350
Mr. Ke, you still remember me?

212
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,150
Are you here to play tennis too?

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,880
Yeah.

214
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,230
Mr. Ke, please teach me.

215
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,030
It's my pleasure.

216
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,960
-Come.
-Okay.

217
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,000
I think we need to pressure
Lin Zhanhong with the masses too.

218
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,200
If the employees of Zhuoyue hear about this,
especially the ones

219
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,030
that are not in senior-level positions,

220
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,910
they surely worry about their positions

221
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,400
once Zhuoyue is taken over by someone else.

222
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,110
However, we mustn't make everyone panic.

223
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,840
We're trying to protect Zhuoyue here.

224
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,110
We have to try our best to retain our talents.

225
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,670
I will act accordingly.

226
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,840
Let's have lunch together.

227
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,790
I brought extra today.

228
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,670
I don't feel like eating much.

229
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,230
Okay.

230
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,440
Let us help you out.

231
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,970
Okay.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
Jin Lailai,

233
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,030
it's almost the end of the year soon.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm sure the investment department
is especially busy, huh?

235
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,080
Busy?

236
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,910
We have plenty of free time.

237
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,670
Those from the investment department
actually have free time on their hands?

238
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,960
Did you guys hear about it?

239
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,960
-About what?
-About what?

240
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,200
They're planning to sell Zhuoyue away.

241
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,400
It's nothing.

242
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,880
Lower your volume.

243
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,880
They haven't announced the news yet.

244
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,590
You guys must keep it a secret.

245
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,110
Actually, we're thinking of the same thing.

246
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,960
No one wants Zhuoyue to go through
a massive change, right?

247
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,110
However, it's definitely useless
if we just sit there and do nothing about it.

248
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,550
That's why I hired a friend

249
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,230
to make a joint protest petition web page for me.

250
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,150
Look.

251
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,590
All of us can sign our names on the petition.

252
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Zhuoyue belongs to us all.

253
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,790
We mustn't let the few of them decide
the fate of the company.

254
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,880
-That's right.
-Let me show you guys.

255
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,840
Look.

Send the link to me immediately.

259
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,880
I'll open a WeChat group.

260
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,110
Okay.

261
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I'll send it to you right now.

262
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,030
I've sent it to you.

263
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,150
Alright, I got it.

264
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,470
You mustn't tell people
that I told you guys about this.

265
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,760
-We won't.
-We'll keep it a secret.

266
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,200
I'll make a move first.

267
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,470
Goodbye.

268
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,320
Goodbye.

269
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,230
We're in trouble!

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,670
They're going to sell Zhuoyue away!

271

[Hongxing Telecom purchased
by cold-blooded foreign capitalist]

272
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,470
Sir,

273
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,910
this is just a random article
posted by a trivial reporter.

274
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,350
There's no need to care about them.

275
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,520
The article is none of your concern.

276
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,760
However, what about the employees?

277
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,840
Now, over 500 of our employees

278
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,320
have already signed their names

279
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,400
on the joint protest petition.

280
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,520
More than 500 of them!

281
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,280
Isn't that your responsibility?

282
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,650
I...

283
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,400
I think someone

284
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,910
is surely behind this.

285
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,410
If not...

286
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,550
If not, there's no way anyone could find out

287
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,710
about your secret plan overnight.

288
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,910
Of course, I know someone is behind this.

289
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,320
I think I know his identity too.

290
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,790
Actually, you and the board of directors

291
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,150
have the right to decide the fate of the company.

292
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,440
Their protest is meaningless.

293
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,280
Enough. Stop it.

294
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,440
I know what to do.

295
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,710
I will think of something

296
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,520
and win the support of the board of directors.

297
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,030

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,930
Hello?

300
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,370
Are you still working?

301
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,810
Are you hungry?

302
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,780
No.

303
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,900
Did you miss me then?

304
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,370
No.

305
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,610
But I missed you.

306
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,220
Why didn't you miss me?

307
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,860
Because

308
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,490
I don't mean what I say.

309
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,690
Let's go home.

310
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,220
Do you want me to give you a lift?

311
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,170
No.

312
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,860
Okay.

313
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,860
I'll wait for you downstairs.

314
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,780
Husky,

315
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,820
you're not adorable at all.

316
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,940
It's been so long since I came to the bookstore.

317
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,780
Isn't this your favorite bookstore?

318
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,250
How did you know?

319
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,330
I never told you about it before.

320
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,300
I realized that you knew

321
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,900
many of my hobbies.

322
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,060
Don't you think your question is meaningless?

323
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,250
Mr. Shao, you're so fierce.

324
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,370
Why are you being so serious?

325
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,850
I have something serious to tell you.

326
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,700
We'll face off against Lin Zhanhong next Monday.

327
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,060
Although we've put in a lot of effort,

328
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,330
I still

329
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,940
feel insecure about it.

330
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,580
Did you forget what I told you before?

331
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,060
Sometimes, the result
isn't the most important thing.

332
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,490
What matters is that you've done your best

333
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,180
to resolve the issue.

334
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,330
That's right.

335
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,450
Mr. Shao,

336
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,490

505
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,370
Anyway, stay out of this affair!

506
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,180
I may not understand you,

507
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,090
but I know it's difficult
for Zhuoyue to get to where it is today.

508
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,610
Dad,

509
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,130
are you going to forsake Zhuoyue
because of some stupid money?

510
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,250
Haven't you earned enough?

511
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,780
Some stupid money?

512
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,090
I'm forsaking Zhuoyue?

513
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,820
Have you experienced what I have before?

514
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,450
You can't just do business

515
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,250
with a dream and a hot-blooded attitude.

516
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,730
Dad!

517
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,660
This is infuriating.

518
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,020
I didn't expect

519
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,450
Mr. Lin to be this insistent.

520
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,940
Dad changed.

521
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,210
He wasn't like this in the past.

522
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,060
He used to listen to everything I said.

523
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,250
Fei'er,

524
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,060
you mustn't blame yourself.

525
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,540
We're already grateful

526
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,900
that you're helping us out.

527
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,020
However, this matter is too big of a deal.

528
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,060
Maybe it has a different meaning to him.

529
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,210
However, when I was little, he used to tell me

530
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,780
that he, Mr. Xiao, and Mr. An

531
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,940
established Zhuoyue together.

532
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,180
He said all of us must have a dream.

533
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,970
I didn't expect him

534
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,370
to sell his dream away in the end.

535
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,180
Don't tell me his dream
is just a series of numbers?

536
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,970
What are you two thinking about?

537
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,020
I'm thinking about

538
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,060
how to persuade your father

539
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,610
to give up on selling Zhuoyue.

540
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,580
I think it's impossible.

541
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,090
What should we do

542
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,020
to make your father change his mind?

543
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,420
Wait, I'm reminded of a place.

544
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,940
Dad.

545
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,610
Are you still angry at me?

546
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,020
I don't dare to do so.

547
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,420
You suddenly appeared
at the board of directors' meeting

548
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,450
and interrupted me.

549
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,660
Now, everyone knows about it.

550
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,370
I'm not a chairman.

551
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,900
I'm just the slave of my daughter.

552
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,580
That's nothing to worry about.

553
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,330
Our Mr. Lin is gentle and cute.

554
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,090
Everyone will like you better.

555
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,420
Gentle and cute?

556
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,090
I...

557
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,490
Did you think I got to where I am
today by being gentle and cute?

558
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,250
I'm here to apologize to you, aren't I?

559
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,730
I won't be mad at you

560
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,610
as long as you don't interfere
with my plan of selling Zhuoyue away.

561
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,540
Do you understand?

562
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,330
I'm not here to talk about this.

563
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,660
What is it then?

564
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,330
I'm doing my portrait series,

565
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,820
and it's going to be completed soon.

566
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,060
I need your support.

567
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,330
Tell me then.

568
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,850
How should I support you?

569
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,780
I need to draw a portrait of you.

570
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,090
Draw a portrait of me?

571
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,130
No way.

572
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,700
I've already decided from the start.

573
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,940
I will draw your portrait for my last entry.

574
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,060
You just made me a promise.

575
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,940
Why are you drawing a portrait of me?

576
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,250
There's nothing for you to draw here.

577
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,300
Please?

578
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,660
Just let me draw you.

579
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Fine.

580
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,730
I still have some time left.

581
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,850
Let's begin.

582
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,130
This place won't work.

583
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,330
Let's head to another place.

584
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,210
Where are we going? Can't we do it here?

585
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,610
I'm making the call here.

586
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,130
Just follow me.

587
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,060
Come on.

588
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,210
Where are you bringing me?

589
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,330
I'll tell you when we're there.

590
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:10,900
Let's go.

591
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,730
Where are we going?

592
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,060
Dad, get out of the car.

593
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,940
Why did you bring me here?

594
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,370
Wasn't this the place you lived in before?

595
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,540
I have never been here.

596
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,850
I came here to check it out.

597
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,970
Let's go.

598
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,020
Come on.

599
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,940
Please?

600
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,250
Let's go.

601
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,780
Dad,

602
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,970
I'll check out the second floor first.

603
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,160
Okay.

604
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,250
(Come.)

605
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,620
(Cheers.)

606
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,290
Here.

607
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,460
This liquor is pretty good.

608
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,740
Drink up!

609
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:18,890
Come on.

610
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,650
Bottoms up.

611
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,370
Don't worry. This liquor isn't that strong.

612
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:26,890
Drink up.

613
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,130
I have to eat up.

614
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,890
I can only drink

615
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,130
with you guys after I had my fill.

616
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,170
If not, I can't hold my liquor well.

617
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,410
Here.

618
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,490
Your favorite Chinese cabbage is cooked.

619
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,340
You're giving us the Chinese cabbage

620
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,940
so that you can have the meat to yourself, right?

621
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,010
What?

622
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,890
What do you mean by that?

623
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,740
Didn't you have any meat?

624
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,620
I was wondering where the meat had gone.

625
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,250
I thought it sunk to the bottom.

626
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,220
But he actually ate it all.

627
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,250
Yeah!

628
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,460
Punish yourself with a drink!

629
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,730
(It's fine.)

630
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,210
We can treat this failure

631
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,340
as testing the water.

632
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,730
It's impossible for one

633
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,620
to succeed on the first try.

634
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,490
Yeah.

635
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,290
Failing once doesn't mean anything.

636
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,140
I'm sure we can achieve our dream.

637
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,340
We will establish

638
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,450
a finance company with over 500 employees.

639
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,380
We will take on all the projects we want to do.

640
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,770
I will always be there for you two

641
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,530
for as long as you two need me.

642
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,900
We can overcome anything

643
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,690
as long as we stay united.

644
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,820
All three of us are vital members of the team.

645
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,730
Each of us is equally important.

646
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,340
Dad.

647
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,340
Dad?

648
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,530
