182
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,270

You'll never guess.

208
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
It was because of crabs.

209
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
When I was preparing the crabs just now,

210
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,350
Kai told me that there was a type of crab

211
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,110
called the Florida stone crab abroad.

212
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Back then, he had just gone abroad.

213
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Stone crabs

214
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,710
are a local delicacy.

215
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,320
They would only harvest the claws.

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,640
And the rest must be

217
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,110
released back into the ocean

218
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,030
or risk getting caught by the police.

219
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,710
Despite his first time

220
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,080
going into the sea,

221
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,910
Kai managed to capture
a big bucket of stone crabs.

222
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,200
And he happened to bump into
Mr. Wolf, who was taking a walk.

223
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,230
When Mr. Wolf saw the police,

224
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,320
he quickly dumped all the stone crabs
back into the sea.

225
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,030
Kai was stunned.

226
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
He didn't know what happened.

227
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
He thought Mr. Wolf was bullying him.

228
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,710
So when Mr. Wolf saw the police,

229
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,790
he had no time to explain.

230
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,080
In the end, both of them...

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
What's that?

232
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,150
What are you doing?

233
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,400
It felt like the beginning of an idol drama.

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,840
-Yeah.
-What idol drama?

235
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,910
Guess what?

236
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,030
My childhood has been a tragedy.

237
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
Want to hear a story?

238
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
Let me tell you.

239
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,910
When I was

240
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,790
about fourteen years old,

241
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,200
my parents and I moved abroad.

242
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,760
I was extremely introverted back then.

243
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,350
There was a language barrier,

244
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
so I didn't have any friends.

245
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,910
Me too.

246
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,550
When I was abroad,

247
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,520
my parents were always busy working.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,590
I could only read books, draw, and watch TV

249
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,550
after I got home.

250
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,110
I was isolated and bullied

251
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,520
at school

252
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,640
all the time.

253
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,230
I wasn't as tall as I am now.

254
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,280
Instead, I was short and fat.

255
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Do you know

256
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,670
what my classmates called me behind my back?

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
They called me

258
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,030
"Mommy's Piglet".

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,590
I got a nickname too.

260
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,470
I was doing brilliantly in my studies,

261
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,640
especially in mathematics.

262
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,550
So they'd always call me a freak.

263
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,840
Are you telling the story or I am?

264
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,550
Carry on.

265
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,670
I remember once...

266
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
I was buying lunch in the canteen.

267
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,520
And I accidentally bumped into
one of my classmates.

268
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,150
And I spilled the soup all over him.

269
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,350
So his gang took the opportunity

270
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,840
to bully and trouble me

271
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,710
relentlessly.

272
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,320
But it was an accident.

273
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,670
He assembled his gang

274
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,520
and surrounded me.

275
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,230
Do you know what he did?

276
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,110
He made me kneel on the ground

277
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,470
and clean up the soup.

278
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,640
Many people at the canteen

279
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,710
surrounded us,

280
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,030
but no one cared for me.

281
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,440
They were laughing at me.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,790
Suddenly,

283
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,150
one person appeared.

284
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,110
And it was him.

285
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,150
When I saw him,

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,150
I knew

287
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,910
he was the one who had dumped
my crabs into the sea.

288
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,440
So I was like, "What should I do?"

289
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,150
All the bad guys are here now.

290
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,110
Unexpectedly,

291
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,110
he

292
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,200
pulled me back

293
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,280
and confronted that dude.

294
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,030
Eventually, that dude lost the argument

295
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,670
and attacked him.

296
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,840
Guess what?

297
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,470
That dude

298
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,440
was from the rugby team.

299
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,710
One punch from him

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,910
was enough to send me to heaven.

301
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,640
That incident

302
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,080
left a scar on Shao's head.

303
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,320
Really?

304
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,710
Did you get hit?

305
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
Over here.

306
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,350
It's on that side.

307
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
On your right side.

308
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,760
Seriously.

309
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,470
-I told you, it's right here.
-It's really there.

310
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,960
He's very righteous, isn't he?

311
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
When I was a kid, I was actually very timid.

312
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,440
But

313
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,670
when I got bullied,

314
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
someone appeared

315
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,470
and protected me.

316
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
That's why I did

317
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,590
the same for Ye Kai.

318
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,200
Since then,

319
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,670
both of us

320
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,400
have become

321
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,080
best buddies.

322
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,470
After that, I grew taller

323
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
and got a little muscular.

324
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
So I thought to myself,

325
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,150
whoever dares to bully Shao

326
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,280
or provoke him in the future,

327
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,320
I will stand before him and protect him.

328
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,110
I must

329
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,280
and I will always remain by his side.

330
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,840
I mean nobody can bully him.

331
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,590
And so, you two have

332
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,760
stuck together?

333
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,910
In life and death?

334
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,760
I feel so touched.

335
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Come on, let's have a drink.

336
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,280
To our friendship.

337
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,520
To never leave each other.

338
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,030
To life and death!

339
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,550
Cheers!

340
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,960
Ice Cream.

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
You sneezed.

342
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,550
My allergies are getting better.

343
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,880
But you are still sneezing.

344
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,760
What's wrong?

345
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,590
Ice Cream.

346
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,910
Here, let me see.

347
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,030
Hello?

348
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,670
I brought some of the things you left behind.

349
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm downstairs.

350
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,000
I sent you photos of Yiyi twice.

351
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Did you receive it?

352
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,030
I thought you didn't.

353
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,670
So...

354
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,910
Yiyi

355
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,790
looks more and more like you.

356
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,860
He is my child.

357
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,050
Of course, he'll look like me.

358
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,300
Are these things for me?

359
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,930
Yes. These are the stuff

360
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,170
you left behind.

361
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,730
I kept them nicely for you.

362
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,100
Because I think they're important to you.

363
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,570
Of course,

364
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,220
it depends if you still need it.

365
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,050
I'm pretty happy for you

366
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,980
after seeing you do well.

367
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,020
Yu.

368
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,930
Thank you.

369
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,130
Did you smoke again?

370
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Why are you so disobedient?

371
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,300
All right.

372
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,250
I promise I will be obedient.

373
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,220
[Financial Statement]

374
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,450
Why do we get so many
financial statements today?

375
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,300
Are we having financial problems?

376
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,420
Let me have a look.

377
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,250
Leave

378
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,730
the company's affairs to me.

379
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,450
Dad.

380
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,250
I am also a finance graduate.

381
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,300
When Yiyi gets older,

382
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,090
I'll help you with your finances.

383
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,970
Since you were young,

384
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,420
I have always

385
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,700
fulfilled your demands.

386
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Hello? Zhou Min.

387
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,330
An Yu.

388
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,560
Do you know which gym is better?

389
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,330
Gym?

390
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,850
How about this?

391
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,850
Let me ask my friend, okay?

392
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,250
Okay.

393
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,370
Thank you, An Yu.

394
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,020
I'll wait for your reply.

395
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,780
You're welcome. Bye.

396
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,820
Hello?

397
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,700
I have a favor

398
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,780
to ask of you.

399
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,300
Is it someone else's business?

400
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,730
I haven't told you what it is.

401
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,610
How did you know that?

402
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,610
Because you'd never

403
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,330
personally ask me for a favor.

404
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,780
So, is that a "yes"?

405
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,210
Be careful!

406
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,020
Can you concentrate while you're walking?

407
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,210
Why did you fall?

408
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,330
If the ground is slippery,

409
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,610
hold on to the handrail.

410
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,130
What if you

411
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,540
fall off the stairs?

412
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,210
I...

413
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,660
That overbearing character
didn't seem to suit me at all.

414
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,020
I'd better stick to

415
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,660
that helpful neighbor

416
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,300
character.

417
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,900
Let's go.

418
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,970
Are you all right?

419
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,420
I'm okay.

420
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,250
An'an.

421
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,090
I am really exhausted now.

422
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,060
Can we

423
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,020
postpone it...

424
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,420
No way.

425
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,450
We just finished our warm-up.

426
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,180
Our training is just about to begin.

427
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,420
We are very lucky to have

428
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
an all-around training partner with us today

429
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,700
to bear our burden.

430
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,850
Such an opportunity is hard to come by.

431
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,540
Therefore, don't miss

432
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,330
this golden opportunity.

433
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,300
Let's give it up for

434
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,540
our training partner.

435
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,490
Lift.

436
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,090
Okay.

437
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,610
I've never seen you dance before.

438
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,420
Both fists.

439
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,580
Use your

440
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,250
strength from below.

441
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,490
Come on. Straight punches.

442
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,370
Elbow strike.

443
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,610
Elbow strike.

444
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,700
Come on.

445
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,370
High kick.

446
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,090
I...

447
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:19,730
I'll do it for real.

448
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,250
Go ahead.

449
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,300
An'an.

450
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,660
Boxing is so much fun.

451
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,970
When are we doing it again?

452
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,450
You are quite energetic.

453
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,250
Am I right?

454
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,820
Besides, it can help release stress.

455
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,540
Yes.

456
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,020
An'an.

457
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,450
Your boyfriend isn't too bad.

458
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,780
Actually...

459
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,700
I admit you do have good taste.

460
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,130
Apart from his average looks,

461
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,580
the rest are pretty nice.

462
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm leaving now.

463
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,820
Bye.

464
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,370
Wait...

465
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,420
Average looks?

466
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,020
You clearly can't appreciate beauty.

467
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,700
Didn't you just say

468
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,330
that she had good taste moments ago?

469
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,490
All right.

470
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,330
I have to go too.

471
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,250
Where to?

472
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,850
To work.

473
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,450
We're not far away from the store.

474
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,730
But what time is it now?

475
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,060
It's almost time to get off work.

476
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,940
Why bother going back to work?

477
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,820
Mr. Shao.

478
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,210
I'm not like you.

479
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,700
I don't have financial and work freedom.

480
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,300
I have to work shifts.

481
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,940
Why don't

482
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,820
you accompany me for a while?

483
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,820
Sure.

484
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,060
Mr. Shao.

485
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,540
Can you please walk faster?

486
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,020
If we don't hurry,

487
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,940
my salary today will be deducted.

488
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,370
Mr. Zhang.

489
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,970
I'm aware of your request.

490
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,820
I'll discuss it with their lawyer in two days.

491
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,700
Keep in touch

492
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,540
for any updates.

493
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,850
Madam.

494
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,970
Are you in your 30s?

495
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,490
I'll be thirty-five next year.

496
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,250
How do you stay youthful?

497
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,940
What skincare products do you use?

498
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,300
-Recommend me.
-I'm getting old though.

499
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,370
Have you seen Zhou Yiyi's mother before?

500
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,250
She looks even more youthful.

501
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,780
Yiyi?

502
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,330
Do you mean Zhou Yiyi?

503
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:32,970
Yeah.

504
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,250
Of course, she's younger.

505
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,250
Don't you know about it?

506
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,330
About what?

507
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,020
She is a stepmother.

508
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,090
Of course, she's younger.

509
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,330
Do you mean

510
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,300
she's not Zhou Yiyi's biological mother?

511
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,250
How could that be?

512
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,780
To me, she seems very concerned about the child.

513
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,610
Yiyi.

514
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,370
Mom.

515
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,210
Hurry.

516
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,970
Dudu.

517
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,700
-Are you happy?
-Mom.

518
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,780
Mom,

519

Fine.

Ms. Xu,

697

can you stop talking nonsense?

698
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,820
They are just friends.

699

I'll go with her.

Why did you open a store here?

707

What are your purposes for doing so?

710
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,470
What if I say

711
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,140
that we won't compete with you?

712

713

I'm afraid, yes.

714

Let me ask you again nicely.

You can beg me to close it down.

735

And I will close it down.

736

Okay.

740

Deal.
