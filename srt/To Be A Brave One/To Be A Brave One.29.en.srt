[To Be A Brave One]

17
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 29]

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,800
Well?

19
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,120
Did you find it?

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,910
Zhou Yuan is Xiao Feng's son.

22
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,310
His real name is Xiao Yong.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,110
That means

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
An Yu's father

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
and Zhou Yuan's father

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,320
went way back.

27
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,360
According to information from that time,

28
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,030
An Yu's father pressed Zhou Yuan's father

29
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,550
to repay a debt
and the latter jumped off a building.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,160
After Zhou Yuan grew up,

31
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,360
he destroyed An Wenbin.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
How do you plan

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,240
to tell An Yu about this?

34
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,670
One more thing.

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,240
This is also related to An Yu.

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,630
When the three of them parted ways that year

37
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,160
and split Zhuoyue's shares into three,

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Lin Zhanhong held a portion,

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
and An Wenbin and Xiao Feng

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,910
became custodians of the shares.

41
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,910
However,

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,960
the expiry date is approaching.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Therefore, An Yu

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,750
also holds Zhuoyue's shares.

45
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,470
Zhou Yuan holds the same amount too.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,000
What exactly is Lin Zhanhong's intention?

47
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,720
Where are you going?

48
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,390
You exchanged Zhuoyue's shares

49
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,720
for the patent for smart desks.

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
There's more to this than meets the eye.

51
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,670
What are you trying to say?

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,040
Since the Smart Desk project
encounters problems,

53
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,440
you've started to act weird.

54
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,640
Not only did you take care of the issue yourself,

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,640
but you also agreed to He Shuo's demand
for a sky-high price.

56
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,600
However,

57
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,440
these happened precisely at a time
when An Yu and Zhou Yuan

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,510
inherited the shares

59
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,600
of Zhuoyue from their fathers.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,040
Looks like you know everything.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,640
How did you find out about this?

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,950
I told you

63
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,230
not to take advantage of An Yu's hatred.

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
I also said

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,510
that I must acquire Yimi,

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
but you wouldn't cooperate with me.

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,070
So I can only do it my way.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,350
You made An Yu approach Zhou Yuan

69
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,640
and made Zhou Yuan assume,

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,880
wrongly, that An Yu would sell her shares to him

71
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,040
so that he'd bet everything

72
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,160
to buy the shares that He Shuo held.

73
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,000
Why?

74
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,160
Why create this great setup

75
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,480
and even take the risk with Zhuoyue at stake?

76
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,200
Very simple.

77
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,110
Only one of us

78
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,510
can be the winner.

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
If I don't vanquish him now,

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
tomorrow he will vanquish me.

81
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
It's between you and him.

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
You shouldn't get An Yu involved.

83
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,160
Don't forget

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,350
that An Yu has the right to choose.

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
You know her well.

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,550
So you should know

87
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,320
how much she loves her father

88
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,040
and how much her father mattered to her.

89
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,070
Correct?

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,950
Unless you want to destroy his image in her mind,

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,070
you

92
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,830
should give her

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,160
the right to choose.

94
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,040
Understand?

95
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,760

that when he founded Zhuoyue,

99
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,320
he held 30 percent of the shares.

100
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,600
After he left Zhuoyue,

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,390
he left the shares to you.

102
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,600
He is extremely ambitious.

103
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
His next goal

104
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,350
is to swallow up Zhuoyue.

Mr. He,

173
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,320
you can ask your people to look into it.

174
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,670
I included the next five years
of Zhuoyue's incremental

176
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,350
Five years.

177
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,550
No one can say what will happen in five years.

178
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,960
If you sign it,

179
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
all your risks and concerns

180
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,440

181

Mr. He,

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
you are a smart businessman.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
You won't reject

184
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,230
such a lucrative deal.

185
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,840
I won't reject a good deal,

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200

187

188
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,880
He Shuo, you know what's the worth

189
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,000

190

206

207
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,230
