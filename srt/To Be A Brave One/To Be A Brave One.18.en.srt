When you get the test results the next day,

50
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,270
they would act all surprised and say,

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,390
"How did I get such a good grade?"

52

Yes. There are people like that.

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,880
She's from Zhuoyue Group.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,150
I think she is most probably here

174
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,110
to spy on us.

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
I don't need to do that.

176
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,910
I'm here to do a normal survey.

177
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,200
That's enough.

178
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,790
Can you see that?

179
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,520
It's all caught on surveillance.

180
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,030
Follow me to the security department,
then you can explain yourself.

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
There's no need for that.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
There must be a misunderstanding.

183
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,640
I...

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,670
I'm here to...

185
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,200
An Yu.

186
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,350
Mr. Ma.

187
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,520
What a coincidence.

188
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,960
It's been a really long time.

189
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,790
Exactly.

190
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,000
I know her.

191
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Ma.

192
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,150
You still look the same after all these years.

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,520
My age is catching up to me.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,350
I've heard about what happened

195
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,350
to your dad.

196
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm sorry

197
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,280
that I couldn't be of any help.

198
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,110
Don't beat yourself up.

199
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,150
If it wasn't for your dad's guidance,

200
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,840
I would probably have spent my entire life
working at the workshop.

201
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,670
I spoke to him once

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
not long before his passing.

203
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,670
At that time,

204
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,710
he was already very frail.

205
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,880
He said

206
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,110
you were what he worried the most about.

207
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,440
He said that he'd let you down.

208
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,910
Let's drop by and pay your dad a visit
when you're free.

209
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,880
Sure.

210
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,590
When my dad was working at the factory,

211
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,790
he always talked about you.

212
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,440
Even after he left Hongxin Telecom, he still said

213
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,080
that Mr. Ma was the wisest.

214
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,470
If the factory has a bright future,

215
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,790
you will definitely be the one planning it.

216
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,960
Let's pay him a visit when we're free.

217
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,440
Sure.

218
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,350
He'll definitely be happy to see us.

219
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,350
Sure.

220
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,230
Looking at you,

221
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,230
I know you must be doing pretty well.

222
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,200
In that case, An can rest assured.

223
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,440
By the way,

224
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,840
why are you here at Hongxin Telecom today?

225
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,910
You know I've been working at Zhuoyue, right?

226
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,110
Zhuoyue intends to acquire Hongxin Telecom.

227
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm here to do some research.

228
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,150
This factory

229
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,150
won't be able to last long.

230
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Its performance keeps deteriorating.

231
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,200
It has been mortgaged three times

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
over the past three years.

233
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,470
Don't worry.

234
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,910
Don't be shy to approach me

235
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,880
if you need any help.

236
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,030
I'm working at the factory.

237
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,030
It's not something worth mentioning,

238
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,350
but I've been here for many years.

239
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,000
I have earned myself more or less some respect.

240
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,840
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

241
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,840
Let's go.

242
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,200
[Zhuoyue Financial Group]
How did you verify the actual shipment quantity?

243
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,440
[Hongxin Telecom Project Team]
I visited Hongxin Telecom personally,

244
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,230
and it happened that
they were preparing their shipment.

245
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,520
I noted down every truck's capacity

246
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,150
and checked the number of trucks they owned.

247
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,550
I did a rough estimation based on that.

248
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,520
Rough estimation?

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,760
When I was at Hongxin Telecom,

250
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,910
I ran into some security guards.

251
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,710
Somehow,

252
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,350
they have been really strict recently.

253
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Therefore, I could only

254
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
tally the data
with an experienced staff of theirs.

255
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,440
According to them,

256
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,470
it should be...

257
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,230
about the same.

258
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,400
That means the data is more subjective

259
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,440
than accurate, right?

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,760
I don't want to hear

261
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
"rough", "should be", or any other similar terms.

262
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,840
We're acquiring a company.

263

We're not playing house.

264

265
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,550
You're right.

266

with the most accurate data.

I'll do it.

273
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,670
I said it on my first day.

in the same mode at work!

because of what Ms. Fang

286

did to you?

287
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,400
Obviously.

can bring warmth to others,

you never cried.

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,020
I heard

508
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,700
that they spent millions on the PR.

509
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,090
How extravagant.

510
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,940
Will they launch the application again
after they modify it?

511
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,490
I guess so.

512
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,020
As its loyal user,

513
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,180
what do you think about this?

514
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,450
How should I put it?

515
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,060
Personally,

516
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,900
I certainly hope

517
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,210
that Soul App can continue to thrive.

518
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,090
But remember this.

519
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,700
The Internet doesn't hold grudges.

520
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,330
As long as you can put it on track again,

521
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,330
people will forget about this very soon.

522
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,700
Su.

523
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,700
Have you forgotten

524
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,020
that you're still in Zhuoyue?

525
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,450
Of course I haven't.

526
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,450
It's just my analysis.

527
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,730
I think it makes a lot of sense.

528
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:18,979
It doesn't matter what happens in the future.

529
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,660
All we know is that
our rival embarrassed themselves today.

530
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,660
Mr. Lin is very pleased

531
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,490
and allowed all of us a paid day off.

532
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,090
Really?

533
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,850
Isn't that nice?

534
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,940
I need to thank Soul App for this.

535
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,090
That's for sure.

536
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
But I also think

537
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,090
that this off day...

538
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,060
Ms. Fang.

539
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:43,970
Don't worry.

540
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,090
Although it's an off day,

541
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,540
we won't slack off.

542
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,090
An Yu.

543
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,130
Get me a cup of coffee.

544
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,210
She gave me a scare.

545
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,330
Hey, bro!

546
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,330
Did I scare you?

547
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,610
I'm so scared. This is terrifying.

548
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,300
How boring.

549
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,900
What are you up to today?

550
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,730
What else can I do?

551
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,490
I need to work.

552
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,420
Then, now I'll speak as Lin's daughter.

553
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,090
I order you to take a day off.

554
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,250
Can you do that?

555
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,420
Okay.

556
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,420
What do you want?

557
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,210
I want to sketch faces.

558
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,850
You and Miss Yu will be my first project.

559
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,700
I want to learn about your stories.

560
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,490
Then, bring her here.

561
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,850
I want to hear it from you.

562
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Why me?

563
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,130
Because I noticed that you're into her.

564
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,250
The way you look at her

565
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,450
is different from the way you look at others.

566
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,090
Tell me.

567
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,420
I am curious.

568
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,820
Fine,

569
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,730
but

570
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,970
it's going to be a long story.

571
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,940
I'm all ears.

572
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,610
It all started when I was eight.

573
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,210
Wait.

574
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,900
Are we going to talk here?

575
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,660
If not, where?

576
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,330
I can't feel the story here.

577
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,730
Are there any meaningful places?

578
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,420
This place looks pretty good.

579
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,780
It's pretty good.

580
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,300
The inside looks even better.

581
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,060
We drew this when we were kids.

582
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,420
Did you draw this?

583
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,780
An Yu drew most of them.

584
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,780
Miss Yu?

585
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,370
How did you find this place?

586
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,450
It wasn't me.

587
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,490
It was An Yu who found this place.

588
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,580
More specifically,
she found this place 16 years ago.

589
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,090
16 years ago?

590
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,610
We're just in time for the sales.

591
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,090
I need to buy some good food for Ice Cream.

592
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,780
An'an, what's the matter?

593
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,660
Did you catch a cold?

594
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,730
I have no idea what happened either.

595
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,850
I think I'm fine.

596
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,130
I guess someone is missing you.

597
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,450
Perhaps Mr. Wolf is missing you.

598
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,060
An'an, what's your plan for tomorrow?

599
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,820
I need to clean the house.

600
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,210
I also need to study

601
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,900
for the Chartered Financial Analyst exam.

602
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,490
I'm so impressed by your determination, An'an.

603
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,780
You didn't manage to get much rest
in the past few days.

604
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,450
You're finally having a day off,

605
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,610
and you plan to spend the day studying at home.

606
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,700
I wouldn't do that.

607
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,300
I get sleepy every time I read.

608
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,610
Then, what should we do?

609
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,970
I don't know how to be strong,

610
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,780
but I'm thinking all the time.

611
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,060
Wait here.

612
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,580
To show you my moral support,

613
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,970
I'll buy you some mint.

614
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,700
This will keep you awake.

615
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,730
Thanks.

616
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,330
What are you doing tomorrow?

617
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,940
I'm going out with my friend tomorrow.

618
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,780
You have friends?

619
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,020
This is news to me.

620
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,090
We were from the same hometown.

621
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,370
He's here for a short trip.

622
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,700
I'm going to show him around.

623
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,610
You know what happened later.

624
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,900
I joined Zhuoyue and we became colleagues.

625
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,730
Look at the sky, and you can climb up.

626
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,900
I love this phrase a lot.

627
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,660
We have been friends for a long time.

628
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,730
Why had you never told me anything
about your childhood?

629
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,060
I have no idea either.

630
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,450
It just never crossed my mind to bring it up.

631
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,610
You're really lucky

632
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,940
that you ran into each other again.

633
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,060
Why didn't you tell everyone about this?

634
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,090
Because

635
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,730
we're not a couple yet.

636
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,540
We discussed this matter before,

637
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,610
but it wasn't a pleasant discussion.

638
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,450
Now, I only want to respect her.

639
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,420
I'll stay with her while she does what she wants.

640
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,130
So...

641
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,370
You'll always be there for her?

642
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,970
You'll keep waiting for her?

643
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,330
If...

644
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,780
Just if.

645
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,130
What if

646
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,180
she never accepts you?

647
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,650
Then, I'll keep waiting.

648
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,530
Why?

649
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,580
What is that?

650
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,220
I'm moved by your story.

651
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,060
If that's the case,

652
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,130
did the story contribute anything

653
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,740
to your drawing?

654
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,370
If I want to draw a nice painting,

655
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,940
I can't listen to only your side of the story.

656
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,130
I need Miss Yu to tell me
her side of the story too.

657
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,010
Okay.

658
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,220
Hello?

659
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,770
Moli.

660
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,940
Are you free tonight?

661
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,130
Let's have dinner together.

662
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,410
We need to talk.

663
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,250
Sure.

664
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,170
Do you want to come with me to meet your dad?

665
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,740
You go ahead.

666
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,890
I'm going to be bored when you talk about work.

667
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,010
I have important things to do.

668
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,980
This is amazing.

669
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,340
Drinking this duck soup

670
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,410
makes me forget all my worries.

671
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,650
Yun.

672
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,770
You look really good recently.

673
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,130
Did anything good happen?

674
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,370
Lailai.

675
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,740
Have you noticed

676
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,010
that since Yun came back from Yunnan,

677
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,890
she fell in love with cooking?

678
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,770
She is so different from before,

679
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,770
when all she wanted was the freedom
to do whatever she wanted.

680
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,970
You're right.

681
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
You know me the best.

682
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,530
Something happened.

683
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,930
My goodness.

684
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,900
He is the one.

685
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,060
Who is he?

686
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,420
He's quite handsome.

687
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,490
He's a young man.

688
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,490
He

689
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,730
is slightly younger than I expected,

690
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,140
but

691
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,690
after some thinking,

692
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,250
I think women

693
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,770
should live a memorable life

694
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,010
and live for themselves.

695
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,900
Right?

696
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,930
I don't want

697
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,340
to give myself a to-do list.

698
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,140
Instead,

699
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,660
I want to make a not-to-do list.

700
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,290
There are too many things

701
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,100
we need to do in our lives.

702
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,860
We might not even be able

703
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,420
to complete all of them,

704
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,860
but

705
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,970
it's not easy to come by

706
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,210
a person who suits you well.

707
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,450
I thought

708
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,060
it would be a pity

709
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,450
if I miss him.

710
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,930
The duck soup tastes so good.

711
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,730
Should I send texts to the two boys

712
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,180
and invite them over too?

713
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,620
I was on the phone with Kai.

714
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,060
He is working overtime.

715
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,290
I'll go and help him

716
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,380
after I finished the soup.

717
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,420
Sure.

718
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:46,690
I...

719
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,100
Let me send Shao Moli a text.

720
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,010
Typing is too slow.

721
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,380
It's going to be a long text.

722
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,970
It lacks emotion.

723
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,930
Just send him a voice message.

724
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,690
That's right.

725
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,690
Shao Moli.

726
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,530
Yun

727
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,730
cooked some duck soup today.

728
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,580
It's delicious.

729
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,660
Where are you now?

730
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,770
Do you want to try some?

731
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:10,970
Shao Moli.

732
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,770
Yun

733
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,060
cooked some duck soup today.

734
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,970
It's delicious.

735
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,930
Where are you now?

736
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,210
Do you want to try some?

737
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,140
I'm going to have dinner with Lin tonight.

738
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,730
Enjoy your soup.

739
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,490
I can't make it today.

740
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,140
I'm going to have dinner with Lin tonight.

741
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,900
Enjoy your soup.

742
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,290
He can't make it today.

743
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,730
What a pity.

744
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,250
Yun.

745
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,420
Let's save some for him.

746
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:48,930
An'an,

747
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,380
did you notice

748
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,250
that Yun is getting
prettier and prettier recently?

749
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,140
Love is indeed the best cosmetic.

750
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,530
I'll play some music.

751
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,450
Sure.

752
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,490
Lailai.

753
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,450
I noticed that you're getting
prettier and prettier.

754
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,060
That's not true.

755
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,620
Let's finish every drop of the soup. Don't waste it.
