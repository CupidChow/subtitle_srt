509
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,140
I'm quite disappointed.

510
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,900
Mr. He.

511
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,620
Please be patient.

512
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,250
Regrettably, we also found out

513
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,380
that Wei'er Hotel has made up
multiple fraudulent data,

514
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,450
including their occupancy rates
and many other figures.

515
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,530
Let's take a look at this comparison chart.

516
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,380
This is the real daily occupancy rate
of Wei'er Hotel,

517
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,660
and this is the reported occupancy rate.

518
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,380
It's doubled.

519
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,290
In other words,

520
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,820
more than half of the traffic

521
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,140
was made up

522
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,290
by Wei'er Hotel.

523
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,660
I guess

524
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,820
if this news is leaked,

525
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,730
we might not be able to proceed
with the acquisition.

526
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,060
The Securities Regulatory Commission
might also need to carry out an investigation.

527
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,250
By the time,

528
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,250
a brand that was built by two generations
across 27 years

529
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,210
will turn into a subject of public scrutiny.

530
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,060
Not only will you lose your reputation

531
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,100
and the public's trust,

532
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,340
but you will also cause turmoil,

533
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,860
resulting in the withdrawal of shareholders,

534
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
or even the closure of the hotel.

535
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,860
I'm sure Mr. He doesn't want
any of those to happen.

536
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,900
Miss An, right?

537
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,060
If it weren't for Mr. Shao,

538
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,860
I can sue you for defamation.

539
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,770
You have the right to do that.

540
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,730
Let me continue.

541
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,420
We also found

542
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,490
the daily towel usage

543
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,290
and the laundry bill for the past two months.

544
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
We did a calculation

545
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,380
and noticed that the data tallies

546
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,770
with the data we found on online travel agencies.

547
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Where did you get these data?

548
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,380
This is illegal.

549
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,450
It's a crime.

550
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,210
What's your name?

551
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,860
An what?

552
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,580
An Yu.

553
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,490
Miss An Yu.

554
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,620
Do you know what I hate the most?

555
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,970
I hate it when others blackmail me.

556
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,620
You bet that I'd be scared, huh?

557
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,290
I can give you the result now.

558
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,970
Mr. He.

559
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,970
An Yu doesn't know you well,

560
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,900
but I

561
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,450
know you very well.

562
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,970
Alright.

563
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,620
It was a very successful roadshow.

564
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,620
Let's pack up and head back.

565
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,490
Mr. He has understood

566
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,060
everything we wanted to say,

567
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,210
and all the messages we intended to deliver.

568
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,380
We shall allow Mr. He some time

569
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,930
to think about it.
