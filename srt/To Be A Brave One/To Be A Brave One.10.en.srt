[Episode 10]

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,720
Have you ever thought about
what you will do

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,550
if An Yu calls the police?

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,400
So, did Mr. Fu break the news to you?

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,400
Lulu,

22
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,480
I remember we agreed

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,040
that we have to be honest with each other

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,510
no matter what happens, right?

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,910
Fine.

26
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,550
Let's do it.

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,310
I'll be honest with you then.

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,240
I didn't break the news to you

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,750
because I thought it was unnecessary.

30
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,470
I didn't want to implicate you in it.

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,520
You didn't break the news to me

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,390
because you knew

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,030
that I wouldn't agree to it.

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,000
You're aware of how important

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yiyi is to me.

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,910
I cannot afford to lose that child.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Lulu,

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
I always said

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,160
that I would protect this family.

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
I said I would protect Yiyi

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
and you.

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,910
Why do you say that we're losing Yiyi?

43
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,520
Ever since An Yu was released from prison,

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,910
she has been harassing us from time to time.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
It got worse every time she came.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,030
Now, she has joined Zhuoyue.

47
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,030
It's obvious that she's here

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,110
to steal Yiyi's custody from me.

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Did you know how many times
I'd mentioned this issue to you?

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,190
Was it resolved?

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,110
No, it wasn't.

52
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,270
Now, things have taken a turn for the worse!

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
However, have you ever
thought of the consequences

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,390
if you did so?

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
What consequences?

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,320
Are you referring to her or me?

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,270
Of course, it's you.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,110
Are you questioning me right now?

59
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,910
I'm not questioning you.

60
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,390
I just want to resolve the issue.

61
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,550
After Mr. Fu left, he told me

62
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,830
that An Yu insisted on calling the police.

63
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,600
Everything will be too late

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
if she calls the police on you,

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,240
do you know that?

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,000
Just let her do it.

67
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,240
Let her call the police on me then!

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
I understand An Yu well.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
If she says she's going to call the police,

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
she will surely do so.

71
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,360
By then,

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,190
you'll face dire consequences.

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,880
I'm sure you know that well

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
since you're a lawyer.

75
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,670
Let me talk to her,

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,320
okay?

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,030
Talk to her?

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,960
How?

79
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,630
Will you beg her?

80
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,470
Or will you threaten her?

81
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,000
The method doesn't matter

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,830
as long as she doesn't call the police

83
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,520
and implicate you in all this!

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,950
Kai,

85
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,830
call Lailai

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,950
and tell her to join us for a feast.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,390
Who are you calling Kai?

88
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,550
She's not answering.

89
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,390
Let's look for her in the branch then.

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go.

91
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,720
She insists on calling the police?

92
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,550
I think that's pretty good.

93
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,230
Mr. Zhou is here.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,550
Mr. Zhou.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,550
Nice to meet you.

96
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,830
I'm here to handle
the fund embezzlement issue

97
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,790
on behalf of my wife, Mi Lu.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,830
Let me talk to An Yu.

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,350
Mr. Zhou,

100
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,600
it's best

101
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,160
if you can make things clear

102
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,040
and settle them out of court.

103
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,720
After all,

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,790
it won't benefit anyone
if things get out of hand.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,230
It'll affect Zhuoyue's reputation too.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,350
I will try my best.

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,440
Do you need us to accompany you?

108
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,920
I don't think so.

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,040
I think it would be easier to resolve the issue

110
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,480
if I talk to her in private.

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,270
Is there a surveillance camera in the room?

112
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,790
Yes.

113
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,670
Can you please deactivate it?

114
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,830
Mr. Jiang.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,550
Okay then.

116
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,160
I'll head inside then.

117
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,920
You haven't eaten anything yet, right?

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,320
Do you need me to grab you something?

119
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,760
Once the internal investigation is over,

120
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,790
I'll surely call the police on her.

121
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,600
It's been four years.

122
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,830
This is our first time

123
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,830
sitting together at the same table

124
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,550
and having a proper conversation.

125
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,070
Maybe this is the last chance

126
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,390
for us to have a conversation like this.

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,390
Can we have a chat?

128
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,040
This is Mi Lu's fault.

129
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,480
It's because she became paranoid

130
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,830
ever since you were released from prison.

131
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,320
She was truly afraid of losing Yiyi.

132
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,510
That's why she did such a silly thing.

133
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,000
It's all my fault.

134
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,040
I deserve it

135
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,600
no matter how much you hate me

136
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,230
or blame me for it.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,830
Are you done?

138
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,880
If so, you may leave now.

139
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,950
Mi Lu will be done for

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,830
if you call the police on her.

141
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,200
I know you might be upset

142
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,920
after hearing what I'm about to say.

143
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,920
However, Mi Lu has raised Yiyi for four years.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,950
To Yiyi,

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,510
Mi Lu is already his mother.

146
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,270
She wouldn't have done so

147
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,720
if she truly considered Yiyi's feelings!

148
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
Is she afraid now?

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
If she's afraid,

150
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,350
tell her to see me personally.

151
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,910
I know.

152
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,550
I have no right to beg you here.

153
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,400
I know I'm nothing

154
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,200
to you.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,670
But Yiyi is still a kid.

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,110
I will tell him everything

157
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,550
when he grows up.

158
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,590
But can you please allow Yiyi

159
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,910
to have a complete family before then?

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,280
If Mi Lu were arrested,

161
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,280
Yiyi wouldn't be able to accept it

162
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,320
if he couldn't find his mother
all of a sudden.

163
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,000
Fine.

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,030
I won't call the police on her.

165
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,080
However, I have to know the truth.

166
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,350
That's my bottom line.

167
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,150
Thank you.

168
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,440
Thank you.

169
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,590
An Yu,

170
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880

What else do you want?

342
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,550
Did you apologize to her?

343
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,340
Who told you to apologize to her on my behalf?

344
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,550
What have I done wrong?

345
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,710
Why did you apologize to her?

346
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,590
I know.

347
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,790
I know you did nothing wrong.

348
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,830
I just wanted to make concessions
to avoid trouble, okay?

349
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,310
I ran out of choices.

350
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,190
If she insists on keeping quiet,

351
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,790
you should know the consequences

352
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,830
since you're a lawyer yourself.

353
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,740
I'm sure you know how dire the consequences are.

354
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,070
Your future will be ruined!

355
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,790
Did you know that?

356
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,500
Why were you so reckless?

357
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,430
It's because I know better than anyone else

358
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,070
that An Yu has the right

359
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,910
to take Yiyi away from me!

360
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,790
I've raised Yiyi for several years.

361
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,790
But this woman,

362
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,910
she can steal my child away from me at any time.

363
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,830
I feel anxious!

364
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,860
I feel insecure.

365
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,670
Sometimes,

366
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,260
I can't even sleep

367
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,430
when I think about that fact.

368
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,620
I suffer from insomnia.

369
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,590
Zhou Yuan, let me ask you this.

370
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,430
Why should I suffer like this?

371
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,950
Listen.

372
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,260
Even if the entire world is accusing me

373
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,460
for being wrong right now,

374
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,550
you must never do it.

375
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,220
Am I wrong for reproaching you?

376
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,950
You are wrong in the first place!

377
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,340
Do you think I'm trying
to reason with you right now?

378
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,500
I only want my husband

379
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,950
to stand by me

380
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,340
even after I've committed a mistake!

381
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,740
You must side with me!

382
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,140
Lulu?

383
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,500
Lulu, where are you going?

384
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,190
I'll spend the night in the law firm.

385
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,670
I don't feel like staying here.

386
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,070
Mister,

387
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,430
have you seen this girl

388
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,830
at around 8 PM on the 19th?

389
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Mister,

390
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,220
have you seen this girl

391
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,550
at around 8 PM on the 19th?

392
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,380
Thank you.

393
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,980
Thank you.

394
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,260
Excuse me.

395
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,140
I have something to ask you two.

396
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,460
Have you guys

397
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,910
seen this person before?

398
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,980
No, we haven't.

399
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,740
No.

400
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,550
Alright, thank you.

401
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,310
You...

402
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,070
Mister!

403
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
Mister!

404
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,860
I've been waiting for you the entire night.

405
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,980
You're finally here.

406
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,860
I've already asked all the shops around here.

407
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,220
Your shop is the only one left.

408
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,070
Do you want to buy something?

409
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,670
That's not it.

410
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,140
I wanted to ask you

411
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,100
if you had seen this girl

412
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,030
together with an old lady

413
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,220
at around 8 PM

414
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,830
on the 19th?

415
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,140
They were waiting for a bus
at the bus stop opposite here.

416
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,190
No, I haven't.

417
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,100
Are you sure?

418
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,860
Try to recall again.

419
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,910
Mister,

420
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
I can recall something

421
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,070
if you give me something in return.

422
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,140
I'll give you 1,000 yuan.

423
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,430
1,000 yuan?

424
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,260
If it's not enough,

425
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,910
I'll even buy all of your goods.

426
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,340
I'll even buy your car too.

427
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,380
My car

428
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,140
is imported, you know?

429
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,100
It's not cheap.

430
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,550
When was the last time you drove it?

431
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,590
Last Tuesday.

432
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,460
I parked it here after I unloaded my goods.

433
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,190
Although it looks dirty outside,

434
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,670
it's clean inside.

435
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,190
Mister,

436
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,030
I'll sell it to you at a cheaper price
if you're sincere in buying it.

437
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,910
What time did you buy your goods last Tuesday?

438
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,140
I remember that it was already dark

439
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,620
when I was back here.

440
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,310
I think

441
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,860
it was around 7 PM

442
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,550
Or 8 PM, I guess.

443
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,740
Did you install a dashcam in your car?

444
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,340
Of course.

445
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,380
I just installed it recently.

446
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,710
It has 512 GB worth of free space.

447
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,310
It has

448
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,860
plenty of free space.

449
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,740
Mister,

450
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,950
can you please show me your dashcam footage?

451
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,620
I'm begging you.

452
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,790
You want to take a look?

453
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,430
Fine.

454
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,980
Go ahead.

455
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,860
Thank you.

456
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,950
An'an, you're awake?

457
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,030
Lailai, how did I end up here?

458
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,380
Mr. Wolf rescued you

459
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,430
from them last night. Did you forget?

460
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,500
He rescued me?

461
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,550
Yeah.

462
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,310
Well...

463
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,100
Where is he then?

464
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,430
He's off investigating your case.

465
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,310
And he's out for the entire night.

466
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Just now, he called Ye Kai to join him.

467
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,260
I'll go and look for him.

468
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,140
No way.

469
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,710
You haven't recovered yet.

470
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,710
You shouldn't get out of bed.

471
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,070
Don't worry.

472
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,710
I heard that he had found evidence.

473
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,380
He'll be fine as long as

474
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,380
he can prove your innocence.

475
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,310
Well...

476
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,430
What will happen to him if he doesn't?

477
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,070
He's fine, isn't he?

478
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Yeah.

479
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,070
Come on. Don't worry.

480
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,070
He'll be fine

481
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,950
as long as you're fine.

482
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,710
It's only a huge deal to him

483
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,670
when you're in trouble.

484
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,670
Here.

485
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,030
Finish the porridge.

486
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,430
You should recuperate here.

487
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,710
Try it.

488
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,100
I don't really remember

489
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,590
what happened last night.

490
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,550
I think I fainted.

491
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,860
After that, Mr. Yang and Mr. Fu...

492
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,550
Wait a second.

493
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,670
Why did they agree to release me?

494
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,790
The investigation was already in progress.

495
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,220
We could sue them for unlawful detention

496
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,910
if they kept detaining you like that.

497
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,860
Now, you just need to rest here

498
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,740
and wait for Mr. Wolf's good news.

499
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,430
Have another bite.

500
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:43,425
[Dashcam]

501
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,980
The transaction on Mi Lu's account

502
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,100
was made at 19:55:54 on the 18th.

503
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,910
On the same night, An Yu appeared at a bus stand 

504
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,860
which was 1.4 km away from Chuanhe Branch

505
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,380
at 19:56:03.

506
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,860
Both events were less than 10 seconds apart
from each other.

507
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,380
Unless An Yu is Superwoman herself,

508
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,740
if not,

509
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,670
I don't think we need
to give you guys an explanation here.

510
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,220
Everyone,

511
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,950
please clear An Yu's name for her.

512
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,670
Mr. Shao,

513
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,710
I hope you can provide
the original footage to us.

514
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,460
We need the unedited version

515
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,620
and the name of the dashcam owner.

516
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,590
No problem.

517
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,030
Both the original footage
and the dashcam owner are downstairs.

518
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,430
We will give An Yu

519
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,310
an explanation

520
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,140
after we verify the validity of the footage.

521
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,100
But why?

522
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,220
It's just footage from a dashcam.

523
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,670
Can he prove An Yu's innocence
with that footage alone?

524
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,740
Isn't that enough?

525
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,910
How do you explain the security token then?

526
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,980
Also,

527
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,380
the surveillance camera was turned off

528
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,310
and the transaction was made
on An Yu's computer.

529
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,740
In my opinion,

530
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,790
even if the footage is valid,

531
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,190
that could only prove

532
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,980
that An Yu didn't do the deed herself.

533
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,950
I think

534
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,140
An Yu might have an accomplice here.

535
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,710
An Yu created an alibi on purpose

536
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,460
so that we wouldn't suspect her.

537
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,550
That's right.

538
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,380
Xu Jingya took the words right out of my mouth.

539
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
This case is very complicated.

540
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,980
Just one footage alone isn't enough.

541
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,950
We have to

542
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,340
continue the investigation.

543
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,460
Mr. Shao,

544
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,100
you're running out of time.

545
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,710
You mustn't bite it!

546
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,620
Stop biting it!

547
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,790
-Spit it out!
-(I swear)

548
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,380
(on my career that...)

549
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,260
Lailai.

550
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,430
(I will prove An Yu's innocence...)

551
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,550
Have you watched this?

552
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,460
(within 24 hours.)

553
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,310
If not,

554
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,460
I'll quit the finance industry.

555
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,070
I have.

556
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,500
Mr. Wolf was flustered back then.

557
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,790
He just wanted to rescue you.

558
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,430
Even so, he shouldn't have

559
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,590
made such a stupid promise
with his career at stake.

560
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,790
An'an, just calm down.

561
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,500
Ice Cream.

562
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,860
Come, get over here.

563
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,670
Come back.

564
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,550
Come back.

565
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,380
He didn't answer my call
or reply to my messages.

566
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,860
Where is he?

567
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,430
The time limit will be up soon.

568
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,860
Lailai,

569
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,100
why don't you ask Kai for me?

570
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,830
Sure.

571
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,950
I'll make a call for you then.

572
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,950
Ice Cream, be good.

573
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,140
I'll go and get my phone.

574
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,670
Why did you call me here?

575
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,070
Are you sure you want to shout at me?

576
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,740
Wait.

577
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,910
What exactly are you up to?

578
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,910
I have nothing to do with An Yu's case.

579
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,070
Don't be nervous.

580
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,740
I didn't say that you
were related to An Yu's case.

581
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,220
You!

582
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,910
Mr. Shao,

583
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,590
you have to trust me.

584
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,220
I'm innocent.

585
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,190
Of course, I trust you.

586
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,500
If not, I wouldn't have called you here.

587
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,620
Since you're so anxious,

588
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,070
I'll cut it short.

589
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,950
I could tell that there was something
between you and Jiang Haoran

590
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,590
from the first day you joined Zhuoyue.

591
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,430
Due to him

592
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,460
and some conflicts at work,

593
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,790
you became hostile toward An Yu.

594
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,910
After that, Mi Lu went to you.

595
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,910
She persuaded you to join hands with her
to deal with An Yu.

596
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,460
A common enemy

597
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,550
and the benefits Mi Lu had promised you

598
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,190
motivated you

599
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,260
to move to a remote area like Chuanhe.

600
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,430
You followed An Yu to Chuanhe

601
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,710
and became the branch manager

602
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,500
just so

603
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,460
you could stage yesterday's act,

604
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,380
am I right?

605
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,950
Mr. Shao,

606
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,550
I don't understand what you're saying.

607
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,550
I didn't hold any grudges against An Yu.

608
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,070
I think you misunderstood me.

609
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,910
You see,

610
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,910
I always separate public affairs
from private affairs.

611
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,980
I told you already.

612
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,980
I do trust you.

613
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,790
I'm sure you couldn't come up with
such a devious plot.

614
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm also sure that you don't hate An Yu that much.

615
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,710
It was because Mi Lu deluded you.

616
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,550
Mi Lu was the one who gave you the cipher.

617
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,740
Mi Lu was the one who gave you
the time, location, and date

618
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,830
for you to do the transaction.

619
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,190
And I'm sure Mi Lu also told you

620
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,860
to say those words during today's meeting,

621
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,460
am I right?

622
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,620
Mr. Shao,

623
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,260
now that time 

624
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,380
is running out,

625
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,220
you're trying to push the blame on me

626
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,030
because you don't know the truth.

627
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,740
I don't think this is appropriate of you.

628
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,380
Xu Jingya,

629
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,830
you and I had worked together before.

630
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,070
Since when have you seen me

631
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,550
engaging in an unprepared battle before?

632
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,420
When you were being interrogated
by the Internal Audit Department,

633
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,110
you said you were together
with your bosom friend, Selina,

634
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,900
at around 8 PM on the 19th.

635
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,780
You were daring enough to say that

636
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,630
because you guys were in cahoots.

637
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,420
But Xu Jingya,

638
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,230
you've overestimated your friendship.

639
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,350
You've overestimated your intelligence too.

640
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,500
You used her to harm someone

641
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,300
while she used you to secure a date.

642
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,230
You two are great bosom friends indeed.

643
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm so jealous. I wish for such a friendship.

644
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Shao Moli!

645
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,830
What exactly are you up to?

646
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,140
Why did you investigate me?

647
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,750
Why are you helping An Yu?

648
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,990
Why am I helping An Yu?

649
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,300
I wish I could tell you why.

650
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,900
But I don't feel like doing it.

651
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,470
Mr. Shao,

652
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,590
your story is very interesting.

653
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
I'm done listening to it.

654
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,020
Xu Jingya has left the lobby.

655
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,540
What did you tell her?

656
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,590
Her expression seems weird.

657
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,990
I told her everything.

658
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,220
You told her everything?

659
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,150
Why did you alert her to our presence?

660
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,740
How could I lure out the mastermind

661
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,460
without any bait?

662
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,390
Didn't I tell you

663
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,540
not to call me at this time?

664
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,630
Mi Lu,

665
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,190
we're in trouble.

666
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,780
Shao Moli knows everything!

667
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,590
He's found out that my alibi is fake!

668
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,390
What should we do?

669
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,670
Meet me at Swan Hill Park

670
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
in half an hour.

671
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,500
Okay.

672
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,870
What exactly did you tell Shao Moli?

673
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,150
Nothing.

674
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,500
I told him nothing.

675
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,590
From now on,

676
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,300
you need to cut off all contact with me.

677
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,980
Delete our conversation in WeChat
and my contact number.

678
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,780
By the way,

679
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,390
you should delete your cache as well.

680
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,780
Mi Lu, what do you mean by this?

681
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,500
Are you leaving me in the lurch?

682
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,830
I told you already.

683
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,540
Shao Moli knows that my alibi is fake.

684
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,500
Tell me then.

685
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,390
How should I explain myself if he asks

686
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,870
the Internal Audit Department
to investigate me again?

687
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,670
Just explain yourself to them in a nice way.

688
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,630
Good luck.

689
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,300
Shao Moli was right.

690
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,020
I was a fool

691
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,500
for trusting you.

692
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,260
However, Mi Lu,

693
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,670
I'm not as dumb as you think.

694
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,870
I've recorded all of our conversations.

695
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,190
Listen,

696
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,910
we're on the same boat right now.

697
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,590
If you leave me in the lurch,

698
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,590
we can perish together.

699
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,150
Since you've recorded them,

700
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,590
you should listen to them again.

701
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,070
What I had told you

702
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,980
was a story of my friend's.

703
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,910
I only gave you my opinions
and some useful suggestions.

704
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,940
You should listen to them again.
