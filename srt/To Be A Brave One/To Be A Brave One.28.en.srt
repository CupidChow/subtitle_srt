Here is Xiao Feng's information.

361
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,670
He

362
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,620
was one of the founders of Zhuoyue.

363
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,670
Lin Zhanhong, An Wenbin, and him

364
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,260
were good friends.

365
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,310
However, perhaps it was due to
ideological differences,

366
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,830
they split.

367
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,100
Lin Zhanhong stayed with Zhuoyue

368
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,860
while Xiao Feng and An Wenbin

369
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,550
founded their own company.

370
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,830
It doesn't make sense.

371

They had a good beginning.

372
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,620
Why would he jump to his death?

373
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,740
I can't find a lot of information
about what came after.

374
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,140
Apparently, Xiao Feng

375
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,950
was quite a bold investor.

376
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,860
His first two investments turned sour

377
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,620
and then for some reason,

378
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,910
he went insane

379
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,500
and put all his money into the stock market.

380
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,830
He even

381
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,260
turned to loansharks to take out
a leveraged loan for thrice his debt.

382
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,670
Then you know what happened.

383
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,140
But it's not this simple either.

384
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,140

386
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,070
The same day Xiao Feng threw himself off the roof,

387
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,100
An Yu's father, An Wenbin,

388
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,980
came with a bunch of debt collectors
to demand repayment.

389
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,590
It's almost the same time he jumped off the roof.

390
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,260
Did Xiao Feng

391
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,220
have a family?

392
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,140
He was married

393
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,550
and had a son.

394
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,950
But his wife wasn't

395
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,980
in good health.

396
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,100
Shortly after

397
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,190
he committed suicide,

398
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,100
his wife died from her sickness.

399
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
What about his son?

400
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,260
I couldn't find anything about his son.

401
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,860
I even went to the local orphanage

402

516
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,500
was so different from what it used to be.

517
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,140
Actually,

518
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
today is my father's birthday.

519
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,590
I want to use this victory to tell him

520
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,500
that her daughter has moved on.

521
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,950
But it's okay

522
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,950
even if I lost.

523
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,500
He already knows his daughter did her best.

524
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,500
You got out of it.

525
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,350
The outcome doesn't matter anymore.

526
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,780
So

527
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,900
this is why this competition means a lot to you?

528
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,110
Yes.

529
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,500
What about you?

530
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,300
Didn't you say

531
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,710
the same thing too?

532
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,350
I

533
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,590
have an important decision

534
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,380
to make.

535
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,660
I want to use this competition

536
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,350
to find courage.

537
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,260
I believe you can do it.

538
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,020
All the best!

539
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,020
You too.

540
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,390
Hello?

541
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,020
Zhou Yuan is out.

542
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,260
Okay. Noted.

543
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,430
I have an important business to attend to.

544
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,980
Why don't you head back and rest up?

545
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
I'll go back then.
