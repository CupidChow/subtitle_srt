Mi Lu loves me.

173
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,470
Yiyi is also obedient.

174
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,960
Logically speaking,

175
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
I shouldn't ask for anything else.

176
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,710
But don't worry.

177
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm working hard.

178
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,470
I'll definitely let you two rest in peace.

179
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,520
Did Mi Lu ask you to come here?

180
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,440
No, Mr. Zhou...

181
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,200
Enough.

182
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,470
Can you see what this place is?

183
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,760
Mr. Zhou.

184
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,710

189
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,790
You've been waiting for me?

190
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,200
Yiyi fell asleep.

191
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,670
He chose this cake for you.

192
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,590
Make a wish.

193
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,550
I don't know what to wish for.

194
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
Help me.

195
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,710
Let's do it together.

196
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,520
Okay.

197
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,710
I wish

198
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
for Zhou Yuan's wish

199
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
to come true.

200
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,760
Come.

201
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,280
Come.

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Please take a seat.

203
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,790
Okay.

204
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,700
Did you make them all?

205
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,140
Try it.

206
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm not good at cooking.

207
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,500
I gave it a try.

208
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,700
Okay.

209
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,030
It's delicious.

210
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,430
Your expression already betrayed you.

211
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,940
Is it not nice?

212
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,580
No.

213
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,260
It's delicious.

214
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,070
Oh,

215
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,620
I'm going to Singapore
for a business trip tomorrow.

216
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,100
Do you want to go with me?

217
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,500
Let's have a trip

218
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,910
and do something else for a change.

219
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,550
There are too many meetings at the company.

220
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
I can't leave.

221
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,380
Besides,

222
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,860
Ms. Chen is not around.

223
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,100
I should take care of Yiyi at home.

224
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,740
Fine.

225
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,100
I'll continue eating.

226
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,340
I'm starving.

227
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,260
(I'm grateful for all the things
you've done for me in the past.)

228
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,860
(But I hope all of this)

229
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,590
(stops now.)

230
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,860
Why?

231
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,380
(You deserve better.)

232
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,220
(Can you answer me?)

233
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,620
What is the obstacle between us?

234
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,860
(Life is long.)

235
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,310
(People don't grow old so quickly.)

236
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,190
(Life is difficult when there isn't love.)

237
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,860
(Both of us know this well.)

238
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,830
Have you ever had any feelings for me?

239
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
(Isn't the thing)

240
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,140
(that should be recorded most)

241
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,500
in life

242
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,460
this love-filled radiance?

243
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,620
(I've never seen him)

244
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,100
(looking at someone)

245
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,910
(the way he looks at you.)

246
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,910
His eyes are filled with love,

247
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,220
radiance,

248
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,830
and warmth.

249
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,620
(I believe you can feel it.)

250
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,590
(I like you, An Yu.)

251
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,340
I want to tell you my thoughts

252
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,070
and my feelings
