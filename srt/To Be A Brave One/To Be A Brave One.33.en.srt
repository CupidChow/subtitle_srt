[Episode 33]

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Thank you

19
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,360
for staying in the company.

20
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,470
Some time ago,

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
a lot

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
happened

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,000
to Yimi Capital and me.

24
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,880
I...

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,800
wish to apologize to you

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,720
for letting you down.

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,390
I wanted to bring good news to the company,

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
but...

29
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,360
Sorry.

30
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,240
Thank you

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,390
for your contributions to the company.

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,000
I hope you are proud of yourself.

33
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,240
At the same time,

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm also

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,630
proud about my decision.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,630
Running a company

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,910
is one of the missions I have in my life,

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
but

39
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,320
I made mistakes.

40
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,270
I am responsible.

41
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,830
So, in the remaining days,

42
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,390
I can't be with you.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,190
I must stop

44
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,830
and ponder over some issues.

45
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,600
If, according to the company's accounting group,

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,110
there is remaining money in our account,

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,630
I'll pay everyone the severance pay.

48
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,240
Over here,

49
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,030
I sincerely wish

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,830
that you face yourself and your life

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
bravely.

52
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,030
Thank you.

53

Beginning tomorrow,

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
this will belong to someone else.

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
You lost this home because of me.

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,350
Sorry.

57
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,390
Don't say sorry.

58
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,670
It doesn't matter.

59
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,350
We only lost

60
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,720
this house

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
and this courtyard.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,790
To begin with,

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,230
we don't belong here.

64
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,200
Home is where the family is,

65
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,670
with the three of us.

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760

You can sign it.

68
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,550
I won't.

69
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't leave you now.

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,510
You should find someone better.

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,790
I don't deserve you.

72
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,070
There is no one better.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,600
After going through so many things all our life,

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,000
why are you talking about deserving or not,

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Zhou Yuan?

76
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,440
I don't care what you say,

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,830
or what you want to do today,

78
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,320
I won't let go.

79
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,320
I won't leave you at this juncture.

80
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,790
We cannot start over as we wish.

81
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,480
I made a mistake.

82
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,760
I have to face the consequences, understand?

83
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,320
You can do that

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,920
with me by your side.

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,000
From childhood to adulthood,

86
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,830
we had undertaken so many things together.

87
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,230
Don't keep thinking you made a mistake

88
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,480
and push me aside.

89
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,270
I can face it with you.

90
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,950
As long as we stay together,

91
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,110
we can start over

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
and get through it. Okay?

93
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,640
Mi Lu,

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,760
don't you understand?

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,670
The person I loved for so many years wasn't you.

96
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,480
Wake up.

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
You are just a substitute!

98
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't regard yourself
as Yiyi's biological mother.

99
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,070
I had no one to take care of Yiyi

100
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,440
and got you to stay with him.

101
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,510
Don't describe our past so beautifully,

102
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,160
okay?

103
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,670
Do you think I needed you all along?

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I just needed a partner by my side.

105
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,600
The moment I met An Yu,

106
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't need you anymore!

107
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay. Okay.

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,230
Sign it now.

109
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
I have signed.

110
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,160
By the way,

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,040
is this card under your name?

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,110
Take it.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,070
From now on,

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,070
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

115
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,880
This is

116
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,550
as far as we go!

117
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,390
I got it.

118
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,440
You're back.

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I bought the last bowl of shrimp wonton.

120
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,790
Am I awesome?

121
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,320
Only one?

122
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,110
I also bought the fresh meat flavor.

123
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,550
We'll share.

124
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,400
Is this shrimp?

125
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,760
Yes.

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,960
It's fresh shrimp.

127
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,910
I'll just eat the meat flavor.

128
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,080
You take the shrimp flavor.

129
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,760
We'll share.

130
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,710
Okay.

131
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,760
It's hot.

132
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,230
A bit hot.

133
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,790
A bit hot.

134
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,590
Careful.

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Here.

136
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,640
You first.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,670
How is it?

138
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,080
The shrimp flavor is the best.

139
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,960
You look silly.

140
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
You call me silly?

141
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,150
If I'm silly,

142
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,110
you are sillier.

143
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm not silly.

144
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,280
Aren't you silly?

145
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,470
You're silly enough to like me.

146
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,880
Ha,

147
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
you wish!

148
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,080
Okay.

149
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,640
I wish!

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,880
Here, have some soup.

151
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,710
My biggest wish

152
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,840
is for us to be together.

153
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,550
As for Fangfang,

154
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,280
I wish he will be safe.

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,960
Other things don't matter.

156
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
That day, on the way to Nankou Village,

157
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,880
you said something in the car.

158
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,350
You said

159
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,590
that every parent has moments of despair.

160
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,150
Sometimes,

161
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,350
a parent would think of dying with their child.

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Was that about you?

163
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Forget that.

164
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,000
Did you...

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,660
♪The same color♪

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,030
really want to do that?

167
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,240
♪In the same corner♪

168
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,280
At that time,

169
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,150
Fangfang just got into an accident.

170
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,110
It was the greatest blow for me.

171
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,760
I collapsed.

172
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,740
♪The same extremes♪

173
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,470
♪Who said two like poles would repel?♪

174
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,520
So,

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,740
We'll try to cooperate with you

350
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,910
and see how to make him

351
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,460
accept his new environment.

352
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,980
Okay.

353
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:47,950
Okay.

354
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,620
That's all.

355
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,340
I have to leave.

356
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,310
Thank you all.

357
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,950
Thank you.

358
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,260
School is over.

359
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,950
The kids will be out soon.

360
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,790
I'll go in and check on them.

361
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,070
Okay, thank you.

362
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,590
Yiyi.

363
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,550
Miss An.

364
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,430
Yiyi.

365
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,100
Yiyi.

366
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,860
I will take you home today, okay?

367
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,030
Miss An.

368
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,140
Where are my daddy and mommy?

369
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,340
Well,

370
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,910
they are a bit busy.

371
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,460
You'll go to my place

372
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,710
and stay for a few days.

373
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,260
No way.

374
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,670
I will wait for

375
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,910
Mommy and Daddy.

376
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,190
However, your mommy and daddy

377
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,340
have important matters to attend to.

378
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,460
I don't care.

379
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,860
I want Mommy and Daddy.

380
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,590
Be a good boy, Yiyi.

381
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Can you go with me?

382
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,710
Come out first.

383
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,830
I'll wait for Mommy and Daddy.

384
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,340
Yiyi.

385
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,980
Dark Knight!

386
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,980
Are you the Dark Knight?

387
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,030
Yeah.

388
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,190
I am Moon,

389
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,790
the Dark Knight.

390
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,340
The Dark Knight is here to pick Yiyi up.

391
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,140
Is it true, Dark Knight?

392
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,830
Yes.

393
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,710
Dark Knight, let's go eat fries!

394
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,790
McDonald's!

395
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,430
You want French fries?

396
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,380
Of course, that's fine.

397
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,670
Let's go together.

398
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,860
Okay?

399
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,910
Dark Knight,

400
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,980
when we're out there,

401
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,500
I want to play with you.

402
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,740
(When I got him to bed,)

403
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,590
(I told him a story.)

404
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,500
(It was the only fairy tale I knew.)

405
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,670
I told him

406
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,860
that he doesn't need to worry.

407
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,950
No matter what difficulties he encounters,

408
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,380
the Dark Knight will come to his rescue.

409
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,260
Correct?

410
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,140
Of course,

411
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,620
the Dark Knight will protect you both.

412
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,310
Your meal is here.

413
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,550
Mommy.

414
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,710
Look! What is that?

415
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,790
Does it smell good?

416
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,830
Yes.

417
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,310
It smells so good.

418
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,380
Who are you?

419
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,140
Can I take a photo with you?

420
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,740
He is the Dark Knight.

421
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,860
His name is Moon.

422
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,590
He is my good friend.

423
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,500
You're lying.

424
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,710
The Dark Knight does not exist in this world.

425
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,460
Dark Knight, tell them

426
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,910
that you are the Dark Knight.

427
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Hello, everyone.

428
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,260
I am the Dark Knight.

429
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,740
My name is Moon.

430
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,830
He lied.

431
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,500
He is not the Dark Knight.

432
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,030
Look.

433
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,500
He's not the Dark Knight.

434
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,710
He is a human.

435
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,140
Liar. Let's go!

436
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,100
It's you.

437
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,950
You are a bad guy.

438
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,950
I don't want you!

439
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,670
Yiyi.

440
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,910
Yiyi.

441
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,620
Don't run around.

442
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,310
Yiyi.

443
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,340
Yiyi.

444
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,100
Ms. Mi,

445
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,100
you've dealt with so many divorce cases in court.

446
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,790
In this field,

447
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,430
you're more professional than me.

448
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,140
I want to hear your opinion.

449
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,380
Do I have a chance

450
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,830
to get back the custody?

451
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,340
It's not totally impossible,

452
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,620
but the child's current custody

453
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,590
has been modified.

454
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,100
And this kind of thing
happened to the child's father.

455
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,910
The other party is the child's biological mother.

456
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I could only say

457
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,220
that it's very unlikely.

458
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,500
Even if I only have

459
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,590
a 0.01-percent hope,

460
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,670
I want to fight for it.

461
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,500
Ms. Mi,

462
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,590
you know

463
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,860
that this process

464
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,910
is very long and painful.

465
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,950
I will get his custody back

466
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,100
at all costs.

467
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,910
Help me, please.

468
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,100
Okay.

469
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,380
I'll try my best.

470
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,190
Thank you.

471
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,620
Yiyi finally fell asleep.

472
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,260
We rarely have time to rest.

473
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,220
Where are they?

474
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,140
In the room.

475
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,030
I'll lower my voice.

476
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,550
Don't take it to heart.

477
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,380
Is it very difficult

478
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,140
to care for a child?

479
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,860
I think so.

480
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,670
We are first-time parents.

481
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,620
Sometimes, we can't handle him.

482
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,500
What if

483
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,310
he is very stubborn?

484
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,430
Aren't we stubborn too?

485
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,500
What should we do

486
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,910
to change his mind?

487
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,310
Time will.

488
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,190
If we can't change him,

489
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,910
we don't have to.

490
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,620
We can just compromise

491
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,460
and find

492
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,980
a way

493
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,500
to coexist.

494
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,910
Mutual tolerance.

495
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,460
Shao Moli,

496
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,430
how long have we not gone on a date?

497
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,380
Right.

498
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,070
How can I work and forget life?

499
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,260
How can you forget your motto?

500
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,070
Tomorrow, I will make arrangements immediately.

501
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,670
Okay?

502
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,740
Deal.

503
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,500
I have an idea.

504
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,380
I want to sell some of Zhuoyue's shares

505
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,710
and buy the old house.

506
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,460
Yiyi grew up there.

507
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,710
He'll feel safe living there.

508
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,740
What do you think?

509
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,220
Let's plan that, then.

510
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,740
I feel tired after drinking wine.

511
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,860
You've worked hard.

512
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,550
Fortunately, I have a Husky.

513
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,340
Who is it?

514
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,950
You scared me.

515
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,380
Why are you here?

516
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,590
To visit you.

517
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,550
Okay.

518
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,430
Come on in.

519
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,550
Why are you staying here?

520
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,860
Can you get used to it?

521
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,830
If not,

522
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,380
I'll find you another place tomorrow.

523
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,830
No need.

524
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,830
This place is not bad.

525
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,830
How do you have your meals here?

526
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,460
Call me anytime if you want to eat anything.

527
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,550
I'll send it to you.

528
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,070
Ding, I remember you told me before

529
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,140
that your father died young.

530
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,860
You have a sister

531
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,830
and mother, right?

532
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,260
I'll give you an additional six months' salary.

533
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,220
It's fine.

534
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,710
I...

535
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,670
You have worked hard all these years.

536
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,620
You have done a lot for my family.

537
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,340
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

538
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,860
Take the money and find a new job.

539
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,460
Later, get a girlfriend,

540
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,100
get married, and start your family.

541
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,670
Start a new life.

542
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,070
I still have some work to do.

543
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,830
If there is nothing else, head back first.

544
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,340
I'm doing well.

545
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,710
I'll leave, then.

546
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,740
(Thank you, Kai.)

547
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,310
It's nothing.

548
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,340
Take a break.

549
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,220
Go ahead and chat.

550
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,220
What's the matter with you?

551
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,910
You're moving out.

552
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,790
I'll miss you.

553
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,190
Why are you suddenly so sad?

554
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,860
Sad?

555
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,430
I don't want you to leave me.

556
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,550
I'm leaving you.

557
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,980
I live close by.

558
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,460
By taxi, you pay the basic charge.

559
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,070
Right?

560
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,620
In the future,

561
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,340
we will meet every day at the company.

562
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,790
I can't bother you at any time.

563
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,950
You wish!

564
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,380
I'll bother you every day and at any time.

565
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,500
In the future, Kai and Lailai will babysit for me.

566
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,030
Right?

567
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,030
Absolutely.

568
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,590
I want to test Kai's ability to take care of a child.

569
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,860
Are you planning?

570
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,590
No.

571
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,310
Hello, Shao Moli.

572
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,830
How is the packing over there?

573
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,500
Kai and Lailai are helping me.

574
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,430
We're almost done.

575
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,830
I'm almost done over here too.

576
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,620
You can directly take Yiyi here later.

577
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,260
I'll leave right away when I'm done.

578
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,340
I won't let him see me.

579
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,380
You're so nice.

580
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,340
Love you.

581
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,740
What?

582
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,620
Love you.

583
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,070
Bye-bye.

584
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,030
Don't move.

585
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,740
Stay put.

586
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,310
I'll take a photo for you.

587
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,140
That's it.

588
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,860
One, two, three.

589
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,190
I caught you.

590
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,710
You lost weight.

591
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,590
He stole a kiss.

592
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,500
Is this a stolen kiss?

593
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,870
I'm leaving.

594
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,110
Bye-bye.

595
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,300
Let's go.

596
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,470
Yiyi,

597
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,710
what happened?

598
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,230
Why are you looking so down?

599
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,780
Miss An,

600
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,230
why aren't my daddy and mommy

601
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,180
back yet?

602
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,660
I miss them.

603
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,230
I miss Bumblebee, too.

604
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,710
Well, Yiyi,

605
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,420
I'll take you somewhere.

606
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,630
Where?

607
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,990
We'll visit Bumblebee.

608
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,710
Yiyi.

609
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,660
Look. Where are we?

610
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,540
We're home.

611
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,300
Yiyi,

612
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,660
what's wrong?

613
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,830
We're home.

614
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,990
Why do you still look so down?

615
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,780
I thought

616
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,590
you were taking me to see Mommy.

617
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,740
I heard that the villa was auctioned off.

618
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,870
I immediately knew it must be you.

619
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
This is good.

620
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,110
Yiyi doesn't have to leave his home.

621
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,870
Can I visit every week?

622
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,740
Every Saturday.

623
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,670
You can come and see him.

624
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,150
What about the weekdays, then?

625
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,500
When I miss him,

626
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,590
can I see him?

627
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,780
I raised him up from small.

628
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,980
I'm afraid when he doesn't see me,

629
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,910
he will cry.

630
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,910
He will look for me.

631
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,460
He might not be able to sleep.

632
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,260
Okay.

633
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,150
I'll visit him every Saturday.

634
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,740
Even for one moment.

635
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,460
Mommy.

636
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,700
Yiyi.

637
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,830
I've missed you so much.

638
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,700
Mommy.

639
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,670
I've missed you too.

640
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,350
Mommy.

641
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,110
I've missed you so much.

642
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,220
Mommy.

643
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,300
Why hasn't Daddy come back?

644
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,870
Daddy?

645
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,670
He has important work to do.

646
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,350
I want to be with Daddy.

647
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,150
You miss your daddy, don't you?

648
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,940
He has to work hard.

649
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,940
If he works hard,

650
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
he will make money to buy toys for you.

651
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,460
Right?

652
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,220
I don't want toys.

653
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,670
I don't want to make Daddy work so hard.

654
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,460
You don't want to make Daddy work so hard?

655
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,279
I know you are the most sensible kid.

656
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,190
You're a good boy.

657
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,670
Listen to Mommy.

658
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,910
Eat well,

659
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,980
sleep tight,

660
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,910
and work hard to grow taller.

661
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,830
When you are tall,

662
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,300
Daddy will come back. Okay?

663
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,110
I'll eat well, drink milk,

664
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,350
and grow tall.

665
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,870
You're awesome.

666
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,590
Look at how cold your little hands are.

667
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,670
Let me make them warm.

668
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm going off today.

669
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,460
I have something to do. Okay?

670
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,590
Listen to Miss An.

671
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,630
Mommy, where are you going?

672
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,190
Won't you accompany me to play the piano?

673
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,020
Of course, I want to do that,

674
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,460
but...

675
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,070
but Mommy has other things to do.

676
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,260
Be a good boy.

677
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,300
I'll come back to see you in a while.

678
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,020
Okay?

679
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,460
Be a good boy.

680
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,870
I have to leave now.

681
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,940
Mommy, is it that you don't want me anymore?

682
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,590
How could I not want you?

683
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,430
Even if the whole world doesn't want you,

684
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,670
I definitely will want you.

685
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,390
Mommy, don't go.

686
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,630
Be a good boy.

687
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,780
Listen to Miss An.

688
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,630
Wait for Mommy to come back to pick you up.

689
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,020
Mommy, don't go.

690
