00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,910
I'll gladly fight a protracted war

175
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,670
with you, Mr. Shao.

176
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,840
But my gut feeling tells me

177
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,550
that you won't.

178
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,520
You have 24 hours to get ready.

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,670
At this time tomorrow,

180
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,880
I'll bring the contract here.

181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,110
Don't be late.

182
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,230
Mr. Lin.

183
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,110
Mr. Shao.

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Goodbye.

185
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,640
From the start,

186
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Zhou Yuan didn't want to clash head-on with us.

187
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,400
He blocked us at the time
when we were signing the contract

188
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,230
to put us in a dilemma

189
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,200
and even force us

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,320
to pay a lot to acquire his equity.

191
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,640
Do you know

192
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,550
why round ice cubes are better for whisky?

193
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
They keep it cold longer

194
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,910
and melt slowly.

195
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,350
They have another function.

196
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,640
They make you raise your glass slowly,

197
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,230
take a sip slowly,

198
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,710
and put your glass down slowly.

199
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,670
If you do it too fast,

200
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,350
the round ice cubes will slide down

201
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,640
and hit your teeth.

202
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,760
One can always retreat.

203
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,150
We've signed

204
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,350
to acquire more than 20 percent of the shares

205
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,030
but it does not mean

206
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,550
we can't give up.

207
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,400
Give up?

208
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,000
If you give up, you'll fall into Zhou Yuan's trap.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,910
Yimi Capital will acquire Hongxing Telecom

210
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,760
at a very low price.

211
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,790
It'll be liquidated, sold off,

212
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,520
and eventually shut down.

213
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,320
What do you want to do?

214
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,840
He charges four times the price.

215
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,150
That's because he bets I won't buy them.

216
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,000
There is little chance of success.

217
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,400
The price of failure is costly.

218
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,710
I know you want

219
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,230
to realize the dream
of Hongxing Telecom for An Yu

220
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,230
but keep your cool.

221
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,590
Don't be impulsive.

222
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,760
Actually,

223
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,200
acquiring Hongxing Telecom

224
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,840
has become my dream too.

225
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,150
Don't worry.

226
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,280
If we fail,

227
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,000
I will take full responsibility.

228
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,840
I won't let you or Zhuoyue suffer any losses.

229
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,880
You have less than 24 hours left.

230
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,150
What can you do?

231
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,590
Before the very last minute,

232
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,470
I won't know either.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mr. Ma.

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,350
Mr. Ma.

235
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,400
What brings you here?

236
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Mr. Ma,

237
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,520
what happened to your office?

238
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,350
Nothing.

239
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,760
It's just that Mr. Qian

240
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,280
shut down my office.

241
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,080
He said I occupied a lot of space all by myself

242
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,440
and abused power for my gain.

243
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,520
I said that I accumulated

244
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440
many drawings, books, and samples

245
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,350
over the years.

246
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
I have to keep them.

247
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,080
He got me a basement.

248
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,790
I'm about to move there.

249
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,760
We bought some food.

250
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,350
Let's eat together.

251
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,440
After that, we'll help you move.

252
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,320
Thank you.

253
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,230
Put it here.

254
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,320
Sorry.

255
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,230
I'll take it.

256
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,000
Mr. Ma,

257
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,230
what is this?

258
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,640
It's a sample of a semiconductor
and communication device I researched on.

259
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
It is for testing special environments.

260
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,910
Special environments?

261
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,400
For example,

262
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,230
mines

263
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,350
and deep oil wells.

264
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,230
Of course,

265
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
it depends on the soil, environment,

266
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,320
and the material and thickness

267
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,710
of the isolation layers during construction.

268
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,790
Do you have the design drawings
and description?

269
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

270
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,840
Here.

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,910
Look.

272
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,910
Do you have the test data?

273
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Yes.

274
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,760
Here.

275
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,400
Look.

276
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,400
Mr. Ma and An Yu,

277
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,030
I think this thing

278
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,960
can give us a nice turnaround.

279
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,230
What do you mean?

280
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,110
I don't understand.

281
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,440
How about this?

282
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,230
Let's give it a name.

283
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's call it

284
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,670
Sirius I.

285
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,590
Sirius I?

286
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,200
Hello.

287
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,230
Zhou Yuan.

288
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,320
Yimi and Zhuoyue have fought so many times.

289
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,790
We're fated to meet.

290
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,280
I want to meet and talk to you about something.

291
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,000
Sure.

292
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,710
I'm at a noodle shop.

293
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,590
Come here.

294
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,440
I will share the location.

295
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,880
Sir,

296
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,640
assorted pea noodles.

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,710
Okay.

298
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,700
[Yuqing Noodles]

299
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,470
Mr. Zhou.

300
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,990
Come, come. Sit down.

301
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,940
Was it off the beaten path and hard to find?

302
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,110
It's my fault

303
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,030
for choosing here.

304
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,030
Good choice.

305
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,670
This store is much recommended.

306
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,430
I've heard of it.

307
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,260
Really?

308
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,470
What would you like to have?

309
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,230
I almost forgot.

310
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,820
You can't eat spicy food
after returning from abroad, right?

311
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,990
Who said that?

312
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,340
Staying abroad for many years

313
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,980
hasn't changed my Yuqing stomach.

314
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,100
It's a habit from childhood.

315
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,860
Great.

316
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,380
Assorted pea noodles or plain noodles?

317
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,910
I'll have a bowl of assorted pea noodles.

318
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,590
Okay.

319
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,830
Sir,

320
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,460
one more bowl of assorted pea noodles.

321
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,950
Extra spicy.

322
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,790
Okay.

323
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,950
I'll eat first

324
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,190
or the noodles will turn lumpy.

325
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,740
Zhou Yuan.

326
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,100
Your performance

327
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,460
shocked me.

328
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,950
I admire you.

329
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,790
Do you?

330
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,710
I know

331
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,670
what you want to discuss with me.

332
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,980
You'll state

333
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,620
the principle of win-win cooperation

334
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,380
to get me to compromise and yield.

335
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,220
Correct?

336
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,910
Looks like you won't agree.

337
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,980
Not necessarily.

338
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,860
Unless...

339
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,790
Unless what?

340
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,310
You beg me.

341
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,140
Mr. Lin,

342
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,310
are you seriously thinking about it?

343
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,190
Seriously?

344
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,430
Your noodles, sir.

345
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,430
Thank you.

346
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,500
You are old.

347
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,430
How can you eat such a big bowl of noodles?

348
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,790
It's okay.

349
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,220
I have a good appetite.

350
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,260
I'll eat them for you.

351
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,220
I am full.

352
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,430
You pay the bill.

353
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,620
Would you like to pay now?

354
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,380
Give me another bowl.

355
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,790
Extra spicy.

356
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,710
Okay.

357
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,500
Assorted pea noodles,

358
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,430
extra spicy.

359
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,710
(Will Sirius truly be useful?)

360
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,620
Time will tell.

361
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,860
Are you hungry?

362
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,830
A little.

363
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,380
Shall we go over there for wonton?

364
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,310
Yun is still awake.

365
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,220
Hasn't she fiddled in the food business?

366
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,030
Maybe we can go grab a bite?

367
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,460
Quick.

368
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,790
Yun, Yun.

369
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,740
Yun.

370
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,910
We're hungry.

371
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,550
Do you have food?

372
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,340
I'm not your nanny.

373
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,830
You look for me when you're hungry.

374
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,070
I have no food.

375
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,310
Well then,

376
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,620
it's my turn to show my skills.

377
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,140
I'll cook for you.

378
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,030
Really?

379
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,910
Wait for me.

380
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,430
I'll have a glass too.

381
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,860
Thanks.

382
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,590
How are you?

383
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,740
Not good.

384
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,950
What about you?

385
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Do you get along well with him?

386
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,590
It's okay.

387
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,340
Do you find it tiring
to be in a relationship with a younger man?

388
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,860
I think he's quite mature.

389
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,590
Age

390
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,340
has nothing

391
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,980
to do with men's maturity.

392
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,860
I broke up with my guy.

393
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,860
I think he is too young.

394
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,140
He doesn't take care of others.

395
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,910
I can't stand

396
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,860
his capriciousness.

397
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,590
However, don't be influenced by me.

398
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,460
Don't use my love

399
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,950
as a reference.

400
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,380
I am not happy.

401
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,950
It doesn't mean you'll be unhappy.

402
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
I broke up.

403
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,830
It doesn't mean you will too.

404
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,860
I think everyone is different.

405
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,590
Congratulations.

406
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,430
You're single again.

407
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,070
Mr. Right is on his way
now that Mr. Wrong is gone.

408
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,070
That's correct.

409
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,100
The noodles are ready.

410
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,790
Here.

411
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,740
This is for Yun,

412
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,190
and this is for An Yu.

413
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,260
Here.

414
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,310
Looks good.

415
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,860
Go ahead.

416
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,190
I'll go to the back for a while.

417
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,340
I'll go with you.

418
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,310
I want to be alone.

419
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,460
Yun, take your noodles there.

420
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,310
Yes.

421
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,740
I'll bring the wine over in a minute.

422
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,430
So,

423
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,950
what happened to her?

424
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,340
Do you want to know

425
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,140
every sentence in our chat?

426
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,190
Let's eat.

427
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,980
Listen.

428
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,460
A man's real cooking skills will be revealed

429
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,310
when he cooks instant noodles.

430
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,500
How can you say that?

431
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,460
Shao Moli.

432
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,550
You've changed.

433
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,500
I miss

434
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,790
the prudent and sincere boy I met earlier.

435
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,980
I'm still very prudent now.

436
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,220
I'm also very sincere.

437
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,070
I'd say slick.

438
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,220
If you don't eat them soon,
the noodles will turn clumpy.

439
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,910
Yes.

440
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,220
So,

441
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,070
we should cherish

442
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,310
this bowl of noodles.

443
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,260
This does taste good.

444
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,260
Told you.

445
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,380
The noodles now have a soul
after you made them spicier.

446
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,670
Yummy.

447
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,100
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

448
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,070
I'm the Financial Times reporter.

449
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,460
Will Zhuoyue's equity acquisition

450
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,380
proceed smoothly?

451
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,830
Mr. Zhou.

452
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,740
I am from Business Weekly.

453
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,070
Do you only want to sell shares

454
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,620
or do you actually wish
to acquire Hongxing Telecom?

455
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,460
What's your opinion

456
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,220
on what has happened, Mr. Zhou?

457
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Say something, Mr. Zhou.

458
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,140
-Mr. Zhou.
-Mr. Zhou.

459
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,100
-Say something, Mr. Zhou.
-Mr. Zhou.

460
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,380
-Say something, Mr. Zhou.
-Please say something.

461
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:36,910
-Say something.
-Mr. Zhou.

462
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,430
A brief explanation would do.

463
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,550
Mr. Zhou, please respond.

464
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,340
Excuse me.

465
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,220
We do not accept

466
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,500
interviews today.

467
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,260
Thank you.

468
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Please make way.

469
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,950
-Mr. Zhou.
-Mr. Zhou.

470
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,710
Mr. Zhou.

471
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,710
-Mr. Zhou.
-Say something.

472
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,340
-Mr. Zhou.
-Why are there so many reporters?

473
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,830
How would I know?

474
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,460
Please have your seat.

475
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,430
Sit down and talk.

476
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,220
Wait.

477
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,340
Hello, Ye Kai.

478
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,070
Send the reporters in.

479
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,790
Yes,

480
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,070
you are right.

481
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,710
I'm the one who is winning.

482
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,910
I'm selling the shares at four times the price.

483
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,140
I should be the one making it public.

484
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,460
Send them in.

485
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,430
Hold on.

486
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,460
Mr. Shao.

487
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,500
We came with sincerity today.

488
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,950
Signing a contract and negotiating the terms

489
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,430
are a trade secret.

490
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,100
It's inappropriate to have reporters here.

491
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,030
We have something on later.

492
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,220
We are not free.

493
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,740
Why don't you check the contract now?

494
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,190
What about the price I offered last time?

495
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,380
Will you sign the contract?

496
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,220
Let me tell you a secret.

497
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,740
Yesterday, at Hongxing Telecom,

498
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,460
we found

499
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,340
a black technology
that may change the future market.

500
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,980
It may increase the valuation
of Hongxing Telecom

501
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,710
exponentially.

502
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,100
If we sign this contract

503
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,620
and you give us the shares

504
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,310
at such a low price,

505
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,190
and then watch Hongxing Telecom's

506
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,860
shares appreciate all the way,

507
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
both of you

508
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,670
cannot blame me for not reminding you today.

509
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,220
Mr. Shao,

510
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,380
you said so much

511
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,030
because you wish to haggle with me.

512
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,590
Okay.

513
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,670
I'll make a compromise.

514
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,910
Triple the price.

515
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,100
Effective for three minutes.

516
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,460
Since Mr. Zhou made a compromise,

517
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,830
I will also make one.

518
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,500
How?

519
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,550
