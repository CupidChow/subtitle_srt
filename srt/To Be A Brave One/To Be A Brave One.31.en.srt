00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,440
(Let us meet each other.)

173
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,230
Here are your noodles.

174
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,440
Here.

175
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,880
Dig in.

176
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,440
So, you already knew who I was.

177
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,720
Yong,

178
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,320
the things you had done
to Xingchen Financial and An Wenbin

179
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,230
and your ambition of purchasing Zhuoyue

180
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,230
have made it easy for me to connect them

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,350
to certain past events.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,230
If so, you should understand this.

183
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,760
I will never let you off.

184
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,720
You're just like your father.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,830
You're just as impulsive

186
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,070
and hot-blooded as him.

187
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,350
However, there's one thing different about me.

188
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,880
Unlike him, I won't let you guys

189
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,670
take advantage of me.

190
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,320
Zhou Yuan,

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,640
you dug such a deep pit for yourself

192
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,950
because of a mere misunderstanding.

193
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Is it even worth it?

194
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,550
Misunderstanding?

195
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,710
There's no misunderstanding between us.

196
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,470
Lin Zhanhong, listen up.

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,710
I've been conserving strength all these years

198
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,910
just to wait for your return.

199
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
I wanted you to have a taste of how it feels like

200
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,790
to be abandoned.

201
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,440
Do you think you still stand a chance?

202
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,640
You've already mortgaged

203
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,840
all of your assets,

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
including Yimi Capital,

205
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,200
to purchase He Shuo's shares.

206
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,080
Oh yeah, and the loan you took out from Yuan Wei,

207
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
how long has it been
since you took out the loan?

208
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,000
One month? Three months?

209
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,150
Tell me then.

210
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,200
How can you repay the loan?

211
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,350
It's hopeless

212
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
unless the other shareholders of Zhuoyue

213
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,230
are willing to sell their shares to you.

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Zhou Yuan,

215
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,150
you can never win against me.

216
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,000
However,

217
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
you're the son of my friend after all.

218
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,470
I can't just leave you in the lurch.

219
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,710
How about this?

220
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,150
If you're willing to beg me,

221
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,320
I can consider

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
repurchasing the shares you have right now.

223
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,230
What do you think?

224
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,280
No one will buy your shares.

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,470
They will surely rot in your hands.

226
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
However, your wife and child

227
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,200
will lose everything.

228
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,080
You should think about it.

229
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,000
You want me to address you as Uncle, huh?

230
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,110
Listen up.

231
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,280
Even if I were to lose my family

232
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,400
and everything I have,

233
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,790
I would never bow down to you,

234
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,520
let alone sell my father's shares to you.

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,640
Zhou Yuan,

236
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,520
why don't you think from my perspective?

237
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,030
Why do you think I was trying to exchange

238
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,350
Zhuoyue's shares with He Shuo for the patents?

239
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,150
Why did he make
a ridiculous demand all of a sudden,

240
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
signed the contract with you in a hurry,

241
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
and went to Melbourne in a rush?

242
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,230
Why do you think Yuan Wei, a loan shark,
would approve your loan?

243
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,840
He knew

244
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,840
that you had mortgaged all of your assets.

245
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,030
Even so, he still approved your loan.

246
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,550
Why?

247
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,400
It's because every step you took

248
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,150
was within my plan.

249
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,030
It's so easy to make a vengeful man

250
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,440
fall into your trap.

251
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,960
Hatred causes one to lose all rationality.

252
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
You already lost

253
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,030
from the beginning.

254
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,590
Mister,

255
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,910
get me another bowl of the same noodles.

256
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
Alright.

257
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,200
Yong,

258
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,230
I've been tight on money lately.

259
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,550
It's tough on me too.

260
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,110
Where else can Zhou Yuan go?

261
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,230
I've already inquired about Mr. Zhou in the bars,

262
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,110
restaurants, and clubs

263
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,230
he used to frequent.

264
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,030
Actually,

265
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,790
there's another place I have in mind.

266
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,280
Is it possible that Mr. Zhou

267
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,470
is in An Yu's...

268
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,590
Turn back.

269
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,590
Let's head to An Yu's place.

270
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,670
Ms. Mi.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,470
Ms. Mi!

272
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,200
It's Mr. Zhou!

273
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,760
Turn around!

274
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
Hurry up!

275
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Ding,

276
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,150
get back in the car.

277
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,350
But Mr. Zhou is...

278
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,030
Get back in the car!

279
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,150
Come home with me.

280
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,350
Come home with me!

281
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,400
Ms. Zhang has prepared lunch for us.

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,590
Yiyi is waiting for you at home.

283
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,400
Let's go home.

284
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Are you hurt anywhere?

285
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,820
Do you see those unfinished buildings?

286
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,740
They have been

287
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,820
under construction

288
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,110
for a decade.

289
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,030
Even so, they remain unfinished.

290
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,580
Did you know why?

291
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,500
Because this is a land of fortune!

292
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,940
It's a land of fortune!

293
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,940
No one can outshine it!

294
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,870
Let's go home.

295
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,580
Let's go home, okay?

296
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,430
Let's go home.

297
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,180
Let's go home.

298
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,430
Let's go.

299
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,980
Did you know

300
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,910
why this place is a land of fortune?

301
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,380
It's because

302
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,670
this place used to be my home.

303
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,740
My father is gone.

304
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,070
My house is confiscated.

305
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,590
My mother is gone too.

306
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,710
My entire family is gone.

307
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,860
We're still here.

308
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,140
We're still here for you.

309
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,380
We're still here.

310
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,070
We're still here for you.

311
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,910
We're still here for you.

312
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,980
Lin Zhanhong

313
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,620
owes my father an apology.

314
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Come home with me!

315
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,460
Leave me alone!

316
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,070
-Come home with me!
-Just leave me be!

317
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,380
Zhou Yuan!

318
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,950
You have so many things.

319
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,670
This is all I can do for you.

320
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,220
In the future, you have to obey the female owner.

321
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,340
Come on, let's return to our unit.

322
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,460
We can keep the stuff you don't use often

323
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,260
in the storeroom.

324
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,070
Okay.

325
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,430
I think it's them.

326
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,190
Can you do it?

327
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,190
Of course.

328
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,950
Ice Cream? What are you doing here?

329
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,260
This...

330
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,430
My goodness!

331
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,260
You turned the room into a mess!

332
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,140
Dumb Ice Cream.

333
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,310
This belonged to my dad.

334
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,310
What is this?

335
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,980
Feng,

336
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,710
what are you doing?

337
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,550
You've been at home for several days.

338
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm afraid I can't repay

339
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,070
the 30 million yuan I owe you.

340
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,310
Pack your clothes,

341
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,310
bring your ID card with you,

342
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,070
and come with me.

343
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,140
No need for that.

344
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,340
Wenbin,

345
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,790
I've owed you too much.

346
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm afraid I can never repay the debt.

347
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,620
Buddy,

348
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,340
this isn't the time for this.

349
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,620
Let's lie low for now.

350
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,380
When everything has settled down,

351
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,070
I'll bring you back
so that you can turn yourself in.

352
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,140
Let's start from scratch.

353
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,830
Wenbin,

354
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,710
no matter what,

355
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,220
I want to thank you.

356
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,670
We're brothers, you know? Drop the formalities.

357
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,070
Just pack your clothes.

358
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,950
I'll deal with the rest.

359

[Xiao Feng, pay up!]

(Wenbin,)

363
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,380
(I should have been freed)

364
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,830
(by the time you read this letter.)

365
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,190
(I'm sorry.)

366
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,590
(I'm sorry that I had to end it this way.)

367
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,260
(I'm sure you despise me for it.)

368
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,220
(Out of the three of us,)

369
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,030
(Zhanhong is the calmest,)

370
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,790
(you're the most loyal,)

371
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,260
(while I'm the weakest.)

372
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,070
(Zhanhong reprimanded me)

373
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,740
(and stopped lending me money)

374
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,260
(when I first fell into the trap.)

375
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,260
(I hated him because of that.)

376
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,910
(However, I know)

377
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,070
(that he might be doing it for my own good.)

378
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,790
(He was trying to make me sober up.)

379

(You lent me money time and time again)

380
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,910
(and almost went bankrupt because of it.)

381
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,980
(You never gave up on me)

382
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,500
(no matter how dire the situation was.)

383
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,620
(To be honest,)

384
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,340
(you're the one I had let down the most.)

385

(Wenbin,)

386
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,430

(All these years,)

388

suffering together with me.)

389
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,550
(They couldn't enjoy their lives at all.)

390
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,620
(I mustn't implicate them anymore.)

391

(I have no courage to start from scratch again.)

Excuse me.

398

Where's the family

399
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,380
that's been staying in this unit?

400
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,190
They moved.

401
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,860
Do you know where they went?

402
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,340
I don't.

[Xiao Feng's letter to An Wenbin]

So, this is the truth.

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,430
We should show this letter to Zhou Yuan.

406

Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

407
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:15,497
Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

408
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,590
Zhou Yuan switched off his phone.

409
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,380
I thought Mi Lu was planning to meet me alone.

410
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,380
I didn't expect

411
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,550
that you two owe her a favor too.

412
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,590
(Did you forget?)

413
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
(Ms. Mi helped me out with my divorce.)

414
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,460
(That's how I was spared
from paying a huge sum of alimony.)

415
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,340
I have to come

It's better

418
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,430
when we reject the favor in person, huh?

(That's impressive of you.)

423

You guys would laugh at me for the next decade

if I did such a stupid thing.

425

I won't be able to make a living
in the industry in the future.

426

Seems like getting a woman as your bosom friend
doesn't amount to much either.

(Don't say that.)

Why haven't you guys started eating?

By the way,

Ms. Mi,

436
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,340
it's fine. We've eaten beforehand.

437
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,260
We need to leave
as we have things to attend to later.

Me too.

439
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,550
Why don't we have a drink then?

440
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,710
Ms. Mi, you see,

441
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,380
the assets of Yimi Capital

442
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,980
had been mortgaged several times.

443
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,910
And, we need to explain to the board of directors

444
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
about how we use our money.

445
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,590
That's why we have no way

446
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,710
to lend you any money now.

447
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,070
Yes.

448
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,140
It's too risky.

449
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,100
No one dares take the risk.

450
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,070
Can we

451
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,830
think of a solution together?

452
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,500
I'll be honest with you.

453
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,620
Mr. Lin of Zhuoyue has spoken.

454
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
It's difficult for you guys to cut your losses

455
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,670
even if someone buys your shares right now.

456
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,830
Unless

457
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,740
Mr. Zhou

458
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,980
is willing to sell his shares at Zhuoyue

459
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,830
for a low price.

460
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,980
I called you guys here

461
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,380
because I hoped you guys could help me out.

462
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,190
I've never requested any favors from you guys.

463
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,190
You guys know my personality well.

464
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,790
If I borrow money from you guys,

465
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,590
I'll definitely repay my debt
together with the interest.

466
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,380
Ms. Mi,

467
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,100
I assume you know this clearly.

468
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,070
Zhou Yuan

469
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,226
was only able to get to where he was
by depending on his ex-father-in-law.

470
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,140
Rumors are going around

471
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,070
that Mr. Zhou owes Mr. Yuan a huge sum.

472
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,620
Mi Lu,

473
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,980
since it has come to this,

474
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,670
you've already done all you can for him.

475
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,380
After all, the child isn't yours.

476
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,590
You're an excellent woman.

477
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,500
It's time to make some plans for yourself.

478
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,030
If it doesn't work out,

479
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,790
I can introduce someone better to you.

480
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,980
What do you think?

481
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,340
I would like to thank you all

482
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,070
for coming here today.

483
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,070
I understand what you mean.

484
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,590
Please go ahead with your schedule if you have any.

485
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,620
Thanks a lot.

486
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,910
We'll make a move first.

487
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,070
I remember

488
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,550
I told you many times about this.

489
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,500
Don't make me repeat this, okay?

490
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,950
Keep it unchanged.

491
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,740
Keep everything the same.

492
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,910
Hello, Ding.

493
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,670
Zhou Yuan has a white Range Rover, right?

494
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,310
That's right.

495
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,620
He's been driving it lately.

496
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,190
Call Mi Lu

497
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,100
and tell her that Zhou Yuan is in trouble.

498
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,190
Mi Lu.

499
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,190
I couldn't find Zhou Yuan.

500
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,260
Ding said you were here when I called him.

501
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,980
I have a very important letter

502
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,670
that is related to the truth back then.

503
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,030
I hope you can show this
to Zhou Yuan as soon as possible.

504
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,380
No.

505
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,260
This won't do.

506
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,380
He cannot see this letter.

507
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,740
But why?

508
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,830
Do you know what this letter means to him?

509
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,910
He's lived the first half of his life
bent on seeking revenge.

510
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,620
He almost sacrificed his entire life

511
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,500
for his vengeance.

512
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,790
But now,

513
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,220
you want to tell him
that his vengeance was uncalled for

514
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,590
and that the things he had done were wrong?

515
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,030
He won't be able to take it.

516
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,710
He doesn't have the mental capacity to take it.

517
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,830
No way.

518
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,310
But this is the truth behind the incident.

519
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,340
If you keep this a secret,

520
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,950
he'll keep repeating the same mistake.
