I didn't know you were a nostalgic person.

154

I suppose that would be when you finish work,

the sun would still be out

159

and when you walk into your residence,

160
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,350
you would smell the dishes.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,830
One family would be stewing a fish

162
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,160
while another would be brewing a soup.

163
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,040
Kids would be playing in the park down there

164
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,440
but this time, you would hear their parents too.

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,350
The supermarkets in the city
wouldn't go bankrupt

166
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,880
and our phones might not have as many apps.

167
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,440
Your parcel might not arrive in one day

168
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,950
but we might have more time

169
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,550
to hang out, drink, and talk with our friends.

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,550
A slower pace sounds amazing.

171
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,000
Indeed.

172
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,470

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,350
Open your mouth.

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,760
Is it delicious?

175
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,350
Yes.

176
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,470
Is it spicy?

177
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,350
I can handle chilies very well.

178
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,910
I can do

179
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,150
anything for you.

180
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,790
I love you.

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
I would have all

182
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,590
the chilies for you.

183
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,760
Eat.

184
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,590
Do you know

185
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,400
this is where we had our first meal together?

186
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,590
Of course, I do.

187
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,400
We chose this table

188
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,350
and sat on the same seats.

189
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,350
However, there isn't a huge slice
of watermelon with us.

190
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,760
Time sure flies.

191
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
And you can handle chilies now.

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,840
I remember you said in the laundromat

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,520
that you came back to live a life.

194
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,520
Has that changed?

195
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm still working on it.

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,840
But I believe

197
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,670
I made the right choice.

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,520
You've been here for a while.

199
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,400
What aspect of Yuqing
do you think is the most beautiful?

200
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,200
Its people.

201
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,470
Indeed.

202
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,520
The Yuqing people

203
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,790
are frank, passionate, romantic,

204
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,840

No problem.

I'll prepare all the documents.

Lailai.

274
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,030
Min just introduced a new client to me.

275
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,520
He's overseas now

276
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,520
and he'll be back next month.

277
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,910
Perhaps we'll seal a big deal next month.

278
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
An'an,

279
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,350
don't waste your time.

280
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,640
God knows if we can survive until next month.

281
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
This branch might be closed down this month.

282
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,470
Closed down?

283
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Why?

284
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,880
Su.

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Tell her.

286
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,880
Su lost a client.

287
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,550
An important one.

288
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,640
Five-star worthy.

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,030
The client brought it
to the headquarters' attention.

290
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,670
You could have screwed up anytime you wanted.

291
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,200
But why now?

292
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,670
The end of the month is near.

293
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,710
Su.

294
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,840
No one cares if you want to end your career

295
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,350
but don't drag us with you.

296
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
Mr. Fu just called me

297
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,550
and yelled

298
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,350
that if we couldn't solve this problem,

299
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,230
this branch would be closed down.

300
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,030
Su Dayong.

301
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,150
What good is your brain for?

302
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,910
I'm sorry, everyone.

303
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,200
I'll find a new client now.

304
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
Hurry up then.

305
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
Stop dallying here.

306
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,470
You are good at nothing

307
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,440
except screwing up.

308
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,710
Stop it.

309
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,030
Su has always helped you.

310
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,230
You do not have the right to speak.

311
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,550
This month is already tough enough.

312
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,150
When another store opened next to us,

313
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,470
I thought it was rock bottom.

314
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,200
I thought everything could only be better.

315
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,470
But then, we sunk further.

316
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,910
Su.

317
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,000
Is he going to be all right?

318
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,910
He's an adult.

319
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,110
What can happen to him?

320
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Worry about yourself.

321
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,550
How careless Su was.

322
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,230
When we had a problem,

323
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
he just stayed silent.

324
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,150
He even took my client last time.

325
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,790
I'm still not over it.

326
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,590
In my opinion,

327
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,200
all of us are affected by it.

328
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,880
Let's find a solution.

329
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,440
What solution is there?

330
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Who needs to shoulder the company's loss?

331
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,910
However,

332
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,670
if Su gets lucky

333
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,110
and can find

334
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,080
another client that is just as important...

335
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,350
But that won't be easy.

336
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,030
You need me?

337
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,110
How can I

338
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,440
deal with a difficult client?

339
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,910
That Karen again?

340
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,470
It...

341
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,710
won't be easy.

342
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,150
Just cut to the chase already.

343
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,550
Our branch needs to show some results.

344
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,470
Getting this client is absolutely crucial for me.

345
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,310
I can teach you

346
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,740
but it's more like an epiphany.

347
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,310
Epiphany?

348
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,940
Sounds esoteric.

349
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,550
I'm smart.

350
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,500
Try me.

351
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,380
Okay.

352
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,500
Youyou.

353
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,550
Slow down.

354
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,230
Slow down.

355
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,670
Hi, Ms. Fan.

356
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,310
You're the first one to come back to me

357
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,550
after getting shouted at.

358
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,550
Can we talk?

359
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,060
I want to see if my service
can be of assistance to you.

360
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,350
Well,

361
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,910
you can walk the dog for me.

362
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,910
I think I cannot handle this task as well

363
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,740
as professionals like a housekeeper
or a nanny.

364
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,980
But if you need financial advice,

365
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,740
I can help.

366
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,860
After I left,

367
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,620
I've been reflecting upon myself.

368
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,980
I'm not a good communicator.

369
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,550
Speaking as another woman,

370
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,620
I believe a steady flow of income

371
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,220
can bring you a sense of security.

372
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,430
I agree.

373
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,190
But I want the best service.

374
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,550
Why shouldn't I

375
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,830
consult an expert like Shao Moli?

376
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,590
Why should I go to you?

377
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,310
Don't you think?

378
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,550
Hi, Ms. Fan.

379
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,950
I'm Shao Moli.

380
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,500
I have looked at the risk evaluation report

381
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,670
you handed in.

382
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,710
Your household has two houses

383
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,100
worth up to ten million in total.

384
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,830
But they were bought

385
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,830
by your husband before you got married.

386
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,980
Half of the money was obtained from a mortgage.

387
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,380
Your child wants to study overseas in the future.

388
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,030
That costs at least one million.

389
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,070
However, you do not have a fixed income

390
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,340
nor do you have any investment.

391
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,950
You don't even have commercial insurance.

392
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,980
That means you have
no prior experience in investment

393
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,260
nor are you investment-savvy.

394
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,670
In my opinion,

395
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,590
An Yu is the best candidate for you.

396
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,860
She can understand your demand

397
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,670
and communicate effectively with you

398
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,830
to devise the best investment plan for you.

399
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,460
I see it now.

400
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,790
Both of you are working together.

401
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,910
I need time to think it through.

402
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,790
Oh, no!

403
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,910
What happened?

404
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,340
There's a problem with the portrait

405
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,590
we received.

406
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,950
What happened to it?

407
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,100
Please take a look.

408
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,670
We accidentally damaged it

409
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,980
during the delivery.

410
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,710
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,380
There's no use to apologize.

412
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,070
Give me my portrait back!

413
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,710
How about this?

414
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,140
According to the company's policy,

415
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,340
this is considered our mistake.

416
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,310
We can compensate you for thrice its price.

417
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,950
Thrice?

418
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,380
Yes.

419
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,550
Even one billion won't cut it!

420
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,070
This was meant for my son's birthday party.

421
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,590
Tomorrow is his birthday party.

422
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,220
How can I hang this portrait?

423
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,030
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,910
He's going overseas soon.

425
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,030
This is our last birthday party together.

426
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
What should I do?

427
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,670
Give me my portrait back!

428
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,500
Ms. Fan.

429
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
Calm down.

430
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,910
Let's find a solution together.

431
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,260
What solution?

432
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,710
Can you draw me a new portrait?

433
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,190
Can you?

434
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,380
I can help you.

435
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,260
Why are you staring at me?

436
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,860
Brush.

437
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,260
The thick one.

438
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,030
Palette.

439
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,340
Do it.

440
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,670
I'm not inspired.

441
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,830
What should we do then?

442
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,100
I don't know.

443
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,070
Then why did you tell her you would fix it?

444
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,310
If I didn't promise her that,

445
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,260
I wouldn't have had the opportunity
to find a solution.

446
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,740
But we shouldn't lie,

447
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,380
should we?

448
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,790
Otherwise, she would be disappointed.

449
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,140
Why don't you do it?

450
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,790
I can't draw.

451
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,550
I'm not inspired.

452
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,100
Maybe you can inspire me.

453
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,620
Do not horse around.

454
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,740
This portrait is very important

455
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,220
to Fan Meimei.

456
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,430
If you're not inspired,

457
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,100
then think

458
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,190
and mull it over.

459
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,790
Find your inspiration, okay?

460
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,980
Sure.

461
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,830
What are you doing?

462
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,430
To look for inspiration.

463
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,910
To look for inspiration?

464
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,310
To look for inspiration?

465
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,830
But where to?

466
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,620
Shao Moli.

467
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,950
You dragged me with you to buy ice cream

468
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,830
and to enjoy the view by the river.

469
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,710
Why are we in a park now?

470
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,260
To take in the fresh air.

471
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,310
Our brains need oxygen.

472
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,310
Follow me.

473
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,790
Breathe in.

474
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,030
Breathe out.

475
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,460
Let's say doing deep breaths

476
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,790
can give us inspiration.

477
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,830
Why should we do it in a park?

478
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,190
Trust me.

479
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,670
Just this once.

480
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,670
Okay?

481
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,430
Close your eyes.

482
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,030
Breathe in.

483
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,620
Breathe out.

484
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,340
Gather around, Apple Class!

485
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
Line up.

486
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,550
Look at

487
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,070
the grass, the trees, the sky, and the clouds.

488
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,030
Are they beautiful?

489
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,740
-Yes!
-Yes!

490
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,740
The ground is the Earth's veins.

491
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,550
The grass is the Earth's skin.

492
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
The water is the Earth's blood.

493
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,710
And so, we have to protect the Earth.

494
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,100
Protect the Earth and we can protect ourselves.

495
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,790
Do you know what we're supposed to do?

496
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,550
I know!

497
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,670
Tell us, Yiyi.

498
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,220
We have to care for the plants.

499
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,190
Do not break the branches

500
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
and do not litter.

501
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,460
We have to categorize our trash.

502
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,910
After using the tap,

503
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,950
we have to close it tightly.

504
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,430
Do not spit on the ground.

505
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,340
-How do you know they are here?
-Correct.

506
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,860
Bravo.

507
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,340
Who else knows?

508
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,340
I also know for Earth Day,

509
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,190
the teacher will bring the kids on an excursion.

510
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,070
Parents are excluded.

511
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,830
This is supposed

512
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,310
to be one of today's highlights.

513
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,620
But Fan Meimei appeared out of nowhere.

514
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,740
Thank you.

515
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,430
Let's go.

516
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,140
I'm just going to see him from afar.

517
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Why?

518
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,220
Isn't seeing and hugging Yiyi

519
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
your biggest wish?

520
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,030
I didn't hold myself back last time

521
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,670
and went to visit him in his kindergarten.

522
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,380
I ran into Mi Lu

523
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,380
and we fought.

524
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,830
I'm sure he thinks I'm a bad person now.

525
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,100
You shouldn't take what a kid says

526
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
to heart.

527
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,740
Perhaps

528
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,190
he had already forgotten about it.

529
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,500
I talked to the owner the other day

530
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,190
and I agree with her.

531
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,070
Kids are not ignorant.

532
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,460
They actually know everything

533
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,100
because they are sensitive.

534
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,550
I don't want to drag Yiyi

535
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,460
into the grudges between Mi Lu and me.

536
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,710
Let me show you a place.

537
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,550
Let's go.

538
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,430
Use the pincer.

539
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,340
Here.

540
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,500
Hi, everyone.

541
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,910
To thank you for your contributions
to our environment,

542
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,220
all of you will be given a balloon.

-I want one!
-I want one!

544
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,860
Say thank you, mister.

545
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,190
-Thank you, mister.
-Thank you, mister.

546
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
And you here.

547
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,620
You have a special gift.

548
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,460
Go ahead.

549
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,380
Help me, miss.

550
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,030
Thank you.

551
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,550
I want the SpongeBob SquarePants one.

552
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,910
Thank you.

553
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,190
You're very cute.

554
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,380
Can I hug you?

555
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,790
[Zhuoyue Finance]

556
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,550
I don't buy it.

557
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,740
You don't believe me?

558
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,620
Our glorious achievements

559
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,430
were written into Zhuoyue's annals.

560
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,620
I think you have spent too much time here.

561
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,910
Truth be told,

562
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,950
I quite like this place.

563
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,100
Why?

564
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,910
The freedom.

565
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,190
You don't have a boss hounding you every day

566
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,100
and there's no workplace politics.

567
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,950
I don't like those stuff.

568

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,860
Don't order anything.

571
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,310
I'll buy you dinner.

572

Why?

573

Because I want to.

574
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,380
For no reason at all.

575
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
What are you buying me then?

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,100
You came with supper?

590
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,710
We were planning to order a hotpot.

591
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,140
I don't have 

592
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,100
hotpot.

593
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,590
But it's similar.

594
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,190
I bought your favorite cold-served skewers

595
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,340
from that restaurant by the street.

596
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,070
I love that restaurant.

597
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,430
Let me introduce you to one another.

598
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,030
Even though both of you have met,

599
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,220
a proper introduction is due.

600
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,790
He's Li Zhou.

601
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,070
A colleague of mine

602
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,460
and a Chuanhe local.

603
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,310
And he's

604
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,100
Ye Kai.

605
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,100
Mr. Wolf's assistant.

606
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,830
My good buddy.

607
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
What buddy?

608
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,460
What did you say, Kai?

609
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,980
Nothing.

610
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,500
You're that staff member
who refused to leave Chuanhe Branch.

611
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,550
And you're the Wolf of Wall Street's

612
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,670
assistant.

613
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,710
Have you found the key?  

614
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,670
Who would have thought that Mr. Wolf's assistant

615
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,340
was a key thief?

616
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,220
How funny.

617
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,100
Kai was born in 1996.

618
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,590
He's one year older than us.

619
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,740
You're still a kid.

620
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,220
What do your parents do?

621
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,430
My father is a secondary school teacher

622
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,830
and my mother works in the tourism center.

623
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,030
How many family members do you have?

624
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,980
I have a younger sister.

625
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,860
Four in total.

626
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,550
A younger sister?

627
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,670
Interesting.

628
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,790
What sports do you like?

629
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,500
Basketball.

630
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,620

631

Why?

633
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,950
You like basketball too, Kai?

634
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,310

635
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,140
-Happily obliged.
-Me too.

636
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,860
How many exes do you have?

637
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,860
Kai, what are you talking about?

638
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,340
This is not some matchmaking event.

639

769

770
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,580

After words of comfort

779
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
or a simple favor,

780
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,970
the issue will become a non-issue.
