I will,

254
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,180

255
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,090

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,330

258
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,330
Tell Mommy.

259
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,970

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,900

261
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,060

262
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,580
Now,

263
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,900

264

Miss An "Mommy".

265
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,780

269
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,090
Mommy, don't cry.

270
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,060

271
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,020

Yiyi will be very blessed.

273
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,900

274
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,210

275
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,610
Sorry.

276
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,060
Had I stopped him in the first place

277
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,610
and told you the truth,

278
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,090
maybe things wouldn't have come to this.

279
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,940
Our life

280
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,900
would've been different.

281
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,180
Let bygones be bygones.

282
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,820
Just forget it.

283

284
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,940
let it go.

285
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,330

Start afresh.

290
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,060
Yiyi, what else do you want to say to Mommy?

291
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,780
Didn't you say a lot at home?

292
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,130
Yiyi.

293
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,970

303
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,130
I'll find them. Lock the door.

304
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,850
I'll lock it.

305
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,370

Here we go.

312
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,900
Are they here?

313
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I can't see.

314
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,330
An obstacle!

315
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,580
What are you doing here?

316
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
You must overcome

317
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,330
three obstacles to enter.

318
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,090

319
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,370
What are they?

320
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,300
First,

321
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,820
guess which is the bride's lip print
in 30 seconds.

Wrong.

327
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,450
Wrong again.

328
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,540
Bros,

329
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,700
what should we do if someone is in the way?

330
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,130
Dear.

331
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,850
Who is it?

332
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,660
It's me.

333
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,850
Who are you?

334
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Your husband.

335
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,610
Husband?

336
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,450
We don't have a man called Husband here.

337
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,540
Dear, I'm here to pick you up.

338
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,370
Open quickly.

339
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,370
Who are you?

340
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,780
Open and you get red packets.

341
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,610
Red... Red packets.

342
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,300
What's your wife's name? What's her name?

343
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,820
Jin Lailai.

344

407
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,700
I might

409
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,020
The first thing was

410

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,660
Happy wedding!

519
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,620
(Dear Shao Moli,)

520
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,980
(I like to call you by your full name.)

521
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,180
(I feel a special closeness doing that.)

522
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,500
(Suddenly, I want to write you a love letter.)

523
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,460
(I firmly believe this is a love letter.)

524
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,900
(It is full of everlasting love.)

525
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,380
(Amid a familiar and sweet melody)

526
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,900
(is your slightly upturned mouth,)

527
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,700
(cute and bright as you,)

528
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,820
(and innocent and gentle as you.)

529
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,100
(The natural you)

530
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
(brought me my long-lost happiness)

531
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,300
(and even made me believe
if there is love in the heart,)

532
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,660
(I'll one day be surrounded by love.)

533
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,180
(I can't control my love for you.)

534
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,980
(I can't reject the feeling
of warmth in my fingertips.)

535
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,780
(Remember our conversation
at the hot spring hotel?)

536
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,980
(It surprised me.)

537
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,260
(Why is there another me in the world,)

538
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,540
(living in another body?)

539
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,620
(Later I found out that we are so similar)

540
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,620
(that it can only be because we are from one soul.)

541
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,100
(We met and knew each other.)

542
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,660
(We fell in love, as fated,)

543
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,740
(never-ending.)

544
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,500
(That is because we are originally one entity.)

545
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,060
(Looking back at my past,)

546
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,140
(had I not met you,)

547
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,980
(I don't know if I'd still be in that deep valley.)

548
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,460
(Your presence always makes me stupefied.)

549
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,820
(Is the dream real,)

550
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,140
(or is life too much like a dream?)

551
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,460
(In the past, every time I woke up from my dreams,)

552
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,180
(I always wondered)

553
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,780
(who was the face under the mask?)

554
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,940
(Was it you who have always protected me)

555
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,990
(or was I unwilling to bow to fate?)

556
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,260
(I understand now)

557
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,780
(that love and courage
are the true meaning of the Dark Knight.)

558
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,020
(As time goes by, everything will fade away.)

559
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,300
(Only the days soaked in love)

560
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,420
(will glitter in the long river of time.)

561
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,180
(I'm grateful to have you.)

562
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
(The heart is free and the world
is striking and beautiful).

563
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,260
(To us, the brave ones.)

564
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,740
