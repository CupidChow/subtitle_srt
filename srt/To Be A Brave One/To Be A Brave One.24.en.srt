why didn't you save him?

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,080
I only found this SD card

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,630
when I was clearing out my things

58
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,240
after I got back in the country.

During that time,

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,630
I was doing business abroad.

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
I was flying around.

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
So, my housekeeper overlooked

63
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,520
this voicemail.

64

I wouldn't sit back and do nothing.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,670
Is this recording

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,240
related to the acquisition of Yimi Capital?

68
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,760
I had known An Wenbin for more than 20 years.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,670
I knew him best.

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
He was a very cautious man.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,440
He rarely

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
made any mistakes.

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
But his biggest weakness was

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,550
that when he trusted someone,

75
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,390
he would unconditionally trust that person.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
Are you saying

77
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,600
that An Wenbin's mistake

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,000
was trusting Zhou Yuan?

79
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,110
Yes.

80
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,720
No matter how I think about it,

81
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,480
Zhou Yuan is the most suspicious one.

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,200
After something happened to An Wenbin,

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,950
he's the only one benefiting from it.

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Does An Yu know about this?

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,920
I didn't tell her because I was worried

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
that it would be too much for her.

87
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm telling you this now

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,760
to let you know

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,880
that not only Zhou Yuan is my enemy,

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,920
but he may also be An Yu's enemy.

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,070

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
And acquiring Yimi Capital

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,950
is the best way to do that.

95
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,880
This is what An Yu lost.

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,600
You should get it back for her.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
You are looking at a top-quality South Sea pearl.

When Ms. Lu came here last time,

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,790
she tried this one.

102
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,670
I could tell

that she really liked it.

104
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,230
If you buy this for her,

Saw through me?

Don't you have any secrets?

Actually, it's easy to see through me.

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,320
that you are going to show me soon.

173
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,550
What good news?

174
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
(Hongxing Telecom has managed
to sign a contract with the Middle East)

(It may affect
the petroleum exploration industry globally.)

177
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,590
So, the black technology

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,520
that you talked about is true.

179
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,320
Congratulations.

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,910
You are so furious.

181
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,550
But you can still smile.

182
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,590
As expected,

183
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,110
you live up to your name.

184
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,280
You are like an abyss.

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,550
You are unfathomable.

186
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm quite surprised.

187
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,710
But I don't regret it.

188
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,150
We are people

189
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,760
of different aspirations.

190
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
That's right.

191
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,960
We are people of different aspirations.

192
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Back then, I did invite you to be my partner.

193
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,910
But luckily,

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,080
you didn't believe in me.

195
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,320
Shao Moli.

196
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,080
This is not the end yet.

197
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,670
We don't know

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,910
who will laugh last yet.

199
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,030
Moon. Are you looking for me?

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,350
I need you to investigate something for me.

201
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,960
But you have to promise me

202
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,000
that you'll keep it a secret

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,790
from anyone.

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,400
I have to keep it a secret?

205
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,760
Including Miss Yu and my father?

206
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,790
Yes.

207
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,320
Fine.

208
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,590
Since this is your first time
asking me for a favor

209
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,110
after knowing me for so long,

210
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,110
I'll help you.

211
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,230
Do you like it?

212
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,110
I like it.

213
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,400
The color is so nice.

214
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,790
Here.

215
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,760
Let me put it on for you, okay?

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,350
Okay.

217
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,910
(Hongxing Telecom has managed
to sign a contract with the Middle East)

218
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,550
(thanks to their newly developed semiconductor.)

219
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,110
(It may affect
the petroleum exploration industry globally.)

220
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,230
What happened?

221
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,670
They look good on you.

222
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
You've seen the news already?

223
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,280
Yes.

224
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,960
What's wrong?

225
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,550
When he talked about that black technology,

226
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,080
I already had a bad feeling about it.

227
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,470
Do you remember me warning you about it back then?

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Now that Hongxing Telecom

229
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,880
is in their grasp,

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,760
Yimi Capital has no leverage on Zhuoyue.

231
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

232
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,150
But so what?

233
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,200
Even though we are in this situation,

234
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,230
I haven't lost.

235
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,590
I had still sold the shares of Hongxing Telecom

236
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,230
back to them with triple the price.

237
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,550
You should've told me about it

238
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,080
when you found out.

239
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
But you celebrated with me when you came back.

240
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,230
You...

241
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,520
You know it now, right?

242
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,710
I just wanted to buy you a present

243
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,030
and celebrate it with you.

244
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,840
What did I do wrong?

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
So, I've spoiled the mood.

246
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
We can celebrate again

247
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,880
when the two of us

248
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,520
can face each other with sincerity

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,790
and honesty.

250
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,590
I'll go back to the room first.

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,590
Yu.

252
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,520
Look.

253
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,910
Now that we've saved the factory,

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,790
[Thank you, Zhuoyue Group, Hongxing Telecom Team]
I feel more energetic now. Even the food is good.

255
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,670
Today, I purposely told the canteen

256
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,400
to prepare food that tastes like gratitude.

257
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,350
No wonder the food smells so good.

258
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,880
By the way,

259
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,470
why isn't Shao Moli here yet?

260
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
We should call him

261
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,080
and ask him where he is.

262
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,280
If he's still not here,

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
the food will get cold.

264
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,760
Yes.

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
If he's still not here,
the smell of gratitude will be gone.

266
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,710
That's right.

267
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I'll tell him to hurry up.

268
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,230
He's not picking up.

269
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,000
Hello, Ye Kai.

270
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,320
An Yu.

271
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,230
Have you seen Shao?

272
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,000
No.

273
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,470
I thought he was with you.

274
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,110
I'm looking for him too.

275
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,550
We agreed to eat

276
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,470
at Hongxing Telecom's canteen today.

277
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,710
Everyone wants to take this chance to thank us.

278
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,670
But he's nowhere to be found.

279
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,080
Shao is unreliable.

280
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,440
But he won't do that to you.

281
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,790
That's not how he rolls.

282
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,910
I'll continue to look for him.

283
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,110
I'll call you when I find him.

284
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay then.

285
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,670
How is it?

286
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,670
Mr. Ma,

287
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,760
let's eat first.

288
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,710
We can eat while we wait for him.

289
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,320
Okay.

290
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,320
Let's eat then.

291
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,150
By the way,

292
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,520
I have

293
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,000
prepared a small gift for the two of you.

294
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,150
I designed these myself.

295
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,590
I crafted them at the factory.

296
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,000
But they are way better than what is sold outside.

297
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,110
I've installed

298
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,550
the Sirius induction nucleus

299
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,420
from our factory into them.

300
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,780
When you light up one of them,

301
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,300
the other one will sense it.

302
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,220
You'll each take one with you.

303
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,050
No matter how far apart you are,

304
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,300
they'll still work.

305
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,050
That's so magical.

306
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,930
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

307
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,610
I'll try them out later

308
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,020
to see if they'll work or not.

309
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,050
They'll definitely work.

310
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,980
Let's eat.

311
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,300
Moon.

312
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,668
[Administration for Industry and Commerce]
Four years ago, An Wenbin's company

313
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,979
was called Xingchen Financial.

314
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,810
The contract that got him into trouble

315
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,490
was signed with a company
called Kaiyuan Trading.

316
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,730
The real person who was in control

317
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,300
of Kaiyuan Trading was Wang Kai.

318
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,810
He was the one who accused An Wenbin of fraud

319
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,900
and the key witness.

320
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,100
Okay.

321
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,730
I just came out from the Administration
for Industry and Commerce.

322
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,340
I found out that Kaiyuan Trading

323
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,420
closed down within half a year after the case.

324
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,700
But I already know

325
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,250
the location of their previous office.

326
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,540
I'll head over there right now

327
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,820
to see if I can find any clues.

328
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,210
I will sift through the ex-employees
of Kaiyuan Trading as well

329
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,940
to see if I can find any other clues from them.

330
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,940
I went to get some water just now.

331
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,300
How's Fangfang been doing lately?

332
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,490
He's doing much better now.

333
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,900
That's good.

334
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,900
You must be tired after all these days.

335
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:42,940
I'm fine.

336
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,540
As long as Fangfang is doing well.

337
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay.

338
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,300
You need to rest as well.

339
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:47,970
Don't worry.

340
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,850
I'm fine.

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,250
Mr. Shao?

511
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,940
This is Chengxin Law Firm.

512
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,090
I checked the saved files.

513
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,210
Four years ago,

514
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,210
Kaiyuan Trading had hired us

515
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,970
to deregister their company.

516
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,660
These are the documents
that can be disclosed legally.

517
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,700
Please take a look.

518
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,660
As for the company's situation
and operation data,

519
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,820
[Deregistration of Kaiyuan Trading]
we can't

520
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,700
provide it to you due to client confidentiality.

521
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,180
Do you still remember
the legal representative of Kaiyuan Trading,

522
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,250
Wang Kai?

523
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,730
I think he was ill

524
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,300
and had to go abroad to get treatment.

525
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,450
Thank you.

526
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,060
Lailai's desserts.

527
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,660
Yay.

528
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,940
Taste of happiness.

529
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,540
Yay.

530
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,250
I'm back.

531
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Sorry for disturbing you.

532
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,090
An'an, don't go.

533
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,900
Welcome

534
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,450
to Jin Lailai's dessert shop.

535
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,330
You'll get rich after you eat it.

536
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,490
Sorry for disturbing you.

537
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,180
Look at the desserts I made.

538
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,940
Dessert shop?

539
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,700
Yes.

540
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,660
You made these?

541
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,780
An'an, let me tell you.

542
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,850
I already have the business plan in mind.

543
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,090
In the first year,
I'll have over 1,000 chain stores.

544
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,090
In the second year, I'll get listed on
the National Equities Exchange and Quotations.

545
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,780
In the third year, I'll become a listed company.

546
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,540
And the pain point of our business

547
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,490
is the people in the city
are under great pressure

548
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,940
and everyone needs some dopamine.

549
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,820
Give it a taste.

550
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,210
Everyone needs some dopamine?

551
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,490
That is a nice slogan.

552
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,330
I'll give it a try.

553
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,250
I'll get each of you a cup of flower tea.

554
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,090
Thank you.

555
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,130
How is it?

556
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,250
Have you had it?

557
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,300
I ate each of them the whole day.

558
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,610
What's wrong with her?

559
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,330
I don't know.

560
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,180
When she came back,
she kept talking about the phrase,

561
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,420
"One can become successful with accomplishment

562
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,660
in any industry or profession."

563
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,300
I can't take it anymore.

564
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,060
Has she given up on being the CFA?

565
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,420
Is she going to quit from Zhuoyue?

566
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,490
Maybe she wants to start her own business

567
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,940
because she's too sad.

568
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:09,730
Let's not

569
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,490
pop her bubble first.

570
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,610
I'll take care of her.

571
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,730
Okay.

572
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,610
Isn't it tasty?

573
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,020
Once you eat it,

574
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,210
you feel so happy.

575
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,330
Your flower tea will be served soon.

576
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,490
Not bad.

577
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,420
Lailai, when did you learn how to bake?

578
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,780
An'an, hurry up and help me

579
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,130
write a business proposal.

580
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,850
How can I convince Mr. Wolf

581
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,820
to invest in me?

582
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,020
An'an.

583
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,450
Hurry up and call Mr. Wolf.

584
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,300
Ask him to come back and taste my desserts.

585
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,020
Okay.

586
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,180
Hello?

587
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,970
Hello, Shao Moli.

588
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,850
Where are you?

589
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,610
I'm meeting someone at a cafe.

590
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,210
We are at home.

591
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,970
Lailai has made some desserts.

592
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,180
She wants you to try them out.

593
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,660
Besides that,

594
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,850
we want to discuss some plans with you.

595
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,970
Mr. Wolf.

596
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,060
Come back and taste my desserts.

597
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,820
I think I'll be late.

598
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,730
Don't wait for me.

599
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,940
Rest earlier.

600
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,900
Okay.

601
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,850
Bye.

602
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,900
Okay. Bye.

603
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm sorry.

604
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,370
We'll be closing in 30 minutes.

605
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,370
Do you want to order anything else?

606
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,420
I'm fine. Thank you.

607
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,490
By the way,

608
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,300
I need to send an e-mail.

609
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,020
Well...

610
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,940
I'll leave you guys to it.

611
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,370
Okay.

612
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,420
Why do I feel that Shao Moli
has been acting strange lately?

613
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,540
He leaves before the sun is up.

614
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,300
And I don't know what time he comes back.

615
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,130
I haven't seen him for days.

616
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,730
Don't you think he's been acting weird?

617
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,250
Maybe he has a huge surprise

618
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,490
for An'an.

619
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:10,097
A kind of mega surprise

620
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,020
that you don't even know about.

621
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,090
So, he wants to let An Yu unwind?

622
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,180
Maybe.

623
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,070
[Yes! No!]

624
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,620
[Courage and Freedom]

625
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,700
[Husky]

626
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,800
[Yes]

627
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,330
There are so many people here.

628
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,060
Looks like

629
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,660
everyone

630
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,700
cares a lot about courage and freedom.

631
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,210
What do you think?

632
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,780
I think

633
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,450
it takes

634
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,850
a lot of courage to be free.

635
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,130
I think you are right.

636
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,660
What about you?

637
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,450
I think

638
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,330
that when your heart is free,
the world will be beneath you.

639
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,130
What do you mean?

640
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,660
It means

641
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,970
that if your heart is big enough,

642
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,660
you'll have freedom all across the world.

643
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,610
Then,

644
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,740
how big should my heart be?

645
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,900
To put it the way you'd put it,

646
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,710
it'll depend on how much courage you have.

647
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,870
Hello?

648
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,260
I'm sorry that I stood you up last night.

649
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,750
I hadn't made up my mind yet.

650
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,540
Are you calling me now

651
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,870
because you've made up my mind?

652
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,590
Yes.

653
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,830
When are you free?

654
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,900
I'll send you a location.

655
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,710
I'll see you in half an hour.

656
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,710
Okay.

657
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,750
What's wrong?

658
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,630
Shao Moli.

659
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,750
Whenever something is wrong,

660
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,540
you won't be able

661
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,780
to look me in the eyes.

662
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,470
You are coming up with a solution, right?

663
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,500
And you'll touch your nose with your hand.

664
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,900
You can't hide anything from me.

665
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,070
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,260
I need to leave because I have something to do.

667
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,020
How big should my heart be

668
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,220
to forgive my boyfriend for standing me up?

669
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,220
I'm sorry.

670
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,540
But I really have to go.

671
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,390
Two choices.

672
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,390
I can either watch it myself today,

673
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,540
or we can come back again.

674
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,700
We can come back again.

675
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,190
Let's go then.

676
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,700
Ignore me.

677
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,670
Let me suffer by myself.

678
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,500
Ms. Mi, please take a seat.

679
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,830
I already told Mr. Zhou about the situation.

680
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,150
He can tell you about it.

681
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,670
These are my father's shares when he founded

682
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,630
Zhuoyue.

683
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,540
When he left Zhuoyue,

684
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,870
he left his shares to me.

685
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,980
I just received a notification
from the bank today.

686
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,700
This equity succession agreement

687
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,830
has been kept in the bank.

688
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,390
The retention period is 20 years.

689
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,670
It ended

690
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
yesterday.

691
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,500
Not only is the retention period 20 years,

692
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,350
but the effective period is also 20 years.

693
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,430
It means

694
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,220
[Equity Succession Agreement]
that this equity succession agreement

695
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,020
is effective starting from yesterday.

696
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,500
Mr. Zhou's father had

697
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,670
a total of 1,328,334 shares.

698
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,350
At that time, he owned

699
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,780
a total of 34.4% of the company's shares.

700
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,220
Of course,

701
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,980
after 20 years,

702
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,980
Zhuoyue has accepted more and more investors.

703
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,070
Due to share dilution,

704
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,830
these shares

705
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,300
make up a total of 9.3%

706
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
of Zhuoyue's current shares.

707
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,910
According to Zhuoyue's current
share distribution,

708
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,500
Mr. Zhou is now
the fourth biggest shareholder of Zhuoyue.

709
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,430
Okay, Mr. Qin.

710
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,190
We fully understand the agreement.

711
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,220
Thank you.

712
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,350
Okay.

713
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,500
I'll leave you to it.

714
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,670
Goodbye.

715
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,740
Did you hear that?

716
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,670
I'm the fourth biggest shareholder
of Zhuoyue now.

717
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,500
I've been waiting for Yimi Capital to grow

718
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,460
so that I can

719
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,020
face Lin Zhanhong one day.

720
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,460
I never thought that day would come so soon.

721
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,980
Lin Zhanhong.

722
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,350
Finally, I don't have to wait anymore.
