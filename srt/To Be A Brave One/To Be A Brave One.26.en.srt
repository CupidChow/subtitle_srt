the main thing about this report

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
Walk backward.

that it's the weekend tomorrow.

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,110
I'll bring Yiyi to the park

228

I have made up

234
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,440

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,110
that once you do this,

238
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
there's no way we can ever forgive you again?

239
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,470
You might lose all of us,

240
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,520
including Yiyi.

241
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,550
I've considered that too.

243
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,400

I know I have let you down,

245
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,320
but this is the only thing I can do now.

246
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,150
Zhou Yuan is going through a liquidation?

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
The funding chain has ruptured.

248
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,910
After the incident,

249
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,150
Zhou Yuan made an announcement
at the press conference,

250
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,960
saying that he would stay with us
through all difficulties,

251
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,880
but what actually happened

252
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,520
was that he stopped investing
any money in the project.

253
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,840
Soul App didn't manage to stick around.

254
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,470
It has been two weeks since we shut it down.

255
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,470
Besides,

256
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,640
most of our programmers
have tendered their resignations,

257
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,840
including the one who founded
the application with me.

258
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,470
An Yu.

259
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,520
Mr. Shao.

260
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,670
Please.

261
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,960
Please save Soul App.

262
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,320
Please save this project.

263
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,640
I've always thought

264
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
that Soul App was a very good invention.

265
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,790
I believe that the project
speaks for the founder.

266
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,440
The founder of Soul App

267
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,590
is definitely someone
who wants to spread kindness to the world.

268
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,230
That's why

269
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,640
he deserves a second chance.

270
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,640
In fact,

271
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,320
my dad was in town to pay me a visit recently.

272
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,710
I mentioned this to him.

273
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,280
He told me,

274
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,280
we shouldn't be ashamed of making mistakes.

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,670
What we should be ashamed of
is making the same mistake repeatedly.

276
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,640
I did make a mistake

277
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,840
this time.

278
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,230
And I want to turn over a new leaf.

279
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,710
Thank you.

280
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,030
How about this?

281
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,710
I'm working

282
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,520
on the Smart Desk project.

283
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,030
I'm very keen on adding a new plug-in

284
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,320
that will make it easier
for the left-behind children

285
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,590
to make calls to their parents.

286
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,350
I wonder if Soul App

287
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,840
can collaborate with Smart Desk.

288
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course.

289
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,470
Our team can attempt

290
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,320
to install the plug-in feature

291
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,550
without changing the overall system.

292
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm also volunteering

293
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,710
to do it for free.

294
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,520
Well, that's great.

295
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,400
I think it's a very good concept.

296
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,790
When I was younger,

297
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,030
my dad was always away.

298
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,710
If this

299
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,640
can revive Soul App

300
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,280
and help with the launching of Smart Desk,

301
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
I would like to donate all the profit
I make through Soul App in the future

302
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,200
to the left-behind children
who come from poor families

303
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,110
and Hope Primary Schools.

304
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,670
I hope that they can own their own Smart Desks.

305
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,790
Mr. Shao.

306
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,320
You looked so frustrated

307
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,550
when you were playing Gomoku with Xiaoshu.

308
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,320
Tell you what?

309
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,670
I was really frustrated.

310
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
You look quite cute

311
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,710
when you are frustrated.

312
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,960
That's not true.

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,640
It's true.

314
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,080
Let me take a photo of you

315
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
-and turn it into a sticker.
-I can't do it.

316
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
You can do this.

317
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,440
That's too much.

318
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,440
Is it that bad?

319
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,320
Are you really a husky?

320
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,880
You always try to dismiss things

321
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,960
with a few barks.

322
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,760
Why does it always come at the wrong time?

323
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
Then, should I answer it?

324
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,700
[Zhou Yuan]

325
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,760
Hey.

326
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,640
An Yu.

327
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,150
Yiyi has been saying

328
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,640
that he misses the pretty lady.

329
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you think

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
we can go to the park together

331
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,840
with Yiyi tomorrow?

332
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,880
Don't worry.

333
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,670
I have already spoken

334
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,790
to Mi Lu.

335
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,840
She won't have any objection.

336
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,960
After all, you're Yiyi's mom.

337
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,000
From now on,

338
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,860
you can bring Yiyi out every weekend.

339
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,460
Every weekend?

340
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,540
Yes.

341
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,220
All right.

342
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,780
Okay. That's our deal.

343
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,980
Bye.

344
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,860
That's quite abrupt.

345
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,370
Did he just realize

346
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,420
his mistake?

347
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,100
This was a little too unexpected.

348
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,660
But I'll get to see Yiyi

349
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,460
every weekend from now on.

350
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,730
It's worth celebrating.

351
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,370
Madam.

352
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Is he here again?

353
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,020
I told him many times,

354
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,850
but he still insisted on coming.

355
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,060
He sends us a bouquet of flowers
every time he is here.

356
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,700
We now feel bad to ask him to leave.

357
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,300
I got it.

358
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,300
He's quite a nice guy.

359
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,540
Maybe you should give him a chance.

360
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,580
He was stunned for a moment.

361
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,730
Then, he gave a bow

362
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,450
and said,

363
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
"Miss Fairy.

364
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,020
I get to witness your beauty today,

365
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,090
and now, I'll die with no regrets."

366
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,580
"Doesn't Miss Fairy feel lonely

367
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,940
staying here alone, away from everyone else?"

368
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,090
The gems in the eyes of the jade statue...

369
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,300
Ms. Fang.

370
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,250
Ms. Fang.

371
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,970
I have no other intention.

372
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,490
I only want to read some stories for Chen Fang.

373
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,420
I like reading Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils,

374
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,900
and I have no friends who share my interest.

375
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,850
Chen Fang and I share the same interest.

376
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,060
Don't ever come here again.

377
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,060
Bring those with you.

378
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,300
Hi, Mr. Peng.

379
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,940
Mr. Peng, we just bought some investment...

380
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,780
Wait a minute.

381
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,660
Someone else is interested in that unit too.

382
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,850
Just give me

383
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,970
a few minutes.

384
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,580
Sorry.

385
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,900
Hey.

386
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,580
Half a million?

387
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,300
You can offer more?

388
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,130
We are not going to bargain with you either.

389
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,180
We won't bargain with you.

390
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,370
My tenant said that he wouldn't bargain with me.

391
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,970
I should prioritize my tenant, right?

392
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,130
You used to live in the same area too?

393
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,300
You are attached to the neighborhood?

394
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,370
Sure.

395
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,970
Bye.

396
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,780
Sure.

397
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
See.

398
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,780
I wanted to sell it to you initially.

399
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,940
However, he is keen on buying this unit,

400
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,730
and he offers a higher price.

401
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,020
That puts me in a very difficult position.

402
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,250
We just bought a new investment product.

403
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,900
It needs another half a year
before we can withdraw it.

404
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,130
Now, we have 450,000 yuan.

405
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,900
Can you still sell the unit to us?

406
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,940
I'm in a dilemma.

407
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,020
That is the best the two of us can offer.

408
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,420
Are you married?

409
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:33,970
Yes.

410
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,820
We just got married.

411
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,490
We are here in the city,
working hard for our future.

412
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
It's not easy for us.

413
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,370
There were so many people out there,
but we ran into each other.

414
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,210
We have made this place our home.

415
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,580
We really enjoy living here.

416
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,540
If we lose this home,

417
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,610
we will go back to being a homeless couple.

418
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,450
You must have had a tough time.

419
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,250
How about this?

420
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,540
Let's meet up.

421
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,900
If what you said is true,

422
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,850
I will sell the unit to you.

423
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,020
Sure.

424
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,940
Thank you, Mr. Peng.

425
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,540
Thank you.

426
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,730
Thanks, Mr. Peng.

427
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,780
No worries.

428
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,540
We shouldn't be lying, right?

429
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,420
Are we lying?

430
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,210
Did we lie?

431
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,370
Bride and groom, please look here.

432
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,420
Show me a wider smile.

433
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,540
Wider.

434
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,250
Look at me, miss.

435
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,820
Sir, please look at the bride.

436
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,060
Look at her affectionately.

437
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,850
Great.

438
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,730
Good job.

439
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,300
Now move closer to each other.

440
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,180
There are more here.

441
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,180
This is our latest collection.

442
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,330
Do you want to try it on?

443
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,900
Try it on.

444
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,940
What do you think?

445
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,730
Looks good.

446
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,020
Do you like it?

447
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,330
Kai,

448
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,490
I think it's not that pretty.

449
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,420
It is so small

450
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,580
but so expensive.

451
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,700
It's not worth the money at all. Forget it.

452
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,130
After all, we will return it in two days.

453
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,780
Just wear it for two days.

454
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,250
We'll take it.

455
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,330
Thanks.

456
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,820
Who are you drawing?

457
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,610
I'm drawing the pretty lady.

458
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,450
Me?

459
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,210
They seem like they are really close.

460
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:00,970
Yes.

461
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Because I like you a lot.

462
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,700
What did you just say?

463
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,900
I like you.

464
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,180
I like you too, Yiyi.

465
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,780
Madam.

466
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,300
I want to play with those kids.

467
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,940
Go ahead.

468
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Be careful.

469
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,580
Sure.

470
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,300
Be careful.

471
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,970
Are you done yet?

472
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,730
All done!

473
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,450
One. Two. Three. Go!

474
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,940
He forgot his water bottle.

475
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,330
I'm here to send him the water bottle.

476
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,130
Hey.

477
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,700
Why didn't you answer the phone?

478
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,250
What's the matter?

479
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,900
Your family called me.

480
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,450
They said they couldn't get ahold of you.

481
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,300
Your grandma passed away.

482
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,370
One. Two. Three.

483
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,580
-Hey.
-Hello?

484
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,820
Is this Shao Moli?

485
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,060
Speaking.

486
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,090
Who are you?

487
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,090
I'm Ding.

488
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,300
Zhou Yuan's driver.

489
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,850
I'll see you at Jiangbin Road

490
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
later at 8 PM.

491
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,970
If Zhou Yuan wants to meet me,

492
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,660
he can approach me personally.

493
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,090
It's not him.

494
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,970
I want to meet you.

495
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,940
He fell asleep.

496
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,450
-Here.
-He fell asleep.

497
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,210
He must have had a long day.

498
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
He fell asleep.

499
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,850
He...

500
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,090
He enjoyed himself today.

501
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
Did Mi Lu

502
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,580
make things difficult for you?

503
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,490
It was fine.

504
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,490
She received a call

505
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,850
and she didn't look quite well after that.

506
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,060
Her grandmother passed away today.

507
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,180
She is back in her hometown now.

508
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,700
I will settle Yiyi down

509
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,130
and I'll meet her there tomorrow.

510
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,700
My condolences.

511
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,060
The agreement still stands.

512
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,420
You can take Yiyi out

513

-Yeah.

-You can head home now.
-Bye.

518
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,940
You want to teach Zhou Yuan a lesson, right?

519
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,610
So Zhou Yuan found out about this?

520
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,540
You haven't found the evidence, right?

521
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,370
I don't know

522
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,490
why you have a beef with him.

523
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,210
And I can't be bothered.

524

However, you might find this useful.

525

526
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,300
Why are you helping me?

527
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,370
Did Zhou Yuan send you here?

528
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,700
I'm not here to help you.

529
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,130
No one sent me here either.

530
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,420
I only have one request.

531

[Xingchen Financial 2015 Financial Report]

534
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,090
I just received a document.

535
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,940
It was a few main projects invested by Zhou Yuan

536
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,660
when he first joined Xingchen Financial.

537
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,180
All of them were traps.

538
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,250
That also made Xingchen Financial

539
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,250
lose a great amount of money.

540
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,850
Our hypothesis was right.

541
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,450

Why did you ask to see me?

548
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,850
All right.

549
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,730
There's something

550
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,420
I've been wanting to tell you,

551
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,420
but I never had the chance to do so.

552
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,540
I spent a long time pondering upon this

553
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,780
and I thought I should inform you about this.

554

won't allow me to smoke either.

567
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,540
To be honest,

568
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,660
something went wrong

569

with the company's operation.

570
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,450
It's a major issue.

571
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,020
I have no idea

572
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,780
how the company ended up like this.

573
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,820
I really want to save the company.

00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,900
if I did the right thing.

578
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,300
I've never been this torn.

But I don't know who I should call.

585
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,420
Just take it as me ranting.

586
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,970
That's all I know

about what happened at that time.

588
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,540
I know

589
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
it must be hard for you to accept this news.

590
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,060
You will need time to digest this.

591

Although

592
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,970
it has been many years,

I still remain skeptical.

594
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,820
It didn't make much sense to me.

595
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,700
I didn't realize how scheming
Zhou Yuan was

596

00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,230
Cheer up.

598
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,710

if you need any help.

Thanks, Mr. Lin.

601

Thank you for telling me this.

Shao Moli

603
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,070
has heard this recording too.

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
I thought he would relay the message to you,

605
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,630
but please don't get him wrong.

606
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,350
He only did that

607
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,590
because he didn't want to make you sad.

608
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
He knew about this too?

609
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,660
I didn't expect him to keep this secret so well.

610
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,380
He actually kept everything to himself.

611
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,380
He's quite a responsible man.

612
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,500
What's the matter?

613
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
What's wrong?

614
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,230
You knew

615
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,990
about what Zhou Yuan did all this time.

616
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,590
Did Lin Zhanhong tell you that?

617
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,260
Why did you hide it from me?

618
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,830
I have nothing to hide from you.

619
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,420
I only did that

620
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,750
because I didn't know how to break it to you.

621
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,660
I had no idea

622
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,020
how you would react

623
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,540
after you found out about it.

624
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,110
Do you know that this involved my dad?

625
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,110
I only did that because it involved your dad.

626
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,630
I need more time to get to the bottom of it.

627
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,670
Everything just didn't make sense,

628
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,220
including Lin Zhanhong's attitude.

629
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,150
Why did he pick this time to bring this up?

630
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,020
Why did he inform me before you?

631
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,670
And why did he decide to tell you about it now?

632
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,630
Have you found anything?

633
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,670
Don't worry about me.

634
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,500
This is not the right time to be weak.

635
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,940
I must get to the bottom of this.

636
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,540
The last person who signed these proposals

637
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,460
is Mr. An.

638
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,590
However, Zhou Yuan

639
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,630
was the initiator and handler

640
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,780
of all projects.

641
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,740
This means that Zhou Yuan
was involved in all the issues

642
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,870
related to the projects

643
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,590
that Xingchen Financial invested in.

644
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,540
It might be a coincidence

645
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,940
if it happened once,

646
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,740
but the same issue kept repeating itself.

647
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,350
Where did you get

648
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,350
this information?

649
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,590
It's from Ding.

650
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,430
Zhou Yuan's driver?

651
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,780
He has been working for Zhou Yuan for many years.

652
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,870
Why would he do this?

653
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,500
I've no idea too,

654
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,500
but the only thing he told me

655
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,980
was to never hurt Mi Lu

656
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,390
no matter what I was going to do to Zhou Yuan.

657
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,740
By the way,

658
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,910
do you remember this man named Wang Kai?

659
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,026
[Wang Kai]
He was the whistleblower

660
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,393
of the contract fraud case.

661
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,540
The contract Mr. An signed

662
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,020
was a contract with his company, Kaiyuan Trading.

663
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,220
I don't know who he is.

664
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,700
I don't remember

665
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,430
seeing him before.

666
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,260
We only found very little information
about this man.

667
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,630
The only thing I can confirm now

668
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,110
is that he left the country four years ago
for his pancreatic cancer treatment.

669
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,070
I have asked Fei'er

670

to help me with the investigation.

671
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,430
I haven't got any answer yet.
