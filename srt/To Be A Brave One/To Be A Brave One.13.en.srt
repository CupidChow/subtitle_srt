[Episode 13]

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,950
I have something to tell you.

19
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,480
That little trouble maker, Ice Cream.

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,760
An'an! It's me and Ye Kai!

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,910
How strong is she?

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,760
She actually managed to move
the clothes rack all the way here.

23
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,310
You seem to be eating well lately.

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,120
You've gotten fat again.

25
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,160
That's right.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,630
What were you saying just now?

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,440
You and Ye Kai...

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,190
Me and Ye Kai...

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,720
Me and Ye Kai...

Real Madrid will win the UEFA Champions League.

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,910
Since when did you start watching football?

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,110
An'an, you wanted to tell me something, right?

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,110
Hush. I think I know.

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,270
Did something electrifying happen

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,360
at the hot spring resort

while you two were being alone there?

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,470
Oh, God! Old man!

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,670
Someone's jumped!

40
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,750
-Look!
-Where?

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,190
Your eyesight is so bad.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,360
That's just a kid's toy.

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,910
No...

44
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,110
It's not moving. See?

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,720
Someone really jumped.

46
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,000
What's wrong with your eyesight?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
Look over there!

48
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,880
It's not moving at all.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,190
It's a toy.

50
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,270
It's moving!

51
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,600
Is it?

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,910
You're right.

53
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,360
Ye Kai?

54
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,800
You're back.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
Why is your nose bleeding?

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,880
It must be the heat lately.

57
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,670
Why are you wearing that?

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
It's been a while since I went to the zoo.

59
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,160
I miss the crocodiles.

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,670
What about you?

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,520
Why are you already back?

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Aren't you supposed to be out till afternoon?

63
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,630
Are you unhappy with me too?

64
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,470
"Too"?

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,520
An'an.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,960
Listen, I could tell since the beginning.

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,070
Mr. Wolf is serious about you.

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I got careless.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Wait,

70
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,880
An'an.

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,160
Why did you say no to him?

72
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,920
He's handsome,

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,390
and he came back

74
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,670
riding on a rainbow chariot.

75
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,070
And he's so devoted to you.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,390
If I have to add a time period,

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,040
it started when he was eight.

78
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,950
You're being presented

79
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,320
with such a wonderful relationship.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,600
Why are you turning him away?

81
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,350
Because there's no way we could be together.

82
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,350
Why not?

83
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,350
Because we're not compatible.

84
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,790
Why not?

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,390
Let me ask you a question.

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,200
Do you feel anything for him?

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,070
Do you like him?

88
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,600
That's impossible.

89
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on.

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,440
Look at your exquisite face

91
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
and your enchanting eyes.

92
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,040
How could someone reject them?

93
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,320
That doesn't make sense.

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,390
Shao,

95
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,760

let's not be called the Wolf of Wall Street.

97
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,440
Let's be called

98
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,320
Tragic Wolf of Wall Street.

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,320
Tragic Wolf.

100
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,110
Tragic Wolf...

101
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,920
♪Love really takes courage♪

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
♪To face the rumors and gossip♪

103
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,320
Love indeed requires courage.

104
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,000
But what I'm facing

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
are real-life problems.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,160
An'an.

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,350
I still want to try and convince you.

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,230
Give it another thought.

109
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,720
If you miss it,

110
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,160
you'll regret it.

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
Give me a bit more time.

112
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,550
So I can become better.

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,070
Shao.

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I think

115
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,040
you still have a chance.

116
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,920
Why so?

117
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
Think about it.

118
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,950
An Yu

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
just experienced turmoil in her life.

120
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,070
Her career is just about to take off.

121
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,510
And wham!

122
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,760
You dropped a bomb in front of her.

123
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,550
No one can accept this calmly.

124
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,950
Her hesitance

125
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,350
is not entirely unexpected.

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,670
Give her some time to think.

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,110
Besides,

128
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,110
how old are you?

129
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,550
And how old is she?

130
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,350
What are you?

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,920
And what is she?

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,110
Moreover, given what she's been through
in the past few years,

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,390
any woman in her shoes

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,320
would feel the same, right?

135
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,950
Is it really because of that?

136
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,720
If...

137
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,350
none of those applies,

138
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,350
then,

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,790
there is only one answer left.

140
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,000
She doesn't feel anything for you.

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,070
What did she say

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,320
when she rejected you?

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,040
There's something

144
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,880
I have to ask you.

145
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,640
You said you don't like me.

146
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,950
Is it because you're not sure about
your feelings for me currently

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
or...

148
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,950
are you already sure that you don't like me?

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,830
I don't know if I'm sure or not.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,950
But...

151
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,550
But I just don't feel anything.

152
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,320
No feelings.

153
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,040
What I said might not be correct.

154
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,670
Stupid.

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
How did you get out?

156
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,030
Quick, get down.

157
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,790
Well?

158
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,280
How did you escape?

159
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,840
I saw the window open.

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
So without another thought,

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
I tumbled into the air

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,350
and did a 360 spin

163
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,200
to land perfectly.

164
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,150
Difficulty level, a 3.6B.

165
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,670
Those who brag will be struck by lightning.

166
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,280
That's what happened.

167
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,550
How are things going on your side?

168
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,350
An'an said

169
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,840
she needed a bit more time.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
How about your side?

171
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,080
Shao said the same.

172
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,590
But judging from Shao's condition,

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,470
he won't make it

174
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,790
through the time that she needs.

175
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,840
If things continue like this,

176
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
we won't make it either.

177

Lailai!

178
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,000
By the way, Fu,

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
your direct superior,

180
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
the managing director
of the Investment Department isn't here.

181
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Not just the MD.

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Many people of the Investment Department
aren't here as well.

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,960
Fu.

184
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,790
Why is that?

185
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,350
Sit.

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,400
Everyone, please sit down.

187
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,710
It should be obvious.

188
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,550
The meeting we're having today

189
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,030
has much fewer attendees

190
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,520
because I've removed them from the company.

191
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,760
So congratulations to those who are still here.

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,910
After much deliberation,

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,760
I've chosen you all

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,910
to remain in the company

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,230
and fight alongside me.

196
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,150
In the past few years,

197
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,350
I have been

198
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,760
away from the country.

199
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,640
So the first thing I did
after coming back

200
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
was to pick out the elites

201
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,030
and optimize management

202
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,350
to start afresh with the best among the best.

203
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,590
Particularly for our core department,
the Investment Department.

204
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,520
After this major restructuring,

205
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,350
a large number of positions

206
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,550
in the Investment Department,

207
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,230
be it MD, ED, or SVP,

208
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,440
need filling.

209
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,150
How do you think

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
we should fill them?

211
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,000
Sir.

212
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,150
Based on the standard promotion pathway,

213
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,710
we don't have enough candidates

214
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,840
our current talent pool.

215
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,280
So I think

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,640
we should not judge the candidates

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
based solely on qualifications.

218
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,200
Conduct an internal recruitment

219
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
within the company.

220
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,590
No limit to department,

221
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,840
job title,

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
seniority,

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,110
and background.

224
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
Everyone can apply.

225
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,350
As for the criteria,

226
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,320
I suggest

227
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,640
we focus on their real-time investing ability.

228
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't really agree with Mr. Fu's idea.

229
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,320
ED and other lower positions

230
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,710
could be open to all departments,

231
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,960
titles, and seniority.

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,550
But MD of the Investment Department

233
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,470
is a core position in the company.

234
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I think

235
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
it should be decided by the board of directors

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,670
after a thorough selection process.

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,150
Do not judge based solely on qualifications.

238
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,640
I think Mr. Fu's idea is good.

239
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,710
Let's go with it.

240
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,880
As for the candidate for MD,

241
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,520
I will discuss it with the board.

242
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,280
Okay.

243
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,520
You're dismissed.

244
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh, come on, Mr. Fu.

245
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,280
Selection?

246
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,710
The best candidate for MD

247
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
is you.

248
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,230
We've got many capable people in the company.

249
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,760
Let's make it fair play.

250
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
Fair play?

251
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,440
You've been here for so long.

252
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,280
In terms of seniority and capability,
we know who is tops.

253
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,790
No one said anything about you
having a beef with Mr. Fu.

254
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,550
That's because there's no such thing.

255
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,880
So it's solely because you don't think he's suitable

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
to be MD of the Investment Department.

257
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,200
Does that concern you,

258
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Mr. Jiang?

259
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,880
It doesn't concern me.

260
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,670
But it concerns you.

261
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,150
Ms. Fang.

262
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,760
You put him in a difficult position

263
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
in front of the chairman.

264
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,230
What if he took it personally?

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm just doing my work.

266
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,350
I don't do PR.

267
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,030
You're worrying too much, Mr. Jiang.

268
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,080
Miss Fang.

269
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,590
I know things are hard for you.

270
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,550
You're a single mother.

271
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,880
Your son should still be hospitalized, right?

272
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,880
Whether or not things are hard for me

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
isn't related to what's been discussed today,

274
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,550
is it?

275
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Take it slow.

276
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,710
The results will be better.

280
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,030
I brought some snacks for you.

281
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,150
Please accept it.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,150
It's okay.

283
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,470
We're all trying to get by.

284
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,840
Keep it for yourself.

285
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,590
Since you came,

286
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,550
Fangfang's been looking much better.

287
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,350
His muscle atrophy has improved too.

288
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,790
But then, you won't accept any payment.

289
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
I don't know how to thank you.

290
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't mention it.

291

Let me see you out.

295
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,440
It's okay. Don't bother.

296
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Dr. Xue is so nice.

297
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,470
Fangfang is so lucky

298
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,710
to have met him.

299
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,030
But,

300
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,230
I can't let Dr. Xue treat him for free.

301
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,470
Regarding the expenses...

302
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,350
Listen.

303
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,910
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

304
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,030
When you feel better,

305

I'm sure Fangfang

will feel happy too.

00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,530
Sorry, excuse me.

682
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,170
[Today is the kindergarten
parent-child sports day.]

683
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,820
[3 PM this afternoon. Mi Lu is not here. You can come and see Yiyi.]

684
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,250
Hello?

685
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,490
You...

686
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,170
Do you mean what you said?

687
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,010
Come and see Yiyi.

688
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,060
It's okay if you're busy.

689
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,420
I'm free.

690
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,580
I... I'll be right there.

691
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,250
What's up, An'an?

692
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,930
I'm sorry.

693
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,100
Can we meet another day?

694
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,690
I have something urgent.

695
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,580
It will only take a few more minutes of your time.

696
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,620
-I'll explain...
-Lailai, listen.

697
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,970
Help me gather all the information.

698
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,210
I need to get going.

699
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,820
Leave it to me.

700
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,340
You go ahead.

701
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
Thank you.

702
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,290
I have to go.

703
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:47,900
Okay.

704
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,290
-We'll talk again.
-Okay.

705
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,380
Bye.

706
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,060
Let us continue.

707
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:59,060
Go, go...

708
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,770
Okay.

709
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,250
Now we're having

710
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,490
the last race for today's parent-child event.

711
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,420
The four-legged obstacle race.

712
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,530
Both parents will need to participate

713
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,900
to help their child get to the finish line.

714
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Mommy is not here. What do we do?

715
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,250
Okay!

716
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,340
Fathers, mothers, altogether.

717
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,660
All the children, I'm the best!

718
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,860
Fathers, mothers, altogether.

719
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,290
Mommy probably won't be able to come today.

720
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:20,688
We won't run in this race,

721
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,580
okay?

722
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,060
I want to run! I want Mommy!

723
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,140
Mommy isn't coming today.

724
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,530
Why don't we take part in the next event?

725
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:29,970
Okay?

726
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,970
I want to take part in this one!

727
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,770
I want Mommy!
