175
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
the top performer in your company.

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

177
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Why are you here?

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
You are finally home.

179
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
We can't reach Lailai.

180
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
Kai is panicking now.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,320
What happened?

182
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
I don't know.

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Can't reach her?

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
How could this happen all of a sudden?

185
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,800
Kai.

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
What happened?

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
We are supposed to do the cat tree

188
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
for Ice Cream today.

189
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,920
It's late now.

190
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
She isn't home yet.

191
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,680
She didn't pick up my calls

192
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
or reply to my messages.

193
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,120
See!

194
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Lailai always replies to messages right away.

195
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,320
Exactly.

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Let me call her.

197
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
Mr. Zhao, here, you can sign here.

198
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
I have to answer this call.

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,040
Sure.

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
Sorry.

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
An'an, can you hear me?

202
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,080
Hello?

203
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,920
An'an?

204
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,880
Hello, Lailai.

205
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
Where are you?

206
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
Hello?

207
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,360
An'an?

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,800
Get a dozen of beers for Room 408.

209
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,760
Hello?

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,640
An'an?

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,640
Jin,

212
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
I'm looking for you to sign the contract.

213
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Let's go.

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
My apologies.

215
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,800
[Power off]

216
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
(Hi.)

217
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,800
(The number you have dialed is powered off.)

218
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,640
Powered off?

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,120
Wait. What did she say?

220
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
It was very noisy just then.

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Someone was singing, I think.

222
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
KTV.

223
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
KTV? Why is she at the KTV
in the middle of the night?

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
Wait, I heard someone saying

225
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,680
something about sending beer to Room 408.

226
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
They are even drinking alcohol?

227
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
Let's look for her.

228
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,680
Wait.

229
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
There are just a few KTVs in Chuanhe.

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,920
Even fewer with a fourth floor.

231
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,960
Right? Room 408.

232
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,840
Room 408.

233
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,120
I got it.

234
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
It's Xing Le Hui.

235
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
I'll get the car.

236
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,240
Let's go.

237
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
Zhao, we are leaving.

238
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,800
Are you okay?

239
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,000
You

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,640
should learn from Mr. Zhao.

241
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,240
Jin worked hard.

242
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
She drank a whole lot.

243
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,840

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,880

245

Jin.

246
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
What are you doing?

247
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Young man,

248
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
who are you?

249
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
Who are you?

250
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,440
Calm down.

251
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
We can talk this out.

252
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
We can talk this out.

255
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you okay?

256
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,320
Come,

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,520
I'll take you home.

258
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Careful.

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,680
Careful.

262

Are you okay?

267
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,640
What's wrong?

268
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
Let go of her!

He is our colleague.

272
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,760
He is our colleague, Li Zhou.

273
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,720
You misunderstood.

274
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,800
What do you mean?

275
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,320

You jerk!

279
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
I wouldn't do that again!

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
I wouldn't do that again!

281
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,160
If you do something similar again,

282
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,840
I'll beat you every time I see you.

283
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,120
I won't.

286
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
Drink some honey water.

287
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,480
It'll help you sober up.

288
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,120
Thanks.

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,840
It's hot.

290
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
Drink it slowly.

291
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm already sober due to the shock earlier.

292
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Sorry for making you all worry about me.

294
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,040
I didn't know how I got so drunk.

295
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
They sang a few songs

296
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,560
and then I became drunk already.

298
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,800

I'm a tough man.

How could I get hurt?

301
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,880
At that moment, I really wanted to...

302
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,480
That old man,

303
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
how dare he bully a young girl?

I didn't think much at that moment.

312

I saw a man holding you

313

and I lost control.

314
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,280
I will never drink so much again.

I'm sorry.

All right. Well, I know Kai's personality.

317
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,760
There's a dog that is similar to him,

318
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,640
a Bull Terrier.

319
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,400
It is very loyal

320
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,120
but can also lose control easily.

321
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,840
That's why

322
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,560
he's extra furious today.

323
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
Who are you calling a Bull Terrier?

324
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Do you know what his nickname is?

325
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,520
Silly Husky.

326
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Look at him.

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Doesn't he look like a Husky?

328
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,360
You might think he's being cute,

329
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
but he's truly a dummy.

330
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,800
Who are you calling a Bull Terrier?

331
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,280
Spit it out.

332
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,080
Vomit it all out.

333
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,840
You'll feel better.

334
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,600
Do I look like one?

335
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,240
Bring us some water.

336
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200

Li Zhou,

340
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,360
I brought you breakfast.

341
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,520
Thank you.

342
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,160
You are welcome.

343
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,800
Are you okay?

345
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,520
I was sober once I reached home yesterday.

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,840
Thank you.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
You saved my life.

348
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,960
It's not that big of a thing.

349

Wait for me in my office.]

523
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
Hello, Lailai.

524
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,260
An'an,

525
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,460
what's happening?

526
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,260
Zhou Min has been waiting for you
for half an hour.

527
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,300
Just do as I told you.

528
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,580
Go get the contract signed.

529
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,140
I can't.

530
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,180
Xu Jingya has everyone in the store
leave the room.

531
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,140
I don't even have a chance to talk to Zhou Min.

532
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,820
Jin Lailai!

533
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,260
I've got to go. Come back, quick!

534
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,740
Yes, Ms. Xu.

535
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,380
Our store is running out of water.

536
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,260
Go get some water.

537
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,860
Why don't we order delivery?

538
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,140
I can't make you do something for me, is it?

539
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,180
Hurry up!

540
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,980
Okay.

541
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,780
Miss,

542
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,460
sorry to keep you waiting.

543
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,020
An Yu is always like this.

544
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,980
She's always late.

545
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,900
I've told her several times.

546
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
But we can't even reach her now.

547
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,140
What to do?

548
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,140
She is a new employee,

549
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,740
so I can't be too harsh on her.

550
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,140
As the store manager,

551
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,060
I won't allow my employee

552
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,300
to affect the contract signing procedure

553
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,300
or take up the client's time.

554
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,700
Miss,

555
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,820
as for this contract,

556
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,460
it's the same no matter whom you sign it with.

557
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,420
If you continue waiting,

558
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,740
we don't know how long you will wait.

559
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,460
Right?

560
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,220
It's the same contract after all.

561
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,060
Mr. Fu, please take a look.

562
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,140
Mr. Fu.

563
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,900
Oh, give me a minute.

564
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,700
Check the time.

565
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
This project...

566
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,380
This project...

567
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,780
Mr. Fu,

568
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
why did you want to see me?

569
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,580
I said, give me a minute.

570
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,340
Can't you see I'm reviewing something important?

571
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,820
I have a contract to sign at the branch.

572
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,860
I've waited for you for quite a while.

573
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,780
So what?

574
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,460
This new employee is so impatient.

575
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,420
What's wrong, Mr. Fu?

576
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,460
Why are you mad?

577
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,380
Go back to your office.

578
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,500
At first,

579
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,940
I think that you've been performing well
since you joined our company.

580
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,340
So, I called you here

581
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,780
because I wanted to let the management know
and give you recognition.

582
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,660
You are right.

583
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
An Yu has been performing well recently.

584
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,060
Thanks, Mr. Fu.

585
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,340
You are so thoughtful and even helped
the HR Department to make a decision.

586
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,220
But your behavior today

587
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,700
is very disappointing.

588
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,820
As someone young,

589
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,860
you shouldn't be arrogant and impatient.

590
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,260
Don't be so full of yourself just because you made

591
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,300
some minor achievements.

592
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,060
How about this?

593
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,180
You can go back now.

594
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,220
Regarding the recognition,

595
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,460
since Mr. Jiang is here,

596
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,660
I'll talk to him.

597
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,420
Goodbye, Mr. Fu and Mr. Jiang.

598
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,940
Hello, sir.

599
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,260
Why aren't you here yet?

600
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,620
Traffic jam?

601
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,460
Well, how much longer do I need to wait?

602
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
Twenty minutes!

603
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,180
I can't make it in time then.

604
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,140
Please, please hurry up.

605
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,220
Get on the bike.

606
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,900
How do you know I'm at Zhuoyue?

607
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,940
Jin Lailai called me.

608
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,180
I'd been waiting for you outside Zhuoyue.

609
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,740
Oh,

610
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,340
she told me you were in a hurry.

611
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,100
Yes.

612
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,380
I'm late already.

613
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,380
Sit tight then.

614
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,300
I'm speeding up.

615
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Miss,

616
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,740
An Yu is not coming.

617
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,420
Look, if you don't sign the contract,

618
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,820
it'll be wasting our time

619
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,540
sitting here.

620
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,220
Right?

621
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,460
It's okay.

622
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,060
I have a lot of time to spare.

623
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,300
Wait, you...

624
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm so sorry

625
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
that I'm late.

626
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,460
May I ask

627
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,060
why did you wait for me?

628
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,140
Do you remember

629
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,260
the rainy day when we first met?

630
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,300
I was hiding from the rain in front of the shop.

631
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,060
You put an umbrella near the entrance.

632
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,940
Yuqing

633
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,420
is a city of rain.

634
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,020
But whenever there was rain,

635
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
my dad would put an umbrella

636
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,980
near the classroom door for me.

637
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,620
My mom passed away when I was a kid.

638
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,380
My dad raised me alone

639
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,820
and he owned a restaurant
that sells Jiaodong cuisine.

640
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,980
Every day after school,

641
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,700
I'd help him in the restaurant.

642
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,380
Then,

643
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,620
the business was getting better and better.

644
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,740
My father was packed with work

645
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,980
and he didn't spend as much time with me.

646
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,140
I thought he didn't care about me

647
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,260
and he didn't love me anymore.

648
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,940
So I fought with him

649
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,300
and I said a lot of hurtful things.

650
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,940
Did you take your medicine?

651
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,820
I did.

652
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,060
Did you smoke?

653
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,700
I've told you,

654
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,260
with your current health condition,
you can't smoke.

655
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,380
No smoking.

656
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,220
Why didn't you listen to me?

657
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,580
All right.

658
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,500
I'll listen to you.

659
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,660
He was only so busy because of me.

660
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
He knew he was sick,

661
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,380
that was why he was trying
to earn more money for me.

662
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,140
But I didn't know about that.

663
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,700
I didn't know he was sick.

664
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,060
Every time he spoke to me,

665
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,300
he was in pain.

666
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,020
My dad passed away a month ago.

667
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,620
I didn't even have the chance

668
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,660
to say sorry to him.

669
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,580
Since you were a kid,

670
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,380
I've always given you
whatever you wanted and listened to you.

671
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,340
Your dad kept calling your name

672
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,780
before he passed.

673
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,700
He said that he kept his promise

674
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,140
and he never smoked again.

675
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,220
Two days ago,

676
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,620
my uncle took away our restaurant.

677
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,940
Now,

678
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,860
aside from the money in the bank,

679
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,300
I'm left with nothing.

680
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,220
I'm all I have

681
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,700
in this world.

682
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,580
I have no family left.

683
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,660
A few years back,

684
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,140
my dad passed away too.

685
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
I didn't get to see him one last time.

686
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,180
So I can understand how it feels.

687
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,180
But life goes on,

688
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,580
right?

689
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,780
Let's make good use of the money.

690
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,980
After all, it was your father's hard-earned money.

691
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,900
I have faith in you.

692
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,100
Your dad will love to see you live a happy life.

693
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,700
That's a deal.

694
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,140
-If our branch passes the evaluation this month,
-What if we rank in last place?

695
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,940
-we'll give ourselves a well-deserved bonus.
-I'm so nervous.

696
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,980
No one can break the promise.

697
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,940
Of course.

698
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm thinking of getting myself
a set of luxurious cosmetics.

699
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,380
Those aren't discounted,

700
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,980
aren't having a promotion,

701
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,180
and are not refundable.

702
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,460
I want to buy myself
a set of limited edition batman figurines.

703
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
I want...

704
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,900
I want to date someone.

705
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,980
I...

706
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,700
I want to give Ice Cream a home.

707
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,340
Ice cream?

708
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,780
Are you getting a fridge?

709
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,580
Ice Cream is our cat.

710
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,540
Ms. Xu,

711
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
do you have a wish?

712
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,540
Do I have to tell you?

713
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,980
Will you make my wish come true?

714
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,820
He's here.

715
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,100
So after the evaluation

716
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,660
of sales performance and other considerations,

717
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,380
Xinxiang Branch ranked last in the evaluation.

718
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,340
Submit the layoff list to the HR Department.

719
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,180
As for other branches, continue to work hard

720
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,580
and be prepared for next month's evaluation.

721
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,940
It's your fault!

722
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,460
If you can get that client to sign the contract,

723
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,660
we wouldn't be in such a situation.

724
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,260
-How is that my fault?
-That's all because we usually...

725
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,980
It's because he stole the client.

726
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,540
Stop it.

727
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,500
Stop arguing.

728
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:16,875
[Finance]

729
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,860
[Finance]

730
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,740
This is such a remote area.

731
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,580
And there comes a finance company
trying to compete with us.

732
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,260
Either something is wrong with the owner,

733
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,300
or he has too much money to spend,

734
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,740
or someone tricked him.

735
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,300
Setting up a business here,

736
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,860
right above us!

737
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,820
What is he trying to do?

738
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,020
Is he trying to poo...

739
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Last month, if we didn't get Mi Lu

740
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,780
and Zhou Min to sign the contract,

741
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,060
we wouldn't pass the evaluation.

742
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,700
I mean, I always attract wealth

743
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,580
but it's impossible

744
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,140
to be this lucky every month.

745
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,340
What about this month?

746
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
This is like adding insult to injury.

747
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,820
What if we tell them

748
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,460
that the business will go nowhere

749
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,580
if they set it up here.

750
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,900
Do you realize

751
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
there are always some stores

752
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,860
that are not doing well near your home?

753
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,580
They always close down
within two to three months.

754
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,340
That's because no one tells them this.

755
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,140
That's true.

756
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,820
I'll let them know then.

757
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,380
Tell me. What are you thinking?

758
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,210
What are you thinking?

759
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,940
Why do you set up the business
in such a remote area?

760
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,380
Don't tell me it's really because of An Yu.

761
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,740
What if the answer is yes?

762
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,860
What is wrong with you?
Something is wrong with you.

763
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,380
Do you have too much money to spend?

764
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,180
And you bought these marble tiles?

765
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,460
Well, you are rich.

766
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,300
How much did you spend on this door?

767
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,180
We must show that we are powerful later.

768
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,980
Yes.

769
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,340
Discourage them.

770
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,460
An Yu. An Yu is here.

771
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,180
Is anyone here?

772
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Is the owner of the place here?

773
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,980
The renovation is almost done.

774
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
The owner seems to have good taste.

775
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,340
It looks much classier

776
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,060
than our shop.

777
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,980
Look at these sculptures.

778
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,620
The owner knows how to appreciate arts.

779
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,180
Oh, no.

780
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
This will be a great opponent.

781
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,180
How do we compete?

782
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,940
Well...

783
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,780
Don't give up.

784
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,380
Right?

785
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Anyhow,

786
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,660
we are the ones who have made this place lively.

787
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Right.

788
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,740
We did some square dancing too.

789
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,740
Who is it?

790
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,820
Hello?

791
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,100
Are you the contractor

792
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,260
or our future neighbor?

793
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,580
We are dropping by to say hi.

794
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,540
Is anyone here?

795
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,500
Hello?

796
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,220
