(Mi Lu.)

19
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,110
(I heard that you are going to go abroad.)

20
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,160
(Yes.)

21
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,440
(What if we can't get
the first place anymore after you leave?)

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,520
(That won't happen.)

23
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
(You've been training so hard for it.)

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,160
You'll be fine.

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,720
-That's good.
-That's good.

26
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,720
Hit it.

27

You can leave first.

28
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,110
I'll catch up with you.

29
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

Here.

Let's do it again.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,910
Don't hit my head.

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,320
One, two, swing.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,080
No, you need to swing it higher.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,110
Look, swing it.

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,910
Mi Lu.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Let me introduce you to each other.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,110
She is Mi Lu.

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,910
This is An Yu.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,880
Hello.

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,320
I haven't told you, right?

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
Mi Lu is a key player

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
on our school's tennis team.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,160
She's very good at tennis.

46
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,470
If there's a chance, we can play together.

47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,830
You are amazing.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,270
No need to wait for a chance.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,110
We can do it now.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,670
Let's do it.

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,630
Okay.

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,030
Come. Let me carry the bag for you.

53
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,800
Go for it!

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,470
You two, as the child's parents,

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,910
need to check the temperature of the child.

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,030
Okay.

57
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,750
Thank you.

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Shao, don't go easy on me.

59
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,550
Kai.

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,480
What does it mean when your left eyelid
or your right eyelid ticks?

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,160
That's just a superstition.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,920
Don't believe in that.

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,160
No.

64
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
I haven't been able to reach An Yu

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,270
since this afternoon.

66
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,950
I don't know if she's in trouble or not.

67
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
You

68
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,230
are always so anxious

69
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,230
when it comes to An Yu.

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,510
I'll call someone to ask about her.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,640
I...

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,070
I'll call Lailai, okay?

73
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,670
I'll ask her.

74
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,110
Lailai.

75
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,320
Do you know where An Yu is?

76
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,830
Okay.

77
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,670
It's nothing.

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,640
Shao was just asking about her.

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,320
That's it then.

80
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,550
Zhou Yuan has asked her to go to the riverside.

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Why did you ask me out?

82
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,920
Yu.

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,670
You are here.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,230
I have many things to tell you.

85
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,720
But I...

86
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,110
I don't know how to tell you about them.

87
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,760
Zhou Yuan.

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
Were you drinking?

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm not...

90
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm not drunk.

91
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,920
I just...

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,110
I just think that I had done something wrong.

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
If there's nothing else,

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,350
I'll take my leave now.

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,640
Yu.

96
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,110
Yu.

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
You are really drunk.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
We can talk again

99
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,230
when you are sober, okay?

100
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,040
Can you let me finish first?

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,600
I know that I can't treat you like I used to.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,880
You are drunk.

103
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
-Zhou Yuan.
-Give me a chance.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,270
Zhou Yuan, you are really drunk.

105
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,440
-I won't repeat what I did.
-You are drunk!

106
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,480
Zhou Yuan, you are...

107
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,270
Zhou Yuan

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
called me today.

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,270
He said that he had
something important to tell me.

110
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,600
I only found out

111
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,320
that he was drunk when I reached there.

112
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,000
So, what did he tell you?

113
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,000
Just some nonsense.

114
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,320
We don't have to talk about it.

115
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,480
Is it painful?

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,230
How is it?

117
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,920
I think they'll be fine.

118
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,600
An Yu is treating Shao's wound for him.

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,720
That's good.

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,670
Let's go back then.

121
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,110
Baby.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,670
Well...

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,390
-Today...
-What is it?

124
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,790
How about

125
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,110
we stay outside

126
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
for tonight?

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,830
Why should we?

128
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,550
There'll be an intense match in the final tonight.

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,880
It's the Champions League's eighth final.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,670
It's Real Madrid versus Juventus.

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,040
You can watch it at home then.

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,030
No.

133
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,960
The tournament will start at around two.

134
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,550
Besides, think about it.

135
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,470
Both of them have just calmed down.

136
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,150
We can't disturb them.

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,670
Don't watch the match then.

138
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,280
Staying outside is so not worth it.

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,350
Such a waste of money.

140
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,910
It won't be a waste of money.

141
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,350
When we collaborated
with Wei'er Hotel before this,

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,230
Chen Wei had given me a membership card.

143
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,790
We can get a 90% discount.

144
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,230
A suite will only cost us 468 yuan.

145
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,790
And that includes dinner
and breakfast for the next day.

146
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,280
A suite will only cost us 468 yuan,

147
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
including dinner and breakfast?

148
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,960
Then, it'll be our loss

149
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
if we don't take advantage of that.

150
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,030
That's true.

151
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,230
It was my first time seeing you being so fierce.

152
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,790
Are you okay?

153
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,840
I'm quite fine.

154
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,840
Are you still mad?

155
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,590
Of course.

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
After this,

157
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,440
I won't meet him anymore
unless it's absolutely necessary.

158
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Who is it?

159
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,960
What kind of expression is that?

160
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,550
Kai told me

161
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,550
that he won't be back tonight.

162
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,110

178
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,550
Baby.

179
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,470
What is it?

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,640
It's so late already.

181
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,760
How about we turn in for the night?

182
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,550
It's just ten.

183
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,230
It's still early.

184
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,790
It's already ten.

185
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,230
You don't like to watch football, right?

186
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,150
Kai.

187
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,910
You've been treating me so well.

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,520
And you always accompany me

189
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,640
when there's a promotion.

190
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,400
I've reflected on myself.

191
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,670
I want to know more about your hobby.

192
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,590
I'm going to stay up and watch football with you.

193
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,440
You don't have to do it today.

194
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,640
Think about this.

195
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
This is such a good deal.

196
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,470
And we are staying in such a luxury room.

197
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,880
We need to enjoy

198
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,710
a night of romance together.

199
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,320
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,960
This is such a good deal.

201
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,150
It'll be our loss if we fall asleep.

202
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,710
No,

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
we shouldn't watch it.
We still have to wait a long time for it.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm serious.

205
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,910
You must be tired after a day.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,640
I'm not tired.

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,150
The match will only start in a few more hours.

208
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,320
It's okay.

209
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,200
No matter how late it is,

210
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,200
I'll accompany you.

211
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,350
Okay.

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,030
We'll watch it.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,760
Don't you think that this is so funny?

214
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,150
Is it?

215
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
It's so funny.

216
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,020
[Dear]

217
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm the owner of a bar.

218
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,880
Hello.

219
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,710
This man

220
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,790
is drunk.

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,110
And after looking through his phone,

222
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,760
you are his emergency contact.

223
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,790
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Can you please tell me

225
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
your address?

226
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,710
I'll be there right away.

227
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,520
Okay.

228
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,150
Thank you.

229
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,790
Hello, sir.

230
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm his family.

231
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,230
Sorry for troubling you.

232
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,080
It's okay.

233
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,447
Zhou Yuan.

234
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,080
Zhou Yuan, what are you trying to do?

235
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,400
Why did you get so drunk?

236
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,910
Come.

237
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,080
Let's go home.

238
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,670
Come.

239
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,760
Here's some hangover tea for him.

240
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,550
Okay.

241
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,880
Ms. Chen, you can go back first.

242
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,550
I'll take care of him.

243
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,470
Okay.

244
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,840
Call me if you need me.

245
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,910
Yu.

246
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,700
(Miss Mi Lu.)

247
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,900
(I'm sorry.)

248
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
(Due to your previous miscarriage,)

249
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,540
(you may never be able)

250
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,460
(to bear children anymore.)

251
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,180
(You have a child with An Yu.)

252
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
But I can never be a mother again.

253
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
That child

254
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,820
is an accident.

255
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,580
Accident?

256
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,460
You still have me, Lulu.

257
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
You have me.

258
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,300
But how long will your plan take?

259
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,460
I can't take it anymore.

260
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,940
Okay. Give me some time.

261
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,940
Once I've done everything,

262
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,980
after this is settled,

263
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,980
we will be together.

264
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,860
I'll take care of you after this.

265
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,180
We'll be together forever.

266
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,460
It's okay now.

267
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,060
I'm here.

268
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,020
Almost.

269
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,820
Why are you drinking so much coffee?
Can you sleep later?

270
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,740
This is Chris?

271
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,620
He's Cristiano Ronaldo.

272
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,380
He's so handsome.

273
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,020
Look at his face,

274
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,460
his chest, his thighs.

275
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,980
Are you watching football

276
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,060
or the men?

277
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,420
Doesn't matter as long as they are handsome.

278
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,580
Go in.

279
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,620
[Champions League, Real Madrid versus Juventus]

280
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,500
So handsome.

281
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,860
Goal!

282
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm so happy.

283
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
He's so handsome!

284
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm just tired.

285
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,020
I can walk by myself.

286
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,540
It's okay.

287
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm not tired.

288
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,780
It's too tiring to stay up and watch football.

289
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,380
Besides, it was a recorded live broadcast.

290
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,900
How do you know?

291
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,860
I checked when we were buying breakfast.

292
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,100
I just think that the match is very exciting.

293
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,100
It is quite exciting.

294
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
And you bought me breakfast.

295
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,100
Good morning.

296
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,340
Good morning.

297
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,260
Good morning.

298
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Good morning.

299
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,900
We watched the football game the whole night.

300
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,940
Ronaldo is really handsome.

301
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,100
And the sofa was so hard.

302
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,060
I'm sleepy now that I'm full.

303
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,580
An'an, how well did you sleep last night?

304
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,940
Actually,

305
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,500
on the day you announced your relationship,

306
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,660
we had become a couple too.

307
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,460
We wanted

308
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
to make the announcement on that day too.

309
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,420
But both of you

310
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,740
were so happy that day.

311
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,780
So, we forgot about it.

312
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,620
We also think

313
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,940
that happiness should come in succession.

314
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,540
So...

315
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,980
So, you are finally together!

316
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,580
An Yu, do you know

317
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,540
how hard it has been for Shao?

318
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,060
When we were abroad,

319
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
as soon as he heard about your incident,

320
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,620
he wanted to book a flight ticket
and come back at once.

321
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,100
He joined Zhuoyue because of you.

322
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,860
We went to Chuanhe because of you too.

323
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
Shao is such a rational person.

324
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,220
But as soon as he hears something about you,

325
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,620
he'll become so reckless.

326
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,340
Do you know how many times he has told me

327
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,100
about giving you everything you want

328
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,060
as long as he has it?

329
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,740
In the past, I always worried

330
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,340
about how he would be if it didn't turn out well

331
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,340
between you two.

332
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,260
Now, I think everything is going well.

333
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,940
Treat her well.

334
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,940
Yes.

335
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,020
We are on her side.

336
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,380
We are very powerful.

337
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,540
Now,

338
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,900
I feel so happy.

339
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,020
It's like a fairy tale
when it comes to the two of you.

340
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,820
If this is a fairy tale,

341
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,660
then, now must be the ending

342
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,580
of this story.

343
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,460
But our story has just started.

344
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,300
Whether the future is a beautiful fairy tale

345
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,980
or a realistic heartbreaking drama,

346
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,740
I won't regret this.

347
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,660
Shao Moli.

348
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,220
I love you.

349
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,020
Ye Kai.

350
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,580
Why are you crying so much?

351
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,020
I'm not crying.

352
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,620
You should be happy, right?

353
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,580
I am happy.

354
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,540
Hello?

355
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,860
Ask your Hongxing Telecom Project Team

356
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,180
to come to the company for a meeting now.

357
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,500
We have an emergency.

358
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,860
Okay.

359
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,500
I have to go to the company.

360
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,260
Don't just eat this.

361
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,660
Eat some vegetables.

362
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,940
Thank you, Mommy.

363
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,820
Was I drunk last night?

364
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,580
Yes.

365
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,660
The owner called me

366
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,620
and told me that you were drunk.

367
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,980
So, I took you home.

368
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,860
Thank you, Daddy.

369
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,100
You are such a good boy now.

370
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,340
Mommy, eat an egg.

371
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,620
Thank you.

372
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,340
Daddy, eat an egg too.

373
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,620
Thank you, Yiyi.

374
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,660
Daddy.

375
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,780
Can you and Mommy

376
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,460
send me to kindergarten today?

377
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,060
Yiyi, don't make it difficult for your daddy.

378
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,500
He has an important meeting today.

379
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,500
I'll send you there.

380
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,500
It's okay.

381
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,420
I can postpone it.

382
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,180
Yiyi.

383
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,900
Mommy and I

384
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,500
will send you to the kindergarten
together today, okay?

385
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,660
Thank you, Daddy.

386
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,980
You are the best.

387
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,820
But we are eating breakfast now.

388
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,460
We have to finish our breakfast first, okay?

389
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,820
Let's compete and see who can finish it first.

390
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,340
Ready, start.

391
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,860
Why do they look so serious?

392
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,620
Did something

393
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,220
happen to the Hongxing Telecom Project?

394
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,340
I don't think so.

395
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,220
Maybe they are talking about promoting us
or giving us an increment.

396
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,460
What do you think, Lailai?

397
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,660
I've been wanting to learn lip reading.

398
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,780
But I didn't want to spend the money on it.

399
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,340
Or else, I could tell you

400
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,700
what they were talking about.

401
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
They are coming.

402
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,700
[Zhuoyue Financial Group]

403
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,300
Everyone.

404
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,980
We just found out

405
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,260
that Yimi Capital
is targeting Hongxing Telecom.

406
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,820
If they succeed,

407
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Hongxing Telecom will crumble.

408
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,420
Because based on Zhou Yuan's personality,

409
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
he will fire

410
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,820
more than 1,000 employees.

411
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,020
Besides, he'll auction off all the assets.

412
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,420
So, I hope that all of you

413
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
can do your best

414
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,260
under Mr. Shao's guidance

415
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,660
to win this war

416
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,020
with commitment

417
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,340
for the glory of Zhuoyue.

418
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,220
Okay?

419
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,060
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,860
I asked you out today

421
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,140
because I want to talk to you.

422
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
We can talk here.

423
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,580
Mr. Qian is your uncle, right?

424
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
You've already done your investigation, right?

425
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,100
If we weren't related,

426
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,780
you wouldn't come to me today.

427
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,540
Okay.

428
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,500
I'll get straight to the point then.

429
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,900
There's some cash inside this card.

430
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,340
Take it.

431
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,140
What is the meaning of this?

432
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,340
I hope

433
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
that I won't face too many obstacles in acquiring

434
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,700
Hongxing Telecom.

435
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,980
Mi Lu.

436
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,100
Why should I?

437
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,300
Xu Jingya.

438
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,420
Do you know why a man like Jiang Haoran

439
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,380
always act

440
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,860
so high-and-mighty?

441
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,420
Because he feels that he's in charge.

442
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
You can try

443
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,020
acting capable in front of him

444
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,300
and making yourself look as if you have a choice.

445
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,140
Let's see if he'll change his mind about you.

446
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,540
Do you really think that I'm a fool?

447
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,900
Do you think I'll be tricked
by you the second time?

448
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,980
I've seen too many men like Jiang Haoran

449
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,420
in the workplace.

450
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,700
Think of it as a test.

451
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,820
Don't feel pressured about it.

452
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,940
Give it a try.

453
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,500
You won't lose anything anyway.

454
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,420
Putting in some good words for you
in front of my uncle

455
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,260
is too easy for me.

456
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,020
But you'll never understand the relationship

457
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,580
between me and Jiang Haoran.

458
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,820
I'm trying to draw you.

459
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,180
But I can't.

460
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,380
How about you come over?

461
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,140
Where?

462
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,340
I'm at the company.

463
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,460
Me too.

464
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,220
Your father treats you really well.

465
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,420
He allows you to draw here.

466
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,260
Go ahead and draw me then.

467
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
I know exactly what you look like.

468
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,100
I remember all the details about you.

469
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,740
But whenever I want to draw you,

470
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
I can't.

471
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,660
What Yu said yesterday had woken me up.

472
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,940
She told me that I had been running away
from how I really felt.

473
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,620
I want to forget about that person.

474
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,420
But I don't know

475
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,860
why I can't do that.

476
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,420
In time,

477
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,820
he has become someone special to me.

478
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,900
But I know

479
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,300
that I'm just a good friend to him.

480
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,980
Until one day,

481
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,460
I confessed to him

482
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,860
when I was drunk.

483
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,060
He was frozen on the spot.

484
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,220
You don't know how awkward it was.

485
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,180
I regretted it so much.

486
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,540
I know that he doesn't like me.

487
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,100
So, why did I confess to him?

488
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,780
From that day onward,

489
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,300
things became weird between us.

490
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,860
He purposely kept his distance from me.

491
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,700
To resolve the issue,

492
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,380
I purposely got myself a French boyfriend.

493
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,620
What happened after that?

494
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,020
After that, I broke up with my French boyfriend.

495
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,060
Because in my heart,

496
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,780
he is still the special one.

497
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,980
I know that I can only move forward

498
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,420
when I let go of this feeling for him.

499
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,460
Only then can I

500
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,220
accept another one into my heart.

501
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,660
But I don't know

502
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,500
why I can't do it.

503
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,740
Until I come back this time

504
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
and see him

505
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,500
with someone he loves.

506
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm really happy for him.

507

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,500
are not as complicated as you think.

513
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,900
Maybe the more you hide it,

514
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,460
the harder it is for you to let go.

515
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,900
I think you should tell him about this story.

516
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,860
Maybe

517
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,700
you can't get used to it

518
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,660
at first.

519
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,220
Maybe it'll be awkward.

520
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,820
But you won't lose him as a friend.

521
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,620
In the future,

522
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,180
you don't have to pretend
that it doesn't matter anymore.

I believe in that.

526
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,940
