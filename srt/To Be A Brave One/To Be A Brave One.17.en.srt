Please,

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,320
Please.

176

(But Chen Fang's mother did not want my money.)

177
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,960
(She got the head nurse to return the card to me.)

178
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,790
Before this,

179
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,760
I've imagined it countless times.

180
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,080
If Chen Fang's mother was standing before me,

181
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,230
what would I say?

182
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,590
What...

183
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,550
What can I do?

184
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,110
Even if it's just something little

185
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,550
to make her feel better.

186
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,440
But when she did stand in front of me,

187
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,500
I couldn't utter a word.

188
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,670
I didn't know what to say.

189
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,470
I am a mother too.

190
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,500
I understand what she's feeling.

191
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,430
If anyone did anything to Yiyi...

192
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,990
Seriously, I...

193
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,310
I would never forgive them.

194
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,830
I wouldn't ever want to see that person.

195

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,710
Not yet.

344
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,340
I'm going downstairs to get some food.

345
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,620
I have more work to do.

346
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,670
Recharge your battery.

347
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,550
Replenish some energy.

348
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,740
I think it instantly went from 0 to 100.

349
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,550
It contains liquor?

350
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,140
Liquor-filled chocolates?

351
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,260
It's just a little bit.

352
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,190
It won't affect work.

353
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,500
Are you getting the feeling

354
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,460
that we're the only ones in the zone

355
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,620
and no one else gets to enjoy the fun?

356
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,550
It's you!

357
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,550
I missed you so much!

358
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,310
Lin Fei'er.

359
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,740
What are you doing here?

360
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,340
You came back.

361
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,550
So why can't I come back?

362
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,860
Let me introduce you to each other.

363
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,620
An Yu.

364
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,260
Lin Fei'er.

365
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,500
Lin Fei'er, An Yu.

366
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,430
An Yu.

367
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,830
Lin Fei'er is Mr. Lin's daughter.

368
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,590
An Yu.

369
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,790
Fei'er!

370
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,220
Miss Yu?

371
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,260
Miss Yu!

372
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,030
It's really you!

373
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,430
You're back.

374
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,030
Why are you here?

375
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,190
You've grown taller.

376
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,740
And you dyed your hair.

377
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,460
Looks good.

378
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,220
You've lost so much weight.

379
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,980
I've missed you.

380
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,380
-I miss you too.
-So,

381
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,380
you two didn't need my introductions.

382
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,100
I've been following Miss Yu around

383
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,340
since I was a kid.

384
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,380
Because she's pretty.

385
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,710
I took her clothes shopping.

386
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,790
Let us go.

387
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,710
Come with me.

388
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,310
Where to?

389
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,430
To welcome me back.

390
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,790
You promised to battle with me, right?

391
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,380
We can't.

392
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,190
An Yu and I need to stay back today.

393
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,430
Why not later tonight?

394
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,620
Then I'll go and see my dad first.

395
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,860
Come and get me later.

396
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,740
Deal?

397
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,830
Okay.

398
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,100
Bye.

399
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,030
Bye-bye.

400
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,550
So that's Mr. Lin's daughter
people have been talking about.

401
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,950
What an amazing aura.

402
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,460
That's an artist for you.

403
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,340
[The Secret Garden]

404
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,910
(So,)

405
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,790
(how long are you staying this time?)

406
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,430
Why?

407
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,590
How long do you want me to stay?

408
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,500
Is that up to me to decide?

409
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,740
I'm not sure how long I'll stay.

410
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,140
I'm planning to do something big.

411
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,140
Have you heard of this portrait photographer?

412
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,710
August Sander.

413
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,710
Are you using his work
"People of the 20th Century"

414
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,980
as your inspiration?

415
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I want to get to know my subjects
on a deeper level

416
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,790
and examine their lives,

417
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,830
capturing their most captivating moments.

418
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,740
Your idea is good.

419
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,260
But let's hope it's not a short-lived passion.

420
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,950
It won't be short-lived.

421
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,190
I've already thought about

422
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,430
who the first subject should be.

423
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,830
Don't tell me it's me.

424
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,140
No way.

425
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,430
Why not?

426
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,310
What about this?

427
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,590
Draw An Yu.

428
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,070
Why me?

429
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,830
Why can't she draw you?

430
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,620
Why me?

431
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,100
Listen, Fei'er is an exceptional painter.

432
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,860
She'll be able to paint the best version

433
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
of you on the canvas.

434
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,430
I know Fei'er is good.

435
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,380
But me?

436
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,070
I...

437
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,980
Maybe...

438
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
I could draw both of you.

439
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,460
Sure.

440
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,860
Draw us both.

441
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,380
-Why is the door open?
-Is that okay?

442
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,380
We...

443
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,460
What?

444
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,430
Fei'er?

445
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,980
Lin Fei'er!

446
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,430
Kai!

447
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,980
When did you get back?

448
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,030
I just got back.

449
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,190
Why didn't you tell me that she's back?

450
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,830
She didn't tell me either.

451
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,670
Let me introduce you to each other.

452
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,670
This is Lailai.

453
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,670
She is Fei'er.

454
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,100
Hello, I'm Fei'er.

455
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,190
Hi, Fei'er.

456
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,030
Lailai is our colleague.

457
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,550
An'an and I live in the opposite unit.

458
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,910
You guys are neighbors?

459
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Lailai, it's nice to meet you.

460
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,910
Why don't you guys

461
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,430
open a bottle of wine first?

462
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,550
Set the table.

463
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,380
I'll be quick.

464
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,030
You made it

465
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,220
in time for my big feast.

466
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,340
No worries.

467
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,190
Listen.

468
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,070
Her cooking skills improved a lot.

469
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,740
I thought she couldn't cook.

470
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,070
Who knows if she's faking it?

471
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,460
Who asked me to get the cookies?

472
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,070
Me.

473
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,830

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,740
Like what?

515
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,830
I keep feeling like

516
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,790
someone is secretly watching us.

517
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,140
Watching us?

518
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,860
Who?

519
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,260
Don't scare yourself.

520
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,590
It's very late.

521
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,790
No one is here.

522
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,830
Silly you.

523
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,750
Fly the drone back.

524
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,710
Don't disturb them.

525
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,020
Okay.

526
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,700
[The Secret Garden]

527
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,750
So those two...

528
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,470
They are definitely dating.

529
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,110
But when did it start?

530
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,500
That I don't know.

531
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,900
But I did notice

532
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,660
that Kai has been acting weird lately.

533
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,230
He's always staring at his phone,

534
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,660
smiling like a fool.

535
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,020
Now that you mention it,

536
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,180
I also think Lailai has been strange lately.

537
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,420
She kept saying that she
went to feed stray cats outside,

538
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,950
and now there is a big tomcat.

539
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,500
But why didn't they tell us they were together?

540
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,990
Yeah.

541
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,710
Why didn't they tell us?

542
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,710
One more kiss.

543
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,780
Enough.

544
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,590
I'm going up first.

545
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,710
Come up after me.

546
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,750
Bye-bye.

547
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,540
An'an, why haven't you slept?

548
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,900
Why were you out for so long?

549
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,300
The stray cat downstairs was very clingy.

550
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,260
It wanted me to hold it

551
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,350
and play with it.

552
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,110
Plus, those innocent eyes

553
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,260
are just like Ice Cream's.

554
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,500
So I couldn't help but stay
and play with it a while longer.

555
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,070
I'd like to meet that cat too.

556
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,870
I'm sure it's already gone.

557
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,150
