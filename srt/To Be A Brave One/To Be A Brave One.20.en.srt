00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,320
We can talk about it tomorrow.

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
I'll get off work first.

173
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,030
What about you?

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,520
I went to Fang Li

175
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,280
to notify her of the meeting.

176
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,880
I still have a meeting to attend.

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
Why don't you wait for me?

178
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
We can have dinner together after the meeting.

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
But I'm tired.

180
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,790
I wish to head home first.

181
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,000
Alright then.

182
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,640
I'll head to my meeting.

183
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,000
Yiyi,

184
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
you're still asleep?

185
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,110
It's time for your piano lesson.

186
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,710
Yiyi?

187
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,280
Yiyi, what's wrong?

188
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,640
Daddy, I feel sick.

189
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Tell me, where do you feel sick?

190
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,200
Over here.

191
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,440
Here.

192
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,550
And here.

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,790
You have such a high fever.

194
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,350
Yiyi.

195
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
My baby, you're sick.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Let me bring you to the hospital, okay?

197
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,960
I want Mommy.

198
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,230
Yiyi,

199
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,080
Mommy is busy right now.

200
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,150
She can't come back.

201
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,230
I want Mommy.

202
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,910
Let Daddy bring you to the hospital, okay?

203
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,000
I want Mommy!
I don't want to go to the hospital!

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,790
Okay. Yiyi, be a good boy.

205
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,400
I'll call Mommy.

206
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,230
Hello, Lulu?

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
Hello?

208
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,400
I have an important meeting to attend right now.

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
I'll call you later.

210
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,960
I...

211
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,790
Yiyi,

212
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,910
Mommy is really busy.

213
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,880
Let's head to the hospital,

214
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,320
okay?

215
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,030
You're having a high fever right now.

216
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
I want Mommy!

217
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,150
Yiyi, be a good boy.

218
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,400
I want Mommy!

219
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,640
I don't want to go to the hospital!

220
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,440
Alright.

221
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,710
Alright.

222
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,640
Yiyi, be a good boy.

223
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760
Let me make another call.

224
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,150
[An Yu]

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,910
Hello, An Yu?

226
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,280
Are you busy right now?

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,840
Yiyi is having a fever.

228
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,880
Can you...

229
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
What's the matter?

230
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,640
He caught a cold.

231
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Calm down.

232
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
He had an IV drip just now.

233
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
His fever will subside soon.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,350
He's sweating so much.

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,910
How did I fall asleep?

236
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,030
How long have I been asleep?

237
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,710
Around an hour.

238
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,910
How is it?

239
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,910
His fever has subsided, right?

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
His head is not that hot now.

241
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,960
Actually, I've been suffering
from insomnia for a long time.

242
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,030
It's been so long

243
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,230
since I slept soundly like that.

244
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,440
I didn't even know that I fell asleep.

245
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,350
It's as if I feel the most secure

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,200
and most relaxed

247
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
when I'm together with you.

248
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:52,125
[Dear]

249
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,400
He'll be done after 15 minutes at most.

250
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
Remember to call me when it's done.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,910
I'll be in the next room.

252
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,470
Okay.

253
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,960
You two as the kid's parents must remember
to take his temperature for him.

254
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,550
Thank you.

255
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,710
What are you doing here?

256
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,910
Didn't you say you were going to
head home after work?

257
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,670
Why did you only return by now?

258
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
I...

259
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,400
Lailai,

260
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,350
were you taking out the trash?

261
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah,

262
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,590
An'an.

263
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,350
Let me join you.

264
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,960
Okay.

265
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,760
Goodbye.

266
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,350
Let's go.

267
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Rest early, okay?

268
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,350
Lailai,

269
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,880
did you know

270
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
why I came back this late today?

271
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,400
Why?

272
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
I went to see Yiyi.

273
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
You went to see Yiyi?

274
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,590
Mi Lu was away on a business trip.

275
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,280
Yiyi fell sick at the same time.

276
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,520
Zhou Yuan couldn't handle him,

277
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,790
and he asked me to help him out.

278
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,110
Was it serious?

279
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,790
He had a fever.

280
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,110
He was much better after getting the IV drip.

281
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,640
Why did he create
another chance for you to meet Yiyi

282
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,230
on purpose when Mi Lu wasn't around?

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,910
Don't tell me he's up to something again.

284
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,150
This won't do.

285
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,880
An'an, you must be careful.

286
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,400
You didn't tell Mr. Wolf, right?

287
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,350
I was planning to tell him.

288
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,790
But I happened to

289
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,400
bump into you downstairs.

290
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,760
It's lucky I was there.

291
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,320
You mustn't tell Mr. Wolf about this.

292
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,150
You must never tell him.

293
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,550
But why?

294
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,520
I'll tell him if he asks me about it.

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,590
I like to speak the truth.

296
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,790
It's good to be honest.

297
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,520
Being honest is a matter of principle.

298
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,000
You don't need

299
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,640
to tell him every detail of your life.

300
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,180
The two of you need private space.

301
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,180
Don't tell me you're dating Mr. Wolf now.

302
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,260
You don't have much
relationship experience yourself.

303
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
How did you end up

304
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,350
becoming a relationship expert?

305
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,350
That's not it.

306
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,500
I've been added to a secret group
consisting of relationship experts lately.

307
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,620
There are plenty of useful posts in there.

308
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,030
Let me add you to the group.

309
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,670
Reformation?

310
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,550
This is the commemoration badge
introduced by Hongxing Telecom

311
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,140
for their 30th anniversary.

312
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,950
I could tell that they were
pretty extravagant back then.

313
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,740
Seems like

314
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,460
not only do you want them to survive,

315
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,980
but you also want them to thrive.

316
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,140
It'll only be challenging if we do so.

317
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,830
Trust me, Lin.

318
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,140
We'll earn plenty more
if we reform the entire company

319
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,740
instead of selling it away.

320
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,030
However, it's also highly likely

321
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,550
that Hongxing Telecom

322
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,710
has no chance to start anew.

323
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,220
Moreover,

324
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,710
we need time to proceed with our projects,

325
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,030
especially

326
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,950
an old and huge factory like Hongxing Telecom

327
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,830
with plenty of employees at their disposal.

328
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,430
Besides that,

329
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,260
it'll be more difficult and riskier

330
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,670
to obtain our capital from circulation.

331
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm a thoughtful man.

332
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Of course, I've taken that fact into account.

333
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,910
You can check the last page.

334
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,980
You wish to be a shareholder?

335
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,980
By my guess,

336
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,030
our acquisition of Hongxing Telecom

337
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,340
won't proceed smoothly.

338
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,620
Yimi Capital will surely interfere.

339
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,220
That's why I've contacted several investors

340
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,980
whom I had cooperated with before.

341
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,340
Including my investment,

342
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,830
you and Zhuoyue

343
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,670
will definitely

344
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,740
make a profit.

345
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,100
I guess all of your fortunes are at stake then.

346
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,030
Lin,

347
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,710
you don't need to expose me

348
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,670
like that.

349
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,550
Is it worth it for you to do so
for an unrelated company

350
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,710
like Hongxing Telecom?

351
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,590
In this industry,

352
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,460
there's no such thing as worth it or not.

353
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,670
It only depends on
whether you're willing to take the bet.

354
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,670
Hello?

355
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,710
Have you arranged an appointment for me?

356
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,830
Alright, I understand.

357
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,220
Miss Mi,

358
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,670
the business trip must've been tough.

359
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,790
Where are we heading later?

360
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,030
I still have things to attend to.

361
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,310
Let's not head home for now.

362
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,070
Alright.

363
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,380
Please have some water.

364
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you.

365
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,340
What do you think about this acquisition plan?

366
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,950
About that,

367
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,340
to be honest, I have no idea.

368
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,430
Acquiring our factory is a huge thing.

369
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,260
It concerns

370
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,830
the benefits of all the factory workers.

371
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,220
As the factory manager,

372
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,260
I don't think I should say yes that easily.

373
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,430
Of course.

374
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,140
Just tell us

375
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,710
what you need.

376
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,030
We will do our best to cooperate with you.

377
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,980
Just give us your conditions.

378
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,030
Alright.

379
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,910
Give me some time to think about it.

380
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,190
I'll be counting on you, then.

381
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,590
I'll make a move first
as I have something to attend to.

382
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,740
Alright.

383
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,500
Please.

[Assistant Factory Manager]

385
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,670
Uncle!

386
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,220
Jingya, you're here?

387
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,140
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

388
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,710
You have something to tell me?

389
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,430
Could it be that you found a job for me?

390
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,740
Uncle,

391
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,430
you're so efficient.

392
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,260
It concerns your future.

393
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,500
Of course, I have to pay great attention to it.

394
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,590
By the way, Uncle,

395
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,710
was Mi Lu here

396
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,500
to look for you just now?

397
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,460
Do you know Ms. Mi?

398
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,670
She's the reason I lost my job in the first place.

399
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,460
Alright.

400
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,310
Tell me everything.

401
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:32,525
[Assistant Factory Manager, Mr. Qian]

402
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,310
Hello?

403
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,740
Ms. Mi,

404
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,140
I've reviewed your acquisition plan

405
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,790
time and time again.

406
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,430
I've given it some serious thought.

407
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,030
I still think it's problematic.

408
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,140
What's the problem?

409
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,100
Your acquisition plan

410
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,140
didn't consider

411
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,500
the future of our factory workers.

412
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,620
If we let you guys

413
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,740
acquire our factory,

414
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
the workers

415
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,190
will lose their jobs.

416
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,710
That's why I need to reconsider it.

417
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,550
A, o.

418
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,980
What's that?

419
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,140
A.

420
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,100
Huopo, lively.

421
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,070
It's pronounced as "po".

422
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,910
Am I right?

423
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,500
Xiangjiao, banana.

424
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,620
Hello!

425
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,790
-Mommy!
-Mommy is back.

426
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,140
You're back!

427
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,710
Mommy is exhausted.

428
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,590
Did you miss me?

429
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,380
I did.

430
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,220
Come on.

431
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,910
I've heated some milk for you.

432
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,830
Have it while it's hot.

433
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,670
The trip must've been exhausting.

434
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,550
Here.

435
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,380
Have some milk.

436
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,590
I thought your flight was this afternoon?

437
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,710
Why have you only returned by now?

438
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,959
I went to negotiate a deal with Hongxing Telecom.

439
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,030
That's why I came back late.

440
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,100
Let me prepare the bathtub for you.

441
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,030
No need for that.

442
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,100
I missed you guys so much
during the business trip.

443
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,740
Let me keep you guys company.

444
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,140
I bought some gifts for you two.

445
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,310
What kind of gifts?

446
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,740
Let's take a guess

447
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,500
at what your mother bought for you.

448
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,430
Could it be my favorite
Transformers action figure?

449
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:14,950
Smart boy.

450
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,620
Transformers!

451
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,430
It's my favorite Bumblebee!

452
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,620
Thank you, Mommy!

453
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,830
Yiyi, you have a gift.

454
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,460
Don't you think Daddy should have a gift too?

455
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,030
Mommy,

456
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,620
what did you buy for Daddy?

457
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,550
Take a look.

458
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,670
The gift she bought for Daddy is...

459
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,310
Cufflinks!

460
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,910
I see.

461
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,790
Have you been a good boy
when you were in the kindergarten?

462
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,620
Yes, I have.

463
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,500
Mommy,

464
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,790
let me show you my painting.

465
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,910
My teacher praised me for it.

466
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,190
Let me take a look.

467
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,710
Yiyi,

468
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,460
you're getting better and better at drawing.

469
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,910
Are they Mommy and you?

470
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,670
No.

471
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,670
It's the pretty lady and me.

472
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,830
Mommy wasn't around

473
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,860
when I fell sick.

474
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,950
Daddy brought me to the hospital for a jab.

475
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,830
I wasn't afraid at all.

476
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,220
I didn't cry either.

477
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,190
The pretty lady took care of me.

478
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,140
Mommy, look.

479
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,500
I'm all healthy now.

480
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,670
Yiyi,

481
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,140
since Mommy bought you your favorite toy,

482
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,860
why don't you go upstairs
and have some fun with it?

483
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,140
Okay.

484
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,100
Let's play with your toy upstairs, okay?

485
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,260
Yiyi, go now.

486
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,190
Go ahead.

487
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,980
Be careful.

488
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,710
Hurry up.

489
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,100
When did he fall sick?

490
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,190
I called you before.

491
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,430
Yiyi fell sick right after you left.

492
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,190
When I called you, you said
you were in an important meeting.

493
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,790
After that, you hung up on me.

494
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,620
Does that mean you must need An Yu's help?

495
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,310
Yiyi was crying and throwing a tantrum.

496
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,430
He didn't even want me to carry him.

497
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,670
I had no choice.

498
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,030
I couldn't deal with him.

499
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,070
If so, shouldn't you
have told me about it after that?

500
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,980
I might never know about this

501
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,620
if it weren't for this drawing.

502
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,030
Yes.

503
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,030
I should've told you immediately
right after the incident.

504
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,910
It was my fault.

505
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,340
I'm sorry, Lulu.

506
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,910
I didn't think too much about it.

507
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,220
I thought it was over.

508
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,140
I'll check on Yiyi upstairs.

509
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,380
Zhou Yuan,

510
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,590
I asked you this before.

511
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,460
