Hello.

I'm Chen Wei,

Come on, Mr. Shao.

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,360
It isn't right. There's a misunderstanding.

-There's a misunderstanding.
-Don't go.

Isn't no one staying next door?

They just moved in.

48

They're throwing a party
even though they just moved in.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,910
What is wrong with them?

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
It's so rowdy.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
It's too rowdy.

52

Hi.

63
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,070
How is it?

64
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,230
Have you found a place?

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,270
I have,

66
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,830
but you insisted on being the neighbor of An Yu.

67
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,390
What exactly do you want to do,

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,160
Shao Moli?

69
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,230
Is this the right way to talk to your boss?

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,350
I've sent the photo of the house to you.

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,350
Check it out yourself then.

72
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,480
Unexpectedly, we've become Mr. Shao's neighbors.

73
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,670
We're way too lucky.

74
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,600
Mr. Shao,

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,000
you just moved here?

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,550
Yes.

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,480
We just moved here.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,600
You threw a party even though you just moved here?

79
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,350
They're our clients.

80
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,950
They just came in abruptly to throw a party.

81
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,070
I think it's very rowdy.

82
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,320
So I'm out.

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,950
It's all right.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,510
Perfect timing.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
Take a rest here.

86
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,390
We'll be neighbors in the future.

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Let's visit each other more frequently.

88
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,230
What about I show you around?

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,270
Sure.

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,160
Come on.

91
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,670
This

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,350
is our extremely huge washroom.

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
There are still some dirty clothes
which have yet to be washed.

94
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,000
Our washing machine has broken down.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
I don't know when it can be repaired.

96
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,640
This

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,950
is our kitchen.

98
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,510
I seem to be a bit hungry.

99
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,880
An'an,

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
are you hungry?

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,790
Let's order takeouts.

102
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,040
Sure.

103
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,760
Do you have any instant noodles?

104
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,510
Yes, we do.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,480
Then let me cook the noodles.

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
It's very delicious.

107
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,950
Mr. Shao.

108
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
I didn't expect that you would be
not only handsome

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
but also capable.

110
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,720
Unexpectedly, you know how to cook
such delicious food.

111
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,880
I only know how to cook instant noodles.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,510
That's enough.

113
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,160
By the way, Lailai.

114
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,350
I've done working on the balance sheet.

115
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,600
You can double check later.

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,070
Okay.

117
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,160
There's no need to take a look at it.

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,760
It won't help the project.

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,670
And these are the financial statements
of Wei'er Hotel for ten years.

120
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,950
Each of us shall take half.

121
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,350
Okay.

122
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,440
There's no need to take a look at these either.

123
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,600
They're unimportant.

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,160
It might seem to Mr. Shao

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,550
that we're wasting our time

126
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,320
and that they're unimportant,

127
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,440
but to us,

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,350
they're very important.

129
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,270
Yes.

130
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,760
Moreover, these are related to whether
we can become permanent staff or not.

131
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,040
I just don't want to see you wasting your time

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,230
and energy.

133
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,950
Trust me.

134
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,510
A financial statement can't thoroughly reflect

135
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,320
the actual situation of a company.

136
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,040
You'll need to look into many different aspects

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
to truly understand a company.

138
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,880
My goodness. I set three alarms.

139
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
I didn't expect that none of them woke me up.

140
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,880
I've heated milk and eggs.

141
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Take them with you and eat
when you have a chance later.

142
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Thank you, An'an.

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,760
It's our team leader.

144
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Hello, Mr. Su.

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm just out.

146
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Okay, I'll go now.

147
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Okay, bye-bye!

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,670
Our team leader wants me to go to the bank
to get some documents first

149
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,270
before going to the company.

150
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,320
You want to go to the bank first?

151
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,830
Yes.

152
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,550
Then I'll make a move first.

153
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,760
All right. Take a cab there then.

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,270
Sure.

155
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,670
Thank you for your breakfast, An'an.

156
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,950
See you later at the company.

and very difficult problem faced
in an acquisition case.

179

So the first thing to settle after I got back

180
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,470
was to understand the willingness and attitude

181

of the management of Wei'er Hotel

No matter how dismissive you are of the plan,

441
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,780
I told the HR Department to hire her.

00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,730
he's also aware

455

that there are a few companies

456

When I taught Yiyi to play the piano today,

467
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,090
he insisted on playing games on the iPad.

468
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,250
I told him that he wasn't allowed to do so.

469
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,090
And he was a little angry,

telling me that he hates me.

471
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,580
I'm afraid that he'll remember this
and hate me in the future.

You were right.

When Yiyi grows up in the future,

474
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,610
he'll surely think

It's plan B for sure.

There are so many plans in your plan B.

Now you can let me be alone in my space.

509
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,300
You're so cold-blooded.

510
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,540
Go away.

511
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,210
Cold-blooded.

512
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,800
[An Yu: Recalled a message]

513
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,420
-I'd like to ask...
-I'd like to ask...

514
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,370
-I also would like to ask...
-You go first.

515
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,020
I just want to ask

516
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,900
that if I realize

517
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,420
that there are some issues
with the financial statements,

518
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,540
what should we do?

519
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,130
What issues?

520
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,250
Like what you said earlier,

521
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,090
a financial statement can't reflect

522
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,820
the actual situation of a company.

523
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,020
I realized

524
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,540
that something is wrong with its data.

525
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,520
[Inconsistent with the actual provision]
[There's a discrepancy. The amounts don't match.]

526
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Miss An,

527
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,970
may I have the honor

528
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,540
to invite you for a drink?

529
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,610
Go for a drink?

530
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,850
You can hold your liquor.

531
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,060
Mr. Shao,

532
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,490
don't tell me we're here to just drink?

533
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,700
Didn't you say you wanted to be here
to check the occupancy rate?

534
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,580
Yes.

535
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,450
Judging from the discrepancies
found in your report,

536
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,780
there's a high possibility

537
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,820
that Wei'er Hotel fabricated its occupancy rate.

538
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,850
So we're now here

539
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,210
to count heads?

540
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,780
Yes.

541
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,210
To count heads.

542
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,580
Let's go.

543
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,420
Come on.

544
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,130
Mr. Shao, you've made me giddy
by bringing me around with no specific direction.

545
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,970
What exactly are we doing in the laundry room?

546
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,450
No.

547
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,210
If Wei'er Hotel fabricated its occupancy rate
and financial data,

548
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,450
how do you think we want to prove it?

549
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,540
We'll need to check the data.

550
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,300
If they dare to fabricate,

551
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,940
do you think the data is still reliable?

552
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,370
So we're going to the laundry room to...

553
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,210
To count the towels.

554
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,660
We're going to the laundry room
to calculate the towels one by one?

555
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,090
No.

556
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,130
The hotel will definitely have a record
of the number of washes in the laundry room.

557
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,300
Coupled with the staff's punch-in record,

558
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,780
these are what we want.

559
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,020
Didn't you bring your key?

560
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,730
I'm coming.

561
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,090
Kai, it's already 10:30 PM.

562
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,580
And?

563
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:54,850
It's 10:30 PM,

564
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,090
but An'an is still not back.

565
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,450
Then what?

566
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,130
Shao is not back either.

567
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,940
Moreover, she can't be reached by phone now.

568
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,610
What do you mean?

569
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,020
Should I call Shao?

570
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,090
Hurry up.

571
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,420

is temporarily unavailable.)

573

It's temporarily unavailable?

574
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,850
No, I'm worried about An'an.

575
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,300
They said earlier

576
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,940
that there was something fishy
with Wei'er Hotel's occupancy rate.

577
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,940
Did they go to the hotel?

578
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,850
Did something bad happen?

579
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,660
Nothing will happen in a hotel.

580
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,580
And Shao is there.

581
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,370
It's because of him that it's worrying me.

582
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,450
No, I have to go and check things out.

583
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,540
Wait for me.

584
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,700
Let me get changed and I'll go with you.

585
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Hurry up.

586
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,180
Kai.

587
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,580
I've ordered a ride-sharing service.

588
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,610
It'll be here after going through
an intersection.

589
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,660
Ride-sharing?

590
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,420
Two people can even ride-share?

591
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,180
-We'll be done soon.
-Hurry up.

592
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,420
We're done.

593
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:53,940
I got it.

594
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,090
Hurry up.

595
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,970
What should we do?

596
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,820
What should we do?

597
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,420
Kai, get in the car.

598
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,610
Kai, are you all right?

599
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,730
I'm all right.

600
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm okay.

601
00:28:51,370 --> 00:29:00,020
[Dangerous action, do not imitate]

602
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,940

603
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,450
Seriously?

604
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,450
Phone.

605
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,490
There's no signal.

606
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,660
It's so boring.

607
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,330
Let's chat.

608
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,060
Sure.

609
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,540
You share yours first.

610
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,420
What's it?

611
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,700
Your story.

612
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,370
I'm a very boring person.

613
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,370
There's nothing much to talk about.

614
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,940
Or you can share your story first.

615
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,490
Will you believe

616
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,700
what I say?

617
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,490
I'll believe

618
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,330
what you say.

619
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,210
When I was young,

620
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,780
I was adopted

621
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,940
and moved overseas.

622
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,090
My academic performance wasn't bad.

623
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,420
I also did well in the finance circle.

624
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,700
After that, I realized one thing.

625
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,330
The achievements in work

626
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,940
couldn't really bring me happiness.

627
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,540
We always say

628
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,820
that we work to live a better life.

629
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,210
But we always forget what life is

630
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,060
because of work.

631
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,610
So you came back from overseas to Zhuoyue

632
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,540
to live your life?

633
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,450
It depends on how you perceive it then.

634
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,730
It's your turn.

635
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,020
Or

636
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,420
let me tell you a story.

637
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,900
It's the only fairy tale I know.

638
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,580
A very long time ago,

639
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,730
on the other side of the sea,

640
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,540
there was a country.

641
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,730
There was spring all year round,

642
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,090
and flowers were blooming.

643
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,060
One day,

644
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,370
the king's princess was born.

645
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,210
Since she was born,

646
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,850
she was blessed by the Goddess of Luck.

647
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,210
It was said that she could bring
a wonderful future to that country.

648
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,300
She really was very lucky.

649
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,730
Since she was young,

650
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,330
she was adored.

651
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,420
Meaning to say

652
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,090
this is the story of a princess
who had Princess Syndrome.

653
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,780
She was mischievous

654
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,700
and adventurous.

655
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,090
But whenever

656
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,780
she encountered a difficulty,

657
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,940
there'd be a black knight

658
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,060
wearing a mask and a black shirt

659
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,780
falling from the sky to save her from the danger.

660
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,890
As time went by,

661
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,620
this princess also grew up.

662
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,820
But one day, all of a sudden...

663
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,220
(We're the Financial Crime Taskforce
of Yuqing City Public Security Bureau.)

Dad!

669
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,060
Not long ago after that,

670
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,410
the princess

671
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,370
was brought to an attic.

672
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,410
That was a small room

673
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,010
with only one window.

674
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,980
She could only see a small patch of sunlight.

675
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,580
There was nothing she could do,

676
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,530
except for waiting anxiously.

677
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,410
(She didn't expect)

678
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,170
(that after waiting for a long time,)

679
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,130
(what she heard)

680
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,940
(was the news of her dad's death.)

681
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,250
(Before your dad passed away,)

682
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,370
he had been calling your name.

683
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,980
He said that he kept his own promise

684
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,380
by not smoking anymore.

685
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,730
In that small attic,

686
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,900
she spent

687
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,660
countless long nights

688
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,010
and hopeless days.

689
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,100
It seemed

690
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,450
that no one remembered her.

691
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,620
The black knight

692
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,660
didn't appear anymore.

693
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,420
The princess

694
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,010
had been forgotten by the world.

695
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,820
What happened after that?

696
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,490
After that...

697
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,420
After that, she came out of the attic.

698
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,010
She told herself

699
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,690
[Father An Wenbin's Tomb]
(that in this world,)

700
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,730
(there was already no one that she could rely on.)

701
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,060
(She didn't know)

702
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,620
(if she'd have time for tomorrow.)

703
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,770
So as long as we're still alive now,

704
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,660
live our lives properly then.

705
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,210
How about the black knight?

706
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,580
Who knows?

707
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,770
In fact, this story

708
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,580
was told by my dad when I was young.

709
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,970
I always fell asleep

710
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
halfway through the story.
