[Episode 27]

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,910
Mr. Gen,

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,800
it's been so long since we had a meal together.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,550
Yeah.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,230
You're much thinner now.

22
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,760
You should eat up.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,720
Actually,

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,510
I should've gone and paid you a visit.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
Xiaoshu has told me about you.

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,360
You're currently working in Zhuoyue,

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
and you're doing great.

29
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,550
I've also heard about

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,760
the business he has started.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,190
He was indebted to you,

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,680
but he repaid you with vengeance instead.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,310
I didn't teach him well.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,600
I would like to apologize to you on his behalf.

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,190
Please don't say that.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,960
Youngsters nowadays

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,390
have their own ideas

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,750
and choices.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,910
However, it's lucky

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,880
that we're finally cooperating with each other.

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,080
I'm sorry and thankful

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,880
that you're giving him another chance.

43
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,080
You're just like

44
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,240

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,750
Both of you are truly kind.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
By the way, Mr. Gen,

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,440
have you seen

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,440
this person before?

49
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,600
He's the owner of Kaiyuan Trading.

50
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,520
His name is Wang Kai.

51
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,270
Wang Kai?

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,390
Wang Kai...

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,390
Could it be Mr. Wang?

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,360
I've seen him once.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,750
Dad,

56
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,360
Mr. Wang is one of us.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,670
He's very trustworthy.

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,270
You can rest assured.

59
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,190
This matter can either be a huge

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,270
or a small deal.

61
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,390
Mr. An, it's natural

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,750
that you are worried.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
However,

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,240
we have plenty of time here.

65
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,630
You can take your time and think about it.

66
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,360
Excuse me.

67
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,240
I have a call to answer.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,800
Dad,

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,470
Mr. Wang may have plenty of time,

70
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,910
but our loan repayment won't wait for us.

71
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,600
The salaries of our employees
for next month won't wait for us.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,750
We're running out of time.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Did Zhou Yuan say

74
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,550
that Mr. Wang was one of them?

75
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,600
If so, have you ever seen him

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,600
spending time with Mr. Wang alone?

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think so.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,080
But I was reminded of something

79
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,320
after hearing what you had said.

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
He got into a car with a unique color

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,190
when I saw him off last time.

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,550
Back then, Ms. Chen and I were arguing

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,550
whether

84
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,600
it was green or cerulean blue.

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,470
That's why it left a deep impression on me.

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
After that...

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
What happened after that?

88
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,240
After that,

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,160
I only knew that the car

90
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,920
belonged to Miss Mi

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
when Mr. Zhou

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
started dating her.

93
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,040
So Wang Kai got into Mi Lu's car?

94
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,600
Are you sure?

95
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,110
The color of Miss Mi's car

96
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,510
is very unique.

97
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm sure it was her car.

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
If that's the case,

99
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,270
that means Wang Kai and Mi Lu
knew each other back then.

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
Since you can't sleep,

101
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,040
why don't we have a drink?

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,830
Mr. Gen was right.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,390
Wang Kai and Mi Lu did know each other.

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,550
More importantly,

105
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,070
both of them

106
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,720
came from Luoquan Town.

107
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
If so, what should we do next?

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,720
How about this?

109
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,110
Let's rest well tonight.

110
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,000
We can head to Luoquan Town tomorrow morning.

111
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,880
Okay.

112
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,070
Drink up.

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,760
I will wake you up tomorrow morning.

114
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,510
How long before we reach there?

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,270
Over an hour.

116
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,040
You can continue sleeping if you want.

117
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm not sleepy.

118
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,390
You didn't reply to my messages.

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,550
I knew you were still sleeping.

120
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't tell me you forgot
that we're meeting the landlord today.

121
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,720
I didn't.

122
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm so sleepy.

123
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,880
Isn't Mr. Wolf around?

124
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,440
He went out early in the morning.

125
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,270
He was so loud.

126
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,230
He even woke me up.

127
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,760
An'an left too.

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,670
She told me that she'd be gone for two days.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
What's with the two of them?

130
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,790
That's none of your business.

131
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,880
You better wake up!

132
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,070
Ye Kai,

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,270
listen up,

134
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,110
the deadline for the wedding ring refund
will be up

135
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,350
if we don't get the landlord
to sell the house to us today.

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,110
Let's go.

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,040
Help me get changed.

138
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,440
I've drafted a contract based on the template.

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,110
You two can have a look.

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
You can sign it today

141
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,200
if there's nothing wrong.

142
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay.

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,910
Mr. Peng,

144
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,470
when will you be flying back?

145
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,640
On the 5th of next month.

146
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,400
We still have time then.

147
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,230
We've prepared enough funds
to purchase your house.

148
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,470
Hello.

149
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,470
Your coffee is here.

150
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,350
Okay, thank you.

151
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,590
Sorry about that.

152
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,320
Let me get a new cup of coffee for you.

153
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,520
-I'm so sorry.
-I need to use the washroom.

154
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm truly sorry. Let me get a new one for you.

155
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,000
Please do so.

156
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,590
Thanks.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,910
Sorry about that.

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
You two haven't gotten married yet, right?

159
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,550
Actually,

160
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,320
I thought you two

161
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
don't look like husband and wife

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,640
who have been married for two years

163
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,550
when we did the video call last time.

164
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,550
You two looked like a pair of lovebirds instead.

165
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,640
Was it that obvious?

166
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,200
I saw her ring

167
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,280
when she removed it.

168
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,470
There weren't any dents on it.

169
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,080
Mr. Peng,

170
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,280
We aren't husband and wife.

172
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,590
We're just a normal couple.

173
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,840
We just wanted

174
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,520
to have our own house in the city so badly.

175
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,960
That's why we lied to you.

176
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,350
I understand how you feel.

177
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,440
I was once like you guys.

178
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,200
I did the same thing

179
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,670
more than ten years ago.

180
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,790
This house

181
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,230
was my first home in the city.

182
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,320
If so, about the contract...

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
It's still valid.

184
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,840
Really?

185
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,000
You see,

186
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,840
you can always

187
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,710
find new houses to purchase.

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,110
However, you need to

189
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,470
grab hold of your loved one.

190
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,080
I can tell

191
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,790
that you two are in love with each other.

192
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,200
I don't think

193
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,400
you guys will lie to me.

194
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,080
Thank you so much.

195
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,820
[I'll head to the town first.
Call me when you wake up.]

196
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,350
Hello?

197
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm awake.

198
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Where are you?

199
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
An Yu,

200
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
I just paid a visit to the town's high school.

201
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,880
No one knew much about Wang Kai.

202
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,350
They only knew that he had a younger brother.

203
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,000
A younger brother?

204
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,710
If so,

205
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,710
where can we find him?

206
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,440
I don't know.

207
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,400
But this town isn't that big.

208
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,200
Why don't we ask around?

209
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,550
Maybe the people here know each other.

210
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,910
Excuse me.

211
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,670
[Town Photo Studio]
My photo studio

212
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,520
is almost four decades old.

213
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,110
I've basically seen every child

214
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,080
in the town before.

215
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,400
This person

216
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,670
looks unfamiliar to me.

217
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,910
This was his portrait when he started working.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,910
He might not look this mature when he was young.

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Please try to recall again.

220
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,000
The graduation photos

221
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,910
of all those children

222
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
were taken by me.

223
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,150
Look.

224
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,200
Even so, I don't have any impression of him.

225
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
This must be Mi Lu.

226
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,590
Yeah.

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
The daughter of the Mi family

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,910
has been beautiful since young.

229
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,760
She loved to take pictures here.

230
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,350
There was another chap

231
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
who kept following her around.

232
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,760
A chap?

233
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,470
Oh yeah,

234
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,320
that chap and his family

235
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,840
took a family portrait here
when he got into university.

236
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,440
It came out pretty good.

237
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,320
I even enlarged it on purpose.

238
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,110
I hung it in my studio for six months.

239
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,910
Do you still have that picture?

240
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,150
Let me see if I can find it for you.

241
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,150
Do you still remember this picture?

242
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,320
I do.

243
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Of course I do.

244
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,320
I got into the Faculty of Finance

245
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,760
at the University of Finance and Economics
after retaking the gaokao.

246
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,710
My grandma was so happy

247
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,000
that she held a three-day banquet for me.

248
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,470
After that,

249
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,670
she brought us to the studio and took this photo.

250
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,400
After that, I got into a university as well.

251
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,080
And I left Grandma

252
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,350
all alone in this house.

253
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,350
She called me often back then

254
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,440
and talked about all kinds of things.

255
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,350
Things like it's morning,

256
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,200
the flowers are blooming,

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
another stall vendor is leaving, and so on.

258
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,470
However, I finally understand now.

259
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,110
She just missed me.

260
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,280
She said that she wanted to visit me in Yuqing.

261
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,520
But now...

262
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,230
Grandma will know

263
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
that you're a filial child.

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,350
Stop blaming yourself,

265
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,910
okay?

266
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,200
You've been busy the entire morning.

267
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,790
You can leave the rest

268
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,230
to Uncle.

269
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,080
Get some rest.

270
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,230
Have some food,

271
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,790
okay?

272
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,760
Okay.

273
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,710
Look, this is it.

274
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,440
They have actually known each other since young.

275
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,960
Why was I in the dark during my university years?

276
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,760
Zhou Yuan

277
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,200
actually grew up here.

278
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,520
How many things is he hiding from me?

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,960
My father's imprisonment,

280
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,470
my imprisonment,

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,470
were they all related to him?

282
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,470
How many secrets

283
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,200
are being hidden within this town?

284
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,460
Madam Mi was a nice lady.

285
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,210
Mi Lu is so pitiful.

286
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,780
She's been lonely since young.

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,970
And now,

288
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,730
she has lost her only relative.

289
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,850
Mr. Wang?

290
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,580
An Yu?

291
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,780
What are you doing here?

292
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm here for some private matters.

293
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,900
Do you know Mi Lu as well?

294
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,820
We were neighbors since young.

295
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,820
Mr. Wang,

296
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,940
can we have a chat?

297
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,490
Sure.

298
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,370
Wang Kai is your elder brother?

299
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,370
He always bragged about

300
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,020
how beautiful the town was.

301
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,020
So, he grew up in Luoquan Town too?

302
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,370
He only left Luoquan Town
after graduating from primary school.

303
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,730
What happened after that?

304
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,180
After that,

305
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,820
he went abroad.

306
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,820
He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

307
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,330
He went abroad to seek treatment.

308
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,210
His doctor said

309
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,180
that he can't be cured three months ago.

310
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,450
So he came back after that.

311
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,730
May I know

312
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,580
which hospital is he currently at?

313
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,060
You two seem very concerned about him.

314
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,970
I wish to see him.

315
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,130
Okay.

316
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,700
Hello, Mr. Wang.

317
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,250
I'm An Yu.

318
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,450
My father is An Wenbin,

319
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,580
the chairman of Xingchen Financial.

320
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,020
He did

321
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,940
business with you

322
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,420
in the past.

323
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,820
He already passed away.

324
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,020
I have some questions for you.

325
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,090
Your father passed away?

326
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,300
He had a heart attack

327
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,900
after he was imprisoned.

328
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,610
He passed away in prison.

329
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,180
So, you're the only person

330
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,900
who knows the truth behind this.

331
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,850
Can you please tell me the truth?

332
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,090
I told you before.

333
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,610
No matter if you guys believe it or not,

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,540
the court's verdict is the truth.

335
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,090
My father passed away in prison.

336
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,330
I didn't even get to see him before he passed away.

337
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,090
I didn't even have the chance

338
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,580
to ask him questions.

339
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,580
I only got to know that my ex-husband

340
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,660
might be related to this incident.

341
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,820
Can you please tell me the truth

342
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,660
and quell the doubts in my heart?

343

00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,780
you sent to me.

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,870
Alright.

580
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,380
See you.

581
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,630
(I've known Mi Lu since young.)

582
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,110
Her house was right next to mine.

583
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,110
Zhou Yuan was the son
of Mi Lu's mother's good friend.

584
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,380
Something terrible happened to his family.

585
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,300
If so,

586
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,260
what's the relationship
between them and my father?

587
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,230
Mi Lu has no idea

588
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,110
about my dealings with Zhou Yuan.

589
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,990
Back then,

590
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,590
my company was incurring losses after losses.

591
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,300
Zhou Yuan gave me a sum

592
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,420
so that I could seek treatment abroad.

593
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,140
I agreed

594
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,830
to do him a favor.

595
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,710
After signing the contract
with Xingchen Financial,

596
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,220
I proceeded with Zhou Yuan's plan

597
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,670
and sued Xingchen Financial immediately.

598
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,460
(Dad,)

599
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,220
(what do you think I should do?)

600
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,980
(If only)

601
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,780
(I didn't date and marry Zhou Yuan back then.)

602
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,910
(Then, I wouldn't be manipulated by him.)

603
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,500
(And all of this wouldn't have happened.)

604
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,870
(You wouldn't be involved then.)

605
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,500
Sir?

606
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,020
Today's your father's birthday.

607
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm here to visit my old friend.

608
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,870
Wang Kai told me everything

609
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,300
before I left the ward.

610
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,590
I can no longer pretend

611
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,780
that I'm still in the dark.

612
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,300
Do you plan to confront Zhou Yuan?

613
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,940
I want to ask him

614
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,350
why he chose me as his target.

615
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,020
Did he use up all his tricks and destroy my family

616
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,670
just to get to where he is today?

617
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,460
What can you do about it
even if you know the truth?

618
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,670
A hypocrite can find thousands of excuses

619
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,870
for his lies.

620
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,500
Also, what do you wish

621
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,590
to hear from him?

622
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,870
You're right.

623
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,980
Mr. Lin,

624
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,830
what do you think I should do next?

625
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,220
Take a look at this.

626
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,430
These were your father's shares

627
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,870
when we first established

628
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,630
Zhuoyue together.

629
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,870
He left all of them to you.

630
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,980
[Equity Succession Agreement, Inheritor: An Yu]
This agreement

631
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,870
was kept

632
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,390
inside the bank all along.

633
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,300
It was designed to be effective after 20 years.

634
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,870
20 years had just passed.

635
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,350
The number of shares

636
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,390
your father owned

637
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,070
amounted to around one-third of the total shares.

638
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,780
Although there had been

639
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,260
many new investors in the past few years,

640
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,940
the shares were diluted.

641
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,910
Even so,

642
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,630
you still own around 10% of the total shares.

643
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,110
This is the contact number of our lawyer.

644
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,390
You can ask her about the details.

645
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,150
Why didn't my father mention this to me before?

646
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,980
Zhuoyue was a tiny enterprise back then.

647
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,830
These shares were worthless.

648
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,350
And your father

649
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,190
passed away suddenly.

650
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Maybe he didn't manage to tell you about it.

651
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,540
However, they don't matter anymore.

652
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,020
Now, you're a shareholder of Zhuoyue.

653
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,460
These are the bargaining chips

654

that you can use to defeat Zhou Yuan.

655
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,700
I don't really get it.

656

I have a plan

657
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,350
to take back what you and your father had lost

658
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,300
from Zhou Yuan's hands.

659
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,350
However, I need your help.

660
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,190
What kind of plan?

661
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,640
Zhou Yuan has visited you
often lately, am I right?

662
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,670
And he said he was doing it
for your child's sake.

663
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,500
He's very ambitious.

664
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,910
His next goal is

665
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,430
to swallow the entire Zhuoyue.

666
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,020
To him,

667
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,980
he'll have a much bigger chance of winning

668
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,830
if he obtains your shares.

669
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,590
That's why he'll surely come to you

670
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,390
and tell you about his idea.

671
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,670
What you need to do now is

672
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,590
to stall him

673
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,910
and pretend that you'll sell your shares to him.

674
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,460
Don't give yourself away.

675
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,670
Just leave the rest to me.

676
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,020
We can definitely avenge your father
