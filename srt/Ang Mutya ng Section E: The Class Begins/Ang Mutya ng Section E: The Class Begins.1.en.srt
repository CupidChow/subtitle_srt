1
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,183
It's a story of a girl
who was transferred to a

2
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,312
class of 16 delinquent students.

3
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,897
Her only goal was to graduate.

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,568
But because of the boys' mischievous ways

5
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,944
and revenge plot against her,

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,866
things got complicated.

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,493
She is also the link to

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,247
some of her family's secrets.

9
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,793
What if there's only one girl in a class?

10
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,004
That's where the idea came from.

11
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,422
No one was reading it back then.

12
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,591
So it became my freedom wall.

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,052
Whatever comes to my mind, I put it there.

14
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,554
Because I thought no one's gonna read it.

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,475
After a few months, I got two reads.

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,687
Then the only comment
was a random unserious one.

17
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,940
So I really thought, no one's reading it.

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,736
After almost a year, it started
gaining hundreds of reads.

19
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:58,158
Then readers would 'heart' the chapter.
Until now they still do.

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,410
That's when I started noticing
the growing number of reads.

21
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,748
I never imagined it to
have that many reads.

22
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,839
So, when Viva offered me to direct
the adaptation of The Rain in España,

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,885
I was really pressured and
at the same time challenged.

24
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,469
It was my first project with Viva.

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,891
Growing up being a fan of
Philippine cinema, I look up to Viva.

26
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:29,857
Viva is definitely in my bucket list of
production companies I want to work with.

27
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:34,945
That's how I remember it.
But at the same time excited.

28
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,614
Because I knew it's a very popular novel.

29
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,411
I know I was blessed to be
offered to direct that series.

30
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:46,707
I knew that was the first
series adaptation of Viva One.

31
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,002
It's as if we're launching
the streaming platform itself.

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,463
And so after The Rain in
España, I was really so proud

33
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,800
because I just jumpstarted it.

34
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,937
And now I'm so happy
that it really took off. Now

35
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,638
there are different
directors for the other books.

36
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,600
Different styles, different flavors.

37
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:20,908
And now I was offered another chance
to jumpstart another Wattpad Universe,

38
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,492
which is "Ang Mutya ng Section E."

39
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,786
So, I'm truly grateful.

40
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,580
But the pressure is never gone.

41
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,125
There's always a challenge
because this is a new cast.

42
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,669
This is a different story.
Far from the first one.

43
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,889
So when I was already
on board to direct "Ang

44
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,132
Mutya ng Section E",
of course the next step

45
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,596
was to find the right cast for the series.

46
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,558
When Viva told me that they were thinking
of Andres Muhlach for the lead role

47
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,062
but I have to pitch to him,
at first I was really nervous.

48
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:58,063
So I focused. I studied Andres.
What kind of roles fit him.

49
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,866
And then I realized that
he fits the Keifer role to a T.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,159
The character of
Keifer is larger than life.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,582
And it's only someone like Andres
who is really fit for the role.

52
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Action.

53
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,162
Firstly, when the
director pitched it, I was

54
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,301
excited. Because of
course he's Director Ted.

55
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,388
Great director, and I've heard many
great things about him as well.

56
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,306
So I was very interested at the start.

57
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:31,270
And when I learned about the story,
I started looking into the synopsis.

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,938
And then I eventually got the book.

59
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,066
I got super interested
with the whole storyline.

60
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,862
And with the characters as well.
Like Keifer, Yuri, Jay-jay.

61
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,699
What I like about Andres
is that he really listens.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,950
He listened to the story.

63
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,410
He listened to the character.

64
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:52,208
And I can see that he loves
the story and the Keifer character.

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:02,092
So I'm portraying Mark Keifer Watson.
He's from Section E.

66
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:06,096
He's the class president
and king troublemaker.

67
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:13,479
I think Keifer is very stern,
grumpy, likes to fight a lot.

68
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,858
And a serious guy all in all.

69
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,735
Hi, my name is Ashtine Olviga.

70
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,405
My height is 5'2 and my weight is 44

71
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,867
but I want it to be 40
to have an allowance.

72
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,536
Director: What do you
think is your greatest talent?

73
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,873
My greatest talent?

74
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,708
I can't really say...

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,939
I learned singing and dancing here in Viva.

76
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,010
But I've always liked acting ever since.

77
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,302
Director: Which genre?

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,597
More of drama.

79
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,892
Director: You said here that
you have a jolly personality.

80
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,310
Who told you these?

81
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,771
My high school friends.

82
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,441
And whenever I meet new friends,

83
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,152
that's when I get comfortable.

84
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:07,116
Director: We are going to ask you to
read two characters: Jay-jay and Freya.

85
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,243
But we'll do that later

86
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,953
because we will look for your partner.

87
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,789
Okay.

88
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,586
So, just relax for now.
Review Jay-jay and Freya.

89
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,174
And then from there, we'll
see who you'll throw lines with.

90
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:24,884
Okay.

91
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,843
Director: Thank you, Ashtine.

92
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,844
Thank you.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,192
Among all the auditionees,
I knew Ashtine fits Jay-jay the most.

94
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,195
What I like about her is
that she's a very simple girl.

95
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,573
She comes from the province.
And her beauty shines through her

96
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,951
personality, which is very Jay-jay.

97
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,664
And I know she's a fighter.
She doesn't back down.

98
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,791
That was the vibe I got from her audition.

99
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,670
Plus the fact that she did
really during the script reading.

100
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,757
So when I learned that I got
the role of Jay-jay, I couldn't believe it.

101
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,302
I was like, I refuse to believe
it until the taping starts.

102
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:16,184
I couldn't fully enjoy it because
I, myself, didn't expect it.

103
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,687
At the same time, I feel so blessed because

104
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,900
I was given the opportunity
to showcase my talent.

105
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,320
Five, four, three, two... talents walk!

106
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,613
Action!

107
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,123
So the character I'm playing is Jay-jay.
The muse of section E.

108
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,875
Among all the past female
students in Section E,

109
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,876
she's the only one that
they failed to drive away.

110
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,296
Because Jay-jay is a fighter.

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,216
She stands up for what
she believes is right.

112
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:54,265
If we're gonna dig deeper into
her character, she wants to belong.

113
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,646
She wants a family and friends
who will accept her for who she is.

114
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:12,491
With Rabin, when I saw him, of course his
advantage is Yuri's physical characteristics.

115
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,995
Yuri being a half-Japanese limits
the auditionees for that role.

116
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:21,208
But Rabin's swag and charm is just there.

117
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:26,004
There are some actors
who have that X-factor.

118
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,924
That's what I felt about
Rabin when he auditioned.

119
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,550
He has it.

120
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,970
Director: In terms of
talent, can you dance?

121
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,972
I can dance.

122
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,806
Director: You can or you're good at it?

123
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,807
I just can.

124
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,324
Director: Okay, you actually can.

125
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,954
Until now I still couldn't believe
that I got the character of Yuri.

126
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,207
And I just dyed my hair three days ago.

127
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,753
I told myself before that
I will never dye my hair.

128
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,799
But the red hairsprays weren't enough.

129
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,967
So, they had to really dye my hair.

130
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,760
It was painful.

131
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,597
I almost begged the hair colorist
to stop but we had to finish it.

132
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,158
But it actually turned out really good.

133
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,769
I started eating well.
I went to the gym every day.

134
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,938
I started sleeping early.
I stopped going out.

135
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,441
I changed my life for this role.

136
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,071
I wanted to give them
the Yuri they imagined.

137
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,085
Yuri is both a good boy and a bad boy.

138
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,087
He is a good fighter.

139
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,216
A true friend.
He looks after his classmates.

140
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,010
He's secretive.

141
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,638
And he'll do everything
just to have Jay-jay.

142
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,600
Hey! Come back here!

143
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,228
No!
You should be punished!

144
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,229
You messed with the queen bee.

145
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
She should be punished, not us!

146
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,821
What I like about the supporting cast, they
are smart actors, they are intelligent.

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,491
What I like about them is, basically
before they got their respective roles,

148
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,534
they've been around for quite some time.

149
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,661
They worked hard for this.

150
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,914
They know that this could
be the role of a lifetime.

151
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,251
This could be the role that
will level up their careers.

152
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,965
So, I'm grateful for the
cast that we came up with.

153
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:37,510
Hi, I am Andre Yllana and I'll be playing
the role of Michael Aries Fernandez.

154
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,388
I'm from Section A, not E.

155
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,645
I am the class president of Section A.
He's a leader, very responsible.

156
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,146
He is very disciplined.

157
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:54,319
Hi, my name is Heart Ryan. I play the
character of Ella Dianne Hyun from Section A.

158
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,905
She is charming, charismatic.

159
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
She can get what she wants
and she knows what she wants.

160
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,705
And she can be fierce when she needs to.

161
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,416
Also has loyalty to her friends.

162
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,836
And she might be having trouble with love

163
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,384
and maybe what she
really wants in her life.

164
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:23,224
So, I play the role of Freya Hidalgo.
In this series she is the queen bee.

165
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:31,766
She is the meanest and
has a god complex of sorts.

166
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:37,404
Because if she doesn't have the
person wrapped around her finger,

167
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,698
she needs to have control over them.

168
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,120
In short, she's the Regina George of HVIS.

169
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm gonna be playing the role of
Ci-N Peralta. He's in Section E.

170
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,041
He's the youngest there.

171
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,168
The naughtiest, it's a given.

172
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,254
At times he can be annoying.

173
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,715
And he likes to gossip.

174
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,468
I like to gossip too, so we're the same.

175
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,887
I'm playing the character
of David Braselton.

176
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,889
Former president of Section E.

177
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,892
The most responsible in the class.

178
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,270
More matured.

179
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,441
More on the quiet side.
He likes to sleep a lot.

180
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:19,363
He is also a good fighter
but he prefers peace talks.

181
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,285
Hi, I'm Ethan David and I'm gonna be playing
Calix Rivera in Ang Mutya ng Section E.

182
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,495
He's a good friend. A reliable friend.

183
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,041
But most notably, he's a retired playboy.

184
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,380
Hi, I am Keagan De Jesus and
I'm playing Superman "Eman" Andrada.

185
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,923
Known as chef of Section E.

186
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,678
And he is also a class
officer and a peacemaker.

187
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,474
Hi, this is Kurt Delos Reyes
playing John Felix Collins.

188
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:53,897
He is a varsity player. He's got a strong
personality and he likes to goof around.

189
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,107
He teases a lot but
sometimes he can be a butthurt.

190
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,109
Hi, I'm playing Denzel Castillo here.

191
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,656
I'm a jerk here.

192
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:10,122
I have a secret girlfriend but I
can't fight for her because I am poor.

193
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,458
I can't provide for her.

194
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm playing Kit Harington here.

195
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,465
Kit Harington likes to fight.

196
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:25,345
But he can easily make friends.

197
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,390
I play Eren De Luna.
I'm in Section E.

198
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,603
I'm a lover boy.
I have my way with words,

199
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,648
and with the girls and whatnot.

200
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,609
I love messing around and having fun.

201
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,654
I love hanging out with
Ci-N, who is such a cool kid.

202
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,865
Super fun to hang out with and play with.

203
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,203
Edrix is the nerd of the group.

204
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,499
He is very curious, tech-savvy.

205
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,380
The character I'm portraying
is Rory Abejar from Section E.

206
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:08,005
He is Keifer's private investigator, his
close friend and one of his assistants.

207
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:18,891
He's nerdy but he can fight.
He's hiding his nerdiness a bit.

208
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,865
So, I'm playing Drew.
Drew is so problematic.

209
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,326
He is so stubborn.
He likes to borrow money and gamble.

210
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:38,327
I would say he is a great fighter.
He likes to start fights.

211
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,504
Mayo Jeson Ramos is a closeted bisexual.

212
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,968
He's in a relationship with Kit Harington.

213
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:54,260
And based on what I read about Mayo,
he gets jealous when it comes to Kit.

214
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:02,233
He gets easily offended,
especially if its Jay-jay.

215
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,529
I'm portraying the
character of Joshua Venites.

216
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,116
He's from Section E.

217
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,203
He is always sleeping in class.

218
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,791
But you can rely on him during fights.

219
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,919
People think that he has a sixth sense.

220
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,174
I'm playing Blaster Madrigal.

221
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,636
He is the musician in Section E.

222
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:36,644
He is also playful. Of course
he's in Section E so he can fight.

223
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,397
He has a great sense of fashion.

224
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:46,402
Hello, everyone. I'm Angela Muji
and I'm playing Rakki San Diego.

225
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:51,115
I'm the president of Section C.

226
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:58,831
So Rakki is very chill but she is so
friendly. She will get close to Jay-jay.

227
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:06,798
She is very sporty and athletic.
She will be Section E's loyal ally.

228
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,345
My character here is
Micaela Yumol from Section A.

229
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:19,937
Mica is very kind, very demure, and
is a reliable friend especially to Jay-jay.

230
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:27,528
Improve your Tagalog if you
want a role in this series, all right?

231
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,908
HVIS students, this girl
disrespected us in the restroom.

232
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,789
Me? Me? Freya Hidalgo!
Disrespected by this girl!

233
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,000
When are you leaving our section? How
about you, when are you leaving the planet?

234
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,336
We auditioned a lot of
Viva artists, Viva talents.

235
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,840
There's a lot of them.

236
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:56,340
My audition process is, I know Viva invested
on workshops to develop their talents.

237
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,897
So, I look at the personalities
similar to them in real life.

238
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,316
The audition process
was more of a Q&A round.

239
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:12,238
I asked them about their
personalities, interests, hobbies.

240
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,951
And that's where I based who fits a role
before we did the script reading.

241
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,105
So, what is the genre
of this show? So that

242
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:21,914
it's clear to us what
the tone of the show is.

243
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,333
Because maybe you
were thinking this is drama.

244
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,046
The genre is obviously young adult romance.

245
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,425
Because at the center of it
is a love square, love triangle.

246
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,762
Like what I said earlier.
But it's also a comedy.

247
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,014
Because our boys are mischievous.

248
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:43,102
There's the story conference, wherein we
really explained to them their characters.

249
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,937
Of course this is not
just about popularity,

250
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,689
we also have to produce a well-made

251
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,775
and iconic youth oriented
series for generations.

252
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,736
Well-made because every one performed well.

253
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,447
Well-made because you made people

254
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,740
believe that these
things happen in real life.

255
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,284
Leave the technicalities
to the production team.

256
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,703
As for you, if you perform well,

257
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,122
they see you as the
character you are portraying,

258
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,834
then I can say that we successfully

259
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,714
made an iconic youth-oriented series.

260
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,673
Our vision is, hopefully
twenty years from now,

261
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,801
Gen Z's who will watch this today

262
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:19,556
will remember Ang Mutya ng
Section E is a reminder of their youth.

263
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,724
We asked them to read the book.

264
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,728
We held acting workshops
to build their relationships,

265
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:30,650
which is very important because for me, Ang
Mutya ng Section E is an ensemble piece.

266
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:36,115
Five, four, three, two, one!

267
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,407
Do you like getting involved?

268
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,034
Yes.

269
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,201
Yes.

270
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:40,869
Yes.

271
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,621
Today is our first workshop.
For Section E.

272
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,542
It was really fun.
I learned a lot from coach.

273
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,421
It's nerve-racking. But I'm very
happy to be working with everyone.

274
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:58,636
It was so much fun. It's our first time
together in this kind of learning experience.

275
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:03,683
It was also a good opportunity
to bond with everyone.

276
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,354
At first, we were a bit
shy towards each other.

277
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:13,485
But after six hours or more, we got
more comfortable around each other.

278
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,198
Workshop with Miss Anna is a great
learning experience. I learned a lot.

279
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:24,370
My takeaway probably is doing
too much is really too much.

280
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,916
Miss Anna said it's better if it's natural.

281
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,755
And just connect with the person you're
in front of. Always make eye contact.

282
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,800
So, it's like a bonding experience
for all of us. We all became very close.

283
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:42,096
We became friends. Even to
the point of having dinner together.

284
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,975
We were able to bond and become closer.

285
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,124
But really the workshops
all helped us get more

286
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,521
comfortable with our
roles, our characters.

287
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,275
And more comfortable with
each other most importantly.

288
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:58,572
Even in fight rehearsals it was so fun
because it's just like a workout for us.

289
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,825
And we're all guys so
we're just like trying to fight.

290
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,825
After our first workshop,
I told him I was having

291
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,623
a hard time approaching
him because I was shy.

292
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,459
He told me not to.

293
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,503
I approached him and
he was easy to talk to.

294
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:20,010
And we message each other. I think because
of that, we became more comfortable.

295
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,559
It was my first time
doing workshops at night.

296
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,393
And I enjoyed a lot because
there's so many of us.

297
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:36,777
But I learned a lot of new things. Nobody
taught us like how Miss Anna Feleo did.

298
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,737
She is so good.

299
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,907
We have zoom meetings.

300
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,869
We throw lines during script reading.

301
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,709
We discuss the story,
how the characters met.

302
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,712
What do you want from me? I'm going home.

303
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,839
Sit down.

304
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,007
What is it?

305
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,645
Damn it! What's so hard about sitting down?

306
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,137
Jay-jay surrenders, eventually sits down

307
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,218
because other customers
are already looking at them.

308
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,270
Kit, order for me. Your specialty.

309
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:16,232
We had script readings. We were able to have
time to bond with the crew and the cast.

310
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,777
And it was really fun because
we were able to get to know one other.

311
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,904
On like a really more personal basis.

312
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:28,245
We were able to have so many ice breakers. And I
feel like we built more chemistry because of that.

313
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,247
Water makes me think of love.

314
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,457
Love makes me think of you.

315
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,173
You makes me think of alcohol.

316
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,301
Alcohol makes me think of pain.

317
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,303
Pain makes me think of-

318
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,722
Pain makes me think of money.

319
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,349
Money makes me think of banks.

320
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:58,100
What you're gonna witness as we do the show
is all genuine bond and friendship.

321
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:04,948
The bickering, but in a friendly way.

322
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,704
One!

323
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,206
Gather!

324
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,585
Ready to kick!

325
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,673
Strike.

326
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,598
Fight rehearsals are fun
because it's my first time.

327
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:34,852
Besides acting, I also worked on
my trust with my co-actors.

328
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:40,692
Our bond will reflect on
the screen. Our chemistry.

329
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,989
And I feel like all the workshops
brought us closer together.

330
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
Oh no!

331
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,206
There's so much chaos.
Actually there's accidents sometimes.

332
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,418
It happens because we
don't know. It's our first time.

333
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,880
I remember, I was paired up with Martin.

334
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,633
I accidentally punched him.

335
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,929
But it's just cool to see that we're just
getting to do cool stuff together.

336
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,389
And things happen when you keep going.

337
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,811
And I think it's really cool that
we just adapt and do our best.

338
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,855
That was funny because
some of you here witnessed it.

339
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,275
That's a memorable experience.

340
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:28,322
I had a hard time during the fight
rehearsals because I was too stiff.

341
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:35,831
I couldn't follow the steps, couldn't
dodge. I almost hit my partner Yanyan.

342
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:43,003
It is really difficult to handle
16 boys at the same time.

343
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:48,175
But the good thing about them is,
Section E is a rowdy bunch, right?

344
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,313
So, we need a perfect
balance. It's just okay

345
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:54,473
to be rowdy because
that's how Section E is.

346
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:59,854
I don't need you to behave, to be prim and
proper, demure, cutesy, that's a big no.

347
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:04,233
I want to see your swag, the
bad boy vibes, the naughtiness.

348
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,386
So, it's really hard but
I always remind them

349
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,490
that this could be
the role of a lifetime.

350
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,249
Come on, fight me.

351
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,917
I'll slap the hell out of you.

352
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,460
Around three exchanges.

353
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,378
Just banter.

354
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,547
I'm just asking you
if you're still a virgin?

355
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,549
The nerve.

356
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,908
What if I ask you the same question?

357
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,969
Sure.

358
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,263
Are you still a virgin?

359
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,726
Obviously I'm not a fucking virgin
so I'm asking you.

360
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,018
Jerk!

361
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,937
Okay, ready.

362
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,981
ID, roll!

363
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:51,906
Director Ted told me not to be too nice

364
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,868
because my character
doesn't really smile as much.

365
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:00,749
Overall, the director has told me a lot
and made me feel very comfortable as well.

366
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,877
Working with everyone in the cast and
just getting to know everyone as well.

367
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,299
When he says go out, confront him
and ask why he's shouting at you.

368
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,134
Whenever the director
talks to me, I get nervous.

369
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,387
He always tells me to do good.

370
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,390
I get more nervous when he talks to me.

371
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:23,230
My learnings from the
director is to analyze the script.

372
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:29,944
Know your craft.
Be serious because this is a huge project.

373
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,239
There's no big or small role.
Everyone has a role to play.

374
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,077
And it's a big thing in a series or movie.

375
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,705
One advice that the director
told me was to correct my posture.

376
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,752
So he always reminds me
to straighten my posture.

377
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,382
During our first meeting, he asked me
to practice throwing jokes.

378
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:57,097
So that's what I remember, I
need to learn how to throw jokes.

379
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,559
I felt that we're all a collective.
We're all trying to make this work.

380
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:06,355
And we just want to give our best to the
characters that we're portraying.

381
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,607
We wanna depict them
properly and faithfully.

382
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,821
I really felt that motivation from
everyone. So it's really inspiring.

383
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,514
Actually I admire the writers because

384
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:47,438
they were able to make the story flow
while giving justice to the story.

385
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:54,529
Yes there are some changes
but those are acceptable changes

386
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,076
Basically we followed the
formula of the University series,

387
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:05,289
which is, we cannot change
the flow of the story on the book.

388
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,084
That's what we did with the
script development of this series.

389
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:14,424
Because we know that there's a reason why
it has more than 330 million reads.

390
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,507
Quiet please!

391
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,634
And!

392
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,344
Action!

393
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,096
Whoops!

394
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,473
Come in.

395
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,474
Let’s go, girls!

396
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,895
Are you deaf?

397
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,692
Why would I clean that?
That's your trash!

398
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,488
Actually, I'm not really
familiar with the book

399
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,157
because I don't really
read Wattpad stories.

400
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,619
But after the audition, I
started reading the book.

401
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,541
Because during the audition,
they just gave me a random part to read.

402
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,088
Good thing I read the book.
Now I know Jay-jay better.

403
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,839
I was aware of the book before,

404
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,718
Ang Mutya ng Section
E, especially on Wattpad.

405
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,261
I would hear about it.

406
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:07,352
But then I didn't know about the crazy
fanbase and readers that the story has.

407
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,773
Which excited me all the more to
portray this character just for the people.

408
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,400
Yes, I was actually
aware of its popularity.

409
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,071
On TikTok, it appears on my feed.

410
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,491
Since the pandemic, I've
been seeing so many edits.

411
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,326
Recreation scenes.

412
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,298
Of course as a reader, you
can only imagine. And as

413
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:32,292
a content creator, you
bring these things to life.

414
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,544
The story itself.

415
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,255
So some people do POV edits of it.

416
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,827
And now I am really happy
because I didn't expect to

417
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,839
be part of a project that
I just used to see online.

418
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:52,813
When I learned about the auditions,
I asked my friends and they know the story.

419
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,234
So I had an idea that
this is a really popular title.

420
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,157
This is like their bible.

421
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:07,620
So of course they have
expectations for the cast.

422
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:13,500
As for me, of course I respect them.

423
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:21,300
Just like TRIE, the cast gained mixed
reactions but eventually the fans loved them.

424
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,013
Hopefully, they'll love our cast as well.

425
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,473
Of course there's pressure.

426
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:34,939
First of all, I have to live up to the
standards of the fans and the director as well.

427
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:43,071
I don't want to fall short of that goal.
I hope I reach that goal.

428
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,115
I know it's gonna be a good project because

429
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:52,749
when I read the book and the whole script,
it was very beautifully written.

430
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:02,007
Keifer and Jay-jay's love story
starts with a cat and dog fight.

431
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,053
Meaning they're a total
opposite of each other.

432
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,181
That's what I like about
Ashtine and Andres' chemistry.

433
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,474
You know that they
come from different worlds.

434
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,561
There's this simple province
girl and dreamer from Quezon,

435
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,687
who just wants to make it big in showbiz.

436
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,398
And there's Andres, who
belongs to the showbiz royalty,

437
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,821
which is like the upper
echelon of the showbiz hierarchy.

438
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:28,617
So, the trope that opposites
attract works for them

439
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:34,249
because you have to find their common
denominator, how they would connect.

440
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,584
When I learned that it's Andres,

441
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,839
it's another surreal moment for me
because of course I know him.

442
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,508
I see him in social media.

443
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,553
When I first met him, I was so thankful

444
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,182
because he was so nice
and easy to get along with.

445
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:58,731
Pressure? Of course there's
pressure because it's my first series.

446
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,278
When I saw the fanbase,
the reactions, and I saw

447
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,699
how much people really
cared and loved this book,

448
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,412
I felt like I really wanna
do a good job here.

449
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,915
I want to show the people
and the fans especially.

450
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,416
Here's your order.

451
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,877
Yogorino's popular...

452
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,630
What if I break character?

453
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:37,436
What I can promise is, first, Jay-jay's

454
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,771
character will be maintained.

455
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,774
That's a promise because I saw
how she acted out the scenes.

456
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,111
And I know that she will nail it.

457
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:52,492
And as for the story, the
idea of friendship, adventure,

458
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,913
and forgiveness is
still there. Always there.

459
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,334
What I can promise is I will do everything

460
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,172
to keep the soul or the spirit
of the book in the adaptation.

461
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,424
It may not be a total copycat of the book,

462
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,261
because it's impossible
given the different medium,

463
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:18,428
but at least the soul and tone of the story
is still in our adaptation.

464
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,315
And I'd like to believe that I was able to

465
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,567
prove that in The Rain in España.

466
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,863
So hopefully, the same goes
for Ang Mutya ng Section E.

467
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:37,238
So, please give us a chance and support
Ang Mutya ng Section E.

468
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:44,711
What I can promise is
that I will do my best here.

469
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,712
That's a promise.

470
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,218
I think I can promise that they will get
the Jay-jay that they want.

471
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,929
Wow?

472
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:59,143
The fans will not be disappointed because
I feel like the cast that was chosen,

473
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,356
the people and the cast,
we're all a perfect match.

474
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,651
And per character, they all
have a subplot and everything.

475
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,781
And I feel like this show will really follow
that. And we'll get to show the different

476
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,118
characteristics of the other
characters in this show.

477
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,454

I'm Freya Hidalgo.

495

As if you didn't already know me.

496
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,092
And I'm from Section A.

497
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,138
Hello! I'm Ci-N Peralta. I'm 14 years old
and I'm from Section E.

498
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,267
Hi, I'm Michael Aries Fernandez
and I'm the president of Section A.

499
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,437
Hi, I'm Ella Dianne Hyun from Section A.

500
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,732
Hi, I'm Yuri Hanamitchi.

501
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,485
From Section E.

502
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:33,779
Hi, I'm Jasper Jean Mariano
and I'm from Section E.

503
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,698
Hello, I'm Mark Keifer Watson.

504
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,741
I'm from Section E.

505
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,536
Ang Mutya ng Section E!

506
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,579
Ang Mutya ng Section E!

507
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,414
Ang Mutya ng Section E!

508
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,792
Ang Mutya ng Section E!

509
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,587
Ang Mutya ng Section E!

510
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,717
Excuse me.

511
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,262
Excuse me?!

512
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,109
Is this the room of Section E?

513
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,069
Not here. Go back to the Main Building.

514
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,112
But the guy told me...

515
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,112
Are you deaf?

516
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,196
Leave!

517
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,617
Higher Value International School.

518
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,954
From now on, I will be studying here.

519
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,872
You can do this, Jay-jay.

520
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,210
Wow, looks like everyone here is rich.

521
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,256
Excuse me. Where can I find this?

522
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,548
Section E?

523
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,674
Mm-hmm.

524
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,967
Ew!

525
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,761
So what if I'm in Section E?

526
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,170
I'm sure there's nothing
wrong with being in Section E.

527
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,102
She's your new classmate.
Let's welcome her.

528
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,979
Have a seat. Welcome to Section E.

529
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,941
Mr. President, don't you have anything
to ask about our transferee?

530
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,819
Are you still a virgin?

531
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,528
[students laughing]

532
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,339
When are you going to
disappear from this world?

533
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,423
Why don't you disappear first?

534
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,047
'Cause I'm the one who's gonna
make you disappear from this world.

535
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,911
Do you know anything about Section E?

536
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,692
There wasn't a Section E before.

537
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,542
Until they had nowhere to dump
students with grave offenses.

538
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,751
Troublemakers.

539
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,753
Three, two, one!

540
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,547
[students shouting]

541
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,842
Why are there no girls in Section E?

542
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,736
The girls manage to get transferred
back to normal sections.

543
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,679
Because girls aren't as unruly as the boys.

544
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,355
Jay-jay, huh?

545
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,025
She's getting on my nerves.

546
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,735
She needs to drop out or transfer.

547
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,528
I don't care. I want her out.

548
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,364
Let's see if you can catch this!

549
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,830
This is off-limits.

550
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,789
What's in there?

551
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,225
You're hiding something, aren't you?

552
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,420
Either you shut up, or
I'll make you shut up.

553
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,758
[students teasing]

554
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,470
You look like husband and wife!

555
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,560
I'll make her fall for me,
and then I'll break her heart.

556
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,648
With girls, the cheesier, the better.

557
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,274
They get butterflies.

558
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,484
Ouch!

559
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,253
What if I end up looking like Voldemort?!

560
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,277
Don't move.

561
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,324
Hold still.

562
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,293
Become a knight in shining armor.

563
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,963
Or use the push-and-pull trick.

564
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,631
Be sweet...

565
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,050
then pull back from time to time.

566
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,304
I swear, she won't be
able to get enough of you!

567
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,475
Jay-jay's here! Time to eat!

568
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,186
- Jay-jay!
- Run, quick!

569
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,860
Once a Section E, always a Section E.

570
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,403
She's a slut.

571
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,725
Why are you all changing here?!

572
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,435
My God, you're all so nasty!

573
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,985
You look like you're enjoying yourself.

574
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,986
Nice view?

575
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,071
God, no! What do you think I am, thirsty?

576
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,072
You're all so skinny!
