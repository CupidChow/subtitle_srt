A solution to save DADO Resort.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,290
Ms. Song.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,730
Selling DADO Resort is one of the options we're considering.

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,130
And?

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,830
I was wondering if you were aware.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,030
Yes.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,970
But that doesn't matter...

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,310
because...

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,880
I won't...

19
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,880
sell it.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I see.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,090
Everyone,

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,930
good night.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,850
What was that tension?

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,620

(Episode 8: Opportunity Cost)

26
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,839
That'll be 360 dollars.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,870
Sure.

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,850
- Thank you. - The pleasure was mine.

29
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,490
Goodness.

30
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,099
I hope the food is to your liking.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,370
It is.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,830
And you, Director?

33
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,400
Anyway, Director Ha,

34
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,440
I heard you had something to say.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,550
As if Sanin would have any other requests for Samoel Fund.

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,720
I was just wondering about an additional loan.

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,290
I see.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,950
And here I thought...

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,930
you were going to apologize for botching our last deal.

40
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,330
Oh, that!

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,660
Didn't I already apologize regarding that?

42
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,070
- I'm so sorry. Goodness. - Gosh.

43
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,970
That's just business. It's not like we suffered a loss.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,410
I'm grateful you see it that way.

45
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,610
That's the thing with strategic moves.

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,540
A 1 out of 3 success rate would be considered a win.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,910
A hitter who bats 300 would be the team's star player.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,280
How much are you asking for?

49
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,220
Well, not much.

50
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,620
About 55 big ones.

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I see.

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,459
That's easily doable,

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,630
but on what terms?

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,900
The interest rate should at least be two digits.

55
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,170
Since I feel bad about how our last deal went down,

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,540
I'll suggest ten percent...

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,539
with Sanin's stocks as collateral.

58
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,570
What do you say?

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,780
- But, Director Ha, - Yes?

60
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,380
Are you aware that Sanin has already borrowed...

61
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,450
three billion dollars from us?

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,020
Of course.

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,889
However, an additional 55 million...

64
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,989
won't make much of a difference.

65
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,020
It does.

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,260
Someone who borrowed three billion dollars from us...

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,130
is asking for an additional 55 million.

68
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,100
If this means Sanin doesn't even have 55 million,

69
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,840
could it pay back the three billion?

70
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,940
That's what I'm getting.

71
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,179
Come on.

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,140
What do you take Sanin for?

73
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,910
It feels shaky from where we stand, Director Ha.

74
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,420
All right, fine.

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,990
I guess I forgot to explain.

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,050
So here's what happened.

77
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,730
I don't know why chairmen...

78
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,030
all want to own a resort of their own.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,500
- A resort? - Yes.

80
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,570
Our chairman came across one he liked.

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,769
He must've wanted it badly...

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,640
because he took out a loan...

83
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,310
with his stocks as collateral to buy it before anyone else could.

84
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,910
- His Sanin stocks? - That's right.

85
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,310
My gosh.

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,449
The loan matures in less than a month,

87
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,450
but he only just told me.

88
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,890
Who handled the deal? Mr. Yoon?

89
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,160
As if Joo No is on that kind of level.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,090
He took it out through his secretaries.

91
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,730
But what would secretaries know?

92
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,499
They had the chairman sign a contract...

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,570
- that was designed for pushovers. - Oh, dear.

94
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,470
He should've come to you instead.

95
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,870
He was embarrassed, that's why.

96
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,709
There are talks about Sanin going under,

97
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,940
so how could he openly say he's buying a resort?

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,910
Which resort is it?

99
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm afraid I don't know its name.

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,089
Anyway, that's why he took out a loan.

101
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,790
It has nothing to do with the company.

102
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,190
Then,

103
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,890
we'll agree on 15 percent.

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,430
Fifteen?

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,670
I believe that to be reasonable,

106
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,670
but the chairman is one stubborn man.

107
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,910
I'll have to go back to the office and see where we stand.

108
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,080
Don't push it if it isn't manageable.

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,280
That's not what I'm saying.

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,749
You know how much I like Samoel Fund.

111
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Goodness.

112
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,690
We value Sanin too.

113
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,890
Pay for dinner with this.

114
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,890
It shouldn't be the other way around.

115
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,460
Come on.

116
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I already paid for the meal.

117
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,870
Okay, fine.

118
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,370
I'll head back to the office and get that number confirmed.

119
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,870
You know I'm not in a position...

120
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,310
to control Sanin how I like it just yet.

121
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,339
Please be understanding of that.

122
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,380
Would it benefit us if you become CEO?

123
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,820
Of course.

124
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,050
I give you my word right here, right now.

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,130
The chairman is in his final years now.

126
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
His judgment isn't what it once was.

127
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,129
Is that so?

128
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,170
That's right.

129
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,440
Why else would he have bought a resort...

130
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,300
when the company is suffering?

131
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,850
Are we allowed to move forward without the chairman's approval?

132
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,650
Of course not.

133
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,219
Since we're here,

134
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,550
we should still inspect the facility.

135
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Right.

136
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,690
Ms. Song is just as curious.

137
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,790
What's your take on it?

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,829
There's a clear concept.

139
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,969
The interior design, amenities, and the view.

140
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,370
It checks all the boxes.

141
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,200
The issue is...

142
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,539
it hasn't been turning a profit...

143
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,210
since Ms. Song took over.

144
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,609
The main reason for that...

145
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,950
is that the resort was modified to fit her style and needs.

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,319
To be a profitable hotel,

147
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,649
it has to meet certain conditions,

148
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,320
but DADO failed to do so...

149
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,990
since it was modified to CEO Song's liking.

150
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,520
That's why it's now called a resort.

151
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,430
It's to fit the resort's therapeutic concept,

152
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,699
but not having any neighboring commercial businesses...

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,630
or source of entertainment is a downside.

154
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,639
I'll have to go over the contract to see...

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,670
if the commission needs adjusting.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,740
As for the interior design, the flooring is uneven rocks...

157
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,150
with wood being the main material.

158
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,150
They all require frequent maintenance.

159
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,320
Which will result in cost.

160
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,950
- Yes. - To be honest,

161
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,360
this place isn't run to make a profit.

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,660
It stands to entertain a chairman's daughter.

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
- Is that so? - Yes.

164
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,559
All conglomerate owners buy a resort...

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,970
as they would purchase a designer purse.

166
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,240
They modify it to their liking...

167
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,770
and chalk it up as something unique and grand.

168
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,610
So the issue lies with her ability to run it?

169
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Yes.

170
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,279
On top of that, Room 123 which is occupied by CEO Song...

171
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,150
has never been booked by others.

172
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,060
The resort itself is like a luxurious dollhouse of hers.

173
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,260
Would anyone be willing to buy this?

174
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,000
It has been on the radar of one particular place.

175
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,840
Which is?

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
DOLPHIN Hotel.

177
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,510
It's only five minutes away from here...

178
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,609
and is hoping to obtain DADO Resort...

179
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,480
so that they could run it as a premium hotel.

180
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,649
How much are they offering?

181
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,050
Director Kang handled the negotiations,

182
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,350
and the offer was 50 million dollars at the time.

183
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,259
Since you're negotiating,

184
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,860
you'd be able to at least get 55 million.

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,730
Do you think Mr. Yoon is some kind of con artist?

186
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,559
He should at least get 60 million.

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,600
However,

188
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,370
the deal was unilaterally broken by one party.

189
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,740
By whom?

190
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,910
CEO Song Ji O.

191
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,080
Then, it all boils down to whether or not we can...

192
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,910
persuade her.

193
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,390
Welcome.

194
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,330
- Director Ha. - Mr. Park.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,030
Have a seat.

196
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,470
What brought you to my neighborhood?

197
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,899
How else?

198
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
I was passing by when I thought of you.

199
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,770
- Aren't you pleased to see me? - Of course I am.

200
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,409
Goodness.

201
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,440
Thank you.

202
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,649
- Please enjoy. - Thanks.

203
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,680
Thank you.

204
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,149
Accept this from me first...

205
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,350
- but don't drink it. - Sure.

206
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,330
- We should at least say cheers. - Right.

207
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,930
There.

208
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,710
I have to say I'm a bit upset, Mr. Park.

209
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,470
Sorry? Then...

210
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,140
It's not because you're not drinking with me.

211
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,980
I'm not some old fogy.

212
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,910
I've always been a lightweight.

213
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,980
Come on. That's not what I meant.

214
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,120
Then why...

215
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,120
I mean,

216
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,960
if there was an issue with the chairman,

217
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,260
you should've come to me for advice.

218
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
After all, I'm Sanin's CFO.

219
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,270
The chairman said it was top secret.

220
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,700
Not anymore, it's not.

221
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,640
So tell me the details.

222
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,310
Sorry?

223
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,310
You probably know the chairman pit me against Yoon Joo No.

224
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
As if he's any match of mine.

225
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,780
Isn't Yoon Joo No lower in rank than you?

226
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,690
Right.

227
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,220
All that I can tell you is...

228
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,220
Sure. Do tell.

229
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,660
We're in urgent need of the 55 million dollars.

230
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,860
What about the resort? Won't he sell it?

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,570
That will never happen.

232
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,950
That 55 million dollars...

233
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,410
which is due within one month.

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,720
Taking out a loan of that size isn't easy.

235
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,449
Not many would agree to it...

236
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,860
even at a high interest rate.

237
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,890
That's what I've been told.

238
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,900
Does the chairman know how challenging this is?

239
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,430
He gave the secretaries...

240
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,430
an earful over this matter.

241
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,410
Then the chairman must be more accepting now.

242
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,669
If you solve this matter,

243
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,980
it will be of huge help to the chairman.

244
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Goodness.

245
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,789
- My car's over there. - I appreciate the meal.

246
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,889
As if you must thank me.

247
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,159
We'll have something better next time.

248
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,089
Sure. Should I call you a cab?

249
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,360
- Gosh, no. I called for a driver. - I see. Then...

250
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,930
- Sure. - Good night.

251
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,409
Yes, Director Ha.

252
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,940
Hello, there. Mr. David.

253
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,880
You know how you agreed...

254
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,350
to approve that loan of 55 million dollars.

255
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,390
At an interest rate of 15 percent.

256
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,260
Yes, 15 percent.

257
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,560
I'll agree to that term.

258
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,930
I see.

259
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,530
Did the chairman approve?

260
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,970
I'll have him approve of it.

261
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,170
But how about this?

262
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,279
Can you suggest it be 18 percent?

263
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,810
That'll make my job easier.

264
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,150
I see.

265
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,150
I understand what you mean and will do just that.

266
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,719
I'd love to give you a straight and direct answer,

267
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,520
but I don't have that power just yet.

268
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,630
Tell me about it. The sooner you're CEO, the better.

269
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,460
Goodness.

270
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Anyway, please write up a proposal like we just talked about.

271
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,470
- Sure. - Right. Thank you.

272
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,610
Mr. CEO, you called for a driver, right?

273
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,510
They call anyone a CEO these days.

274
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,180
Didn't you call?

275
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,290
May I...

276
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Go on.

277
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,109
Rather than calling us all the time,

278
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,450
wouldn't it be better to be admitted?

279
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,910
Tell me about it.

280
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,490
Allow me.

281
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,160
Thank you.

282
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,060
- Good morning, Ms. Kwak. - Right. Good morning.

283
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,460
- Here's your menu. - Right. Thank you.

284
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,630
You got up on time.

285
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,699
Attorney Oh woke me up insisting we had to have breakfast.

286
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,069
Come on. Of course you should have breakfast.

287
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,310
It's free since it's already been paid for.

288
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,779
I barely got to eat anything for dinner...

289
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,339
and the lunch course only served a tiny amount of food.

290
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,810
I'm starving.

291
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,280
That reminds me. Won't Mr. Yoon join us?

292
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,960
Mr. Yoon, aren't you having breakfast?

293
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm not.

294
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,730
I hear the morning scenery from that oreum is priceless.

295
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,430
Would you...

296
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,200
I hope you're not asking me to join you.

297
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,969
Of course not. Enjoy your breakfast.

298
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,970
Sure.

299
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Hello.

300
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,340
This is Lee Seung Soo, the manager at DADO Resort.

301
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,440
I had something to report.

302
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,040
Sure. What...

303
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,150
I think we have guests here who are from Sanin.

304
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
What?

305
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,980
As in who?

306
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,250
I don't know his name,

307
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,420
but he's someone who leaves an impression.

308
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,640
We'd jump at the chance if DADO Resort is for sale.

309
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
But,

310
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,010
is it true?

311
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,810
Is the CEO...

312
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,740
willing to sell?

313
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,850
We're still talking to her.

314
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,410
Come on.

315
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,650
We'll talk once she's on board.

316
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,250
We're considering DOLPHIN...

317
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,390
as the one to acquire DADO.

318
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,529
If you're not interested,

319
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,930
we won't have any need to persuade the CEO of DADO.

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,530
We're here to ask where DOLPHIN stands.

321
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,870
I said we'd jump at the chance.

322
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,430
However,

323
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,869
I'll be embarrassed once again...

324
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,600
if the deal falls through at the last second...

325
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,970
like last time.

326
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,710
Allow me to apologize for that.

327
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,850
As for the reason the negotiation fell through last time,

328
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,850
I owe you an explanation.

329
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,679
It had nothing to do with you.

330
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,590
It was due to DADO CEO's personal circumstances.

331
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,690
Well, I understand the CEO had a situation.

332
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,129
Then may I go ahead and assume that you're still interested...

333
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,600
in buying DADO Resort,

334
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
sir?

335
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,339
DADO Resort's reputation of being number one in Jeju...

336
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,570
makes it valuable enough.

337
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,810
What's the point?

338
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,840
It's not profitable.

339
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,610
Isn't it in the red?

340
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,680
That's why it's a good opportunity for DOLPHIN.

341
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Buying a business that isn't even profitable?

342
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,060
How's that a good opportunity?

343
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,929
DADO Resort is in the red at the moment,

344
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,060
so we want to sell it cheap.

345
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,430
If you choose not to buy it,

346
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,240
Sanin Group will run the resort.

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
If that happens,

348
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,339
the resort will start turning a profit in no time.

349
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,570
The group will do a full-scale promotion of the resort...

350
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,079
and sign an MOU to offer all Sanin employees...

351
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,179
a promotional package.

352
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,580
- An MOU? - Yes.

353
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,879
If we run a promotion...

354
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,819
where all Sanin employees get a discount,

355
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
the sales numbers will double.

356
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,560
Then...

357
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,090
DADO certainly won't agree to sell the resort at the current price.

358
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,800
Running resorts is what you're best at.

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,769
So as for DADO Resort being in the red,

360
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,140
it shouldn't really be a problem for you, right?

361
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,570
Well...

362
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,170
I sure can run it well.

363
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,410
Exactly.

364
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,580
That's why I said it'd be a good opportunity for you.

365
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,390
So...

366
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,020
how much?

367
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,360
How much are you thinking?

368
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,230
I believe I told you this last time too.

369
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,030
I can't go any higher than 50 million dollars.

370
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,869
We'd have to persuade the CEO of DADO Resort,

371
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,739
so I'm afraid we can't patch up...

372
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,969
and reinitiate the once-failed negotiation...

373
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,810
if the offer is still the same, sir.

374
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,080
Fifty-five million?

375
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,650
Sixty million would be our minimum.

376
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,190
Then...

377
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,200
that thing you mentioned earlier.

378
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,770
The promotional MOU with Sanin Group.

379
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,100
I want my hotel to get that deal too.

380
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,139
All Sanin employees will get a discount...

381
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
at our resort,

382
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,010
and Sanin will reimburse us...

383
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,310
for 50 percent of the discounted amount.

384
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,389
Would you mind if I discussed this with my team for a moment?

385
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,090
Not at all. Go for it.

386
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,970
Sixty million dollars...

387
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,440
will be enough to cover the repair costs too.

388
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,280
As for the MOU deal, we'll have to review the details.

389
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,580
It's a nice hotel too.

390
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,149
I think Sanin employees will be happy...

391
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,220
to get a discount at this hotel.

392
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
But...

393
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,390
do you really think Sanin will run it?

394
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,830
That, we don't know.

395
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,500
You see, this...

396
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,169
Are they just fishing for info when Sanin will run it anyway?

397
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,240
I think that's what they're doing.

398
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,410
They'll sell it if it's high enough. Otherwise, they'll call it off.

399
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,540
Now, I'm annoyed.

400
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,280
What?

401
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,580
Well, so?

402
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,720
Have you made your decision?

403
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Yes.

404
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,940
- Sir. - Yes.

405
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,710
Have a seat.

406
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,110
- So? - Samoel will issue the loan.

407
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,510
Oh, my.

408
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,650
They'll send the money tomorrow if you sign the agreement right away.

409
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,990
- Well done. - Thank you.

410
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,790
What are the terms and conditions?

411
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes, it's...

412
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,930
You'll have to pay it back in 3 years, and it's 18 percent.

413
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,900
Eighteen percent?

414
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,970
Does that make sense to you?

415
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,740
I know, it doesn't.

416
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,339
I already told them that it was unacceptable.

417
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,340
Bring it down.

418
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,910
Yes.

419
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,780
The thing is, sir.

420
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,710
We've already borrowed three billion dollars, so...

421
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,050
Director Ha.

422
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,720
It's not like we got that money for free.

423
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,620
We make our interest payments on time.

424
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,950
Ask them to bring it down.

425
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,790
Yes, sir.

426
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,790
Sir, I'll try to talk to them to bring it down to 15 percent.

427
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,160
Fifteen percent?

428
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,970
Are you kidding me?

429
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,570
Do you think I'm stupid?

430
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,200
No, sir.

431
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,339
So can you do it or not?

432
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,440
I can, sir.

433
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,510
Yes, you can do it.

434
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,720
Look at this view.

435
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,230
- Director Ha. - Yes, sir.

436
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,130
- Is this your first time here? - Pardon?

437
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,870
Oh, no.

438
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,100
You gave me a tour once a while back.

439
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,010
You probably don't remember it as it was a while ago.

440
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,510
I see.

441
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,980
Not many people know about this place.

442
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,780
Right.

443
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,880
Come often.

444
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,420
It's boring to listen to this music all by myself.

445
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,060
I will, sir.

446
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,730
- Get going. - Yes, sir.

447
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,000
All right, then.

448
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Sir.

449
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,540
They're negotiating to sell the resort in Jeju right now.

450
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,979
That fool! Has he lost his mind?

451
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,249
Why did you let him go there?

452
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,649
Tell him to come back at once.

453
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,720
Make him write a resignation letter!

454
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,450
- Bring it to me in person. - Yes, sir.

455
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,460
Goodness. That punk is really crazy.

456
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
How could he...

457
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,540
Sir. Hey!

458
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,400
You see, Mr. Yoon.

459
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,840
We've done some thinking too.

460
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,040
I really like the people in Sanin Group.

461
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,710
But the thing is,

462
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,320
you did this last time and ghosted us.

463
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,190
That made me look stupid.

464
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,289
I assure you that won't happen again.

465
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,290
That said,

466
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,660
get the MOU signed,

467
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,060
and we'll talk again.

468
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,800
Got it. We will talk again.

469
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,940
This isn't easy.

470
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,480
They suffered last time, you know.

471
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,049
Forget 60 million.

472
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,250
Can't we just tell them we'd settle at 55 million dollars?

473
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,090
No, then this deal is over.

474
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Why?

475
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,590
We've already lost their trust.

476
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,200
If we suddenly bring the price down for no reason,

477
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,430
they really won't trust us anymore.

478
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,170
It'll make us look like...

479
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,399
a group of scammers trying to get 60 million...

480
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
for something that's worth 55 million.

481
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,910
I mean, unless we can come up with a reason for the price drop.

482
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,840
Right, I see.

483
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,280
At this point, I think the MOU is more important than the price.

484
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,980
Yes, I agree.

485
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,390
Yes, sir.

486
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,960
Chairman Song has collapsed.

487
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,960
I think he found out about you going to Jeju.

488
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,470
Is he all right now?

489
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,140
Come back right away.

490
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,870
Yes, I will.

491
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,930
What's the matter?

492
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,570
Was it the office?

493
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,840
It looks like we'll have to write our resignation letters.

494
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
What?

495
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,090
(Mom)

496
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,400
How did he find out about us coming here?

497
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,770
Some DADO Resort employees...

498
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,840
must be in contact with the secretary's office.

499
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,010
(Unread Messages, Mom)

500
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,980
Come home tomorrow. We need to talk.

501
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,850
I can't. I'm away on a work trip now.

502
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,960
Do you really need a car?

503
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,600
Does that mean we have to go back to Seoul now?

504
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,830
Yes, I think so.

505
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,040
I'll hand in my resignation and make sure you guys won't have to,

506
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,500
so don't worry too much.

507
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,039
Today's been paid for already anyway.

508
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,340
Can't we just leave tomorrow?

509
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,850
I know, right? This place is very expensive.

510
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,549
It's the weekend, so the company can't make us come back.

511
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,550
I mean, legally.

512
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes, you are right. Legally, they can't do that.

513
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,220
Right, Mr. Yoon?

514
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,630
Yes, let's do that.

515
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,670
- Did you bring it? - Yes.

516
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,650
Sir, may I come in for a moment?

517
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,080
Yes.

518
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,590
Here's your robe.

519
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,790
Okay.

520
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,590
Let me.

521
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,700
Oh, boy.

522
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,470
Tell them I'm going home tomorrow.

523
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,070
I feel fine.

524
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,200
They're still waiting for the test results, though.

525
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,510
I suggest you wait to hear about the results before you go home.

526
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,580
Okay.

527
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
- And you. - Yes, sir.

528
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,890
- About my fainting spell. - Yes.

529
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,520
Make sure no one hears about it.

530
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,130
- Yes, I already took care of it. - Good.

531
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,740
You brought the contract yourself when you could've just emailed it.

532
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,300
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about it.

533
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,640
Let's see...

534
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,490
What is it?

535
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,190
They wrote ten percent for the interest rate.

536
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,400
Goodness.

537
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,130
It's 15 percent.

538
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Please take a seat for a moment.

539
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,570
Something happened, you see.

540
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,120
Listen.

541
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,219
Chairman Song collapsed.

542
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,519
- Pardon? - It's nothing too serious.

543
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,189
He went to the hospital right away...

544
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,920
and is in stable condition now.

545
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,760
Okay, so?

546
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,100
Well...

547
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,029
Chairman Song collapsed,

548
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,800
so I couldn't bring up the increased interest rate.

549
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,470
Please understand.

550
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,870
Do you need more time to talk to him, then?

551
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,980
I'll be honest with you.

552
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,119
Before Chairman Song collapsed,

553
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,350
he said 15 percent was just not doable.

554
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,919
Is that why he collapsed?

555
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,490
No, it's not that.

556
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,020
It was Yoon Joo No's fault that he collapsed.

557
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,130
You see, Yoon Joo No...

558
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,359
went to Jeju Island...

559
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,160
to sell his resort behind his back.

560
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,030
Chairman Song said he'd never sell it.

561
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,470
What is that punk thinking?

562
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,500
So? Did he sell it?

563
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,910
No!

564
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,240
Chairman Song...

565
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,810
gave that resort to his daughter.

566
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,879
But Yoon Joo No is trying to sell it,

567
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,450
so Chairman Song got fuming mad and collapsed.

568
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,550
Goodness.

569
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Well, Director Ha.

570
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,630
We'll need to discuss this too.

571
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,200
- Oh, sure. - Give us one moment.

572
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,150
That can't be a lie, can it?

573
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,790
No.

574
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,620
When he lies, it shows.

575
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,789
They can no longer sell the resort to pay it back.

576
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,200
They have no choice but to borrow money.

577
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,270
So, technically,

578
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,440
we're all Sanin has now.

579
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,240
That is true,

580
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,010
but if Chairman Song has health issues, Sanin's stock will plummet.

581
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,580
This has been fixed,

582
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,950
but you'll probably have to get a new one soon.

583
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,020
Take a soft drink and leave.

584
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,560
Let's not do this.

585
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,560
Why not?

586
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,900
He said Chairman Song collapsed. It could be risky.

587
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,610
But that could end up becoming an opportunity for us.

588
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,380
How?

589
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,180
- Sorry to keep you waiting. - No problem.

590
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,230
We...

591
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,600
want more shares, then.

592
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,470
Pardon?

593
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,940
Well...

594
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,140
You said Chairman Song collapsed. It makes us anxious.

595
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,410
Who knows what could happen to Sanin if he passes away?

596
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,210
Well, how many shares?

597
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,720
Double it?

598
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,790
Come on. That's too much.

599
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,959
Sanin Group is a huge enterprise.

600
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,360
It won't go bankrupt.

601
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,029
We're not asking for real shares.

602
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,460
Just as collateral.

603
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,899
If Sanin is that stable like you said,

604
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,940
then you have no reason to turn down this offer. Am I wrong?

605
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,940
Besides, we're doing this to help you out here.

606
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,740
If you don't like it, you can simply turn down the offer.

607
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,350
No.

608
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,950
I'll accept it.

609
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
It'll be ten percent, right?

610
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,550
The ceiling is high.

611
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,710
I know you wouldn't like this,

612
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,720
but can't Sanin take over that resort?

613
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,950
With that money, the chairman can settle his debt.

614
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,820
That's paying the chairman's personal debt using Sanin's money.

615
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,430
Even so, the resort will belong to Sainin.

616
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,100
As Chairman Song has given the resort to his daughter,

617
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,630
it'll cause a greater problem.

618
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,970
It can fall under...

619
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,370
malpractice or unlawful gifting.

620
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,440
I'm well aware of it.

621
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,180
But that's the only way...

622
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,480
you can survive.

623
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,680
I understand what you're saying.

624
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,750
But I can't help but believe that was...

625
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,790
the chairman's original plan all along.

626
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,460
Hence why...

627
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,430
I suggested selling the resort.

628
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,630
Right.

629
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,370
Then write your resignation letter.

630
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,390
Yes?

631
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,830
Are you ignoring my calls now?

632
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,200
I was working.

633
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,330
What work? It's the weekend.

634
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,700
Are you even lying now?

635
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,170
I'm not lying. I'm on a business trip.

636
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,710
Whatever. Do you really need your car?

637
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,410
No.

638
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,650
I don't. You can take it.

639
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,580
That means you'll give it to Sang Hoon, right?

640
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,550
Yes.

641
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,250
I don't need a car anymore.

642
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,990
Because I don't need to go to work now.

643
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,760
I'm quitting my job.

644
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,770
Are you acting up because I asked to borrow your car?

645
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,370
No.

646
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,170
I got fired. That's all.

647
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,980
So take the car.

648
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,380
Goodness gracious.

649
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,620
Does making me flip out every day make you happy?

650
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,990
Mom.

651
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,990
What kind of life do you want me to live?

652
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,659
I want you to be well-off.

653
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,330
I would never hope for a poor life.

654
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,930
Don't miss work, okay?

655
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,030
But I got fired...

656
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,490
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,030
I had no intention of eavesdropping.

658
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,300
Are you okay?

659
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,070
Yes.

660
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,150
Min Jeong.

661
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,920
Min Jeong. You can have this.

662
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,730
After all, I got your top ruined.

663
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,130
No. I'm okay.

664
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,829
I think it'll look great on you.

665
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,770
How come? I don't think I can wear it.

666
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,270
Wear it in my stead. Please?

667
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,710
No. I'm okay.

668
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,280
Then have a cup of tea with me.

669
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,020
You must hate me a little, Min Jeong. Am I right?

670
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
No, I don't.

671
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,200
Didn't you get fired because of me?

672
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,629
No. The fault lies with our team,

673
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,130
not you, Ms. Song.

674
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Call me Ji O, not Ms. Song.

675
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,340
Didn't you call me Ji O yesterday?

676
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,780
All right.

677
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
I bet you won't call me that ever again.

678
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,750
Min Jeong.

679
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,120
You're that kind of person.

680
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,420
You don't say "no,"

681
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,130
but you don't say "yes" either.

682
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,770
Here's what I'm like.

683
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,940
If everyone says "yes,"

684
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,070
I do too.

685
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,810
I don't think anyone would say "no" to you, Ms. Song.

686
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,140
That's not true.

687
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,280
"No" is the only thing my dad says to me.

688
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,080
That's why I could never live the life I wanted.

689
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,290
But it looks like you are living the life you want.

690
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,330
Is that so?

691
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,670
The life I want...

692
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,700
is to live here.

693
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,710
Not just anyone can live a life like yours.

694
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,150
Really?

695
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,810
Yes.

696
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,750
You may not...

697
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,790
really know the life of an ordinary person.

698
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,800
I envy...

699
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,510
how bright...

700
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,270
you are...

701
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,710
all the time.

702
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
True.

703
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,680
I like being bright.

704
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,720
It means there's hope.

705
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,420
Do you also need hope, Ms. Song?

706
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,160
You already own a lot.

707
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,260
Do I?

708
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,100
Yes.

709
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,100
You have more than enough.

710
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
A random person can't live in such a place their entire life.

711
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,210
You're right.

712
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,980
You can't live here forever.

713
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,450
Please excuse me first.

714
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,150
What?

715
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,520
Stay a little longer.

716
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,390
I'll let you in on a secret.

717
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,360
See that?

718
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,530
You can't say "no," but you can't say "yes" either.

719
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,840
Are you actually leaving?

720
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,140
Can't you go after finishing your tea?

721
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,210
Ms. Song.

722
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,320
Some people in the world don't have any hope.

723
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,590
Sorry?

724
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,450
- Let me help. - No, it's okay.

725
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,130
Are you leaving?

726
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,730
No. You can't go.

727
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,399
How can you leave? Weren't you going to give me...

728
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,970
DADO's check-up report?

729
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,840
I was waiting for it, you know?

730
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Ms. Song.

731
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,510
We've given up on selling DADO Resort.

732
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,240
Don't let it bother you anymore.

733
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:07,550
Does that mean you're no longer interested in DADO's health?

734
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,999
Here's an advanced development strategy...

735
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,970
for the DADO Resort business.

736
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,110
First off, our team's evaluation of DADO Resort came out excellent.

737
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I see.

738
00:44:39,281 --> 00:44:42,050
Most of the resort's evaluation list received top ratings.

739
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,190
One team member...

740
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,820
said it was the best resort they stayed at.

741
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,560
Was it you, Min Jeong?

742
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,960
- No. - The con is...

743
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,530
the course menu is good, but the portion is too small.

744
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,270
You can ignore this part.

745
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,540
The room evaluations were also very positive.

746
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,320
However,

747
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,050
the problem is the resort not making any profit.

748
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,590
Don't worry about that.

749
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,160
All I wish is for the people in DADO to be happy.

750
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,630
That's all that matters. The profit means nothing.

751
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,600
But...

752
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,270
If you continue to operate with a loss,

753
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,500
you might have to close DADO.

754
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,770
We can close when that time comes.

755
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,270
Then,

756
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,740
will you be firing the employees?

757
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Sorry?

758
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,249
You said you wanted...

759
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,480
the people in DADO to be happy.

760
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,950
Are employees included in those people?

761
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,090
What?

762
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,720
Then what must I do?

763
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,630
You can leave it to a management specialist.

764
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,360
I can't do that.

765
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,170
I can't entrust my beloved DADO to someone else.

766
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,029
Sanin Group can...

767
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,040
No.

768
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,440
The chairman can give you some help.

769
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,810
He's right.

770
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,340
My apologies.

771
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,010
Don't worry.

772
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,220
Does...

773
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,990
this conclude DADO's check-up report?

774
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,890
By the way, Ms. Song.

775
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,360
Are you okay?

776
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Why do you ask?

777
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,170
Do I look strange to you?

778
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,810
Yes.

779
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,450
Chairman Song. How do you feel?

780
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,150
Goodness.

781
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,290
That's not a question the doctor should ask the patient.

782
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,659
There's nothing much to worry about.

783
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,600
But it's best to reduce the amount of stress.

784
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,700
Work from stress was called an illness from pent-up anger.

785
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,240
I heard there was no medicine for it.

786
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,440
You lost consciousness...

787
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,980
due to a vasovagal syncope.

788
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,049
When you get stressed out or such,

789
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,010
- the blood vessel expands... - Enough.

790
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,280
In short, you're telling me I'm old. Right?

791
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,249
No, Chairman Song.

792
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,050
Your body functioned how it should.

793
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,790
You lost consciousness...

794
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,629
because not enough blood was flowing to your brain.

795
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,829
Your body reacted...

796
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,960
by lying down to send more blood to it.

797
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,630
It was a natural response to survive.

798
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,440
So I fainted to live.

799
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,300
Yes. That's the body's instinct.

800
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,439
Let us get your blood pressure.

801
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,470
Go ahead.

802
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,800
One's instinct is to live.

803
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,570
But why is my daughter going the other way?

804
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,310
Do I look strange to you?

805
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,710
Yes.

806
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,950
I can't help but wonder if you're unwell.

807
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,780
How come?

808
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,790
Was that the book you were reading...

809
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,489
when we first met?

810
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,589
("4am, The Desired Time to Live")

811
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,829
Apparently, the writer...

812
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,760
wrote that book while fighting cancer.

813
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,140
And so, I also have cancer?

814
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,970
No.

815
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,770
Mr. Yoon...

816
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,080
Last night,

817
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,910
it seemed an ambulance came to the resort.

818
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,410
How did you know?

819
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,980
I sleep quite late.

820
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,420
That's how I saw it by coincidence.

821
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,160
You didn't have breakfast the next morning.

822
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,090
Nor did you go up the oreum.

823
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,930
And so I assumed...

824
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,160
that ambulance took you to the hospital.

825
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,330
Your reasoning is unbelievable.

826
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,299
I give credit to your reasoning.

827
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,170
But that's no decisive evidence.

828
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,710
Isn't that patch on your arm a pain reliever?

829
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,620
You leave me no choice but to admit it.

830
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,930
Correct.

831
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,160
I have cancer.

832
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,240
But I...

833
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,180
underwent surgery.

834
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,080
That's a relief.

835
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,380
Although it relapsed.

836
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,090
What should I do with my daughter?

837
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,289
Your daughter must have another operation,

838
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,960
even if it's tough.

839
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,630
If not, she's only neglecting the cancer.

840
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,800
I can't do a thing when she's stubborn about not getting it.

841
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,700
It's not me getting the surgery.

842
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,270
It's hers.

843
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,410
Is she not moving from Jeju Island?

844
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,150
No.

845
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,380
She wants...

846
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,420
to die there.

847
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,540
When did you get here?

848
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,550
A while ago.

849
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,790
Did you hear it all?

850
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,230
It wasn't intentional.

851
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,390
I see.

852
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,860
That resort.

853
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,970
She told me to sell it after she dies.

854
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,469
Her cancer is back,

855
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,210
but she's refusing surgery.

856
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,750
She wants to die...

857
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,880
in that resort.

858
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,250
That nasty girl.

859
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,800
I had no idea.

860
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,970
I'm sorry.

861
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,870
Don't apologize.

862
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,310
It has to do with my daughter.

863
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,890
That's why I can't sell DADO.

864
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,690
I made up my mind to die here.

865
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,930
The doctor told me...

866
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,540
I was simply unlucky.

867
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,610
In short, I have bad luck.

868
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,580
But my dad is quite rich, isn't he?

869
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,350
That makes me lucky, which evens everything out.

870
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,749
With that in mind, I got the surgery.

871
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,450
But the cancer came back.

872
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,690
Overall, I'm an unlucky girl. Don't you agree?

873
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,130
I thought I shouldn't leave my death to fate.

874
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,430
I traveled around...

875
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,930
until I met DADO.

876
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,970
I was very lucky.

877
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Shouldn't you get the second surgery?

878
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,140
Even if I do, the probability of me surviving is 50 percent.

879
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,610
And nobody knows how much longer I'll live for.

880
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,150
What if you don't get the surgery?

881
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:39,890
What's this?

882
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,590
Do you want me to get the second surgery?

883
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,760
I knew it.

884
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,540
You don't say no, but you don't say yes either.

885
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,440
You've never gotten surgery for cancer, right?

886
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,870
It's really painful, you know.

887
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,080
I thought death would be less painful.

888
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,480
But here's the thing.

889
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,380
Even if the surgery is successful,

890
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,020
I wouldn't be able to live like this.

891
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,690
But without the surgery,

892
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,190
I'll probably die.

893
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,860
But what if I were to die...

894
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,100
in a place like this after living a happy life?

895
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,800
Wouldn't that be considered a good way to go?

896
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,980
Min Jeong. So you want me to get the surgery, right?

897
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,180
What about you, Mr. Yoon?

898
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,720
Should I risk my life when I have a 50-50 chance?

899
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,890
- I'm not sure. - What?

900
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,019
That's not the answer I was looking for.

901
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
But I will say that...

902
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,830
you do seem truly happy...

903
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,790
here in this resort.

904
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,670
That's an original answer.

905
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,800
Okay. Great.

906
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,640
This ends today's report.

907
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,330
Ms. Song.

908
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,900
I realized that I said some things I shouldn't have.

909
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,100
No. You didn't know about my situation, Min Jeong.

910
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,040
Even so,

911
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:40,380
I failed to think that you had your own reasons too.

912
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,440
I'm sorry.

913
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,050
Then to make up for your mistake,

914
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,680
will you take the dress I offered yesterday?

915
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,190
Pardon?

916
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,390
Yes? Or no?

917
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,320
My answer is yes.

918
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,500
What a pity. I was having a good time in a while.

919
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,940
We had a good time too.

920
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,910
By the way, are things that bad with my father?

921
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,780
He bought this resort for his only daughter.

922
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,380
But you're here to sell it.

923
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,220
You don't seem like a bad person.

924
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,890
So I was wondering if things were that bad with him.

925
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,960
Things are all right for now.

926
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,860
But there will be a problem later.

927
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,100
You sound just like my doctor.

928
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,170
Goodbye.

929
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:47,010
Ms. Song. Thank you for everything.

930
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,950
I left the dress in my room.

931
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,180
I thought about it.

932
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,050
But the dress would suit you better than me.

933
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,120
If that's what you want to do, there's nothing I can do then.

934
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,260
Take care.

935
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,160
We're on our way to hand in our resignation.

936
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,300
But that seems so trivial now.

937
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,570
Right.

938
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,540
It makes me wonder what's really important in life.

939
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,910
I wonder how she must feel right now.

940
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,579
She was so cheerful.

941
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,610
It never occurred to me that she could be sick.

942
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,050
Min Jeong.

943
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,390
This isn't a fancy dress.

944
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,790
I bought it at a traditional market.

945
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,330
It looked pretty, so I bought it on my way back from the hospital.

946
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,600
I think I might have missed the season to wear this.

947
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,170
I might have to wait until next year to wear this.

948
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,240
But I'm not sure if I'll still be around...

949
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,380
by then.

950
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,950
Okay. Thank you.

951
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,760
There's no pity in your eyes when you look at me.

952
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,190
That's why I really like you.

953
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,270
But I was a bit of a bother, wasn't I?

954
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,270
No.

955
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,170
Is that why she was so cheerful?

956
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,340
To be honest, her energy level threw me off.

957
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,680
Same here.

958
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,950
Actually, I wondered if she was having a manic episode.

959
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,620
Because things were tough on her,

960
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,690
I guess she was trying to smile as much as she could.

961
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,590
That sounds about right.

962
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,190
She said she hated it when people gave her the sad look.

963
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,900
If people gave her the sad look,

964
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,100
it meant that she had no hope.

965
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,870
I would have felt the same way.

966
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,539
I hope you're back to full health, sir.

967
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,610
I am.

968
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,580
My gosh.

969
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,720
They want me to double the collateral?

970
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Yes.

971
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,950
But you know, it is just collateral.

972
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,190
They will hold it temporarily. We will get it back later.

973
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,920
You don't have to worry.

974
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,830
Come in.

975
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,530
Sir, Mr. Yoon Joo No is here.

976
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,280
Did you bring your resignation letter?

977
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,380
Yes.

978
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,450
All right.

979
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,760
So you know what you did wrong, correct?

980
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,190
I do.

981
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,860
Leave.

982
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,700
Was she happy?

983
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,080
Yes. She was happy there.

984
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,250
So what did you do there?

985
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,790
- I'll go and get it. - Get me my phone.

986
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,270
- Hey. - Dad.

987
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,310
Hey.

988
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,310
Yes. It's me. What is it?

989
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,610
It's about the resort.

990
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,050
Sell it.

991
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,590
Sell it?

992
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,290
You were going to sell it anyway once I was gone.

993
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,360
But...

994
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,800
just sell it now.

995
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,730
Listen, Ji O.

996
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,130
I'm really sorry.

997
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,100
I won't sell the resort no matter what.

998
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,140
No. That's not what I'm saying.

999
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,580
You should really sell it.

1000
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,810
Oh, right.

1001
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,580
The dress.

1002
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,899
Sorry to interrupt. Could you finish this later?

1003
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,900
Sure, Ms. Song.

1004
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,679
Ms. Song. We'd like to make another offer to you.

1005
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,420
You can find the details of our offer in the contract.

1006
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,689
Whatever decision you make,

1007
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,220
we will support your decision.

1008
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,429
But I'd like to say one thing.

1009
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,160
That this dress will look better on you.

1010
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,199
I will come back to the resort next year...

1011
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,640
to see you in this dress.

1012
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Thank you.

1013
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,410
P.S.

1014
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:01,940
Running the resort may not be the best way to use your skills.

1015
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,410
I'm sorry about that.

1016
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,980
You really want me to sell it?

1017
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,690
Yes.

1018
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,990
I guess I'm not cut out to be the CEO.

1019
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,290
Who said that to you?

1020
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,460
My friend.

1021
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,640
Oh, right.

1022
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,170
I...

1023
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,250
want to get the surgery.

1024
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,360
You want to get the surgery.

1025
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,830
Yes.

1026
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,500
I'll do it.

1027
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,840
I'll get the surgery.

1028
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,480
Hopefully, I can do a better job with that.

1029
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,050
The surgery...

1030
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,180
will go well, right?

1031
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,520
Of course.

1032
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,030
The surgery will go well. Don't worry about it.

1033
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,230
Sell it.

1034
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,830
Okay, Dad?

1035
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,040
Yes.

1036
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,710
Ji O.

1037
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,580
Thank you.

1038
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,580
Don't thank me.

1039
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,710
Thank the people you sent.

1040
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,250
Tell them I'm very grateful.

1041
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,260
Sure thing.

1042
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,520
As for the contract,

1043
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,490
I want to stick to the contract prepared by the people you sent.

1044
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,800
Okay?

1045
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,860
Don't change a word.

1046
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,670
Okay.

1047
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,070
Dad.

1048
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,650
Nothing.

1049
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,630
Thank you.

1050
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:41,970
Thank you.

1051
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,450
Okay. Sure.

1052
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
I got it.

1053
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,070
What happened?

1054
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,480
The contract we offered to Ms. Song...

1055
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,480
has a special clause.

1056
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,050
A special clause.

1057
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,990
Unit 123 of DADO Resort...

1058
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,850
will be rented...

1059
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,920
to Song Ji O without charge permanently.

1060
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,360
When everyone is saying yes,

1061
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,960
I'll say yes too.

1062
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,300
However,

1063
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,400
in the case of Song Ji O's death,

1064
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,840
this clause will be invalidated.

1065
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,510
It won't be invalidated.

1066
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,550
Because I'm not going to die.

1067
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,590
It is my understanding...

1068
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,360
that she accepted our offer.

1069
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,360
Yes.

1070
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,510
Sir!

1071
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,839
Secretary! The chairman has fainted.

1072
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,880
I'm good.

1073
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,180
It's just...

1074
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,610
there was no blood pumping to my brain.

1075
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,920
- So I just sat down. - Pardon?

1076
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,149
- Are you all right, sir? - I'm fine.

1077
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,790
I'm all right. Come on, cut it out.

1078
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,920
I'm sitting down, so my body can recover. I'm fine. Just go.

1079
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,330
- I'm all right. You sit down. - But...

1080
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,940
My goodness. Okay.

1081
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,450
You know what?

1082
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,750
I'm deeply indebted to you now.

1083
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,090
- I'm calling from DOLPHIN Hotel. - Yes. Hello, sir.

1084
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,060
I wanted to check the second special clause.

1085
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,490
Please wait.

1086
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,099
I see. The permanent rental clause also ensures that...

1087
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,330
as long as she's alive,

1088
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,499
the promotion between Sanin Group and your hotel will continue.

1089
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,740
I see.

1090
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,970
Okay. Let's do it then.

1091
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,469
I must send Ms. Song some healthy food,

1092
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,440
so she stays in good health.

1093
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,650
Sure. Thank you.

1094
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,350
How will I...

1095
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:46,420
pay you back for this?

1096
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,070
You.

1097
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,780
Do you want to be a board member?

1098
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,890
(The Art of Negotiation)

1099
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,750
I have a country club in North Chungcheong Province.

1100
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,120
See if you can sell it.

1101
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,930
The atmosphere in the company has gotten intense lately.

1102
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,060
You don't know who could be next on the chopping block.

1103
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,230
Gosh, look at these jerks. They're trying to be clever.

1104
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:05,300
Is your intention in buying the country club to run it?

1105
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:08,239
The company interested in buying GREEN VIEW Country Club...

1106
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,440
demands a change in the CEO as part of their terms.

1107
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,909
If he's getting dismissed because he did a good job,

1108
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,140
that's not fair. Is it?

1109
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,710
Joo No.

1110
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,850
Becoming a board member isn't easy.

1111
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,079
There was a withdrawal of 100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

1112
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,520
The 100,000 dollars weren't accounted for.

1113
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,220
I'm almost there too.

1114
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,820
I'll be on the board.
