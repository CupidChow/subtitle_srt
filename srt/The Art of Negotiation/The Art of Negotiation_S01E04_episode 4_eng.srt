00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,600

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,920

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,940
   

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,460

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,330
♫  Because money takes the heart, money takes the heart  ♫

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,130
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,930
   

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,360
How much did they offer?

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
 They offered to pay double. 

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,420
 I'm sorry. 

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,950
Another place offered CEO Cha double.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,490
Twenty billion won?

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,060
There's no way.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,080
Let's go home.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,120
This was planned.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,260
We met with Cha Cha last week.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,060
But another place offered double in just one week?

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,070
For a company like Cha Cha?

23
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
It seems our interest in Cha Cha was leaked.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,080
Who is responsible for this...

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,490
Mr. Yun.

26
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,900
Everything is going well with Cha Cha Games, right?

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,170
Yes. It's going well.

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,350
As it should.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,640
Yes, it should.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,580
   

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,220
Clearance, clearance. Strawberry, strawberry.

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,960
Hey, Ahjumma!

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,950
Aigoo, aigoo, Sir.

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,770
Sir, taste these strawberries.

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,440
Forget that.

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,940
You can't do this here.

37
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,230
Do you know what kind of people live here?

38
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,590
You're too loud!

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,240
I'll get complaints. Move your truck!

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,590
Don't be like that and just try one!

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,790
Ahjussi, this isn't apartment property.

42
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,140
What? Don't you see the bricks laid down here?

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,760
This is all apartment property.

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,910
Hurry and move your truck before I report you.

45
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,670
Ahjussi, this is public land. Public land.

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,350
The sidewalk had to be renovated

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,370
for the apartment to get the permit.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,450
You're doing this because of the complaints, right?

49
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,390
Do you know how difficult these residents are?

50
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,000
They are all complaining about the noise.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,060
It must be hard for you.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,130
And there are probably all sorts of residents.

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,200
But...

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,860
don't some of them complain if you're too harsh?

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,300
There are.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,860
I don't know what they want me to do. Goodness.

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,330
First, we'll turn that off.

58
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,370
Hurry and turn it off.

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,160
This is an apartment. They can't hear it, anyway.

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,510
No one comes by hearing it.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,350
Oh, okay, okay. Let's do that.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,130
We also have to get going in two hours.

63
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,340
We'll start cleaning up as well.

64
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,730
I think that'd be good for both sides.

65
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,760
- Two hours, okay? 
 - Yes, yes, of course.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,460
Here, Sir.

67
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,400
Take these and eat them.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,790
Aigoo, thank you.

69
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,540
- Aigoo, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

70
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,270
Hey, this works out for us.

71
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,230
Let's sell them all and go.

72
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,390
How will you sell them here?

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,800
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,840
I came here on purpose since it's a rich area.

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
Exactly.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,930
People who live here don't buy fruit from trucks.

77
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,380
They buy good ones at supermarkets.

78
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,330
Aigoo, what are you talking about?

79
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,540
As the last batch of the season, these may be small,

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,790
but they taste great.

81
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,200
   

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,670
Is this clearance?

83
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,750
What's wrong with clearance?

84
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,060
Do you think rich people only eat expensive stuff?

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,540
Rich people actually seek out cheaper products.

86
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
That's how they became rich.

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,240
I asked you to help out with work,

88
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,200
but all you do is nag.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,750
Hey, please buy some strawberries.

90
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,950
Strawberries, strawberries. Clearance, clearance!

91
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,440
Strawberry, clearance! Clearance, clearance!

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,210
I'm leaving. I need to work.

93
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,580
Come on, hey! Gosh, that coldhearted wench.

94
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,420
You just leave your mom to do

95
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,920
- all the work? 
 - I haven't had strawberries this year.

96
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,830
- I was just... 
 - How much are these?

97
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,340
Aigoo, it's 5,000 won for one basket.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,220
We'll take one.

99
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,380
Okay, enjoy! 
    

100
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,670
- 5,000 won per pack, right? 
 - Yes, right.

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,940
Please give me two.

102
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,990
Two? Okay.

103
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,020
I'll give you one more bag.

104
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,610
Yes, this is Cha Cha.

105
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,960
You forgot to give us pickled radish.

106
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
Okay.

107
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,750
They'll bring us some right away.

108
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,760
Gosh, I should've ordered jjampong.

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,940
If you ordered jjampong,

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,800
you'd say you should've ordered jjajangmyeon.

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,440
We should've also got spicy garlic fried chicken.

112
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,750
Their spicy garlic fried chicken is the best.

113
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,650
Let's order that when the money comes in.

114
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,090
Will they really pay us 20 billion won?

115
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,780
What if they say otherwise later?

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,910
They offered to give us double Sanin's amount first.

117
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,690
But even so, 20 billion won is outlandish.

118
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,970
Hey, a major corporation spending 20 billion won

119
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,990
to start e-commerce is actually cheap.

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,400
Why don't you ask for more?

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,700
Hey, should I?

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,770
Should I negotiate for more?

123
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,960
Thirty billion won?

124
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,930
The pickled radish must be here.

125
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,740
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

126
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,920
Could we come in?

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,590
Well...

128
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,680
Ho Jin isn't here.

129
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,620
May I ask you what the conditions of the other offer were?

130
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,780
Why are you asking us that?

131
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,680
Don't be clingy and end things cleanly.

132
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,270
Hey,

133
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,750
is ghosting us after setting up a meeting "clean"?

134
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,380
- Who'd actually buy Cha Cha, when everyone says it's doomed? 
 - Jin Su.

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,980
Is it doomed? That's not true.

136
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,290
They said they'd pay double what Sanin offered.

137
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,930
Do you mean the condition was

138
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,570
to double Sanin's offer?

139
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,540
Yes.

140
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,250
"You're negotiating with Sanin, right?"

141
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,860
"We'll double Sanin's offer."

142
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,950
That's what they said.

143
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,120
Money isn't the only condition in a negotiation.

144
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Do you take us for fools?

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,500
What else is important besides money?

146
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,270
When you ordered your lunch,

147
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,920
didn't you consider which noodle dish to order?

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,970
Was the price important at that time?

149
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,770
Wasn't your craving more important?

150
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,170
Aren't they the same price?

151
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,730
Excuse me.

152
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,890
Jjampong is 1,000 won more expensive.

153
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,260
For that price, you can get a large jjajangmyeon.

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,670
1,000 won isn't that much.

155
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,870
Honestly, we don't want to pivot.

156
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,730
We're confident we can make a hit game next time.

157
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,940
Since we have no money,

158
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,320
we'll get some from pivoting or e-commerce,

159
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,980
and we'll make games again.

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,230
That's why we're going with a bigger offer.

161
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,150
So unless you'll offer more than 20 billion won,

162
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,950
you should leave.

163
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,860
But is this food being wasted?

164
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,020
Gosh, you shouldn't waste food.

165
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,410
If you do, you'll eat all your wasted food in hell.

166
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,490
This is so bad.

167
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,050
Wh-What are you going to do about this?

168
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,440
Y-You can eat it.

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,060
- That's a relief. 
 - Okay.

170
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,140
Thank you.

171
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,730
It's good.

172
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,220
Eat as much as you want.

173
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,480
There's a picture of CEO Cha.

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,750
What do you mean?

175
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,790
Could I take a look at this?

176
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,440
Go ahead.

177
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,180
I guess this was when CEO Cha was younger.

178
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,940
Yes, that's CEO Cha's seat.

179
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,950
This girl looks familiar.

180
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,830
- Is she his girlfriend? 
 - What?

181
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,380
Oh, no. We don't know either.

182
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,030
Aren't you done eating?

183
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,880
Wait, just a moment.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,610
It's good. They make good food. It's tasty.

185
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,750
Thank you for the food.

186
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,200
Should we get going now?

187
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,620
You didn't get to eat properly because of us.

188
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,130
We'll reorder some food for you.

189
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,970
It was tough to force myself to eat.

190
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,740
I thought my stomach was going to explode.

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,590
You seemed to enjoy it, though.

192
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,680
What should I order for Cha Cha?

193
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,320
The same thing?

194
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,580
You know the one with both jjajangmyeon and jjampong?

195
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,770
"Jjamjjamyeon"?

196
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,860
Yes, should we order that for them?

197
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,730
Also, add spicy garlic fried chicken.

198
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,520
Four jjamjjamyeon and a large spicy garlic fried chicken.

199
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,380
No, you can just order three jjamjjamyeon.

200
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,740
CEO Cha wasn't there.

201
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
What?

202
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,100
If they offered to double Sanin's offer,

203
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,920
they knew Cha Cha was negotiating with us.

204
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,080
They just offered to pay double

205
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,140
so they didn't approach them with a number either.

206
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,380
That means they knew they were negotiating with us.

207
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,960
They're messing with us. Who could it be?

208
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,810
Maybe it's DC?

209
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,520
Supposedly, their CEO is a scoundrel.

210
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,240
He even said he wanted to get along with CEO Cha in an interview.

211
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,150
It could also be a fund.

212
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,860
In order to resell it to us?

213
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,410
What if we don't accept their offer?

214
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,960
If they know that we must acquire it, it's possible.

215
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,020
 Hey, did you meet with Cha Cha Games? 

216
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,530
 We are exposed to a sniper right now, 

217
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,000
 and we took a shot. 

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,090
 But we don't even know where the bullet came from. 

219
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,530
Is he dead?

220
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,270
The kill didn't pop up on the feed.

221
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,080
 It's instinctive to want to check where the shot came from, 

222
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,560
 but the opponent 

223
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,940
 will be waiting for us to peek our heads out. 

224
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,170
Then what should we do?

225
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,430
We must do the opposite of our instincts.

226
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,660
The opposite?

227
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,170
We need to act like nothing happened,

228
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,870
as if we weren't hit by a bullet.

229
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,980
For how long?

230
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,200
Until we find out who aimed the gun at our heads.

231
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,160
 How did you know? 

232
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,130
 See me. 

233
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,140
 Let's meet and talk. 

234
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,490
Jin Su.

235
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,990
- Yes? 
 - By chance,

236
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,980
did you beat Delivery King?

237
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,540
Yes.

238
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,570
You know the cut scene when you beat the game?

239
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,110
Do you mean the ending credits?

240
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes. Didn't it look similar

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,960
to the photo on CEO Cha's desk?

242
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,010
Well, I'm not sure...

243
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,450
Developers often make things reflect themselves.

244
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,940
In any case, you found it special, right?

245
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes.

246
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,510
 I'm busy today. 

247
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,860
 It's my first day at work at Cha Cha. 

248
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,000
How much will we get this time?

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,940
If it goes well, I'd say about five billion each.

250
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,000
That much?

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,820
That's if it goes well.

252
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,210
And I happen to be good at it.

253
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,440
Is there anything I can assist you with?

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm buying a small company. There's no need.

255
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,140
Wait, actually, would you like to play cops?

256
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,250
You're talking about "good cop, bad cop," right?

257
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,490
Right. We'll become good friends anyway.

258
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,130
How about we practice some teamwork?

259
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Sure. Sounds good. It's been a while.

260
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,530
Excuse me.

261
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,320
Yes?

262
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,530
I ordered your desk online, Jennie.

263
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,560
It will come tomorrow.

264
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,320
Okay. Thank you.

265
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,550
I ordered a pretty one.

266
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,770
It's much better than the one I use.

267
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,790
Yes, you said that earlier.

268
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,950
Just in case you don't like the design—

269
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,290
You also said that, too.

270
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,890
Okay.

271
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,260
What's the WiFi password here?

272
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,060
I'm sorry, but we don't use WiFi here.

273
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,850
Because wireless is susceptible to hacking.

274
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,340
May I explain why it's susceptible to hacking?

275
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,020
It's okay. It's okay.

276
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,950
It's okay.

277
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,760
It's okay.

278
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,230
Should I connect you to Ethernet?

279
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,860
Yes.

280
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,520
By chance, should I reformat your laptop?

281
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,110
As if you're getting a fresh start?

282
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,780
Okay.

283
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,840
Then I need to take a look at your laptop, Jennie.

284
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,850
Thank you.

285
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,710
Who is she?

286
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,050
She's Ho Jin's crush.

287
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,090
Well,

288
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,210
may I explain to you Delivery King's easter egg?

289
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,240
- Yes. 
 - Well, an easter egg

290
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,180
is like a hidden message inside a game.

291
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,660
Usually, it's for entertainment, but sometimes it holds a certain meaning.

292
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,460
I already know what an easter egg is.

293
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,790
I'm asking what it is.

294
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,870
Well...

295
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,730
no one has been able to discover it so far,

296
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,810
but to tell you succinctly, it is—

297
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,020
I will explain it to you.

298
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,060
That person over there stands here every night.

299
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,340
Who is he?

300
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,840
He's Ho Jin.

301
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,160
Why is the CEO here?

302
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,260
Take a guess.

303
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,190
How would I know that?

304
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,840
- The hint is his first love. 
 - It's a one-sided crush.

305
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,960
How's that a hint? That's the answer.

306
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,240
All right. When Cha Ho Jin comes,

307
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,350
have him sit in this seat,

308
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,390
so that he can face the windows.

309
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,090
That way, we'll be here with the backlighting, giving us an air of charisma.

310
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,500
Lower his seat a little bit

311
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,220
so he has to look up at me.

312
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,670
Okay.

313
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,790
Do it while sitting down.

314
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,760
Look at me.

315
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,050
Okay.

316
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,170
You sure are a negotiation expert.

317
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,460
You're so meticulous.

318
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,990
In battle, positioning comes first.

319
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,460
Have him look up at me in an uncomfortable seat and hide my expressions.

320
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,250
He can't help but be intimidated.

321
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,280
With just this, I've won half the battle.

322
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,760
Serve iced coffee during the meeting.

323
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,210
- With lots of ice. 
 - Okay.

324
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,520
Why is that?

325
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,100
If he finishes his coffee quickly,

326
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,280
he'd feel pressured to give his answer faster.

327
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,030
Then he'll end up signing the contract right away.

328
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,700
Bring the contract.

329
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,230
Okay.

330
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,220
If you print out the contract beforehand,

331
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,290
they can't think about fixing it later.

332
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,460
People are quite predictable when it comes to input and output.

333
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,130
- They're simple. 
 - I guess so.

334
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,700
CEO Cha has arrived.

335
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,960
- Should I go down? 
 - No, no. Have him come up.

336
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,610
Your appointment has been confirmed.

337
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,780
You can take the elevator over there and go up.

338
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,660
On what floor is the Private Placement Fund?

339
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,760
They're on the 17th floor.

340
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,640
Seventeenth floor, okay. Thank you.

341
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,660
 Once he feels that not just anyone can come here, 

342
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,120
 he'll come in with less confidence. 

343
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,920
Then he'll realize he needs to stamp his seal on the contract.

344
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,810
I'll just trust you with it and leave.

345
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,060
You know you have to pull this through, right?

346
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Do I just have to play the good cop?

347
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,490
You fit the bad cop better, Theo.

348
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,500
Aigoo, CEO Cha.

349
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,360
It's nice to meet you. Welcome.

350
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,760
- Please take a seat. 
 - Hello, hello.

351
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,020
This is nothing special.

352
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,770
It's a contract for exclusive negotiation with us.

353
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,110
It's a basic thing we do before any negotiations.

354
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,840
The actual contract will be drafted up again later.

355
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
Okay.

356
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,300
- It's okay if I read this, right? 
 - Of course.

357
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,020
   

358
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,980
Well, okay.

359
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,330
So, if I sign here, I can't talk to other places?

360
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,870
Why?

361
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,270
Are you talking to other places?

362
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,780
It's not like that, but...

363
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,880
Then why are you wondering about that?

364
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,910
We're giving you money.

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,100
- Could I borrow this for a moment? 
 - Of course.

366
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,680
- Give it to me. 
 - Thank you.

367
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,020
Thank you.

368
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,150
But why are you trying to buy our game?

369
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,390
Well, why did you make the game, CEO?

370
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,040
Didn't you make it to make some money?

371
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,600
Gosh, money is great.

372
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,650
Who doesn't like money?

373
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,110
But honestly, I believe people with dreams like you

374
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,580
should be recognized, CEO. Really.

375
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,110
When can we receive the money?

376
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,510
That's not what's important right now.

377
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,670
I just don't know about this.

378
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,190
Pardon?

379
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,390
You've got no performance nor any assets.

380
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,280
Why are we trying to buy this company?

381
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,140
You offered 20 billion won first.

382
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,010
Exactly. I opposed it, saying that was ridiculous.

383
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,100
It's true your company is doomed.

384
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,840
Putting your hand over your heart,

385
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,700
could you say it's not?

386
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,400
We still have Southeast Asia and China markets.

387
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,200
The Chinese license is all blocked and selling in Southeast Asia won't make you much.

388
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,480
Then I guess I'll get going.

389
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,380
Wait, CEO. Just a moment.

390
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,090
Gosh, that's not what we meant.

391
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,410
- Excuse me. 
 - What is it?

392
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,310
A call from the US is on hold for you.

393
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,900
CEO Cha, just a moment.

394
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,340
Drink the coffee, at least. You came all this way.

395
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,930
- No, I'll be leaving. 
 - Come on.

396
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,800
I'd feel so bad.

397
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,140
Please sit. Sit for now. Drink this.

398
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,420
Bring it.

399
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,590
Please take a seat, CEO. Come on...

400
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,640
Please have some.

401
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,910
The coffee is good, right?

402
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,900
This is gesha coffee.

403
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,130
It's a top-tier coffee variety.

404
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,450
I also like it since you can only

405
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,170
purchase it through fair trade.

406
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,620
I feel

407
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,640
Cha Cha is just like this coffee.

408
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,130
Okay.

409
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,230
But honestly,

410
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,760
I came here because of 20 billion won.

411
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
Well,

412
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,470
i-it's not 20 billion won.

413
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,200
We

414
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,230
offered

415
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,600
to double Sanin's amount.

416
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,850
Yes, that's why it's 20 billion won.

417
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,440
CEO Cha,

418
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,860
you need to understand us a bit,

419
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,580
but

420
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,660
who did you meet from Sanin?

421
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,770
Team Leader Yun Ju No.

422
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,670
I knew it!

423
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,180
Mr. Yun said he'd give you 10 billion won, right?

424
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,490
That's a lie.

425
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,400
He'd never give you 10 billion won.

426
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,490
He's infamous in our business

427
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,910
as a scammer.

428
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,570
His initial offer was 10 billion won, right?

429
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,180
The best you'll get from him is one billion won.

430
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,180
It was with

431
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,330
an understanding of that process

432
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,840
that we offered

433
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,570
to double Sanin's amount.

434
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,320
Then you'll pay us two billion won?

435
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,280
Gosh, this is upsetting.

436
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,120
We're not low lives like that!

437
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,050
If you decide before Mr. Song comes back,

438
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,900
I'll give you 2.1 billion won.

439
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,460
2.1...

440
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,280
2.1 billion won?

441
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,510
No, I'm here

442
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,020
because I was offered 20 billion.

443
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,810
Gosh, seriously.

444
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,240
I just explained everything to you.

445
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,900
What can we do if you don't understand that?

446
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,170
No one in Korea will give you that original offer.

447
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,250
Ask around. It's all decided through negotiations.

448
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,280
I won't sign the contract.

449
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,260
Why?

450
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,640
Will you go to Yun Ju No?

451
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,540
People will hear about our breakdown in negotiation.

452
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,640
Everyone will hear how stubborn

453
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,050
and difficult you are.

454
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,620
Yun Ju No wouldn't buy it either.

455
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,220
Even if he does,

456
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,420
he'd never give you one billion.

457
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,460
At best,

458
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,030
you'll get maybe 200 or 300 million won.

459
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,270
If you're unsure, you don't have to sign with us.

460
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,240
But I

461
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
guarantee that

462
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,770
our offer is the best in the industry.

463
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,190
If it's not, I'll take responsibility.

464
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,090
To be blunt,

465
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,410
if you stamp your seal while we're alone,

466
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,790
Mr. Song can't do anything about it.

467
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,970
Then...

468
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,610
are you saying I should stamp my seal now?

469
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,280
Yes.

470
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,100
Okay, okay. If you don't want to, I'll just—

471
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,970
No, no. Wait, wait.

472
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,710
J-Just give me a moment.

473
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,460
 ­ 

474
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,040
 I can see why CEO Cha 

475
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,450
has such an attachment to Delivery King.

476
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,840
Delivery King is his letter to his first love.

477
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,720
That's why Ho Jin can't fall for any other girl.

478
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,030
I suppose so.

479
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,630
Now, it's starting to make sense.

480
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,220
At first, I wondered why

481
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,550
he poured so much into this game.

482
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,770
Honestly, the game sucked rather badly.

483
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,830
I told you the game sucked.

484
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,680
Our next game has to be a hit.

485
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,960
Yes,

486
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,900
he'll be back after signing the contract,

487
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,790
so let's make it big this time.

488
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,010
CEO went to sign the contract, right?

489
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,400
Yes.

490
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,690
With Sanin?

491
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,720
No.

492
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,230
It was some foreign-sounding fund.

493
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,750
The Private Placement Fund?

494
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,610
That's right. There.

495
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,870
Call him and tell him to come back quickly.

496
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,060
Why?

497
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,930
We need the funds quickly to start the next project.

498
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,570
They have a bad reputation.

499
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,610
Then

500
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,370
tell him to bring the contract with him.

501
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,410
I'll be going home first.

502
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,520
You can't.

503
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,570
We should have a team dinner since you're new.

504
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,780
I really have plans.

505
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,110
Hurry and call CEO Cha,

506
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,340
and tell him to come back, okay?

507
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,600
Oh, okay, okay. By the way...

508
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,170
i-if it's because

509
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,570
you don't like the hyeongs,

510
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,900
we can eat by ourselves.

511
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,170
Oh, right.

512
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,310
I like girls.

513
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,690
Seriously...

514
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,810
Hey,

515
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,230
let's meet up.

516
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,420
 I'm really disappointed in you. 

517
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,740
Let's talk when we meet.

518
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,510
Admiral Yi,

519
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,240
would it be okay if I cut my friend's throat?

520
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,120
Why did you have to call me to come here?

521
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,870
I said we should meet in the middle.

522
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
What's this?

523
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

524
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,700
What?

525
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,340
Me?

526
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,210
How did I look at you?

527
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,020
Forget it.

528
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,980
Just buy me coffee.

529
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,480
Okay.

530
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,250
Did you doubt me?

531
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,120
No,

532
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,100
of course, I trusted you.

533
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,400
Sure you did.

534
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,120
But does Cha Cha have that much potential

535
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,930
for you to quit your current job?

536
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,260
Yes.

537
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,280
They definitely have development skills.

538
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,830
With proper management support,

539
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,580
they could be successful.

540
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,480
Really?

541
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,590
Yes.

542
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,100
They also have planning issues.

543
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,010
But the guys there were a bit weird.

544
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,120
They seemed like total nerds.

545
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,700
Yes, they're weird.

546
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,280
But in another sense, they seem pretty innocent.

547
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,180
Aren't they a bit different from being innocent?

548
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,570
You don't know the easter egg in Delivery King, right?

549
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,170
 CEO Cha Ho Jin 

550
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,550
 had a close neighborhood friend from childhood. 

551
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,450
 And? 

552
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,670
 He has liked her since they were little. 

553
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,600
 A girl? Is she pretty? 

554
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,010
 Gosh, 

555
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,030
 do you like anyone who's pretty? 

556
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,000
 Guys like her more if she's pretty. 

557
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,710
In any case,

558
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,760
he never told her how he felt

559
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,680
and just kept hanging around her.

560
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,270
You know what I mean, right?

561
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,160
Yes, I know.

562
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,050
But what does that have to do with the game?

563
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,880
Keep listening.

564
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,710
Sit.

565
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,100
Okay.

566
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,180
So

567
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,720
when Cha Ho Jin and Do Han Cheol

568
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,330
first started making games,

569
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,860
they needed someone to sing an OST for them.

570
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,650
Since they had no money, they called a friend.

571
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,030
And he called that girl.

572
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
She wasn't a girl then. She was in her early twenties.

573
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,210
That first love?

574
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,390
What's her name?

575
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,850
Su Yeon. Oh Su Yeon.

576
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,090
She was a good singer too.

577
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,350
Is that good singing?

578
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,160
I liked it.

579
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,880
Wow,

580
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,160
you've got terrible ears.

581
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,720
Listen.

582
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,900
 Can you hear me? 

583
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,970
 Y-Yes. 

584
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,100
 - Han Cheol. 
 - Yes? 

585
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,170
 We're all ready. 

586
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,040
 Okay. 

587
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,570
 Start singing when I give you the signal, okay? 

588
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,370
 How will you give the signal? 

589
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,710
 With my eyes. You'll know when you see it. 

590
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,410
 - Ho Jin, are you ready? 
 - Yes. 

591
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,970
 Okay. Go. 

592
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,630
 Where do you live? I'll give you a ride. 

593
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,810
 It's okay. I like walking. 

594
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,890
 I'll drive you home. It's dangerous for a girl. 

595
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,120
 I like walking along Bulgwangcheon. 

596
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,380
 I walk there often, so it's okay. 

597
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,190
 You live in Mangwon-dong. 

598
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,600
 Let's go together. I can also walk. 

599
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,700
 I like walking alone while listening to music. 

600
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,740
 You mean that, right? 

601
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,010
 It's not because you don't want to go with me, right? 

602
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,700
 Pardon? 

603
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,600
 - If it's because you like walking— 
 - Yes. 

604
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,550
 Okay. I'll respect your preferences. 

605
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,810
 Ho Jin. 

606
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,020
 I'll be going. 

607
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,190
 Oh, okay. Thanks for your help. 

608
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,120
 Ho Jin, just a moment. 

609
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,830
 One moment. 

610
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,510
 Hey, w-what is it? 

611
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,480
 Could you give me the recording you made earlier? 

612
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,050
 Oh, that? I-It will be released as a track. 

613
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,510
 Oh, I-I just wanted to listen to it beforehand. 

614
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,470
 You can give it to me, right? 

615
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,900
 Yes. 

616
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,640
 You looked different 

617
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,900
 when I saw you at work. 

618
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,420
 I used to think 

619
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,880
 you were pathetic for always playing games. 

620
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,390
 Why do you like games? 

621
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,960
 Because it's okay to fail. 

622
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,740
 You can start over, even if you fail in games. 

623
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,150
 That's an unexpected response. 

624
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,110
 The streetlight in front of my house died too. 

625
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,430
 Why isn't anyone fixing it? 

626
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,530
 The lifespan of a light bulb is about 1,000 hours. 

627
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,100
 If it's on for 10 hours a day, 

628
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,430
 its lifespan is only 100 days. 

629
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,660
 The city workers change it every three months. 

630
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,230
 So you just need to wait 

631
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,550
 a maximum of 90 days. 

632
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,450
 "The lifespan of a streetlight is 100 days"? 

633
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,410
 That's like dating. 

634
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,650
 - Dating? 
 - Yes. 

635
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,500
 They say after 100 days, your romantic feelings disappear. 

636
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,530
 - Is that true for you, too? 
 - What? 

637
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,530
 No. 

638
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,340
 I'm n-not like that. 

639
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,250
 You aren't? 

640
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,740
 You want to walk alone now, right? 

641
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,090
 What? 

642
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,470
 You like walking alone here at Bulgwangcheon. 

643
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,680
 I already know all about it. 

644
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,560
 But the streetlight in front of my house died, 

645
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,200
 so I'm a bit scared. 

646
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,290
 Okay, I got it. 

647
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,550
 What? 

648
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,770
 I'll be going. Get home safely. 

649
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,350
 Hey. 

650
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,630
 Hey! 

651
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,510
 Don't you hear that you're bad at reading the room? 

652
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,220
 No, I'm really good at reading the room. 

653
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,800
 Goodbye... 

654
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,590
 you dummy. 

655
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,640
 The bus will be arriving shortly. 

656
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,750
 Why didn't he walk her home? 

657
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,600
Why didn't he walk her home?

658
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,300
You said he liked Su Yeon.

659
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,620
She never asked him to walk her home.

660
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,460
What are you saying?

661
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,490
Su Yeon asked him to walk her home.

662
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,880
When? Did she?

663
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,030
I mean,

664
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,530
she said the streetlight in front of her house died,

665
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,980
so she was scared.

666
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,930
Oh, yes, she did say that.

667
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,810
But she didn't ask him to walk her home.

668
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,190
Gosh, what's with these guys!

669
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,900
Also,

670
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,230
Ho Jin confessed to her, but Su Yeon rejected him.

671
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,930
What did he say? When?

672
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,270
Asking her to sing the OST is his confession.

673
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,600
Su Yeon isn't even a good singer.

674
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,730
When Su Yeon wanted to walk in Bulgwangcheon alone,

675
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,470
Ho Jin quickly left her alone.

676
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,810
That's his second confession.

677
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,850
This is driving me crazy.

678
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,320
Aren't they crazy?

679
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,220
Am I the weird one?

680
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,830
No, they are. They're the weird ones.

681
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,510
Right?

682
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,380
When I was there, I felt like I was the weird one.

683
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,270
Could one interpret it like that?

684
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,230
Hey, do you know about a developer's humor?

685
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,400
You told a developer to buy three apples at a market

686
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,280
and if there's a watermelon, buy one.

687
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,430
What do you think the developer did?

688
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,490
Normal people would buy three apples and one watermelon.

689
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,010
If there are no watermelons, just three apples.

690
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,450
No.

691
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,880
You shouldn't decide that by yourself.

692
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,310
First, you should buy three apples and if there are no watermelons,

693
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,770
you should call your wife.

694
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,500
"Hello? I'm at the market and bought the apples,"

695
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,200
"but no watermelons. I'll go to another market."

696
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,860
"Okay."

697
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,120
You should get a confirmation like this.

698
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,030
The supermarket had watermelons.

699
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,330
So what do you think the developer did?

700
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
You probably gave this quiz

701
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,150
since the answer isn't three apples

702
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,460
and one watermelon.

703
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,100
Did he just buy three apples

704
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,200
and forget the watermelon?

705
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,250
- No. 
 - Sun Yeong!

706
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,950
One apple and three watermelons due to an error.

707
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,660
- Incorrect. 
 - Damn it!

708
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,840
What about you, Mr. Yun?

709
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,560
One apple?

710
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,110
How could it be one apple?

711
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,890
How did you know?

712
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,110
I just took a guess.

713
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,930
Yes, one apple is the answer.

714
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,340
"Buy three apples."

715
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,370
"If there are watermelons, buy one."

716
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,690
If the market has watermelons,

717
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,300
then...

718
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,960
it'd be one apple.

719
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,920
That's why he bought one apple.

720
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,750
Are you serious?

721
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,500
Developers really think this way?

722
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,480
No wonder they were a bit unique.

723
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,890
They call this developer humor,

724
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,060
but honestly, I don't think this is humor.

725
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,710
So because Su Yeon said she liked walking alone,

726
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,550
- he didn't walk her home that night? 
 - Yes.

727
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,290
What about the streetlight?

728
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,100
Since Oh Su Yeon would be scared

729
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,590
if the streetlight was off,

730
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,650
Ho Jin lit up that alleyway.

731
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,070
Even to this day.

732
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,060
Even to this day?

733
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,750
I will show it on the screen.

734
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,900
From that day on,

735
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,570
Ho Jin actually hung a lantern there every night.

736
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,700
He did what every night?

737
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,610
He hung a lantern on the dead streetlight at night

738
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,690
and took it away early the next morning.

739
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,880
For real?

740
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,110
Yes. He did that for 100 days.

741
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,730
Does 100 days signify the lifespan of a light bulb?

742
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,430
There's that, but that's when

743
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,050
she began dating Do Han Cheol.

744
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,610
Who?

745
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,240
Oh Su Yeon?

746
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,310
Yes.

747
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,080
How did that happen?

748
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,830
I don't know about that.

749
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,510
 Hyeong, I'll go out for a bit. 

750
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,880
 Okay. 

751
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:21,280
  ­ 

752
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,470
 This is Han Cheol. 

753
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,220
 The OST track came out. 

754
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,420
 I brought it on a USB. 

755
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,840
 I came by myself. 

756
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,340
 Oh, yes. 

757
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:10,340
 But Ho Jin told me to make sure it plays. 

758
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,200
 Okay. 

759
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,280
 You came all the way here to give this to me? 

760
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,640
 But I need to check if this plays or not. 

761
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,110
 Should I go and check? 

762
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,980
 Do you know how to use this? 

763
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,820
This also seems to be why Cha Ho Jin left DC.

764
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,490
So that's really Oh Su Yeon's house, right?

765
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:47,510
Yes. This easter egg is essentially his love confession to Su Yeon.

766
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,450
This is it, right?

767
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,900
Yes.

768
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:19,010
It really looks so similar.

769
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,050
She's probably not still living here, right?

770
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,060
Who are you?

771
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,670
   

772
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,440
Are you really from Sanin?

773
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,460
Yes, we're the M&amp;A Team.

774
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,760
We had something to investigate here.

775
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,330
I thought you were real estate agents.

776
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:49,210
I put my house up for sale because game nerds sometimes come by.

777
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,860
Game nerds?

778
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,420
Nerds who are obsessed with games.

779
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,520
I know that.

780
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
They said something about an easter egg.

781
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,080
In any case, game nerds kept coming here

782
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,790
saying something about a pilgrimage or whatnot.

783
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,330
It won't be a problem anymore.

784
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,710
That game shut down.

785
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,580
High Square shut down?

786
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,150
Gosh, that's not good!

787
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,450
High Square?

788
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,330
It's not Delivery King?

789
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,890
Delivery King? What's that?

790
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,090
   

791
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,350
The name of this building is High Square.

792
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,600
I heard it's because the building is on a high place.

793
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,660
There's even a game called High Square by DC.

794
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,600
I heard they used this building as a motif.

795
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,790
How did you know that?

796
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,110
The easter egg.

797
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,120
Didn't you come here after seeing that?

798
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,900
You mean High Square's easter egg, right?

799
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,840
Yes.

800
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,770
Is there anything else besides that?

801
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,240
There's a game called Delivery King.

802
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,050
That also uses this place as a motif.

803
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,040
What? There's another one?

804
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,790
Gosh, who's the jerk who made these games!

805
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,370
I see High Square also used this place as a motif.

806
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,340
And that tree must be a cherry blossom tree.

807
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,020
Yes, it's really pretty in spring.

808
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,700
 High Square. 

809
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,860
 It's DC's killer content. 

810
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,760
 Its plot is quite simple. 

811
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,780
 A knight lives in a village called Buddha's Light. 

812
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,960
 The reason for its name Buddha's Light will be revealed in the second half of this video. 

813
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,630
 So a monster kidnaps the princess of this village. 

814
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,370
 She's locked up at the top of a castle. 

815
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,720
 The knight enters the castle to save the princess, 

816
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,170
 kills all the monsters on his way to the top, 

817
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,340
 and saves the princess. 

818
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,800
 Actually, the plot is quite cliche. 

819
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,380
 But the game is super fun. 

820
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,950
 Simple is the best. 

821
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,150
 It's the truth. 

822
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,980
 But did you know an easter egg is hidden in High Square? 

823
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,550
 Look at the character in front of the unlit lamp. 

824
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,490
 Before this character enters the castle, 

825
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,800
 if you look over here, only this lamp is put out. 

826
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,110
 If you go closer, there's a prompt to write something. 

827
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,770
 If you write "light on" here... 

828
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,960
 Ta-da! 

829
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,730
 They give you an oil lamp. 

830
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,020
 The name of this oil lamp is called Buddha's Light. 

831
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,450
 Now you know why the village's name was Buddha's Light. 

832
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,340
 So what do you do with this oil lamp? 

833
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,240
 When you light this lamp, the BGM changes. 

834
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,230
 Do you hear the humming? 

835
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,770
 You can hear this song. 

836
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,170
 Apart from that, there's no practical use for it. 

837
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,710
 But it's pretty cool. 

838
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,300
Developers hide their traces in easter eggs.

839
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,100
Yes. They do that for fun or if there is some meaning,

840
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,520
but they often hide their traces there.

841
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,530
Doesn't the fact that Cha Ho Jin's easter egg was

842
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,770
hidden in High Square mean he was its developer?

843
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,890
You're right.

844
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,440
But that rooftop house is also special to DC's Do Han Cheol.

845
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,780
He dated Oh Su Yeon, who lived there, you know.

846
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:14,370
But Do Han Cheol didn't know Cha Ho Jin held a lantern outside the window.

847
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:20,190
Even if he knew, Cha Ho Jin was the one who held the lantern.

848
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,210
Yes.

849
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,320
The Delivery King standing with a lantern

850
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,040
and the knight lighting the lamp in High Square

851
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,360
both seem to be Cha Ho Jin himself.

852
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,700
Then Do Han Cheol copied that without knowing.

853
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,840
It's like copying even the spelling errors while plagiarizing.

854
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,980
You said no traces of hacking was found in Cha Ho Jin's program, right?

855
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,460
You're right.

856
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:52,360
It was possible to know through its blockchain, but there were none.

857
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,450
Gosh, you scared me.

858
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,980
He didn't hack it, but the easter egg is still there,

859
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,900
so he didn't copy or hack the program.

860
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,890
He literally stole the entire hard drive.

861
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:09,540
There was a reason Cha Ho Jin sued for theft rather than plagiarism.

862
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,560
 The village name in High Square, Buddha's Light, must mean here. 

863
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,050
"Bulgwang," meaning Buddha's light.

864
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,580
Oh, is that what that means?

865
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,900
Yes. "Bul" for Buddha, and "Gwang" for light.

866
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,200
And Oh Su Yeon liked walking around Bulgwangcheon.

867
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,190
I can see why Cha Ho Jin doesn't want to pivot now.

868
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,610
The High Square he created while longing for his first love was stolen,

869
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,430
and Delivery King was a failure.

870
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,650
The girl in the photo on CEO Cha's desk

871
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,600
and the High Square princess seems to be the same person.

872
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,440
Hyeongnims, do you see how cool this restaurant is?

873
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,100
From what I can tell, this place is at least 30 years old.

874
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,910
Wow. This place is for real. It's for real.

875
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,260
Do you see these starch toothpicks?

876
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,870
Such minor details set the mood to make a great restaurant.

877
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,200
You know what I mean, right?

878
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,280
All right, I'll be eating... jang kalguksu today.

879
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,710
I'll give it a try. Oh, it's okay.

880
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,070
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

881
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,150
We don't allow things like this.

882
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,900
Hyeongnims, just a moment.

883
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,030
- Are you the owner here? 
 - Yes.

884
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,580
It's not a big deal.

885
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,100
I heard your kalguksu is so good.

886
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,400
I wanted to promote your restaurant.

887
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,500
I'm just filming myself.

888
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,750
If you look at the live stream, more than 10,000 people are watching.

889
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,460
I don't care if 10,000 people are watching.

890
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,860
We don't allow things like this.

891
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,030
You don't?

892
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,150
Yes. I won't charge you for this.

893
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,560
Just leave.

894
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,900
Okay, I'll leave.

895
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,170
Hyeongnims, let's leave.

896
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,440
We'll be leaving.

897
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,730
They don't allow it.

898
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,230
I came here when I heard their food is good.

899
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,950
But they're very unfriendly, everyone.

900
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,200
If you ask me where in the comments, I'll tell you.

901
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,100
Don't come here.

902
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,400
Ma'am, people like him are like TV stations these days.

903
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,920
It'd be a boost to your business.

904
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,200
- I still don't like it. 
 - Welcome.

905
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,790
You run a business.

906
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,350
He says he'll help you sell, but you can't let that go?

907
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,740
Just eat your kalguksu.

908
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,600
Aigoo, goodness.

909
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,720
How is she supposed to know how quickly the world is changing?

910
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,280
She says to just eat kalguksu, so let's eat.

911
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
That livestream would've really helped her.

912
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,710
Geez, how frustrating.

913
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:53,280
By chance, do you still not like e-commerce?

914
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,600
Is it making some profit?

915
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,270
Some places started making money,

916
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,490
and others haven't yet.

917
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,950
Aigoo, then forget it.

918
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,670
Listen up.

919
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,660
Those companies will collapse one day.

920
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,430
Just watch.

921
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,000
Bye.

922
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,280
I'll see you.

923
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,950
Congratulations.

924
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,520
I heard you received a better offer.

925
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,670
Well, yes.

926
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:13,070
We did.

927
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,580
Delivery King was fun...

928
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,710
So I can't play it anymore?

929
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,940
I hear people in your field see everything as money.

930
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,010
Why do you think that?

931
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,980
To be honest, I signed with Private Placement Fund.

932
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,750
Did you receive double from Private Placement?

933
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,150
Did you really play Delivery King?

934
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,500
Do you see my ID?

935
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,100
White Snake.

936
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,340
White Snake? Oh.

937
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,830
I'm playing High Square now.

938
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,510
I didn't get to beat the whole game yet,

939
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,640
but I made it up to where I found the easter egg.

940
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,410
That's why I came to see you today, CEO Cha.

941
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:13,860
If I were in your shoes, I wondered if I could've done the same.

942
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,570
The game you devoted your life to was stolen

943
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:23,690
and became a hit in the hands of the man who stole your first love.

944
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,670
And he's still getting in the way of my dream.

945
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:33,870
You said you liked games because you could keep trying, right?

946
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,940
But not everyone can keep trying.

947
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,300
Oh, well, I just...

948
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,070
I just did.

949
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,350
I don't think I could've done so.

950
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,710
I'm sorry.

951
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,940
About what?

952
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,250
Well, I just am.

953
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,010
I ghosted you.

954
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,290
It's okay.

955
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,640
And signing with Private Placement Fund.

956
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,730
That does hurt a bit.

957
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,110
But still,

958
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,150
that must've been the best decision for you, CEO.

959
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,360
Okay, then.

960
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,660
By chance,

961
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,600
is it possible to back out of the contract?

962
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,110
If you signed it...

963
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,630
There's probably a breach of contract clause.

964
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,810
I don't think Cha Cha could afford to pay the fee.

965
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,330
No.

966
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,110
I don't know what contract you signed with Private Placement,

967
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,740
but I hope you keep making games.

968
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,300
I like your games, CEO.

969
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,800
They're fun.

970
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,670
I'll look forward to it.

971
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:14,470
Is there a way to help Cha Cha Games?

972
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,830
I feel bad after hearing their story.

973
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,490
Indeed.

974
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,260
Can't Mr. Yun meet with CEO Cha?

975
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,620
Maybe?

976
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,060
As long as he didn't sign the contract, there should be a way.

977
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,310
Right?

978
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,090
 CEO Cha signed the contract for 2.1 billion. 

979
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,700
 This is so frustrating. 

980
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,260
Cha Cha...

981
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,890
signed with someone else.

982
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,270
I'm sorry.

983
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,050
With whom?

984
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,060
But why are you sorry, Jin Su?

985
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,250
 Even you lose, Yun Ju No. 

986
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,890
Yes, it turned out that way.

987
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,190
 I'll explain it to the chairman. 

988
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,070
No, I didn't give up yet.

989
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,550
 As you well know, 

990
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,750
 if it doesn't work, reporting it quickly 

991
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,730
 will make it easier to salvage. 

992
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,570
Do you think it's salvageable?

993
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,930
 Sure. 

994
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,440
 If it's not salvageable, 

995
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
 you should try everything you can. 

996
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,720
Yes. I'll call you again.

997
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,900
Mr. Yun.

998
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,860
I have something to tell you.

999
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,240
Okay, please take a seat.

1000
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,720
Actually,

1001
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,230
when you told me to play Delivery King to the end,

1002
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,760
I thought you intentionally said that

1003
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,050
because I opposed acquiring Delivery King.

1004
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,920
So I wasn't able to...

1005
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,980
I didn't finish it.

1006
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,790
I guess you could've interpreted it that way.

1007
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:14,140
If I had played it to the end, as you said

1008
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,710
and saw the ending cut scene,

1009
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,600
we could've persuaded Cha Cha.

1010
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,940
I'm sorry.

1011
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,030
Cha Cha Games received

1012
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,700
a better offer than Sanin's, anyway.

1013
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,500
It would've been tough

1014
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,310
to get the contract from the start,

1015
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,790
so don't be too disappointed.

1016
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,730
Mr. Yun, Cha Cha Games

1017
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,010
was sold to the Private Placement Fund.

1018
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,470
I already know.

1019
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,240
How did you know?

1020
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,140
I met CEO Cha last night.

1021
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,260
I heard it from him then.

1022
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,330
How much did he sell it for?

1023
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,450
2.1 billion won.

1024
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,680
They got played.

1025
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:11,500
I'm sorry.

1026
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,260
No. This isn't over yet.

1027
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,970
Private Placement Fund will be calling soon

1028
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,210
since they need to resell it to us.

1029
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:22,730
How did you know Cha Cha was sold, Jin Su?

1030
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,080
Pardon?

1031
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,780
Jennie told me.

1032
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:32,800
I was wondering who was leaking our information.

1033
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,660
Oh, no, Jennie isn't like that.

1034
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,660
She's nicer than you think.

1035
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,100
 I'm asking what your M&amp;A Team is working on. 

1036
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,090
 Trying to buy the company that made this game. 

1037
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,930
 Why would you buy that? 

1038
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,370
That jerk!

1039
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,870
Mr. Yun, Deputy Im is the culprit.

1040
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,400
Who is he?

1041
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,090
He thinks others are purely bad

1042
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,840
and thinks he's good in a complicated way.

1043
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,210
He's a seonbae from my university.

1044
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,800
He asked me what our team was up to,

1045
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,600
and I told him we were trying to buy Cha Cha Games.

1046
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,950
Jin Su, listen carefully.

1047
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:37,490
Aigoo, that jerk is in trouble again.

1048
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,360
It'll be a tough period for you.

1049
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,730
What's wrong?

1050
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,380
Did you get in trouble again?

1051
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,160
I didn't get in trouble.

1052
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,370
Mr. Yun says he's giving up.

1053
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:03,280
- Giving up what? 
 - Cha Cha Games.

1054
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,440
He's giving up on acquiring it.

1055
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,980
W-Well, d-did another place buy it?

1056
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,890
Then he could just buy it from them.

1057
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,420
Your team leader is rather good at that.

1058
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,410
It's not like he's spending his own money.

1059
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,040
Mr. Yun says

1060
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,620
he'll completely give up on e-commerce.

1061
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,670
Really?

1062
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,870
Yes.

1063
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,250
He says he's giving up on everything.

1064
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,160
Let's try to deal with Cha Cha Games again.

1065
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,570
How?

1066
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:44,230
First, we'll check if Cha Cha Games is willing.

1067
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,870
You were in the middle of eating.

1068
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,560
Hello.

1069
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,530
Hello.

1070
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,610
Excuse me.

1071
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,080
- CEO. 
 - Yes?

1072
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,100
Don't you want to make games again?

1073
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,480
How?

1074
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,320
CEO Cha will accept our offer

1075
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,770
as long as he can keep making games.

1076
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:23,520
Since games mean a lot to Cha Ho Jin.

1077
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,970
Because it's his love.

1078
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,910
I also agree with that,

1079
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:31,330
but how about the contract he signed?

1080
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,620
 Well, then, 

1081
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,720
 if he's completely giving up on e-commerce, 

1082
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,580
 he won't need Cha Cha Games either, right? 

1083
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,950
 Of course. 

1084
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,140
 Who would buy a failed game? 

1085
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,450
 Yes, yes, right. 

1086
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,730
 W-Well, I'll be going. 

1087
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,300
 Seonbae. 

1088
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,030
 It's that way. 

1089
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,380
 I-I was going to take the long way around. 

1090
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,610
   

1091
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,440
 Really? 

1092
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,710
Yes, I heard it from the youngest on that team.

1093
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,110
He will give up on e-commerce entirely.

1094
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,560
 Are you sure he's not faking us out? 

1095
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,430
No, I don't think this is fake.

1096
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:40,660
 How do you know that? 

1097
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,590
Director, do you do social media by chance?

1098
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,160
Oh, okay. I'll send you something right now.

1099
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,250
Then offer to sell it

1100
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,380
to Yun Ju No for 10 billion.

1101
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,920
He was going to buy it for 10 billion won anyway.

1102
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,410
 Me? 

1103
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:03,430
It's not like I can call Mr. Yun about this.

1104
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,560
I'm sorry.

1105
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,530
- Hello? 
  - Mr. Yun. 

1106
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,990
 This is David from the Private Placement Fund. 

1107
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,260
Yes, hello.

1108
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,100
 I'll cut to the chase. 

1109
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,620
 You were interested in game companies lately. 

1110
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,890
 There's a decent company for sale 

1111
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,300
 so I thought I'd introduce you. 

1112
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,270
Sounds good. Which company?

1113
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:31,170
 Well, this is off-the-record, but... 

1114
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,470
If it's Cha Cha Games, I'm not interested.

1115
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,010
Let me know if it's a different company.

1116
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,040
Are you not interested in Cha Cha Games?

1117
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,340
No.

1118
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,280
We also looked into it,

1119
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,560
but they're not worth it.

1120
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,010
There are plenty of great companies.

1121
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:49,000
There's no reason to pick them.

1122
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,810
 Are you referring to DC? 

1123
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,820
No comment.

1124
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,240
 All right. 

1125
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,090
Have a good day.

1126
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
 Guys, let's go. 

1127
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,810
Thank you! Seriously...

1128
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:21,370
Thank you!

1129
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,720
Then...

1130
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,350
Sanin will give us 10 billion won, right?

1131
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,430
Oh, no.

1132
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,050
Based on a post-money valuation of 10 billion,

1133
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,780
we will invest 3 billion.

1134
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,870
Pardon?

1135
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:35,990
Wait, what is this White Snake saying?

1136
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,670
Cha Cha Games was already sold

1137
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,740
to Private Placement for 2.1 billion.

1138
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,560
If I say Sanin will acquire it for 10 billion won,

1139
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,300
the executives will surely be suspicious of me.

1140
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,190
And it most definitely will not get approved.

1141
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,640
Hey, you said you'd give us 10 billion won.

1142
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,070
You said you'll let us make games.

1143
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,980
Yes, I'll help you do that.

1144
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,690
You just said you'll only give us 3 billion!

1145
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,850
So...

1146
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,480
I'll get you the money

1147
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,850
for making games from someone else.

1148
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,470
From whom?

1149
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,670
Hello.

1150
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,060
- The car keys are inside. 
 - Okay.

1151
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,710
I'll park it for you.

1152
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,850
- It's here. 
 - Yes.

1153
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,970
CEO Do Han Cheol.

1154
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,650
Congratulations on your wedding.

1155
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,490
If it's okay with you, could we talk for a moment?

1156
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:37,130
Who are you?

1157
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,730
I'm Attorney Oh Sun Yeong, the legal representative

1158
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,470
handling the Cha Cha Games' lawsuit.

1159
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,460
You acknowledge that the two games having the

1160
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,680
same easter egg can prove that the developer

1161
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,530
is the same person, right?

1162
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,940
Are you recording me right now?

1163
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,150
Pardon?

1164
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,490
No.

1165
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,910
I was curious about your opinion as a developer.

1166
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,700
Well, yes, I can acknowledge that.

1167
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,750
But my acknowledgment isn't important.

1168
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,090
The judge needs to acknowledge that.

1169
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,760
Exactly.

1170
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,710
But judges are so busy with just their work

1171
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,230
that they probably didn't have any time for games.

1172
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,570
And they probably never played games growing up

1173
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:26,530
because they were so busy studying.

1174
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:29,900
They probably were like, "What is an easter egg?"

1175
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,970
Thanks to that, you won the first trial, right?

1176
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,670
What are you trying to say?

1177
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:36,980
But you know...

1178
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,400
This is crazy.

1179
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,920
I applied for a retrial,

1180
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,990
and the assigned judge was Judge Jo Yong Hun.

1181
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,470
Look him up.

1182
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,410
Judge Jo Yong Hun.

1183
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,880
He was a StarCraft-ranked player.

1184
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,380
Maybe that's why he made the ruling

1185
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,280
in the eSports match-fixing case last time.

1186
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,080
So

1187
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,650
I think he might be very interested in our case.

1188
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,390
Actually, he played StarCraft with me a lot.

1189
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,670
He wouldn't even make

1190
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,600
attacking units in the beginning.

1191
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,110
He used a building focusing on securing resources

1192
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,650
by building a second base at the front.

1193
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,190
Ranked players are truly different.

1194
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:27,170
But if it's Yong Hun—

1195
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,060
No, I mean...

1196
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,400
Judge Jo Yong Hun,

1197
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,010
don't you think the second trial result will be different?

1198
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,140
Do you have something in mind that you want?

1199
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,230
A settlement.

1200
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,880
And the conditions?

1201
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,560
Ten billion won in settlement

1202
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,280
and a 10% stake in High Square.

1203
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,440
The 10 billion won is fine,

1204
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,550
but a 10% stake is ridiculous.

1205
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,850
When I first went to Cha Cha Games,

1206
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,830
I saw that they set up a CCTV facing the walls.

1207
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,310
I found it...

1208
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,260
odd, but I understand it now.

1209
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,150
Did you do it yourself?

1210
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,340
- Do what? 
 - You knew CEO Cha

1211
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,980
could use blockchain to find out

1212
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,740
everyone who accessed his program.

1213
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,680
So you couldn't have hacked it.

1214
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,340
That's why you personally jumped the wall

1215
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:30,530
to steal the actual hard drive, right, CEO?

1216
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,610
Do you have evidence?

1217
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,660
I mean, one developer made that game,

1218
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,480
but it was moved without any trace of hacking.

1219
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,960
If so,

1220
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,610
the only explanation is you breaking in to steal it.

1221
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,080
With your reputation,

1222
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,640
if anyone at DC knew about this,

1223
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,860
they'd have spoken up about it.

1224
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,800
But nobody did.

1225
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,580
Do you think that can act as evidence?

1226
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,460
Yong Hun really likes this kind of stuff.

1227
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,300
This would be special theft, you know.

1228
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,170
For special theft, you get 1 to 10 years in prison.

1229
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,110
It's an aggravated punishment.

1230
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,590
That means you'll have to serve at least one year—

1231
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,530
Smile, smile. Smile.

1232
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,880
You'll have to serve at least one year...

1233
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,220
CEO,

1234
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,620
I think you may have to

1235
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,750
postpone your wedding.

1236
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,320
10%...

1237
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,730
Okay.

1238
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,420
All right, I get it.

1239
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,850
Now, get lost.

1240
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,830
Thank you very much.

1241
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,630
Oh, CEO.

1242
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,200
Hearing you tell me to get lost reminds me.

1243
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,650
I'm going to add a special clause.

1244
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,680
Whenever Cha Cha Games announces a new game,

1245
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,880
DC will not launch any new games

1246
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,740
or hold any events and just get lost.

1247
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,320
You've already released an article saying you made peace with Cha Cha.

1248
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:18,110
Congratulations on your wedding.

1249
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,870
Congratulations.

1250
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,310
Okay. Goodbye.

1251
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,890
He's leaving.

1252
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,440
- Get home safely. Okay. 
 - Okay.

1253
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,270
I just need the chairman's confirmation now.

1254
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,680
Didn't the chairman give it already?

1255
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,620
Yes. Well, no.

1256
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:01,000
I need to go get it now.

1257
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,580
Should we eat some ice cream?

1258
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,760
What ice cream?

1259
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,150
I tried it in the mountains with the Chairman.

1260
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:12,530
- Here. 
 - Not this one.

1261
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,600
Get something else.

1262
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,110
This was on sale up until yesterday.

1263
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,560
It's good. I'm telling you.

1264
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,640
It feels like we're losing out then.

1265
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,200
It'll be on sale again next time.

1266
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,990
Let's eat it then, okay?

1267
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,060
 Yes, Mr. Yun. 

1268
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,770
 I think I misunderstood the chairman. 

1269
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,970
 I thought the chairman opposed e-commerce 

1270
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,600
 because of the risks and 

1271
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,660
 that he didn't understand the industry. 

1272
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,390
 That may have been the case back then, 

1273
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:55,450
 but I don't think that's the reason now. 

1274
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:02,750
 I think he regrets his choice from back then. 

1275
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,600
 Are you saying he thinks he should've 

1276
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,190
 bought Collection but missed his chance? 

1277
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,840
 Yes. 

1278
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,170
 He had a chance to buy it for 10 billion won. 

1279
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:19,440
 That memory may be holding him back. 

1280
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,450
 You're talking about the anchoring effect. 

1281
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,510
 Yes. 

1282
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,500
 ­  

1283
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,920
 Did you know about this by chance? 

1284
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,800
Is that why you offered Cha Cha 10 billion won?

1285
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,610
 I didn't do it knowing this. 

1286
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:35,150
 I just thought it would be best 

1287
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:37,240
 not to exceed that price. 

1288
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,410
 I felt spending more than 10 billion 

1289
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:41,980
 would make it seem 

1290
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,040
 as if he's admitting his mistake. 

1291
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,520
 I see. 

1292
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,330
 What are the conditions now? 

1293
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,420
Chairman, Team Leader Yun Ju No is here.

1294
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,300
Based on a post-money valuation of 10 billion,

1295
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,900
we will acquire 30% for 3 billion won.

1296
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,930
Goodness...

1297
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,480
That's worth 10 billion won?

1298
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,450
Yes.

1299
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,990
I'd also like a contract

1300
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:13,200
giving us a preemptive right to 19%.

1301
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,420
A game company...

1302
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,630
Do you think it'll do well?

1303
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,430
Yes.

1304
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:22,480
How well?

1305
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,840
In the gaming industry, you can't know the value

1306
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,800
before a new game is released.

1307
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,640
It could yield a hundred times the profit

1308
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,290
or end up with losses.

1309
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:34,710
However, Cha Cha Games received 10 billion won

1310
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:38,440
in game development support funding from DC.

1311
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:41,030
- Did you just say "support funding"? 
 - Yes.

1312
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,900
It's money with no conditions attached.

1313
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:47,440
Aigoo, why would DC do that?

1314
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,120
I'm not sure about that either.

1315
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,550
But Cha Cha is...

1316
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,490
in a position where they won't incur losses,

1317
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,250
even if their upcoming game fails.

1318
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,720
Then why not buy it all while you're at it?

1319
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,710
Why only buy 49%?

1320
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,730
It's not like I'm short on cash.

1321
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,240
Cha Cha Games needs to hold 51%

1322
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,570
to maintain control and work hard.

1323
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:13,570
Ultimately, I believe that will benefit Sanin.

1324
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:17,110
Aigoo. Do you think I don't know that?

1325
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:22,150
If we demand more than 51%,

1326
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:25,430
I believe this deal may fall through.

1327
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,500
Buy it.

1328
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,240
Okay.

1329
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,570
How did you settle the contract with PPF?

1330
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,800
If they requested to terminate the contract,

1331
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,050
can't you receive the breach of contract fee?

1332
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,850
But the contract wasn't constructed that way.

1333
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,670
I'm not very familiar with such things.

1334
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:21,220
I got the contract invalidity confirmation letter.

1335
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,650
Okay.

1336
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,430
Since we signed a contract,

1337
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:53,040
I'll treat you to a meal.

1338
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:57,550
Okay. We'll let you pay this time.

1339
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:08,310
Hey, I have a question.

1340
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,370
Yes?

1341
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:11,150
When you ordered us jjamjjamyeon last time,

1342
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,120
was there any meaning behind it?

1343
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,730
You can eat both jjajangmyeon and jjampong.

1344
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,300
You can make both games and platforms.

1345
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,090
Was it...

1346
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:22,770
a metaphor for that?

1347
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,660
Let's just say that was the case.

1348
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,420
CEO Cha, I have a question, too.

1349
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,990
Yes?

1350
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:36,650
Did you really hang a lantern for 100 days?

1351
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,240
Yes.

1352
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,280
If so...

1353
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,530
the lifespan of a lightbulb is 100 days,

1354
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:49,990
and light bulbs are changed every three months.

1355
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,640
Thus, the maximum time

1356
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,120
a streetlight is off is 90 days.

1357
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,140
So how come you did that for 100 days?

1358
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:03,290
 Hey, they're asking when the package will arrive. 

1359
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:06,060
 You left a while ago. Why aren't you there yet? 

1360
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,490
 Hey, this is a redelivery. 

1361
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:09,450
 They'll freak out if you're late. 

1362
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,400
 I'm on my way, 

1363
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,370
 but I took the wrong turn. 

1364
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,710
 Jerk, you still don't know your way around here? 

1365
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,940
 Don't curse at me. I'm trying my best. 

1366
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,770
 What did you say? 

1367
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,800
 Excuse me. 

1368
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,870
 Are you the one who keeps breaking the light bulb? 

1369
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,020
 I'm sorry. 

1370
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,260
I don't really know.

1371
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,180
I guess the city workers didn't do their job well.

1372
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:44,250
Could I also ask a question...

1373
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,250
to the developers?

1374
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:51,540
My friend is running late to a Chinese restaurant.

1375
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,000
My friend asked me to place an order for him.

1376
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,740
This was what he requested.

1377
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,220
"Please order three jjajangmyeon."

1378
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,230
"If the menu has sweet and sour pork, order one."

1379
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:01,300
How would you order, CEO?

1380
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,200
There's sweet and sour pork on the menu.

1381
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,620
I'd order just one jjajangmyeon, of course.

1382
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:11,200
Wow, t-this was actually true.

1383
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,520
What are you talking about?

1384
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,650
I guess the brains of developers are...

1385
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:17,130
really smart, yes.

1386
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,960
That's what I was trying to say.

1387
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,560
Obviously, I'd just get one jjajangmyeon for myself.

1388
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,810
Why should I listen to someone who's late?

1389
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,340
Besides,

1390
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,040
bloated noodles don't taste good.

1391
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,160
Oh, right, right.

1392
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,670
Yes, you're right, you're right.

1393
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,450
No, no. Order one of each.

1394
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,140
Because the conditional value is—

1395
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,500
By the way,

1396
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,300
has no one found Delivery King's easter egg yet?

1397
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,080
No.

1398
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,280
I think it will stay that way forever.

1399
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,130
Stop eating. You should just leave.

1400
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:54,190
You're fired.

1401
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,810
   

1402
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,390
Reporter Han,

1403
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,380
this is the final breaking news this week.

1404
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,460
Yes, DC Games' stock price fluctuated.

1405
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,110
It almost reached its limit.

1406
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,400
Why did this happen?

1407
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,840
There was news about its M&amp;A with Sanin.

1408
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,470
It turned out to be false news.

1409
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,980
Yes, that's why the stock price dropped again,

1410
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:03,020
but it shows that expectations are high for DC.

1411
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,290
In any case,

1412
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,390
Sanin decided to work with Cha Cha Games.

1413
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,430
Pardon?

1414
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:11,470
Yes, Sanin invested in Cha Cha Games, not DC.

1415
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,180
Oh, yes.

1416
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,770
I guess you also make mistakes at times.

1417
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:18,050
Thank you for your hard work.

1418
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,050
That's all the news we've got for you today.

1419
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,010
Thank you.

1420
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,540
 Great work, everyone. 

1421
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,400
 Great work, everyone. 

1422
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,820
 Great work, everyone. 

1423
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,430
Reporter Han.

1424
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,090
- Yes? 
 - Didn't you see the article on Sanin?

1425
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:37,610
Pardon?

1426
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,770
   

1427
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:50,380
   

1428
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,890
   

1429
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,320
Great work today.

1430
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:04,600
These jerks dare to mess with a reporter?

1431
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,450
   

1432
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,580
Seonbae.

1433
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,210
You're covering Sanin, right?

1434
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,550
Why?

1435
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,250
Do you want to get revenge?

1436
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,300
What do you mean, revenge?

1437
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,570
It's just spreading the facts.

1438
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,300
One moment.

1439
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,490
Is this correct?

1440
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,830
If Sanin's stock price falls below 100,000 won,

1441
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:33,330
Private Placement Fund can exercise their option?

1442
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:36,400
They'll go bankrupt or change majority shareholders?

1443
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,120
Yes, that's possible.

1444
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,860
But their stock prices are holding.

1445
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,570
It's currently at 103,000 won.

1446
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,180
Exactly.

1447
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,480
I just need to drag it down a bit.

1448
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,470
How?

1449
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,210
They bought a failing game company.

1450
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,810
Isn't this an M&amp;A failure?

1451
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,430
Even so, it's only 10 billion won.

1452
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:55,110
Do you think Sanin's stock price will shift with that?

1453
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,120
This is so infuriating.

1454
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,220
Should I give you some source material?

1455
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:03,360
What is it?

1456
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,420
Okay, so first,

1457
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,040
change this part...

1458
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,550
   

1459
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:18,820
   

1460
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,960
- Yes? 
  - Mr. Yun, 

1461
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,740
 did you check Sanin's stock price? 

1462
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:35,220
No. What is it?

1463
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,010
 It's 101,000 won. 

1464
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,650
 If it falls below 100,000 won, 

1465
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:41,850
 PPF can exercise its put option. 

1466
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,250
 If the stock price falls any further... 

1467
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,540
Sanin will be...

1468
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,560
taken over by PPF.

1469
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:01,480

01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:37,000
 Why didn't you get it listed sooner?

01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,090
 We'll just raise the stock price within four weeks. 

1481
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:41,340
 By getting Wind listed? 

1482
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,900
 He should've gotten it listed a while ago. 

1483
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,070
 Why is he doing that now? 

1484
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:45,330
 This is like hot potatoes. 

1485
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:46,680
 Are you sure you can do it? 

1486
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,700
 What if we can sell a totally upgraded Wind A 

1487
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,340
 for around 4 million won? 

1488
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,660
 We'll win for sure. 

1489
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,720
 I'll meet Shimizi and negotiate. 

1490
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,400
 I heard you wanted to see Mount Fuji. 

1491
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,540
 We won't return only after touring around, right? 

1492
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,800
 What is the manual for special cases? 

1493
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,330
 I'll consider it in a positive light. 

1494
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:04,320
 - They rejected the offer. 
 - What next time? 

1495
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,500
 I'm sorry. 

1496
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,570
 This won't be easy. 

1497
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:14,130
