00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,940
   

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,400

♫  Because money takes the heart, money takes the heart  ♫

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,050
♫  Money takes the heart away, money takes the heart away   ♫

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,870
   

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,420
So how are things going?

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,220
Well,

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,300
we will sell Construction.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,930
How much can we get for it?

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,130
The current market value can reach 7 trillion won.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,900
Come on.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,130
We should get at least double digits for it.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,290
Pardon?

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,700
Sanin Construction was my first business.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,260
So...

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,400
shouldn't we get a fair price for it?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,810
Chairman.

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,940
Getting 3 trillion over the market value is—

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,600
Why?

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,840
You don't think you can do it?

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,270
Well?

28
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,610
I will try to make it happen.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,270
Okay.

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,600
Go for it.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm leaving.

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,980
   

33
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,350
What's going on?

34
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,420
Are we really being sold?

35
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,630
That's what they say.

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,750
Square your shoulders and walk confidently.

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,860
We didn't come to do anything bad.

38
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,320
Okay.

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,170
Don't you get nervous, Attorney?

40
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,040
Why would I get nervous?

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,140
Hello.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,310
 No need to be scared. 

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,040
 That jerk will leave soon. 

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,700
Hyeongnim, don't worry.

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,640
I've worked in cement for twenty years.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,490
That's right, you jerk.

47
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,180
Think how you made it to your position.

48
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,510
I will call you up to the board of directors soon.

49
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,820
Then Yun Ju No will be nothing to you.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,580
Hyeongnim.

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,460
Rather than becoming an executive,

52
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,030
I only want to see you

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,860
lead Sanin, Hyeongnim.

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Gosh, this guy.

55
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,970
Come in.

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,150
Who are you?

57
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm Yun Ju No of the M&amp;A Team.

58
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,080
I thought you were one of my guys.

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,250
You're that team leader.

60
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,330
I came to discuss some things regarding the M&amp;A.

62
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,260
Come and have a seat.

63
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,240
How much will you sell it for?

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm curious.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,980
We will be holding an auction

66
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,780
so we don't know the exact price either—

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,780
You probably have a price in mind,

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,420
since you are an M&amp;A expert.

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm the CEO here.

70
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,280
Do you think I'm asking because I don't know?

71
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,910
I'm just...

72
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,420
curious about your thoughts.

73
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,770
It'll be similar to what you're thinking, CEO.

74
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,500
The price will change depending on the conditions.

75
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,370
The primary condition is the retention of employees.

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,540
Thus,

77
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,410
companies that want to expand their construction

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,020
will participate in this auction.

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,350
- Really? 
 - Yes.

80
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,810
So

81
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,820
I would like for you to clear up

82
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,880
any misunderstandings among the employees here.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,550
Who are they?

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,570
- So what's going on? 
 - What will happen?

85
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,880
What about me?

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,040
The CEO and executives have a two-year contract period

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,250
according to Sanin Construction policies.

88
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,770
We intend to uphold that as well.

89
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,870
No, no.

90
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,890
This will...

91
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,640
take an emotional toil on me.

92
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,090
Aren't you going to console me?

93
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,340
We will internally review a severance compensation.

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,660
Review, my foot.

95
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,340
Guarantee a five-year term as the CEO

96
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,760
and stock options.

97
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,920
I don't think you have shares now.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,100
- And your term as well. 
 - That's why...

99
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm asking you right now.

100
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,640
If we do that, it may hinder the sale, CEO.

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,900
That's not my problem.

102
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,870
Isn't that right?

103
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,460
No one knows Sanin Construction better than you.

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,220
So you know.

105
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,810
This place won't function without me.

106
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,960
Yes.

107
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,460
That's why the acquiring company

108
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,720
will see you as the most important asset.

109
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
So if you negotiated directly—

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,650
You're the negotiation expert.

111
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,430
Why don't you show me your skills?

112
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,620
We are working for Sanin,

113
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,610
not for you, CEO.

114
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,370
Geez, this jerk.

115
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,350
This crazy jer—

116
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,350
What did you say?

117
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,580
"Crazy jerk"?

118
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,030
Hey, you. Say that again.

119
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,290
"Crazy jerk"?

120
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,150
He didn't say "jerk," CEO.

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,440
You guys are absolutely ridiculous.

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,990
You guys are pure thugs!

123
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,520
My team member made a mistake.

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,670
Since you seem worked up as well,

125
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,670
we'll come back another time.

126
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,550
All right, then.

127
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,070
What did you say to me?

128
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,880
"Crazy jerk"?

129
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,930
Do you think I'll fold if you threaten me?

130
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,260
If you fire any one of my employees,

131
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,610
I won't sit back, you jerks!

132
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,640
You got that?

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,520
  ­ 

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,580
Mr. Yun, I'm sorry.

135
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,550
I couldn't help myself.

136
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,930
Could you wait for me?

137
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,750
I need a moment.

138
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,540
Okay, you should go and—

139
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,000
I need to use the restroom urgently.

140
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,770
Jin Su,

141
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,600
our goal is

142
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,350
to sell Sanin Construction at a high price.

143
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,660
To do so, we must raise its value.

144
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,020
 So 

145
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,060
 Sanin Construction is not an opponent to beat, 

146
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,500
 but one we must persuade. 

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,790
And they know that as well.

148
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,800
That's why they're acting emotionally.

149
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,930
No, no.

151
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,410
Honestly, it was hard for me to hold back, too.

152
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,380
I almost punched him myself.

153
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,190
Punch, my foot.

154
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,350
I mean it.

155
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,440
If it weren't for Jin Su, I would've immediately—

156
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,800
My fist moves automatically, so...

157
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,540
where was he again? He was here, right?

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
What was it again? "This jerk."

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
I nearly punched him when he said, "This jerk."

160
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,870
It was so hard to hold myself back. Geez.

161
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,370
But he cursed first.

162
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,820
I'm not the only one who messed up.

163
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,830
Exactly.

164
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,680
Imagine if only we were cursed at.

165
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,400
That would've been great.

166
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,670
He'd have been the rude one.

167
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,450
We wouldn't have to agree with him first.

168
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,700
And the public opinion would be on our side.

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,740
Since he won't have any excuses.

170
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,380
Thanks to you, it's become a mudslinging fight.

171
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,990
Jin Su.

172
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,560
Yes, Mr. Yun.

173
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,220
Don't pour your emotions into your work.

174
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,180
Think of it as a game.

175
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,250
Though it won't be easy.

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,540
Yes, I understand.

177
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,860
M&amp;A is literally a war.

178
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,220
People even say there haven't been major wars recently, thanks to M&amp;A.

179
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,630
If a war is fought with weapons,

180
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,870
M&amp;A fights using contracts.

181
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,410
Just like a gun or a sword having no emotions,

182
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,050
there is no use for emotions in contracts.

183
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,100
If you are emotional,

184
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,270
you lose the war.

185
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay.

186
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,520
Well,

187
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,370
if the opponent comes at you without boundaries,

188
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,580
I suppose acting crazy yourself is a way to respond.

189
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,850
Pardon?

190
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,750
Well, I wasn't trying to do that on purpose.

191
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,580
Even if you do, you can't mix your real emotions.

192
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,190
If you do,

193
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,600
your perspective narrows.

194
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,080
Hyeongnim, he couldn't say anything

195
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,440
when I came on strong.

196
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,860
Maybe he was embarrassed. He came secretly to apologize alone and left.

197
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,480
You should have gone easier on him.

198
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,210
 I did go easy on him. 

199
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,790
But he still pissed himself.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,080
See? I told you that would be the case.

201
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,630
 When your perspective narrows, 

202
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,030
 you start to perceive distorted information. 

203
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,560
What's with the CEO today?

204
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,350
He was yelling at them not to fire us, right?

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,380
I know, right?

206
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,610
I always called him stupid.

207
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,910
But at times like this, I like his hot temper.

208
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,280
 Even if you gain what you want emotionally, 

209
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,700
 you won't gain people's trust. 

210
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,410
Such negotiation always produces negative side effects.

211
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,200
Therefore, you must cast your emotions aside

212
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,010
when you sit at the negotiating table.

213
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,390
CEO Kim, have I told you this before?

214
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,430
Pardon?

215
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,870
That eco-friendly product from Bareun Lifestyle...

216
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,660
It's not that great.

217
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,290
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

218
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,250
You're even giving input for Bareun Lifestyle.

219
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,070
This is not my opinion but that of the chairman.

220
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,970
Pardon?

221
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,400
I just wanted to convey what the chairman thinks.

222
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm sorry if I offended you, CEO Kim.

223
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,340
Did the chairman say to reduce Bareun Lifestyle's products?

224
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,100
That's not the point.

225
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,540
You do know there's a hit list circulating, right?

226
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,030
Yes.

227
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,180
Tastes good.

228
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,930
Yes?

229
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,600
Hey.

230
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Hello.

231
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm Lee Hun Min of Sanin Construction.

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,450
CEO Lee, come in.

233
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,960
No, that's okay.

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,010
My staff is also here.

235
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,610
I'll just say hello and leave.

236
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh, you will?

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,540
Yes.

238
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,590
When we heard Yun Ju No was coming,

239
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,410
we thought our company was being sold

240
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,110
and their faces were distraught.

241
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,800
Thanks to you for reassuring us,

242
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,990
we're having a great time having a team meal.

243
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,300
We will pay for your meal.

244
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,740
Please enjoy your meal.

245
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,720
- Okay. 
 - Bye now.

246
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,090
CEO Kim, you're close to the subsidiary CEOs, right?

247
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,980
Yes.

248
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,520
I want to treat you all to a meal.

249
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,870
Sure. But is there some issue?

250
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,020
It's not really about any issue.

251
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,040
You know how the chairman is quite old now.

252
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,210
I should take care of you all now.

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,450
You're right. The chairman is getting to that point.

254
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,140
When you get to meet the chairman, please call me as well.

255
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,410
I'd like to treat you both.

256
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,810
You think it's some kind of a club?

257
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,340
If you have something to say, say it to me.

258
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,460
I'll deliver the message to him.

259
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,920
Then...

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,840
I'll be reducing the eco-friendly products.

261
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,630
Do that.

262
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,550
Please breathe out.

263
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,610
Good. Please relax.

264
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,100
Dr. Park is here.

265
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,970
All right.

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,170
I'll come by another time.

267
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,420
You can come in.

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,700
Okay, okay.

269
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,270
Aigoo, why did you personally come, Dr. Park?

270
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,630
Aigoo, you've been so busy

271
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,090
and it's been a while since I've seen you.

272
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,940
I see. Okay, take a seat.

273
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,050
I got scared, thinking you'd say I'm going to die.

274
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,490
Of course not.

275
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,730
All you have to do is get your flu shot.

276
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,170
And this.

277
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,910
T-There's nothing special, right?

278
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,270
- You're taking your medication, right? 
 - Sure.

279
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,950
Then if you do light exercises,

280
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,530
you'll be healthier than the team leaders under you.

281
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,450
Gosh, come on. Stop it.

282
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,950
Aigoo, she looks like a baby,

283
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,460
but I guess she's also a doctor?

284
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,830
Yes. Actually, she's my daughter.

285
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,600
Really?

286
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,100
Gosh, you raised your daughter well, Dr. Park.

287
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,920
My daughter is better than me at administering shots.

288
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,660
She skipped high school, so it's her last year as an intern.

289
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,700
She's still only 24 years old.

290
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,620
Oh, really?

291
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,640
Then give me the shot painlessly.

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,210
Here.

293
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,930
All right, I'll hold onto it.

294
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,990
All right.

295
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,140
What's your date of birth?

296
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,140
Hey...

297
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,310
   

298
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,280
Write your date of birth and name here.

299
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
Okay.

300
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,790
Hey, hey, hey.

301
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,140
Write your name in Chinese characters.

302
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm sorry, Chairman.

303
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,750
Kids these days are good at English, but...

304
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,010
Yes, my kids are the same.

305
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:21,710
   

306
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,900
Here you go.

307
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,600
Park Eun Chae.

308
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,300
She has a good face, the more I look.

309
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,980
   

310
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,430
They said face reading is science.

311
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,740
Jin Su, choose a good photo of him.

312
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,480
We said not to let your emotions get in the way.

313
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,930
No emotions.

314
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,340
This one is the best photo of him.

315
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,570
Good morning.

316
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,310
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

317
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,110
Jin Su.

318
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,900
- Are the teaser and draft complete? 
 - Yes.

319
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,680
The supervising company is Yumin IB's

320
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,130
Director Kang Sang Bae,

321
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,980
and legal support is provided by Kwon Yeong.

322
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,490
How much is the market price?

323
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,480
6.5 trillion won.

324
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,950
7 trillion won.

325
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,330
6.5 trillion won.

326
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,820
How is CEO Lee?

327
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,050
You know him very well.

328
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,520
No, I'm talking about how the public views him.

329
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,890
They probably view him similarly.

330
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,800
I chose the best photo of him, but should I PhotoShop it a bit?

331
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,510
No, given the nature of the company, this could be advantageous.

332
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,410
Yes. There must be a reason he became the CEO.

333
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,200
Let's go with the fact that he has a drive.

334
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,750
Okay.

335
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,900
What about the fundamentals?

336
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,850
The fundamentals...

337
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,820
Here you go.

338
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,800
- How is it? 
 - It's not bad.

339
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,440
- It's just... 
 - Just?

340
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,400
- The recent operating profit margin is low. 
 - Why?

341
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Recently, they've tried to shift to purchasing the land directly for reconstruction,

342
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,070
but they aren't handling the risk management on the real estate acquisitions well.

343
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,690
Risk...

344
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,600
Give me an example.

345
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,500
   

346
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
They pushed for a reconstruction project here,

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,140
but it's been stalled for several years.

348
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,480
The residents' consent needs to exceed 75%, but it must fall short.

349
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
By how much?

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,140
That information was missing.

351
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,350
Let's ask when someone from Construction comes.

352
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,010
   

353
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,230
Whoa, it looks like a ghost would live here.

354
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,680
Oh, my God!

355
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,300
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,190
I am Lee Jeong Eum, the VP of Sanin Construction.

357
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,400
You are Team Leader Yun Ju No, right?

358
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,560
Yes, VP.

359
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,390
You came to guide us around, right?

360
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,870
Yes.

361
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,230
I will guide you.

362
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,920
Be careful.

363
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,970
Everything is breaking down here.

364
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,170
Wow, people can live in places like this?

365
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,810
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,710
You personally came, VP.

367
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,840
Yes.

368
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,420
You could've sent one of your subordinates.

369
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,350
Well, I know this place the best.

370
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,230
That's why.

371
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,660
Despite the state of this place, it must be hard to get residents' consent.

372
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,020
Well, as for that...

373
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,610
Yes.

374
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,130
It's because I didn't do a good job.

375
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,010
So how much are you lacking?

376
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,940
In resident consent.

377
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,680
54 of the 212 households are refusing to budge.

378
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,200
Does that mean you only need one more household?

379
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,780
Well, yes.

380
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,430
But that's what's hard.

381
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,690
The remaining people are holding out.

382
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,700
And it's not like they live here.

383
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,320
Well, they are not in any rush for the most part,

384
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,250
so it's hard to persuade them.

385
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,630
- For the most part? 
 - Excuse me?

386
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,020
Oh, yes.

387
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,630
There is one person... who isn't like that.

388
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,370
Do they live here?

389
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,270
There's an elderly lady who lives in the last apartment.

390
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,930
Could we meet her?

391
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,610
Right now?

392
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,210
She's probably not home right now.

393
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,720
Grandma,

394
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,460
are you inside?

395
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,540
   

396
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,010
   

397
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,430
Can't we just sell it like this?

398
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,160
It will be redeveloped someday.

399
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,230
There's a bigger difference than you think between this being resolved or not.

400
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,950
The grandma is quite stubborn.

401
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,370
I tried to persuade her for years but failed.

402
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,600
Does she have a reason?

403
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,630
I'm not sure myself.

404
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,230
We'll try to persuade her.

405
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,540
Then please return home safely.

406
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,680
Goodbye, VP.

407
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,370
Why is the VP not leaving?

408
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,050
When the Chairman said double digits,

409
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,730
he was talking about 10 trillion, right?

410
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,460
I asked Yumin Investment and they say it's 7 trillion at best.

411
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,500
The Chairman's greed in his old age is scary.

412
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,730
He's basically saying not to sell it.

413
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,310
Yun Ju No was telling everyone that the company will go under if we don't sell Construction.

414
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,880
So the chairman can't say not to sell it there.

415
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,620
Oh, that's true.

416
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,610
The chairman is basically saying not to sell it.

417
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,280
Construction is our main stream of revenue.

418
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,120
It makes no sense whatsoever in this situation.

419
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,610
That's true,

420
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,980
but the chairman originally came from construction.

421
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,590
Since his youth, he wanted to build apartments.

422
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,450
That was his dream.

423
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,280
Oh, right.

424
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Yun Ju No is trying to sell the chairman's dream.

425
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,490
An old man can't forget his past.

426
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,690
It's all he has. How could he forget?

427
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,900
Though Construction was once feeble,

428
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,380
I made it the top company by acquiring Yongah E&amp;C.

429
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,550
Yes, you're right.

430
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,700
That's why the chairman loves you, Mr. Ha.

431
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,420
Wouldn't someone tell Mr. Yun that the chairman doesn't want that?

432
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,490
It's too late.

433
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,190
The moment he said he'd sell Construction, he was done for.

434
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,140
Goodness.

435
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,070
He's digging so hard without realizing it's his own grave.

436
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,250
He's digging his own grave.

437
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,580
Mr. Yun, do you know how much I missed you?

438
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,050
I missed you, too.

439
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,090
But you know, 10 trillion won is impossible.

440
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,990
I know.

441
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,760
Then why did you tell the chairman that you can?

442
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,630
I couldn't tell the chairman that I couldn't when he asked me like that.

443
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,580
And it could happen.

444
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,900
This is our first time meeting, right?

445
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,240
Oh, yes.

446
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,460
I'm Kang Sang Bae of Yumin IB, the supervising company.

447
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,350
Yes, the supervising company.

448
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,360
In an M&amp;A, we deal with the acquiring company and the target—

449
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,640
Never mind.

450
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,420
Think of it like a real estate agency when you move.

451
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,200
We promoted the teaser everywhere,

452
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,780
but we're focusing on two companies.

453
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,780
First, it's Chamok Construction.

454
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,830
It's also a construction company, but their main focus is civil engineering.

455
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,660
They recently worked on the Nanji Bridge and expanded into the Middle East.

456
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,960
But when they went to the Middle East,

457
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,980
they saw apartment construction as a growth area.

458
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,010
So they probably tried building apartments.

459
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,380
But the results weren't good.

460
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,860
Building apartments is different than engineering.

461
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,410
It's different. Still, the CEO is quite determined.

462
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,890
   

463
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,900
How desperate are these jerks at Sanin that they'd sell Construction?

464
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,490
The group seems to have some funding issues.

465
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,730
Then try to lower the price.

466
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,080
CEO, it's being sold in an auction.

467
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,920
It'd be a major loss if we missed out. If we...

468
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,970
Yes. I'll make sure to lower the price.

469
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,250
It's almost certain Chamok will enter the auction.

470
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,850
They need to start building apartments right away,

471
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,300
so the process will go smoothly too.

472
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,280
That's great.

473
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,390
But doesn't the Chamok's CEO look a bit like Sanin Construction's CEO?

474
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,740
I think he looks more like you, Attorney.

475
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,820
I will sue you. I mean it.

476
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,350
Next, there's Bium D&amp;I.

477
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,090
It's a real estate company that led the Songdo International City development,

478
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,790
securing a lot of cash.

479
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,640
It seems they are trying to expand into construction

480
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,270
using those profits. That seems to be their intent.

481
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,970
So they recently tried an M&amp;A with a construction company.

482
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,920
Which company was it?

483
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,350
This is off the record. It was Eboo Construction.

484
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,660
Why did it fall through?

485
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,470
Off the record.

486
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,110
They got emotional during the negotiation.

487
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,020
As you know, the construction industry

488
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,860
has a somewhat macho culture,

489
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,780
but Bium has many overseas employees

490
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,700
so I think there was a cultural difference.

491
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,540
That's why the deal fell through.

492
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,700
Thus, Bium will continue to pursue construction.

493
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,430
They also have the financial strength.

494
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,130
We should buy it.

495
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,570
Sanin has good cash flow and brand value.

496
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,940
But we can't just keep using their brand.

497
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,250
When we change the name,

498
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,300
we should consider the drop in brand value.

499
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,780
Still, if we want to join the Yongsan project,

500
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,820
we need a construction company.

501
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,840
But how is the CEO of Sanin Construction?

502
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,810
Construction companies are pretty similar.

503
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,080
This is why I don't like manual labor.

504
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,170
Still, we need to do this.

505
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,620
Yes, we should.

506
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,310
   

507
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,600
This one's good too.

508
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,290
Then what is our risk?

509
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,660
Sanin Construction's risk,

510
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,880
as you know,

511
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,470
is the Chungryeol Apartment redevelopment.

512
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,630
Honestly, this risk is tricky to calculate,

513
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,200
but the amount already invested is...

514
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
It's 880 billion won.

515
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,180
It looks dangerous just by looking at the photos.

516
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,280
See if we can proceed without the residents' consent.

517
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,700
Okay, I'll look into it.

518
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,990
I hear getting resident consent is hardest for redevelopment.

519
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,780
We need a grandma's signature who lives there

520
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,550
but for some reason...

521
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,330
I'll try meeting with her.

522
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,420
   

523
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,850
Oh, right. Please take this down.

524
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,280
- Pardon? 
  - The elevator is here. 

525
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Oh, okay.

526
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,110
Okay. I'll take it down. Bye.

527
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,660
See you tomorrow.

528
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,690
Right.

529
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,080
This is a bit tacky for the sign

530
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,430
of an M&amp;A office.

531
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,110
A negotiator should show no emotions

532
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,390
but have a good taste.

533
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,260
I lost.

534
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,070
Good game.

535
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,370
You should've said something if you were here.

536
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,450
This is your favorite time.

537
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,440
I shouldn't interrupt you.

538
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,930
You didn't eat yet, right?

539
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,680
Give me a minute.

540
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,030
Okay.

541
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,840
I learned a lot from you.

542
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,540
Gosh. "You learned from me"?

543
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,790
No, I learned from you.

544
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,260
I was wondering if the chairman said to sell it

545
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,040
for 10 trillion because he doesn't want to sell

546
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,350
or if there's another reason.

547
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,110
Well?

548
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,040
What do you think?

549
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,180
I'm not sure, but...

550
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,080
I think selling Construction is the most logical.

551
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,900
That's very like you.

552
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,540
Then I guess you didn't come to me because

553
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,360
you were curious about the chairman's intent.

554
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,450
 Welcome! 

555
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,570
 I'd like to order, please. 

556
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,230
Please persuade the chairman for me.

557
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,820
You said our Construction is worth 7 trillion won?

558
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,890
Yes. It's estimated at 6.5 trillion,

559
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,070
but I think it's possible to get up to 7 trillion.

560
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,900
I'll try to persuade him,

561
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,280
but he said double digits in front of everyone,

562
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,810
so he probably won't agree to 7 trillion won.

563
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,840
I see.

564
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,320
But I don't think he means not to sell it.

565
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,640
He started out as a construction manager.

566
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,440
That's why he has a strong attachment to it.

567
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,730
Even though keeping Construction could put the group at risk,

568
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,680
he'd be sad to sell it.

569
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,360
He's holding the option of reversing the decision.

570
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,180
Since it's unlikely to sell for 10 trillion.

571
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,610
Indeed.

572
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,480
I'm not trying to put pressure on you, but...

573
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,070
he's saying he'll decide after seeing the price.

574
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,300
Is the chairman fond of Sanin Construction,

575
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,020
or is it more about the construction industry...

576
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,470
It's about making money by the sweat of your brow.

577
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,280
I thought maybe you went to the gravesite.

578
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,590
Did you gather boxes?

579
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,640
How did you bring such a heavy load?

580
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,010
It would've been more convenient with an elevator.

581
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,650
Who said I wanted to ride elevators?

582
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,530
Pardon?

583
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,100
If you'll talk about redevelopment, leave!

584
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,860
Don't ever come back!

585
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,720
Gosh, I wasn't going to.

586
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,350
Aigoo, oh no! What are you doing!

587
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,630
- I-I'm sorry. 
 - My precious bowls!

588
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,150
You're just like contracted thugs, you jerk!

589
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,020
Gosh, just leave it!

590
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,900
Leave! Leave!

591
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,800
You were taken aback, right?

592
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,340
She doesn't usually yell like that.

593
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,400
It's my fault.

594
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,660
N-No.

595
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,190
Did you come to persuade the grandma as well, VP?

596
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,800
Yes.

597
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,580
But is she doing ancestral rites?

598
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,940
Those were bowls for ancestral rites.

599
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,240
Were they?

600
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,830
   

601
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,670
Seonbae.

602
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,790
You came.

603
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,860
You should eat something tasty.

604
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,770
This is tastiest in Sejong.

605
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,250
I hear Mr. Yun came back.

606
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,720
Yes.

607
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,440
You know, about apartment redevelopment...

608
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,010
I hear a fast track without resident consent is coming.

609
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,250
Is that true?

610
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,830
No comment.

611
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,370
You're such a shameless jerk.

612
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,510
You ask me that after feeding me a sandwich?

613
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,240
If it's no comment, that means it's coming.

614
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,520
If it'll happen anyway, can't they do it sooner?

615
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,850
It looked so dangerous.

616
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,980
This one?

617
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
This...

618
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,810
will pass soon.

619
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,000
It is pretty dangerous.

620
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,620
It's serious.

621
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,440
Should I submit a re-evaluation form right away?

622
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,600
Gosh, you were smart when you were a prosecutor,

623
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,600
but you got dumb after becoming an attorney.

624
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,060
The government is

625
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,770
trying to ease the reconstruction law.

626
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,400
Why do you think that is?

627
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,370
They want to increase the supply of housing

628
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,600
by rebuilding and stabilizing housing prices.

629
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,090
Increasing supply.

630
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,260
Who doesn't know that?

631
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,710
So the government

632
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,330
should reap the benefits of easing the law.

633
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,680
But you think they will approve this first

634
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,510
when the law hasn't even passed? Public officials?

635
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,630
So, basically,

636
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,160
they won't approve it until it passes.

637
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,910
The redevelopment should happen after the law passes

638
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,620
so it counts as their achievement.

639
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,860
That's right, you dummy.

640
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,010
I knew that already, too.

641
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,760
Then why did you come to me?

642
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,200
I came to eat a sandwich.

643
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,650
- Stop it. 
 - Why should I?

644
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,700
Stop it.

645
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,200
- Dummy. 
 - Stop it!

646
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,000
   

647
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,880
Hello.

648
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,990
   

649
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,450
   

650
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,920
- Yes? 
 -  Hyeongnim. 

651
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,140
 My guys are doing the job right now. 

652
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,570
Gosh, you can just handle it.

653
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,280
No need to call me about it.

654
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,180
 But Hyeongnim, 

655
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,980
 I don't know if it's okay to do this. 

656
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,880
- Dad, hurry. 
 - Go ahead and start.

657
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,970
Let's start eating.

658
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,070
You need to show some action, not just sit back.

659
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,520
So he'd get scared and give something in return.

660
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,820
Do you think you'll get anything if you don't act?

661
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,160
 Okay. 

662
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,490
 But he won't report us or anything, right? 

663
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,520
No matter what you do,

664
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,860
he can't report you. Never.

665
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,860
Trust me.

666
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,740
 The call is not going through. 

667
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,480
 You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

668
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,410
   

669
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,170
Born in 1942,

670
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,340
Choi Gang Pil?

671
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,280
Hello, good morning...

672
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,000
Didn't I tell you to take this down?

673
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,320
Pardon?

674
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,500
I thought you meant to change it since it was tacky

675
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,850
so I put up a new one.

676
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,340
Did I say that? To change it since it's tacky?

677
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,630
If you don't know something, ask.

678
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,210
Don't just guess and make assumptions.

679
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,320
I'm sorry. I'll take it down right away.

680
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,690
Forget it.

681
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,490
Hello.

682
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,360
It's the Construction guys, right?

683
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,710
I'll report them right now.

684
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,160
Jin Su, are we reporting Sanin Construction?

685
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,900
Then who will enter the auction?

686
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,160
First, let's go to the auction.

687
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,900
Hey, you made it.

688
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,190
Yes, take a seat.

689
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,650
Is it today?

690
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,870
Yes.

691
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,740
How much do you think we can get?

692
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,600
The market is...

693
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,570
estimating around 7 trillion won.

694
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,260
Look.

695
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,450
Then I'm not selling.

696
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,490
   

697
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,430
   

698
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,940
Mr. Yun, which company do you want as the buyer?

699
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,260
One that gives us a lot of money for it.

700
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,580
Don't you think Chamok will want it more?

701
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,480
They need more momentum

702
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,090
to keep doing civil engineering.

703
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,570
Sanin Construction's employees will have

704
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,540
an easier time adjusting if it's sold to Chamok.

705
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,710
That would be ideal.

706
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,490
Is it fun?

707
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,830
This?

708
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,940
Yes.

709
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,990
We're hosting guests today,

710
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,830
but you look like you're at a funeral, Jin Su.

711
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

712
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,480
Should we set up Jin Su as a guard?

713
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,970
Shall we?

714
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,700
A guard?

715
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,140
Jin Soo.

716
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,610
Get yourself some coffee in the first-floor lobby.

717
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,240
   

718
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,340
Ms. Kwak, Bium D&amp;I is here.

719
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,100
The CEO herself came.

720
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,130
She's at the coffee shop.

721
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,180
 Okay. Chamok hasn't arrived yet, right? 

722
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,910
No.

723
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,400
 Enjoy your coffee. 

724
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,860
Pardon?

725
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,350
Oh, okay.

726
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,030
   

727
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,450
Hello.

728
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,930
You're a Sanin employee, right?

729
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,530
W-Well, I...

730
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,050
I'm not.

731
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,270
We did our research before coming here.

732
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,910
Several trillions are on the line.

733
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,420
I should know the faces of the M&amp;A Team, at least.

734
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,620
Oh, I see.

735
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,540
I look forward to doing good business with you.

736
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,880
Oh, no. We also...

737
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,650
I mean, our team leader hopes Chamok acquires it.

738
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,940
Aigoo, thank you.

739
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,010
Then how much will it take?

740
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,230
Pardon?

741
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,610
We don't have much time left.

742
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,730
Why don't you just tell me?

743
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,070
How much are you expecting?

744
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,570
Since the market evaluation is 6.5 trillion won...

745
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,270
About 8 trillion won?

746
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,680
8 trillion...

747
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,520
Come on.

748
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,330
What a con artist.

749
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,090
Let's speak openly as men.

750
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,870
What is the price?

751
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,820
I cannot tell you since it's an auction.

752
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,480
   

753
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,870
   

754
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,020
Then I'll go to submit the bid.

755
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,610
Oh, okay, Thank you.

756
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,140
Since the regulation change is favorable,

757
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,480
wouldn't 8 trillion won be possible?

758
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,680
But there's the risk of Chungryeol Apartment.

759
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,910
If we resolve that, it's definitely possible.

760
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,860
It doesn't seem the government will approve it

761
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,500
until the law is passed.

762
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,310
I also went to visit the grandma.

763
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,530
I got yelled at.

764
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,700
I guess the grandma is scary.

765
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,940
That's not it.

766
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,370
She dropped what looked like ancestral rite bowls.

767
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,130
I got yelled at while trying to help her with that.

768
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,570
Yes, Jin Su?

769
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:52,150
Okay.

770
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,870
CEO of Bium is coming up as well.

771
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,950
Oh, that's a relief.

772
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:00,190
Then I'll be going home first.

773
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,400
Team Leader Yun Ju No?

774
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,220
Hello. You're CEO Ji Yeon Wu, right?

775
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,850
Yes.

776
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,190
It appears Sanin Construction is popular.

777
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,250
Yes, thanks to you.

778
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,510
I want to buy it cheaply.

779
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:52,070
But we have to sell it at a high price.

780
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,020
But why are you selling Construction?

781
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,980
Isn't Construction Sanin's cash flow?

782
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,640
That's right. It's Sanin's engine.

783
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,140
Exactly.

784
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,360
Why would you sell your profit center?

785
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,300
I will answer that if you submit the highest bid

786
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,450
and proceed with due diligence.

787
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,080
We didn't write a price on our bid.

788
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,200
How's 7 trillion won?

789
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,930
Is that okay?

790
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,280
There's no reason it can't be.

791
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,840
CEO,

792
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,020
did you try to acquire a construction company before?

793
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,930
Yes, though it fell through.

794
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,170
Why did it fall through then?

795
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,620
Back then,

796
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,470
I guess I bid too low.

797
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,390
How much was the gap

798
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,860
between the price you wanted?

799
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,770
It was quite a bit. Around 1 trillion won?

800
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,650
Bium can't miss out on Sanin Construction, right?

801
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,690
A construction company doesn't go on sale often.

802
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,750
The government will amend the redevelopment laws soon.

803
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,470
If so,

804
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,560
we may reconsider selling Construction as well.

805
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,920
That's why I'm asking.

806
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,880
How much will it be?

807
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,040
Sanin Construction has much more value than

808
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,630
that company you missed out on, CEO. So...

809
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,210
I would like you to buy it, CEO.

810
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,680
Honestly, I didn't like their CEO.

811
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,440
How's the CEO here?

812
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,110
Is he decent?

813
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,130
No.

814
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,980
He's even worse.

815
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,170
You're honest.

816
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,410
Yes.

817
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,520
But it will be a good company for you, CEO.

818
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,630
How? You said he's no good.

819
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,320
If you acquire the company,

820
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,240
I believe it's also my job to make sure

821
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,120
it becomes a company that suits you, CEO.

822
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,210
So I'd like you to include that

823
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:20,040
as part of your bid.

824
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,640
   

825
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,650
   

826
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,430
Wait.

827
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,020
Submit this instead.

828
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,120
How did you know?

829
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,580
The contract was under an elderly man's name,

830
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,170
but he's no longer around.

831
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,860
And they weren't even married,

832
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,740
so I found it a bit strange.

833
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,120
The grandma has no legal rights to the property.

834
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,500
I thought there was no way you wouldn't know that.

835
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,090
I'm sorry.

836
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,450
You came from his gravesite

837
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,250
when we first met, right?

838
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,740
Yes.

839
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,590
How did you know that?

840
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,310
You had soil on your shoes, VP.

841
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,370
Did you know from just that?

842
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,140
You also knew in advance

843
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,460
that the grandma wasn't home.

844
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,950
Did the grandma oppose the redevelopment

845
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,130
to protect Grandfather's gravesite?

846
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,740
Yes.

847
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,780
Actually, while Grandpa was alive,

848
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,260
Grandma had wanted to move,

849
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,080
but he was strongly against it.

850
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,620
While protesting redevelopment,

851
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,270
fights broke out at times.

852
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,330
In one altercation, Grandpa passed away.

853
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,370
Were you there at the scene?

854
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,600
Yes.

855
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,140
Was the fight so severe that someone would die?

856
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,810
Well,

857
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,540
people give different accounts,

858
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,840
but Grandpa already had some health issues.

859
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,610
So, in the end,

860
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,160
no compensation was given.

861
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:37,740
I see.

862
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,770
Apparently, he opposed redevelopment

863
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,760
because he wanted to receive

864
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,270
a lot of money and leave it for Grandma.

865
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,380
- But... 
 - But then you found out

866
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,560
that they weren't married.

867
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,480
Yes.

868
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,440
And you didn't report that.

869
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,550
If I reported it,

870
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,820
the grandma will be forced out

871
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,680
since they're legally not a family.

872
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,890
Do you think the grandma would

873
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:28,200
want to be buried next to him when she dies?

874
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,860
Yes.

875
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,220
She always talks about that.

876
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,560
Should we wrap it up now?

877
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,820
I think everyone's done.

878
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,860
Okay.

879
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,170
I'm so nervous. 
    

880
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,400
I feel it.

881
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,970
I think we'll get a 7 trillion won bid.

882
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,920
Chamok?

883
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,470
Yes.

884
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,590
   

885
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,970
   

886
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,180
How much is it?

887
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,580
6.9 trillion won.

888
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,170
That's still pretty good.

889
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,530
Though it's slightly...

890
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,770
disappointing.

891
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,990
Bium D&amp;I...

892
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,310
Why?

893
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,840
What is it?

894
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,180
Is it really 7 trillion won?

895
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,880
7 trillion...

896
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,680
999.9 billion.

897
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,510
One moment.

898
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,640
Yes, Min Jeong?

899
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,120
That's great.

900
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,780
Okay.

901
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,470
Mr. Lee,

902
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,320
it's a bit over 7.9 trillion won.

903
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,130
Great work.

904
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,110
 ­ 

905
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,820
It'd be great if the chairman learned to play Go.

906
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,010
Bium has the exclusive right to request data

907
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,750
for two months.

908
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,060
We must provide them with the requested data

909
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,440
and if there are no significant issues with it,

910
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,580
the contract states that Bium must pay

911
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,700
the 7.9999 trillion won.

912
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,580
But what if there is a significant issue?

913
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,960
Can the price be lowered?

914
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,110
Yes, if both parties agree on a reason,

915
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,800
the price can be adjusted.

916
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,910
You will now answer all my questions, right?

917
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,060
I won't lie to you.

918
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,820
Okay.

919
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,010
How old are you, Mr. Yun?

920
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,890
That info is irrelevant to the contract.

921
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,610
Wow, you'll be like this to the end?

922
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,210
We would like to hold a board meeting first.

923
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,510
Okay, sounds good.

924
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,150
What do you think of the future

925
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,000
for the Sanin Construction?

926
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,130
It's the best.

927
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,650
Apartment brands define social class in Korea.

928
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,640
And since Sanin Construction is at the top,

929
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,580
we will keep thriving just like luxury goods

930
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,570
no matter how bad the economy gets.

931
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,540
Really.

932
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,810
But if we acquire it,

933
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,450
we won't use the Sanin brand.

934
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,530
Wouldn't that reduce its brand value?

935
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,050
Pardon?

936
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,330
I'm the one who made Sanin Construction number one.

937
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm confident I can do that with Bium as well.

938
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,540
I see.

939
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,180
   

940
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:06,460
There isn't much land in Seoul for apartments,

941
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,310
and the population is declining in the provinces.

942
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,720
What are your thoughts on that?

943
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,510
Don't you know about redevelopment?

944
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,260
I also have a redevelopment plan to—

945
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,180
You don't need to talk about that.

946
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,370
Redevelopment data is sensitive information.

947
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,820
I see.

948
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,580
But we'll find out soon enough.

949
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,250
That's true.

950
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,100
By the way, your stamina's gotten so much better.

951
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,400
Oh?

952
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,850
Did it?

953
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,410
I don't think so.

954
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,140
You climbed up here without stopping once.

955
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,650
Take a seat.

956
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,000
You're right.

957
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,770
If you caught your breath,

958
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,050
say what you want to say.

959
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,450
What?

960
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,420
It was your first time asking me to go hiking.

961
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,920
That means

962
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,200
you have something to say.

963
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,850
About that...

964
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,910
You want me to sell Construction?

965
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,340
Yes.

966
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,740
I...

967
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,150
started out building apartments.

968
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,040
I really...

969
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,990
I really worked hard back then.

970
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,550
Now that I have to sell it,

971
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,940
I lost sleep wondering

972
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,500
what I did wrong. Aigoo...

973
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,520
It's not that you did anything wrong, Chairman.

974
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,930
How much did they offer for it?

975
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,610
Well...

976
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,280
it's 100 million short of 8 trillion won.

977
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,500
Have him negotiate a higher price.

978
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,850
Even if it's not double digits,

979
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,540
it should at least exceed 9 trillion won.

980
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:15,230
I'll tell him to keep trying to the end.

981
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,790
All right.

982
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,400
But will they still want to buy it?

983
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,390
Hello, CEO.

984
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:31,080
I'm Sanin Construction CEO, Lee Hun Min.

985
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,330
I see.

986
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,440
What brings you here?

987
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,170
Since we'll be seeing each other often,

988
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,750
I wanted to say

989
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,180
I look forward to working with you.

990
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,100
So this is about the Sanin Construction...

991
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,570
Yes, this is Sanin Group's M&amp;A Team.

992
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,060
Oh, yes, CFO.

993
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,660
Yes.

994
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,600
Yes, I understand.

995
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,810
Then I'll call you about the deadline

996
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:26,050
after I notify the Team Leader.

997
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,720
Okay.

998
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,830
That was the CFO of Bium D&amp;I.

999
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,090
He wants to know about

1000
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,480
future redevelopment projects.

1001
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,740
I already gave him everything.

1002
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,960
Yes, but he is requesting a meeting,

1003
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,730
saying he wants more details.

1004
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,350
It's about the Chungryeol Apartment, right?

1005
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,150
Not so sure.

1006
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,410
Yes, Mr. Yun.

1007
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,950
Well, we have a bit of a problem.

1008
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:08,140
Since your paperwork is always precise

1009
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,710
and Mr. Yun's reputation speaks for itself,

1010
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,840
I trust you.

1011
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,630
But there's something we're a bit concerned about.

1012
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,530
Yes, what is your concern?

1013
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,430
The progress on the redevelopment projects.

1014
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,790
Redevelopment involves a complex review process

1015
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,730
and takes a long time.

1016
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,530
We know that better than anyone.

1017
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,490
We're a real estate company.

1018
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,970
Yes.

1019
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,180
Well, the government is

1020
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,530
moving toward easing redevelopment regulations.

1021
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,090
It's just a movement. It didn't happen yet.

1022
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,410
Yes, but it will happen.

1023
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,940
Can you be sure? A hundred percent?

1024
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,240
Not a hundred percent.

1025
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,540
For Sanin Construction, Chungryeol Apartment

1026
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:56,600
is the most difficult redevelopment project.

1027
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,020
That's why I asked to meet.

1028
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,920
On paper, it looks like it'd proceed if we tried.

1029
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,210
But it might be different in reality.

1030
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,800
 The issue of resident consent is a major hurdle, 

1031
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,940
so it won't be easy in the short term.

1032
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,410
That's why I believe it's most realistic to wait

1033
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,920
until the regulations are eased.

1034
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,560
Then

1035
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,900
give us a discount.

1036
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,870
Since we're taking the risk

1037
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,240
the government won't ease the regulations.

1038
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,430
How much are you thinking?

1039
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,050
440 billion won.

1040
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,630
And interest fees will be attached to it.

1041
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:38,090
That's too much.

1042
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,900
How much funding was committed to this already?

1043
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,460
880 billion won.

1044
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,280
The probability of getting redevelopment

1045
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,010
approval is 50%.

1046
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:49,260
It's much higher than 50%.

1047
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,570
Half of 880 billion is 440 billion.

1048
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:58,300
If we add a 20% premium for taking on that risk,

1049
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,560
how much would that be?

1050
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,610
That would be 528 billion won.

1051
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:07,190
Would the acquisition price be about 7.4 trillion?

1052
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:10,210
It would be 7.4719 trillion won.

1053
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,170
You're valuing the risk burden

1054
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:15,030
at 5.28 trillion, right?

1055
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,750
That's right.

1056
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,900
Okay, understood.

1057
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,810
Wow, you're quite decisive.

1058
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,380
So, we'll take it as a 5.3 trillion won discount.

1059
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,770
But, CEO,

1060
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,230
what if we get rid of this risk burden for you?

1061
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,370
Will the fees for that also be 530 billion won?

1062
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,900
No.

1063
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,400
Successful redevelopment is the default.

1064
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,250
But we don't know when it'll be.

1065
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,100
That's why we lowered the price.

1066
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,250
So you agree it will eventually happen?

1067
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,470
Yes, I agree with that.

1068
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:02,410
The problem is not knowing when it'll happen.

1069
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,120
Costs incurred, as in interest on invested funds,

1070
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,250
expenses for related personnel,

1071
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,150
and the uncertainty of government regulations

1072
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:13,810
should be shouldered by Sanin.

1073
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,610
Okay, I understand.

1074
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,530
So the redevelopment not happening isn't the risk

1075
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:22,430
but whether the approval will happen quickly.

1076
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:25,380
Yes, that's right.

1077
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,710
But does that change anything?

1078
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,650
Why are you smiling at me?

1079
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,600
A professional company

1080
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,270
will make it exactly like the photo.

1081
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,660
Right here.

1082
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,910
This is the grandpa's hometown, right?

1083
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,540
Yes.

1084
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,620
This was where we met.

1085
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,220
I know.

1086
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,460
That's why I looked for it here.

1087
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,540
If you take a look,

1088
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,950
there's plenty of space so in the future...

1089
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,340
After I die,

1090
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,940
will you bury me next to him?

1091
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,240
I'll personally make sure to—

1092
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,620
Grandma,

1093
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:35,310
you trust me, right?

1094
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,050
You want me to trust you again?

1095
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,890
If we get you the approval before the acquisition,

1096
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,450
will you consider that equivalent to the amount

1097
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,750
of risk assessed, 530 billion?

1098
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,030
That's already included in the acquisition—

1099
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,770
I will...

1100
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,210
accept it as such.

1101
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,770
But when will you get this done?

1102
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:05,100
I plan to finish the due diligence today.

1103
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,430
By today.

1104
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,350
We got 75% of the resident's consent.

1105
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,230
Then did you just do this

1106
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,640
after getting the consent?

1107
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,260
No, we just got the final consent form.

1108
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,390
The VP worked really hard for it.

1109
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:47,110
Mr. Yun,

1110
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,940
you won't actually ask for all that, right?

1111
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,110
528 billion won?

1112
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:56,320
It's 530 billion won.

1113
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,770
I'm spending my own money on this.

1114
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,320
But aren't you paid a salary?

1115
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,170
Why are you taking it this far?

1116
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,830
I need to save my company.

1117
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,110
CEO,

1118
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:14,020
you asked me why we were selling Construction.

1119
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,730
Yes, I asked. What about it?

1120
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,680
I believe if we want to save Sanin,

1121
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,490
we must sell the best thing we've got.

1122
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,140
That's why...

1123
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,660
we're giving you the most valuable thing.

1124
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,170
So...

1125
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,700
are you really going to ask for all of it?

1126
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,770
Could I talk to you alone?

1127
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,420
They tried their best,

1128
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:52,760
but I don't think they can get to 9 trillion won.

1129
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,630
8.5 trillion won?

1130
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:01,530
It seems they're negotiating around that range.

1131
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,460
All right.

1132
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:12,160
You know how...

1133
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,040
Construction is like our firstborn.

1134
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:20,630
I really hope our firstborn thrives.

1135
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,640
Right?

1136
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,220
Mr. Yun,

1137
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:27,350
you won't actually ask for all of

1138
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,550
8.5299 trillion won, right?

1139
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,810
Buy me a gravesite instead of 299 billion won.

1140
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,660
That will be much better for Bium as well.

1141
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:39,510
What are you talking about?

1142
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,980
A gravesite?

1143
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,010
Bium D&amp;I has acquired Sanin Construction.

1144
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,330
It was the biggest M&amp;A of the year.

1145
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,190
Through this acquisition, Bium D&amp;I

1146
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,830
is expected to jump into the

1147
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,670
apartment construction business.

1148
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,260
There's more news regarding Bium D&amp;I, right?

1149
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,050
Yes, it's a heartwarming story.

1150
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:59,300
They resolved a redevelopment issue that stalled

1151
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,330
under Sanin Construction during the acquisition.

1152
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:04,470
What was the issue?

1153
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:08,080
A resident dug a gravesite behind the apartment.

1154
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,800
That resident was an elderly lady,

1155
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,110
and it was her late husband's gravesite.

1156
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,360
That's probably illegal, right?

1157
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,650
Yes. Also, they weren't legally a married couple,

1158
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:20,050
so she could not have had redevelopment rights.

1159
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,980
And the land owner was Sanin Construction,

1160
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,380
and it is now Bium D&amp;I.

1161
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,580
And what happened?

1162
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,540
But Bium D&amp;I relocated the grandfather's grave to his hometown

1163
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,710
and also recognized her redevelopment rights.

1164
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,260
As a result, they proceeded with the redevelopment.

1165
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,310
M&amp;A is often called a war without weapons,

1166
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:40,390
but this is a heartwarming from the battlefield.

1167
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,560
Yes. This is the first time I've heard of

1168
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,110
such a heartwarming story while covering economic news.

1169
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:49,900
Let's watch the interview with the CEO of BIum D&amp;I.

1170
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,710
 Bium D&amp;I's motto 

1171
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:54,010
 isn't just about building good apartments, 

1172
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,170
 but to create homes 

1173
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,630
 where people can live with dignity. 

1174
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:01,590
 We will work to improve Korea's residential 

1175
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,210
 environment that creates humane housing. 

1176
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:17,300
It reminded me of old times after all this time.

1177
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,400
Wait just a little bit longer.

1178
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,400
I'll join you soon.

1179
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:30,330
But still, since I worked hard to bring you

1180
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,680
to a good place like this,

1181
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,070
you should call me pretty

1182
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,050
when we meet again later.

1183
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:44,330
   

1184
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,630
Thank you.

1185
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,560
I'd like to thank everyone who attended

1186
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,230
the closing party for Sanin Group and Bium D&amp;I.

1187
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:16,920
I'm especially curious to hear from

1188
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,180
Director Ha, who worked hardest on the contract.

1189
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,660
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

1190
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,220
  ­ 

1191
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,330
Thank you.

1192
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,020
Sanin Construction was the best in Korea,

1193
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:45,980
but I believe it'll become the best in the world.

1194
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,280
And...

1195
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,140
Yes, thank you.

1196
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,370
It was because of that belief

1197
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:55,110
that I was able to successfully close this deal.

1198
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,770
Gosh, but he opposed it.

1199
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,660
Actually, someone else deserves more credit,

1200
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,920
but I ended up shamelessly taking the mic first.

1201
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,240
I'm not usually like that.

1202
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,600
Mr. Yun!

1203
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,430
Let's welcome her with a round of applause.

1204
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,930
Bium D&amp;I CEO Ji Yeon Wu.

1205
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,030
Please give her a round of applause.

1206
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:21,680
 ­  

1207
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:30,280
Well, I don't have much to say,

1208
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,670
but thank you for giving me such a good company.

1209
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,330
I'll grow it into an even better company.

1210
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:40,190
Please give her a round of applause.

1211
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,640
Thank you.

1212
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,720
This is wrong, isn't it?

1213
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,410
He stole our thunder.

1214
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,950
I mean, that is exactly it.

1215
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:53,530
Let's go eat something tasty.

1216
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,020
Okay.

1217
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,630
Mr. Yun,

1218
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,490
I think you are really amazing.

1219
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,000
Especially that 500 billion won at the end...

1220
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,830
How did you do it?

1221
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,650
I just got lucky.

1222
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,820
Pardon? Isn't it because of your job well done?

1223
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,450
Negotiations don't succeed

1224
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,840
just because you do a good job.

1225
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,610
It's luck.

1226
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:37,540
So this is where you were, the troublemaker.

1227
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,240
Congratulations, CEO.

1228
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,950
I hope your apartment construction goes well too.

1229
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,910
Okay.

1230
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:47,290
By chance, if you ever decide to leave Sanin,

1231
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,330
you should work with us.

1232
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,380
I'll consider it.

1233
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,240
CEO!

1234
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,720
I should introduce you to our Construction CEO.

1235
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,480
Hello, Mr. Yun.

1236
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,050
Hello.

1237
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:10,320
I see you've become the CEO.

1238
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,580
I heard you recommended me, Mr. Yun.

1239
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,250
Me?

1240
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:25,360
Oh, it's the chairman.

1241
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,550
Oh, hey.

1242
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,450
Aigoo, it's nice to meet you.

1243
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,820
Construction was...

1244
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,050
my favorite division.

1245
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,290
Please take good care of it.

1246
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,680
Yes, Chairman.

1247
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,830
I will raise it up with great care.

1248
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,700
Please do so.

1249
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:51,300
- I'll give you space to talk. 
 - Okay.

1250
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,480
Oh, hey.

1251
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,350
Well,

1252
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,300
you did well, too.

1253
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,680
Please don't mention it.

1254
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,680
I heard you had a deep attachment to Construction.

1255
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:09,160
That's why I said we need at least 10 trillion.

1256
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,470
But goodness, Mr. Lee...

1257
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:14,240
kept insisting.

1258
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,720
Well, thank you for letting us sell it.

1259
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,790
All right.

1260
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:22,500
So is it all done now?

1261
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,110
The amount is still insufficient.

1262
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:30,260
That's probably not that much, though.

1263
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,960
We're about 2.5 trillion won short.

1264
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,360
Then...

1265
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,270
will you sell...

1266
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:53,740
another subsidiary?

1267
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,460
This time,

1268
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,410
I will buy.

1269
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,340
Look.

1270
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,520
First, you sell Construction.

1271
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,590
And now,

1272
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:09,060
you'll buy something else?

1273
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,160
Yes.

1274
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
I will buy.

1275
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,120
Mr. Yun says he's buying this time.

1276
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,460
What company?

1277
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,500
A game company.

1278
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,590
A game company?

1279
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:32,650
At least, that should be fun, right?

1280
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:34,390
Yes, totally.

1281
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,600
Jin Su.

1282
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,210
Eat up.

1283
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,390
No. It's not like I did anything.

1284
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:48,110
You did well. You guarded well, too.

1285
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,790
That's right.

1286
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,170
I got lucky.

1287
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,150
What?

1288
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:56,810
It's not like hard work always leads to success.

1289
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,350
It was luck.

1290
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,060
What is he saying?

1291
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,970
 Aigoo, Mr. Ha. 

1292
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,480
 You pulled off something big. 

1293
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,230
Yes, we closed the deal today.

1294
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,790
 That's impressive. 

1295
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:26,790
 Is it really 8.5 trillion won? 

1296
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,890
The private placement fund is doing well too.

1297
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:32,610
 Gosh, we're just managing other people's money. 

1298
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,320
Well, I have something to tell you in person.

1299
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,860
 About what... 

1300
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,940
Yun Ju No.

1301
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:47,830
 Let's discuss the details when we meet. 

1302
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,290
 What request? 

1303
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:51,400
Jumbo Pharmaceutical.

1304
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:56,130
 You should just bury that. 

1305
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:58,130
 Wasn't that what the deceased wanted? 

1306
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,750
 Let's forget about it and move on. Please. 

1307
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,680
I'd like to do that, too,

1308
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,540
but I can't seem to do that.

1309
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,300
 What's your request? 

1310
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,160
The plan.

1311
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,290
   

1312
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,890
♫  The world is a desolate ocean  ♫

1313
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:38,610
♫  Of greed, loss, and betrayal  ♫

1314
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:43,500
♫  Hang onto your sweet emotions  ♫

1315
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,180
♫  'Cause money takes the heart  ♫

1316
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,580
♫  Money takes the heart  ♫

1317
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:51,330
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

1318
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:53,510
♫  Takes the heart away  ♫

1319
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:55,830
♫  Feed your greed  ♫

1320
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,650
 Mr. Lee tried to do this in the past. 

1321
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,010
 Isn't it too late for this? 

1322
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:02,140
 Now is the right time and the deadline. 

1323
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,860
 Do you think distribution is a joke? 

1324
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,350
 Will you make Delivery King a reality? 

1325
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:08,160
 Gosh, this is so funny. 

1326
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,960
 This will spark a revolution in distribution. 

1327
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,670
 If we turn it into a platform, 

1328
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,840
 we can't play this game, right. I'm not selling it. 

1329
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,050
 With this, Yun Ju No is done for. 

1330
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,310
 Did you share this info? 

1331
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,060
Yes.

1332
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,410
 This better not fail again. 

1333
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,580
 Ten billion won. 

1334
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,310
 Do Han Cheol and Yun Ju No, 

1335
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:25,680
