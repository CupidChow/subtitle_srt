00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,690
Mr. Ha, this isn't a scam.

187
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,319
There's no way of estimating...

188
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,860
how much will be spent on research and development.

189
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,460
If only tests succeeded on their first attempts...

190
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
But that's never the case.

191
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,099
Even I can't guarantee...

192
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,570
how many tests we'll need to conduct.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,699
That's why it's better to have a larger reserve of funds.

194
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,310
Come on. Are you kidding me?

195
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,570
That's what investors hate to hear.

196
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,180
You don't know when you'll find success...

197
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,509
but are asking for an investment.

198
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
That's not it.

199
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,880
It'll happen. We're almost there.

200
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,420
On top of that, we'll be funded by the government.

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
Then it'll be a done deal.

202
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,689
Since it's impossible to go up against government funding,

203
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,290
competitors usually give up.

204
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,129
However, to receive that funding,

205
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,430
we need good results from phase three of the clinical trial.

206
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,170
That's what has us desperate,

207
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,840
but the drug is solid.

208
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm only trying to expedite the project...

209
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,210
before our competitors catch up.

210
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,210
Mr. Ha, please.

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,380
All we need is 8.7 million dollars.

212
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,320
The amount isn't the issue.

213
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,650
It's certainty we need.

214
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,390
Unbelievable.

215
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,170
Right here.

216
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,700
This is not the way to compose your IR report.

217
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,209
You need to tell a story.

218
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,940
- Our IR report? - This right here.

219
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,210
- I see. - Look at this section.

220
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,680
Who cares how many papers this researcher wrote?

221
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,450
How many people in this world would even know what this is?

222
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,790
I see.

223
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,560
A script...

224
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,030
needs drama.

225
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,130
Drama.

226
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,970
- Do you get what I mean? - Pardon? Yes, sir.

227
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm not fond of this attitude either.

228
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,440
I mean,

229
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,940
be more assertive.

230
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,640
My gosh.

231
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,980
Unbelievable.

232
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,820
Mr. Ha, that's not something...

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm good at,

234
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,260
but my company...

235
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,060
has what it takes.

236
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,860
- With just 8.7 million dollars... - CEO Ko.

237
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,030
I doubt you know what I make in a year.

238
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,440
- Sorry? - Do you?

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,540
I don't.

240
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,679
People assume you rake in millions...

241
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
as a company executive,

242
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,280
but that's hardly the case.

243
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,379
You'll probably make more.

244
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,090
Gosh, of course not.

245
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,620
As if.

246
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,390
To be honest, I'm jealous of you.

247
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,390
What you have is yours.

248
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,460
You have a chance to win big.

249
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,900
It isn't mine alone.

250
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,330
- My employees also... - Seriously?

251
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,110
How much of the shares do you own?

252
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,180
About 50 percent.

253
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,750
See?

254
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,910
It's clearly yours.

255
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,450
Lucky you.

256
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,170
You must not know the predicament I'd face...

257
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,370
if the company were to invest in your business.

258
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,810
You have it rough, don't you?

259
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,450
Maintaining a sound mind is impossible in this line of work.

260
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,820
I'm not asking for money to use personally,

261
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,279
but it requires convincing those idiots...

262
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,250
and groveling to those with a chip on their shoulder.

263
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,790
To do so, I must wine and dine them out of my own pocket.

264
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,060
I see.

265
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,229
Let's say I managed to jump through all those hoops...

266
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,200
to get you that investment.

267
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,900
What follows...

268
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,170
is my presentation of the deal to the chairman.

269
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,700
What do you think that implies?

270
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm sticking my own neck out to vouch for the investment.

271
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
So why should I go through all that trouble?

272
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,480
My salary stays the same whether you get the funding or not.

273
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,720
Put yourself in my shoes. Wouldn't you agree?

274
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,790
I'm better off not proposing this at all.

275
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,760
Also, what if I did all of that...

276
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,520
and the project flops?

277
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,290
The company will hold me accountable.

278
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,400
You understand me, don't you?

279
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,029
Mr. Ha, this drug...

280
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,400
It'll be a hit. It won't be a flop.

281
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,670
You should also know...

282
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,270
that children with developmental challenges...

283
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,979
will benefit from this drug.

284
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,340
Exactly.

285
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,650
Should this project be successful,

286
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,850
only you will benefit from it.

287
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,090
If it flops, I'll face termination.

288
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,150
So considering the outcome,

289
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,690
why would I do something...

290
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,690
that solely benefits another?

291
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,230
Let's be real.

292
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,480

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,270
Thank you.

298
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,410
But I take it...

299
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,680
you spent most of your time working in your lab.

300
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,220
You're terrible at conducting business.

301
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,080
Sorry?

302
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,550
I told you I didn't earn much,

303
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,920
so you assumed I was someone who could be bought.

304
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,360
Gosh, no.

305
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,930
What kind of a loser do you think I am?

306
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,130
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,170
Just leave.

309
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,600
Seriously, that fool.

310
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,670
He's awfully dense.

311
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,870
How can he run a business?

312
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,310
I scolded him. I guess it scared him.

313
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,880
I haven't heard from him since.

314
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,150
My goodness.

315
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,980
It would've scared me too.

316
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,620
But weren't you torn when he offered 500,000 dollars?

317
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,820
Well, should I have changed my mind at that moment?

318
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,730
Then I would've earned big money and moved to the US already.

319
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,930
Right.

320
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,639
Hang on now. Are you suspecting me?

321
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,140
No, of course not.

322
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,140
The truth is, you were on the M and A Team back then.

323
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,380
So technically, the Audit Team should interview you as well,

324
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,250
but I told them not to.

325
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,750
I'll tell them I interviewed you because we're talking now anyway.

326
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,890
That's why I suggested we meet today.

327
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,620

That may be the case, but we have solid evidence.

They're the first Korean ADHD medication manufacturer.

356
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,670

You know, autism spectrum disorder is...

but it doesn't only affect the patient.

367
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,530
The whole family has to care for the patient.

368
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,070
Right.

369
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,170
Anyway, many companies have talked about developing a cure,

370
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,040
but it's the only one that has shown results.

371
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,080
- JUMBO Pharma? - Yes.

372
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,510
They're already doing a phase-three trial.

373
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,350
But the company seems to be struggling financially now.

374
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,190
It costs a lot of money to develop a new drug, you know.

375
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,120
And you have to move fast.

376
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,889
The one who develops it first...

377
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,760
and gets a patent will reap all the benefits.

378
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,130
How long does a pharmaceutical patent right last?

379
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,170
Twenty years.

380
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,730
That's right.

381
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,440
It means they can dominate the market for 20 years.

382
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,310
That's huge.

383
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,410
On top of that, they'll soon be selected for a national project.

384
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
- Are you sure? - Of course, I am.

385
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,350
I have my sources.

386
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,990
So, they want to complete their phase-three trial quickly.

387
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,390
Once JUMBO is selected for the project,

388
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,160
the other companies will have no choice but to give up.

389
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,930
Okay. Then shall we review investing in the company?

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,430
No, let's put a rush on this.

391
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,600
I told them it wouldn't be a simple investment.

392
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,870
I said we'd buy up their main stock.

393
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,969
Eight million dollars worth of new shares...

394
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,170
and four million for their old shares.

395
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,079
Their old shares too?

396
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,410
Come on. I told them to just hand those over.

397
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,719
What do you say?

398
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,150
Don't you think there's no reason for us not to pursue this?

399
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,989
You're right.

400
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,960
Based on what you told me now, it seems attractive enough.

401
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,690
- However... - Okay.

402
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,030
Then I'll go ahead and have them sign a right of first offer.

403
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,760
Do you want to meet them with me?

404
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,170
Sure.

405
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,840
When will you meet them?

406
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,100
Today.

407
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,370
- Today? - That's right.

408
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,980
Actually, he should be here any minute now.

409
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,510
My gosh.

410
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,650
He came right on time.

411
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,850
- Come on in. - Hello, Director Ha.

412
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,390
- Oh, you have a guest. - Yes.

413
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,860
This is the manager of the team. He's the one who calls the shots.

414
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,490
I see. It's very nice to meet you.

415
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm Ko Byung Soo from JUMBO Pharma.

416
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,960
This is Dr. Ko.

417
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,069
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No.

418
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,670
- Hello. - It's a pleasure to meet you.

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,140
Mr. Yoon.

420
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,280
Here's the right of first offer.

421
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,450
Thank you, Attorney Oh.

422
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,220
Are there no issues?

423
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,880
No, everything looks good on paper.

424
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,650
What about IR?

425
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,160
It looks good.

426
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,700
I know. You did a good job with it.

427
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,539
It's all thanks to you.

428
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,040
Oh, please. This is good for all parties involved.

429
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,340
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

430
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,680
All right.

431
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,350
Oh, we were just talking about...

432
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,550
what inspired Dr. Ko to develop the drug.

433
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,790
Yes.

434
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,690
The truth is,

435
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,930
I made up my mind to develop this drug...

436
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,270
because my child is autistic.

437
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,410
Your child has autism spectrum disorder?

438
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,010
Yes.

439
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,380
As a father who specializes in pharmaceutical development,

440
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,150
I figured I should at least treat my own child.

441
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Right, I understand.

442
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,060
Yes.

443
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,430
I really poured my heart and soul into it.

444
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,200
So, what's the total amount you need?

445
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,070
In total, it's 12.154 million dollars.

446
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,380
Right, the amount is very specific.

447
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,980
Is it because you have a detailed plan laid out?

448
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,720
Yes, I'm certain that it'll all work out.

449
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,360
I imagine there can be many hurdles while developing a new drug.

450
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,360
I didn't know the process allowed such a detailed and specific plan.

451
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,770
Well, that's...

452
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,600
That's because we're in the final stages now.

453
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,879
(New Drug Development)

454
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,650
(Developmental Disabilities)

455
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,380
By the way,

456
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,620
I know I mentioned about my child being autistic,

457
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,360
but you don't need to feel pressured to do this.

458
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,130
Do you not need the money?

459
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,330
Pardon me?

460
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,330
You've practically devoted your life to developing this drug,

461
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,100
so you must want this to succeed.

462
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,940
And you need the money to do this.

463
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
Well...

464
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,580
That's not what I meant.

465
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,150
There are many other companies that want to invest in it.

466
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,450
It doesn't have to be Sanin.

467
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,030
Then is there a specific reason you came to us first?

468
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,960
Pardon?

469
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,700
When you're developing a new drug,

470
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,200
you'd work yourself to the bone to do it.

471
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,269
Then random companies would develop something similar...

472
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,340
and sell it, right?

473
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,739
Yes.

474
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,640
Right, so to prevent something like that,

475
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,540
you should join hands with a big company like us.

476
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,350
No one would do such a thing because they'd be scared of Sanin.

477
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,250
Right. If we join hands with Sanin,

478
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,290
we won't have to worry about other companies copying our product.

479
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,920
Exactly.

480
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,860
I mean, that won't happen.

481
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,630
But if anyone pulls that on us, we'll make them pay.

482
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,270
Yes.

483
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,470
All right. Don't you worry.

484
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,870
First, let's sign...

485
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,880
this agreement.

486
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,780
Wait, this is...

487
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,580
Signing this means we can only negotiate with Sanin, right?

488
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,750
You see, I'm always working in the lab,

489
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,059
so I don't know much about these things.

490
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
That's correct.

491
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,459
This grants us an exclusive right...

492
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,830
to negotiate with you for a month.

493
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,559
In turn, we'll put down a deposit of 100,000 dollars.

494
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,969
But there was another company that requested a meeting with me,

495
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,430
and I told them I'd meet them.

496
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,940
I don't think I can back out of the meeting now.

497
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,510
Then we shouldn't sign this today.

498
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,220
My goodness.

499
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,260
You sure know how to negotiate since you're a CEO.

500
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,060
All right. Then give us a week.

501
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,900
However, we can only give you 50,000 dollars as a deposit.

502
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,739
- Not 100,000 dollars? - That's right.

503
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,840
We'll have to decide in a week, which is quite risky.

504
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,710
No, Director Ha.

505
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,320
If it's one week, I don't think we can put down a deposit.

506
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,720
- Really? - Yes.

507
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,820
We asked for a month, and even that's not enough.

508
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,460
If it's just one week,

509
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,460
we can't conduct due diligence.

510
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,890
I'm afraid we can't pay a deposit...

511
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,930
without completing the due diligence process.

512
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,000
We can finish it quickly.

513
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,670
Put a rush on it and finish reviewing the documents at least.

514
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,900
- But still... - Come on.

515
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,210
Dr. Ko here doesn't seem like a liar, does he?

516
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,550
Well, then...

517
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,280
Sanin will get a week of exclusivity.

518
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,420
As for the deposit, it'll be 50,000 dollars. Sounds good?

519
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,490
Okay.

520
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,190
Let's do that.

521
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,830
So?

522
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,660
Did you agree to it?

523
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,910
But it's not considered stock price manipulation.

524
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,710
Did you manipulate the stock price too?

525
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,720
We'll talk about the rest another time.

526
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
They'll interview the two of you as well.

527
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,030
Just tell them what you know.

528
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm off.

529
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,000
What did I tell you?

530
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,570
I told you I couldn't trust him.

531
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I apologize, sir.

532
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,810
Hey, why are you talking like that?

533
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,480
Is someone else listening right now?

534
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,760
So?

535
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,390
What's the plan now?

536
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I think a disciplinary hearing will be held.

537
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,470
He'll get a chance to explain everything there.

538
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,170
Oh, boy.

539
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,740
Be honest with me.

540
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,610
You.

541
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,980
Do you trust him?

542
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
Tell me.

543
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,490
Yes, come in.

544
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,290
Director Ha Tae Soo and Director Cho Beom Soo are here.

545
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,590
Come on in.

546
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Sit.

547
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,550
Attorney Oh.

548
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,590
Take my advice for Mr. Yoon's sake.

549
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,990
Don't try to refute it. Just admit it.

550
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,660
I suggest you resolve this politically and resign.

551
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,700
You know what will happen at the disciplinary hearing.

552
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,340
Yes.

553
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,240
I know I'd be going there to be punished, but...

554
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,710
Exactly.

555
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,580
People think it'll be like a trial, but you know that's not the case.

556
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,780
I suggest you try to persuade him.

557
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,950
Okay, I'll try talking to him.

558
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,160
You see, the evidence we have is... I can't get into the details,

559
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,830
but it's solid.

560
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,370
How solid?

561
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,670
A hundred percent.

562
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,140
So, you're sure it was Yoon Joo No? Is that it?

563
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Yes, sir.

564
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,480
Then hand him over to the police.

565
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,550
Sir, the thing is,

566
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,050
considering the situation Sanin is in right now,

567
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,820
nothing good will come out...

568
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,560
of people outside the company finding out about this.

569
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,760
Sir, may I say something?

570
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,270
Yes.

571
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,470
A disciplinary hearing must be held.

572
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,669
If we don't do it despite receiving the anonymous letter,

573
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,410
it could cause a bigger problem down the road.

574
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,240
So what, then?

575
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,680
First, we'll kick him out.

576
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,210
Then Sanin...

577
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
will sue him. That'll be the most hassle-free solution.

578
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,519
We'll seek compensation for the damages...

579
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,760
when Yoon Joo No is no longer a Sanin employee.

580
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
All right. Do that, then.

581
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,790
Well...

582
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,900
Sir, then who should be the head of the disciplinary committee?

583
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,270
Why are you asking me that?

584
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,600
Is it my job to decide that?

585
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,740
No, we'll take care of it.

586
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,260
Darn it. This is all because of Yoon Joo No.

587
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,060
You can lead the disciplinary committee.

588
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,599
The legal manager, the audit manager, and I...

589
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,930
will join the hearing.

590
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll be there too.

591
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,510
How could you say that, knowing the situation?

592
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Director Lee.

593
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,280
Director Ha and I will take care of it.

594
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,780
With the audit manager and the legal manager, we'll have enough people.

595
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,950
How many people do you need on the disciplinary committee?

596
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,660
Under five.

597
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,630
Then I'll join too.

598
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,230
Everyone in the company knows that you and Mr. Yoon are close.

599
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,770
It could cause a misunderstanding. Will you be okay with that?

600
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,969
I believe everyone in the company...

601
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,810
also knows what kind of relationship you and Mr. Yoon have.

602
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,650
So, let me sit on the committee too.

603
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,480
Regardless of the result, we'll make sure...

604
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,720
there are no misunderstandings.

605
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,460
Fine, let's do that.

606
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Goodness.

607
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Hello?

608
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,270
Okay, I'll meet you there.

609
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,210
All right.

610
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,479
I'm stepping out for a coffee.

611
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,049
- Do you mind tidying up the office? - Sure.

612
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,080
Thanks.

613
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,750
Over here.

614
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,760
I need to return shortly. Give me a second.

615
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,960
Okay.

616
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,960
To take away, please.

617
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll tell you what I know.

618
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,810
Mr. Yoon can't get away with it.

619
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,740
The anonymous letter is solid.

620
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,350
But it might just end with him resigning.

621
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,549
With the company's tough situation,

622
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,050
he doesn't want to create any gossip.

623
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,890
You mean the chairman?

624
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,590
- I see. - After he resigns...

625
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,800
No, it's nothing.

626
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,370
That's all I know.

627
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,499
Thanks for sparing me some time.

628
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,940
- Thanks for the coffee. - No problem.

629
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,770
Thank you.

630
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,229
What's this? Come on.

631
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,360
Look at how gloomy you are again.

632
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,430
What?

633
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,130
Do you feel bad for your team manager?

634
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,800
No, I don't.

635
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,870
Hyeong Seop.

636
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,810
Remember what you told me?

637
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,110
That Mr. Yoon was a complicated man.

638
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,750
Did I?

639
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,350
Yes.

640
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,650
You also said he'd be doing all sorts in secret.

641
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,550
Oh, right.

642
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,050
See? I was right, wasn't I?

643
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,890
You don't know that yet.

644
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,760
But why the long face?

645
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,930
You think I'm right, don't you?

646
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,229
Hey. Do you think the disciplinary committee holds...

647
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,100
a meeting whenever they want?

648
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,239
It's never held without decisive evidence. Got it?

649
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,210
Do you think the directors are that free?

650
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,280
(Daejin Delivery)

651
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,460
In short,

652
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,330
you have all the members, right?

653
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,860
Yes.

654
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,530
But Dr. Ko won't meet me.

655
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,470
It's saying he doesn't trust me.

656
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,000
You served time for stock price manipulation, and yet,

657
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,310
he can't trust you?

658
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,870
I didn't go to jail.

659
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,340
I was held in custody but was released on probation.

660
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,950
What must you do to earn his trust?

661
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,120
All those guys trust in is money.

662
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,690
If I were to use money, I would've done so ages ago.

663
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,490
Let's think of another way.

664
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,990
I don't have time.

665
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,770
As if that's easy.

666
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,260
Mr. Yoon.

667
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,430
Jin Soo?

668
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,460
What brought you here?

669
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,600
Mr. Yoon.

670
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,430
Can't you tell me the rest?

671
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,100
About what?

672
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,140
JUMBO Pharma.

673
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,440
You had no part in the stock price manipulation, right?

674
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,680
Neither Attorney Oh nor Ms. Kwak wouldn't talk.

675
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,420
Jin Soo.

676
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,360
At what point is someone considered involved?

677
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,930
Mr. Yoon?

678
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,810
Are you okay?

679
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,520
What?

680
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,750
You look serious.

681
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,950
Oh, it's nothing.

682
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,630
You know autism.

683
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,670
What?

684
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,700
Did you know you shouldn't call it autism?

685
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,370
It should be called autism spectrum disorder.

686
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,540
I see.

687
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,709
That would indeed be free from prejudice.

688
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,080
The symptoms would vary.

689
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,650
- You knew? - Yes.

690
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,420
You really know about everything.

691
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,449
But can't you still use it as a diagnosis?

692
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,490
I doubt it.

693
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,130
It was in a recent drama. They used autism spectrum disorder.

694
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,430
Is that so?

695
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,970
What's this about?

696
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,370
What?

697
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
Are you taking over a pharmaceutical company?

698
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,970
No.

699
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,750
You're the one who asked first.

700
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,020
- But... - Is it even a secret from me?

701
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,480
It hurts, you know?

702
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,390
It's not like that.

703
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,360
I know how you feel. I get it.

704
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,660
You don't need to explain.

705
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,030
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

706
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,370
I'm sorry to call on a weekend morning.

707
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,970
Are you sorry because of the weekend or the morning?

708
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,610
Both.

709
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,350
I see. What is it?

710
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,080
Please look over JUMBO Pharma once again.

711
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,050
Understood.

712
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,290
An accident-prone area lies ahead.

713
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,590
Are you going somewhere?

714
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,560
I'm guessing you're in a car.

715
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,170
Joo No?

716
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,940
Joo No.

717
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,990
(I'm heading out because of an important matter. Sorry.)

718
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,120
- You're on your way to JUMBO? - Yes.

719
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,630
Is it for an inspection?

720
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,700
I could've tagged along.

721
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,600
From what I know, the US made the first ADHD medicine.

722
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,870
Wouldn't there be a patent on it?

723
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,200
You're right.

724
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,340
And Americans are fussy about patents.

725
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,040
I bet JUMBO dodged the patent.

726
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,150
Shall I look into how they did it?

727
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,220
Yes. Please contact me the minute you find out.

728
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,720
(Sales, Sales Cost)

729
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,650
Yes?

730
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,450
Mr. Yoon. I looked over what you asked me to.

731
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,979
The company's sales increased significantly...

732
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,119
after releasing the ADHD medicine.

733
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,160
But there was actually a loss in profit.

734
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,860
The profit dropped when the sales did better?

735
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,529
Please check where the expenses increased.

736
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,470
It could be the R and D.

737
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,969
I did think so too.

738
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,870
But there was no such public notice.

739
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,140
I'm searching if there were other factors.

740
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,080
But it'll take some time.

741
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,290
Please call me once you find out.

742
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,790
And see if...

743
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,120
it has to do with the US pharmaceutical company.

744
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,030
Okay.

745
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,100
"Methylphenidate and the correlations..."

746
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,940
It was two years ago.

747
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,080
That's truly odd.

748
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,190
Mr. Yoon.

749
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,630
There is indeed a problem.

750
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,529
The ADHD medicine...

751
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,869
was developed by a US pharmaceutical company named Revion.

752
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,370
The patent period was 20 years.

753
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,169
Two years ago was when it ended.

754
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,540
The company could've applied for an extension but didn't.

755
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,210
It was for the common good.

756
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,520
So the patent ended two years ago?

757
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,050
If it was two years ago...

758
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,489
Correct. It was when JUMBO released...

759
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,490
its new drug.

760
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,230
In other words, JUMBO released a replica of the ADHD medicine...

761
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,260
when the patent ended, yes?

762
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,400
It seems like it, though I'm not entirely sure.

763
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,430
Millions of dollars are needed to develop a new drug.

764
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,270
It had no reason to develop a drug with a soon-ending patent.

765
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,910
The component is the same as Revion's.

766
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,980
Then there was no patent infringement.

767
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,579
True. But the company promoted as if...

768
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,049
it had developed a new drug,

769
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,309
making it a liar.

770
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,350
Why they lied is a mystery.

771
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,520
Something sure is fishy here.

772
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,890
Maybe.

773
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,219
Since the company has a lab,

774
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,390
it must have the capacity to copy the drug.

775
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,620
I hope so.

776
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,119
Mr. Yoon. Did you go to the lab?

777
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,160
And not the headquarters?

778
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,890
I came to the address on the website.

779
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,630
It doesn't look like a lab.

780
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,500
How come?

781
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,890
Let alone a lab,

782
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,520
it's not even fit as a warehouse.

783
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,330
Did Revion release the drug...

784
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,000
as Contra?

785
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,570
Yes, that's the one.

786
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,440
This company isn't even skilled enough to copy the drug.

787
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,510
It simply...

788
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
changed Revion's packaging before selling the drug.

789
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,680
Those jerks.

790
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,049
Attorney Oh. Let me call you back.

791
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,050
Okay.

792
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,390
Goodness.

793
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,779
(ULTRA FOCUS)

794
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,809
(Methylphenidate)

795
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,580
"Methylphenidate."

796
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,660
Yes, Min Jeong?

797
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,889
Mr. Yoon. I did some digging.

798
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,729
As JUMBO's sales increased,

799
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,930
so did the import from Revion.

800
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,029
The drug is methylphenidate.

801
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,670
It's a medicine for ADHD.

802
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,830
Right.

803
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,599
JUMBO must've imported...

804
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,770
and sold the drug after changing the packaging.

805
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,940
But...

806
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,339
The company sold it for less than its cost from Revion.

807
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,310
It was a plus for those who bought the ADHD medicine.

808
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,880
Why did JUMBO do a losing business?

809
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,450
To scam people.

810
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,380
By the way, where are you right now?

811
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,950
JUMBO's factory.

812
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,410
Sorry?

813
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,480
Isn't that dangerous?

814
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,780
It's okay. Nobody is here.

815
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,690
You should leave.

816
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,620
- I will. I'll call you again later. - All right.

817
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,860
Joo No!

818
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,300
I'm coming.

819
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,400
Joo Seok.

820
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,540
- Hey, An Na. - Come on in.

821
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Where's Joo No?

822
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,650
He had an important business outside.

823
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,480
What important business?

824
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,279
It must be work...

825
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,819
since it's important to Joo No.

826
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,049
That punk. He should fix the doorbell instead.

827
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,219
It's broken.

828
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,290
I know.

829
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,320
What's that important business or whatnot?

830
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,430
Joo No must be starting a project.

831
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,470
He gets busy this time of the year.

832
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,299
But it'll end soon, which will give him a break.

833
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,740
I see. What project is he working on these days?

834
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,370
Something about investing in a pharmaceutical company.

835
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,140
He's keeping the details even from me, you know?

836
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,680
It's that personality of his.

837
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,219
Unlike me,

838
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,220
he's heartless.

839
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,550
You're right.

840
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,250
Should I give him a call?

841
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,890
No. I just dropped by on my way.

842
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,660
Have dinner before you leave.

843
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,630
I don't want to trouble you. Please don't.

844
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,600
But you're not.

845
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,960
No, Oh Woon is waiting. I should go.

846
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,330
Have dinner, okay?

847
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,340
But I'm really okay.

848
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,310
(JUMBO Pharma)

849
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:21,920
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

850
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,990
I have a report to make.

851
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,930
- What is it? - It's about JUMBO Pharma.

852
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,630
I'm sorry, sir. I hit traffic on my way here.

853
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,270
Sit down.

854
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,280
Go ahead.

855
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,109
I placed the due diligence report...

856
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,450
on your desk.

857
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,519
That's why you called me?

858
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,250
Yes. You told me to wrap it up quickly.

859
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,150
I thought you might be curious.

860
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,590
My gosh.

861
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,520
You didn't need to report to me like this.

862
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,390
When have I ever micromanaged you?

863
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,460
I know you'll handle it.

864
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,270
Yes, sir. Have a good day then.

865
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,700
Okay.

866
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Oh, my.

867
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,840
What happened? Who was it?

868
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,340
He's a junior of mine.

869
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,810
It wouldn't look nice if he knew we were together.

870
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,409
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were on the phone.

871
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,450
No worries.

872
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,280
All right. Here you go.

873
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,690
Well, it's not like...

874
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,560
I'm running an unstable company.

875
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,860
Investing in my company wouldn't be a bad idea.

876
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
Even so, it'd be a bit iffy if he knew we were together.

877
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,469
I'm not going to tell people that...

878
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,399
we're splitting the leftover funds.

879
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,740
Hey, come on.

880
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,839
You need eight million dollars to make the drug.

881
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,880
And the leftover fund amounts to more than half of that.

882
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,380
Exactly. I won't tell anyone about what we're doing.

883
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,590
It sounds like...

884
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,889
you're blackmailing me.

885
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,360
Gosh, no. I'm not blackmailing you.

886
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,060
No way.

887
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,529
I'm just so grateful to you, sir.

888
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:10,470
I actually wanted us to meet, so I could make you an offer.

889
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:12,930
What offer?

890
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,600
When I get...

891
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,610
the full investment, the 12 million dollars,

892
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,810
you'll be taking a mere two million dollars.

893
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,880
So I was wondering if you'd like some of my company's shares.

894
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,590
What do you mean?

895
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,489
To be honest with you, just like I told you before,

896
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,490
I don't know exactly how much I'll need for the research.

897
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,230
As the CEO, I have no choice but to save some of the funds.

898
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,700
So I often sell and buy shares of my company.

899
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,300
When I did that,

900
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,910
I realized that I could influence the stock price.

901
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,880
Are you telling me you'll manipulate the stock price?

902
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,190
Gosh, manipulate is such a strong word.

903
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,720
But yes, in essence.

904
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,160
I can boost it tenfold for you.

905
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,630
Are you not interested?

906
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,930
Is something going on at work?

907
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,960
You seem deep in thought.

908
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,360
What?

909
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,830
Oh, it's nothing.

910
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,240
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

911
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,710
Eat a lot, my youngest.

912
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,680
Here.

913
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,650
There you go.

914
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,390
Someone I know...

915
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,690
told me that you were a complicated man.

916
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,560
Is that so?

917
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,100
Then what is your opinion of me?

918
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,870
Actually,

919
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,640
he said you were evil.

920
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,280
He said you just wrote everyone off as evil...

921
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,180
when you considered yourself to be complicated, yet kind.

922
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,120
So what you were doing was more evil.

923
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,960
He does have a point.

924
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,890
But...

925
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,300
in my opinion,

926
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,500
you see yourself to be complicated and evil.

927
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,970
And...

928
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,270
I'm not sure if it's a good thing...

929
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,240
or a bad thing.

930
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,069
Sanin Group will now begin the disciplinary committee meeting.

931
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,100
(Junior Managing Director's Office)

932
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,309
Today's agenda includes two disciplinary reviews...

933
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,410
of Team Manager Yoon Joo No from the M and A Team.

934
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,550
The first review is regarding the leak of internal information.

935
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,010
The second review...

936
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,320
is regarding insider trading.

937
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,250
Sir, here's the file for the disciplinary committee meeting.

938
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,120
- Okay. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

939
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,570
Mr. Yoon.

940
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,439
If it ends with your dismissal,

941
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,340
it wouldn't be a bad idea to accept it.

942
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,780
I also agree.

943
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,180
The company wouldn't want a scandal.

944
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,190
I see.

945
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,709
We shall deliberate on the request of disciplinary action...

946
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,210
regarding Team Manager Yoon Joo No of M and A Team.

947
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,780
If you have any questions for him, feel free to ask him.

948
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,590
Mr. Yoon, you oversaw the JUMBO Pharma investment...

949
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,390
three years ago in the M and A Team, correct?

950
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,060
Yes.

951
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,070
Back then, he evaluated the company as solid.

952
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,700
My gosh.

953
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,170
Am I remembering it correctly?

954
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,210
Yes. I do remember it.

955
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,550
You must have been aware that their stock price would skyrocket...

956
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,820
once people found out that we were going to invest in JUMBO.

957
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,290
Yes.

958
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,230
So...

959
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,900
have you told anyone about the investment deal?

960
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,110
Have you shown this report to anyone?

961
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,449
Is this the company? The company he's going to invest in?

962
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,450
What?

963
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,390
Oh, no. Joo No really hates it when you look at his files.

964
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,759
- Okay. I won't look. - I'm sorry about that.

965
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,629
Joo No is really sensitive about it.

966
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,700
You don't have to apologize. I know what he's like. It's fine.

967
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,650
Hey, Oh Woon. I'm on my way home.

968

It's a new customer for a corporate loan.

- is definitely like that. - So I've noticed.

1003

1004

that Sanin Group was going to invest in JUMBO Pharma?

Yes,

1034

he did.

1035
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,970

The first case alone...

1069
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,309
warrants us ample justification...

1070
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,750
for his dismissal and a potential lawsuit.

1071
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,050
But considering his contribution to the company...

1072
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,020
and the death of his older brother,

1073
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,160
I propose...

1074
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,330
concluding the disciplinary meeting with his dismissal.

1075
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,830
Will you accept it?

1076
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,130
No, I can't.

1077
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:02,870
What?

01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,370
Mr. Yoon.

1079
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,110
The company is showing leniency in its response.

1080
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:11,410
Yes.

1081
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,710
But I still cannot accept...

1082
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,550
my dismissal.

1083
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:22,960
Could I talk to Mr. Yoon for a moment?

1084
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,660
No.

01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,200
Sure. Fine. Let's keep going.

1087

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,110
It's about his punishment for insider trading.

1090
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,950
Right here.

1091
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,120
This letter of notice was sent to Yoon Joo No...

1092
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,019
to inform him to exercise his rights...

1093
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,720
as a JUMBO shareholder of 50,000 shares.

1094
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,630
This was issued in 2022.

1095
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,939
It proves that you held JUMBO stock back in 2022. Correct?

1096
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,070
(Sanin)

1097
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,240
You had 50,000 shares.

1098
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,940
This must have been worth at least one million dollars...

1099
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,210
at some point, right?

1100
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,450
It's one million dollars.

1101
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,260
All right.

1102
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,560
Mr. Yoon.

1103
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,900
You're also admitting that you own JUMBO Pharma's shares, correct?

1104
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,770
Yes, I am.

1105
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,050
I was trying to do you a favor.

1106
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,820
But you turned it down.

1107
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,190
(Sanin)

1108
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,130
(The Art of Negotiation)

1109
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,230
Is it going according to your plan?

1110
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,760
Could it be a suicide mission?

1111
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:16,100
The devil is in the details.

1112
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:19,970
I came back here because I wanted to find out the truth.

1113
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,200
By causing our stock price to crash?

1114
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,340
So he's trying to drag us down with him.

1115
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,470
We must make our move first.

1116
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,640
Word is you're still running your game.

1117
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,280
I can bankroll it.

1118
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,850
You see, when people get chatty,

1119
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,380
they're bound to make a mistake.

1120
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,720
How could you pin everything on your late brother?

1121
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,920
- Have you no sense of decency? - Director Ha!

1122
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:43,460
You're fired. Understood?
