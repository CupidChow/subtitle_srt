Before replying to the email,

17
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,903
I called to check on something.

00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:23,918
Hello?

20
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,887
Is this Reporter Han Ji Eun speaking?

00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,590
This is Kim Hyun from SANIN PR Team.

22
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:31,459
If you have a complaint, email me.

23
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,127
No, it's not a complaint.

24
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,129
I just want a chance to explain.

25
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,465
Yes, so email me.

26
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:49,244
Yes.

27
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,981
- I'll talk to them first.
- Okay.

28
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,582
I'll prepare a dispute.

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,384
- Sure.
- Yes.

30
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:11,332
Something wrong?

31
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:13,401
No.

32
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,673
What do you mean "no?"
There seems to be trouble.

33
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,728
Here.

34
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,681
I didn't expect you to see me in person.

35
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:04,886
Reporter Han, I read your last article.

36
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:09,524
I thought we should explain it this time.

37
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:13,528
So the rumor must be true.

38
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:17,632
I'm actually working on E-commerce.

39
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,033
Is that so?

40
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:19,901
Yes.

41
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,239
There are decisions to be made internally,

42
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:29,310
but once they're approved,
we'll start promoting it at large.

43
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:34,148
Then I'll contact you
for an exclusive interview.

00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,884
With the chairman?

45
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,887
First with me,

46
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:42,557
and I'll talk to the chairman as well.

47
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,860
If you could do that for me,
I'd appreciate it.

48
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,900
So, what's the occasion for today?

49
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:54,869
I wanted to explain...

50
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,039
that SANIN won't be...

51
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,410
affected by WIND's listing issue.

52
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:04,846

55
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,052
the article's already been released.

56
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:13,988
It's past the deadline.

57
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,828

(Deadline, Episode 5)

59
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,445
The countdown makes you anxious,

60
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,614
and you lose focus.

61
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:43,685

to stay alert and focused.

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,490
Hello?

65
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,827
Mr. Yoon,
did you check SANIN's stock price?

66
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:55,263
No, how much is it?

67
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,565
It's 101 dollars.

68
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,268
If it goes below 100 dollars,

69
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:02,337
SAMOEL may demand the put option.

70
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,038
If the stock price drops even more...

71
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,073
SAMOEL will...

72
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,609
take over.

73
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,851

- There was an article.

74
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,319

81
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,337

- When we were buying CHACHA...

83
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:49,751

87
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,865
Yes, I already sent it.
They're probably on their way.

88
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,968
Mr. Yoon. I sent you a text.

89
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,174
I'm sorry, but can I change my order?

90
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,679
Veggie sandwiches, please. Wheat bread.

91
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,649
All vegetables with no pickles.
And for the sauce, olive oil only.

92
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,617
Yes.

93
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,456
Anything else?

94
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,393
Did the stock price drop
because of that single article?

95
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:35,196
Because SANIN is weak right now.

96
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,068
We should prepare for the case
of more articles.

98
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,775
They could demand to pay off with shares.

99

on WIND listing?

We were aware of WIND.

Then why didn't you list it?

Was it fun to travel abroad...

157
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,476
after hitting WIND rock bottom?

158
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,880
But WIND isn't...

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,847
Sir.

160
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,450
Listing is my duty.

161
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,453
You should've done better.

162
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:03,258
But the leisure market was struggling
after COVID-19.

163
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,693
Are you saying that again?

164
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,464
What did I tell you?

165
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:10,798
- Pardon?
- Hey.

166
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,002
Go to Han River right now.

167
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,070
There are bicycles everywhere.

168
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:17,972
Sir.

169
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,717
You're the CEO.

170
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,053
Are you putting the blame on others?

171
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:37,592
What kind of CEO blames others?

172
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,427
Tell me.

173
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:41,062
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:23,104

00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,806
- Yes?
- Mr. Ha.

176
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,176
What?

177
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,683
Is CEO Oh in charge of WIND?

178
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,318
Yes, he's at the headquarters.

179
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,020
To meet the chairman?

180
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,288
Yes, it seems like it.

181
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,924
I thought he might want to see you too.

182
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,259
Okay.

183
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,762
- Get ready.
- Yes.

184
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:52,700
The chairman lost temper there.

185
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,270
Don't be upset.

186
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,971
But WIND isn't my responsibility.

187
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,142
Honestly, I didn't volunteer
to be in charge.

188
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,145
It was Mr. Ha who bought it,

189
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,847
and it's managed by someone else.

190
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:06,814
CEO Oh.

191
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,316
We'll talk downstairs.

192
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,321
CEO Oh, good work.

193
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,169
Hi.

194
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,673
- Do you want some coffee?
- Coffee...

195
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm good.

196
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,608
- Take a seat.
- Yes.

197
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,759
WIND tried listing,

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,762
and the report was negative.

199
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,965
That's why we put it off.

200
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,499
Why? I thought it was doing well.

201
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:02,904
After WIND was acquired in 2015,
it went through ups and downs.

202
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,506
Then from 2021 to last year,

203
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:08,676
the sales went up
by 30 percent every year.

204
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:09,844
But...

205
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,580
bicycles aren't like IT.

206
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,349
How can it go up by 30 percent?

207
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:17,518
Many of my friends joined cycling clubs.

208
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,020
Yes. It was huge.

209
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,123
If you think about it,
it benefited from COVID-19.

210
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:25,560
At the time,
there was a huge leisure fever.

211
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,362
It's my mistake.

212
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:32,901
Bicycling was a sport one could do alone.

213
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,271
I didn't realize it benefited
from COVID-19.

214
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,940
I expected it to grow continuously.

215
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,209
So I waited.

216
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,479
It's not your fault.

217
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,185
I should've reported it to the chairman.

218
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,155
But I missed my chance.

219
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,926
Mr. Lee made a mistake, sir.

220
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,662
He should've done it
when it was doing well.

221
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,997
It's too late now.

222
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,599
Forget about him.

223
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,369
Tell me your opinion.

224
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,705
I think...

225
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,242
our highest priority is
to stop the put option.

226
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:15,977
And?

227
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,214
We should persuade SAMOEL.

228
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,682
Do you want to do it?

229
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,017
Yes, I'll meet them.

230
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,721
Get them to sign
that they won't use the put option.

231
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:28,556
I beg your pardon?

232
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,091
What if they say no,

233
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,661
but do it later? Then I'll get kicked out.

234
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,130
I doubt it.

235
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:42,370
Are you saying WIND has no chance?

236
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,205
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,318
He's a coward.

238
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,620
What?

239
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:06,361
Just have Mr. Ha persuade SAMOEL.

240
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,729
They're close.

241
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,598
If SAMOEL was going to help us,
they would've done it already.

242
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,901
Only if they said they were our partner,

243
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:16,404
the stock price wouldn't have plummeted.

244
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:17,939
But they're playing dumb.

245
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,043
Mr. Ha's lost construction,

246
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,946
and if SAMOEL's ditching him too,

247
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,047
he has nothing left.

248
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,628
CEO Oh was crying.

249
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,297
What?

250
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,165
The chairman scolded him
for failing to list WIND,

251
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,034
and he cried.

252
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:53,575
You should tell him
you'll talk to SAMOEL...

253
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,443
I already told him.

254
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,879
But the chairman told me to leave it.

255
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,715
Whether it gets listed or not,

256
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,383
he decides to abandon it.

257
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,253
You mean WIND?

258
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,488
Whether it's WIND or someone else.

259
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,624
He's furious.

260
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,994
Did you meet the chairman?

261
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,596
Yes, just now.

262
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,933
They should've listed WIND already.

263
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:20,335
Why bother now?

264
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,937
I know. After COVID-19,

265
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,673
the rich are busy traveling abroad,

266
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,508
and the poor are busy making ends meet.

267
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,011
Who'd ride a bicycle?

268
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,714
I bet CEO Oh wanted to cry.

269
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:35,683
He didn't want to cry. He was sobbing.

270
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:39,287
- My goodness.
- But that guy Mr. Ha.

271
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,090
It's also his fault.

272
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,392
He should've bought something
we could list.

273
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,594
He left that trash with me.

274
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:50,198
He was talking like it was none
of his business. How annoying.

275
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:55,003
I'll do my best. Keep calm.

276
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,238
Actually...

277
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,041
this is my second year.

278
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,544
I need to renew my contract.

279
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:06,314
That's why I paid a lot of attention
to Saipan.

280
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,583
Then...

281
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,719
WIND out of nowhere... My goodness.

282
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:15,323
To be honest, the market condition is
important to be listed.

283
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,492
When things are good,
WIND is not a problem.

284
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:19,727
But the market is very low right now.

285
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,263
It must prove its potential.

286
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:24,933
But the thing is, its sales went down.

287
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,468
So you couldn't help
but submit a negative report?

288
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:30,939
No. I couldn't write it'd be successful
because then if it fails,

289
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,342
it'd go under.

290
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:35,310
You did the right thing.

291
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:38,046
What's SAMOEL's option again?

292
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,181
According to SAMOEL's
put option condition,

293
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,150
SANIN's stock price should remain
below 100 dollars...

294
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,752
for 20 business days.

295
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:47,622
That's how they're involved?

296
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,958
Twenty business days mean four weeks.

297
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,126
Then we have to raise the stock price
in four weeks.

298
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,329
How?

299
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:55,897
By...

300
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,699
getting WIND listed.

301
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,935
If that was possible,
it would've happened a long ago.

302
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:03,771
But he couldn't tell the chairman.

303
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,406
That's why this happened.

304
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,710
Yes?

305
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,413
Gosh.

306
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,384
It's hard to say something can't be done.

307
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,088
Who could possibly tell him?

308
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:23,591
He'd only criticize you.

309
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,728
It's like passing the bomb.

310
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,331
I like your expression. Passing the bomb.

311
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,302
Hey. Let's go.

312
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:38,139
- Sir.
- The chairman is leaving.

313
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,307
Should I get the car ready?

314
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,042
No, let's go there.

315
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:41,876
Pardon?

316
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,878
What floor is Mr. Yoon on?

317
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,214
- He's on the 13th floor.
- Let's go.

318
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,384
But Han River is packed with bicycles.

319
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,352
Yes, it's packed.

320
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,421
But how come WIND didn't do well?

321
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:55,456
There are many shared bicycles.

322
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,560
Aren't they basically free?

323
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:02,463
It'll be the end of all bicycle companies.

324
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,766
How can we beat
a government-authorized business?

325
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,135
I don't plan to beat it.

326
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,406
It's fine.

327
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:14,409
You heard it, didn't you?

328
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,212
If you mean WIND,

329
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,213
I read the article.

330
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,415
So? What do you think?

331
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,118
It wasn't easy from the start.

332
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:26,487
That's what everyone thinks.

333
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:30,091
But not everyone went under
during COVID-19.

334
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:33,161
Thriving businesses kept thriving.

335
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,162
Am I wrong?

336
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,531
No, however,

337
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,366
even if it weren't for COVID-19,

338
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,134
the bicycle market
wouldn't have turned out well.

339
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,237
What are you saying?

340
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,005
After the bicycle-sharing system,

341
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,374
more people are riding bicycles,

342
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,977
but most bicycle companies'
performances are low.

343
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,745
Yes. True.

344
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,747
The government offers bicycles for free.

345
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,349
Who's crazy enough to buy one?

346
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,317
The tax covers everything.

347
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:58,086
How can we beat that? Am I right?

348
00:21:58,086 --> 00:21:58,987
Yes.

349
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:01,289
So we need a bait...

350
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,292
to make bicyclists ride better bicycles.

351
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:06,861
With that bait,

352
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,565
WIND would do better
in the high-end market.

353
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,468
Then?

354
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,238
Can you do it?

355
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:24,512
Tell me.

356
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,548
Yes.

357
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:34,188
The CEO was a former archer.

358
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,024
He first began as an archer.

359
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:39,127
Then with his knowledge of carbon fiber,
he advanced to the cycle market.

360
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:41,529
Because he dealt with the carbon cycles,

361
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,398
he joined the high-end market.

362
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,003
Do you have any questions?

363
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,706
Why did you say yes?

364
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,808
We should've stayed quiet.

365
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:55,910
Tell me. Why did you do that?

366
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,980
Because I know it's possible.

367
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:01,749
I'm used to it.

368
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:10,859
(WIND)

369
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,904
Hello.

370
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Hello. I'm Park Nae Gyeong.

371
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,774
Nice to meet you.

372
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:32,513
Here are the bows we made...

373
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,216
in order.

374
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:38,686
The pictures up there are...

375
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:40,655
either important or significant.

376
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,692
I always watch archery in the Olympics.

377
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,630
It's amazing how they hit ten...

378
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,533
when it's already amazing enough
to hit the mark.

379
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,700
How do they do that?

380
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,736
Do you have to be born with it?

381
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:56,404
You just have to keep trying.

382
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,407
Doesn't it still require
some innate talent?

383
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,910
You should be.

384
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,512
But perseverance is...

385
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,981
a more valuable talent
than being good.

386
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,851
Were you an athlete?

387
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:13,054
I didn't do that well as an athlete.

388
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,222
I didn't win any medals.

389
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,592
But these bows got me the gold medals.

390
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:20,295
You won so many gold medals.

391
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,933
This is...

392
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,302
when I acquired DAICHI.

393
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,905
Wasn't DAICHI number one in the past?

394
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,440
Back in the 90s.

395
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,510
But we beat them and acquired them.

396
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:38,213
Who's that man next to you?

397
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:44,219
He's the one who drew this blueprint.

398
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:46,454
He was DAICHI's best technician.

399
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:51,159
Did that master give you this blueprint?

400
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,293
Yes, as a gift.

401
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:54,963
And I gave him the slogan.

402
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,732
Did you write that yourself?

403
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:00,368
When I was an archer,

404
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,104
I learned calligraphy
thinking it'd help me concentrate better.

405
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,408
What does that say?

406
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:09,110
"Ongojishin."

407
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,813
Review the old and know the new.

408
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:14,482
He's cute.

409
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:20,255
That is the master's youngest son.

410
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,856
He was adorable.

411
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:23,825
I see.

412
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:30,064
Here are the cycles.

413
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,869
How much does this cost?

414
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:37,906
About 30,000 dollars.

415
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,910
That's more expensive than a car.

416
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:43,578
I know.

417
00:25:43,578 --> 00:25:45,947
I'd expect it to be around 1,000 dollars.

418
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,882
It's for athletes.

419
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,417
I see.

420
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:52,720
If the athletes ride WIND,
it means it's approved.

421
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:54,923
Of course.

422
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:59,727
Every second matters to athletes.

423
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,963
They only ride the best.

424
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,699
But your sales can't keep up...

425
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,301
just by selling to athletes.

426
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,737
Gosh.

427
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:13,241
That is our homework.

428
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,410
Let's...

429
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,012
work on that homework together.

430
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:19,814
(WIND Analysis Report
SANIN Group M&A Team)

431
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,650
From 5,000 dollars to 30,000 dollars,

432
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,519
WIND released 12 models.

433
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,022
You might think the cheapest model
to sell the most,

434
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,391
but it has the least sales.

435
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:33,261
Because sports is a competition.

436
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:35,196
The device is the same.

437
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,866
Everyone hates the bottom rank.

438
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,270
So instead of the cheapest WIND A,

439
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,906
one rank up was sold the most?

440
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:45,874
Of course.

441
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,409
That's the sports attribute.

442
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,612
No one likes the bottom rank.

443
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:54,649
What if WIND A isn't the bottom rank?

444
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,384
What?

445
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,423
The bicycles are graded
according to their materials.

446
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,559
True.

447
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,729
By steel, aluminum, and carbon.

448
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:10,532
To upgrade from other company's aluminum
model to WIND's carbon,

449
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,033
it's 1,000 dollars more.

450
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:13,468
And that price is...

451
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:15,737
the barrier that stops people...

452
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,138
from moving to carbon from aluminum.

453
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:25,547
Carbon is on a whole new level.

454
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:28,516
You can't compare it to aluminum.

455
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,417
No.

456
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,753
What if you can sell WIND A
on a whole new level...

457
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,721
for 4,000 dollars?

458
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:36,190
That'd guarantee you...

459
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,493
to win in the competition
with the aluminum bicycles.

460
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,094
That's guaranteed.

461
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:43,898
Yes, if the price is the same,
I wouldn't ride aluminum.

462
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:44,966
I'd ride carbon.

463
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,135
(4,000 dollar entry model release)

464
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,136
Yes.

465
00:27:48,136 --> 00:27:51,139
When that happens, we can automatically...

466
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,807
lead aluminum consumers to WIND.

467
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,181
I do agree with you.

468
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,417
But...

469
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:06,020
it's not easy to meet that price.

470
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:10,258
It was really hard to reduce it
down to 5,000 dollars.

471
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,360
That price is impossible.

472
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,130
What if the market grows?

473
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:19,334
Then you can mass produce them.

474
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,202
Probably.

475
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:24,739
But in the bicycle industry,

476
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:28,276
not only the frame,
but the gear also matters.

477
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,512
And SHIMIZ in Japan is known for that.

478
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,548
They also have the patent.

479
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:37,752
We need their gear supply. Otherwise,

480
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,154
I can't produce them even if I want to.

481
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:42,323
It's the same as the semiconductor.

482
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,258
Yes.

483
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,593
SHIMIZ is basically in charge.

484
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,630
It won't be easy to secure the supply.

485
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:52,333
Then we'll meet SHIMIZ and negotiate it.

486
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:59,073
You need to resolve it by next week.

487
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,243
I'm scheduled for the OEM contract.

488
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:06,281
Then we should fly immediately.

489
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,019
Mr. Yoon, this is my first overseas deal.

490
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,353
Anything I should be aware of?

491
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:16,558
You should be aware of their rules.

492
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:18,026
Because we're visiting them.

493
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:20,495
It's disadvantageous for us.

494
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:22,463
Not really.

495
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,900
Both parties are expected
to obey the rules.

496
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,068
Nothing's disadvantageous for us.

497
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:28,937
As long as...

498
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:31,706
we know what the rules are.

499
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:35,176
(The Wanderer in Japan)

500
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:05,940
Yes?

501
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,478
Come in.

502
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,717
- Sit down.
- Yes.

503
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:17,352
Are you coming from WIND?

504
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:18,887
Yes.

505
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:23,024
I ended up giving you a hassle.

506
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:25,126
No.

507
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,462
You've already proceeded with it.

508
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,765
YUMIN Investment Banking told me.

509
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,367
You stopped it...

510
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:35,236
when a negative opinion came up.

511
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,938
Yes.

512
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,842
Because WIND focuses
on the high-end market,

513
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,112
its expansion was an issue.

514
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,216
That's why I gave up on it.

515
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,121
But when I heard what you said
to the chairman,

516
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:55,990
I was ashamed.

517
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:58,059
No.

518
00:30:58,293 --> 00:30:59,994
And the article.

519
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:02,130
It was written by a reporter I know.

520
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:04,465
Reporter Han Ji Eun?

521
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:05,934
Yes.

522
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,769
When we acquired CHACHA Games,

523
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,837
she wrote an article...

524
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,706
that we were acquiring DC.

525
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,541
And she asked me about it.

526
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,343
I see.

527
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,513
So this is up to me to resolve.

528
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,715
It's also part of Project M.

529
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,385
As you said,

530
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:26,955
the bicycle companies aren't doing well.

531
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,525
Is Speed the biggest company in Korea?

532
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:31,893
It's the biggest bicycle company.

533
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:34,629
I'm sure they had a big gear supply.

534
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:38,099
But they put it off
after paying the penalty.

535
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,935
What a timing.

536
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,204
Speed regrets it too.

537
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:45,540
Only if they knew,
they wouldn't have paid the penalty...

538
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,308
and handed it over to WIND.

539
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:49,110
Right.

540
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,580
It's time. You should go.

541
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,149
- I'll see you when I come back.
- Yes.

542
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:58,119
What's that?

543
00:31:58,987 --> 00:32:01,990
I found it
in the Japanese business language.

544
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:05,059
Have you heard of honne and tatemae?

545
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,094
Of course.

546
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,896
Are you talking about euphemism?

547
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:08,796
Yes.

548
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,900
Mr. Oh, you're a genius.

549
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,902
Now we're talking.

550
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,705
Is that honne?

551
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:22,343
If we increase the quantity,
we can reduce the price.

552
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,311
But...

553
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:28,750
Japan hates changing the plan the most.

554
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,721
We're increasing it by ten times.
Why would they hate it?

555
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:36,424
That's possible. They go by the manual.

556
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:43,965
- We will soon take off.
- Fasten your seatbelts.

557
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,600
Fasten your seatbelt, please.

558
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:48,269
Can you close the tray?

559
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:50,104
Can you put the seat up?

560
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:51,773
- Close the tray, please.
- Yes.

561
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,808
Can you put the seat up?

562
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,414
Hi.

563
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:03,184
- Hello.
- Hello.

564
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,156
Thank you for making the long journey.
I hope it was pleasant.

565
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,390
I'm Ryu Ozaki.

566
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:11,593
Joo No Yoon from SANIN.

567
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:14,696
I appreciate you taking the time
to come out and see me today.

568
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,297
No, the honor is ours.

569
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:19,100
Are you Mr. Yoon Joo No?

570
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,070
I'm Hirose Haruka. Call me Hirose.

571
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:25,206
Hello. I'm Yoon Joo No.

572
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,841
You're fluent in Korean.

573
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:30,011
No, I'm still learning.

574
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,680
I'll take you to the bus.

575
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:45,793
What's wrong?

576
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:49,097
The limo isn't here.

577
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,633
Have you called them?

578
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,502
What? What's wrong?

579
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:57,672
Did you call them
or are they not picking up?

580
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,608
Are you sure you checked?

581
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:04,612
Then...

582
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,983
I'll drive them. Take the cab.

583
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:09,817
Yes.

584
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:13,721
If you go ahead, I'll meet you there.

585
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,056
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,257
It's okay.

587
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:18,793
Mr. Yoon, I'll take the other car.

588
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:19,961
Okay. Thanks.

589
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,162
No.

590
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,330
No, I'll go with you.

591
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,598
I'm really sorry.

592
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,066
Don't be.

593
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,468
I'm the youngest.
I prefer going by myself.

594
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,971
I'm also the youngest.

595
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,951
How much are you thinking?

596
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:51,726
I'm going to ask for this discount.

597
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:56,598
That sounds reasonable.

598
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:02,103
Look to your left. That's Mount Fuji.

599
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,973
That's wonderful.

600
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:05,974
Yes.

601
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:09,344
It's quite rare to have such a clear day,
you know.

602
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:11,679
It only happens 30 percent of the time.

603
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:14,382
You know many Japanese people

604
00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:17,852
never even get to see Mount Fuji
in their lifetime.

605
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,988
Seems like we caught a lucky day.

606
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,089
Of course.

607
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,660
Would you like to see it up close?
I mean if we get the chance?

608
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,996
Yes, if we get the chance.

609
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:29,197
How long will you be staying?

610
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:33,535
Until the deal is done.

611
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,671
I see.

612
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:46,648
I'm sorry to take you by cab.

613
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,084
No, you can stop apologizing.

614
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:51,619
Okay.

615
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:58,626
I brought something from Korea.

616
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:03,164
Do you...

617
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,501
want this?

618
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:09,537
I heard this is what Japanese people buy
when they come to Korea.

619
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,239
No, it's okay.

620
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,311
If you don't like it,

621
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:20,248
how about this?

622
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:25,420
Thank you.

623
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:32,227
You're considerate.

624
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:34,863
Considerate?

625
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,097
Yes.

626
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:42,971
Excuse me.

627
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:45,740
Hello?

628
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:47,242
Yes.

629
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:51,946
What? Are you hurt?

630
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:55,850
That's better.

631
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,786
We're taking the cab.

632
00:36:58,786 --> 00:36:59,721
Okay.

633
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:03,091
One second.

634
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:08,329
Can you tell me when you're returning?

635
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,197
What?

636
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:11,499
I need to reserve the limo...

637
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:13,134
in advance.

638
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:16,604
I'll make sure you don't ride in a cab
when you leave.

639
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:17,438
My apologies.

640
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:18,706
No, it's okay.

641
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:23,311
We're leaving at 7 p.m. on the 14th.
It's Saturday.

642
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:26,981
Then 4 p.m. at the hotel?

643
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,285
Sure.

644
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:35,990
For 4 p.m. on the 14th, please.

645
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:40,328
Yes. Thank you.

646
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:45,533
The limo got into an accident on the way.

647
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,202
That's why they didn't show up.

648
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:48,169
I'm sorry.

649
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,138
You don't need to apologize.

650
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:58,213
How did you make the time to visit
when you were busy?

651
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:02,917
While I'm here, I want to check it out.

652
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,552
But we already have
the next meeting scheduled.

653
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,595
It's cute.

654
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:34,883
(SHIMIZ)

655
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:50,598
I'm Yoshida Wusamu.
The Overseas Sales Team leader.

656
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:51,733
Glad to meet you.

657
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,036
Joo No Yoon from SANIN M&A Team.

658
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,571
The pleasure is all mine.

659
00:38:57,372 --> 00:38:59,474
I'm Kwak Min Jeong from SANIN.

660
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:01,309
- I'm Yoshida.
- Yoshida.

661
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:05,313
I'm Naito Senichi. Nice to meet you.

662
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:06,681
Nice to meet you.

663
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,923
Our request is to increase it
by tenfolds...

664
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:16,758
which is 10,000.

665
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:27,468
The original order was 1,000.

666
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:30,872
You want to order 9,000 additionally?

667
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:31,806
Yes.

668
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:35,810
I'll have to check.

669
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:47,722
We only produce...

670
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,724
a limited quantity...

671
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,926
according to the manual
for our quality assurance.

672
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,228
Thank you for your understanding.

673
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:56,264
Are you saying you're out of supply?

674
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,406
It's possible,

675
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,742
but we can't give you a discount.

676
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,379
You have the discount manual...

677
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,114
based on order quantity.

678
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:25,293
He mentioned the in-company discount rate.

679
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:29,764
That's only for general cases.

680
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:33,101
WIND is a special case.

681
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,271
What is the manual for special cases?

682
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,656
We need time to check internally.

683
00:40:54,656 --> 00:40:58,426
Why don't we call it a day
and get some rest?

684
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:01,729
If there is no manual pertaining
to special cases,

685
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:05,233
should we proceed with the existing
discount rate?

686
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,604
We'll consider it fairly.

687
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,273
Thank you for your understanding.

688
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:16,277
Thank you.

689
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:34,229
Can you wait here for a second?

690
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:36,531
I'll take you to the hotel.

691
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:48,376
What did he mean by considering it fairly?

692
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:50,445
Is he saying no or yes?

693
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:51,713
That means no.

694
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:52,714
What?

695
00:41:56,618 --> 00:41:59,654
Considering it fairly is tatemae.

696
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:03,091
And saying no is honne?

697
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:06,628
It's hard.

698
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:10,131
You can't say additional production is
possible without discussion.

699
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:13,234
Are you going to refuse it
if the discount rate is zero?

700
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:17,906
You know how much the sales dropped.

701
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,041
Sir.

702
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,877
Did we have a manual for this case?

703
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,015
Probably...

704
00:42:27,015 --> 00:42:28,816
- not.
- Right?

705
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,156
Hirose, show them the way.

706
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:35,990
Yes.

707
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,393
Do your best.

708
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:41,629
Hirose.

709
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:42,530
Yes?

710
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:45,086
It's all up to you.

711
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:46,554
Yes.

712
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,793
It seemed the sales manager
and the factory manager...

713
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:53,862
had a disagreement.

714
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:55,697
Yes.

715
00:42:56,064 --> 00:43:00,168
Still, the sales manager said
they had enough supply.

716
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:02,704
But...

717
00:43:03,505 --> 00:43:06,508
what if they bring a fake manual
for the special case?

718
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:09,210
We can't accept that.

719
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,847
Still, it won't be easy
for them to fool us.

720
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:15,450
They don't know how much we know
about them.

721
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:19,287
Sorry for making you wait.

722
00:43:20,188 --> 00:43:21,122
This way.

723
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:25,360
Let's go.

724
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:25,320
It's okay.

725
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,956
I'll wait here.

726
00:44:28,723 --> 00:44:30,525
You'll wait for us?

727
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:32,994
Yes, I thought you wanted to
see Mount Fuji.

728
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,330
It's okay.

729
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:37,565
Okay.

730
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:44,372
How long is that going to take?

731
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:46,708
An hour will do.

732
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,944
- We'll go then.
- Okay.

733
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:52,247
Thank you.

734
00:44:54,215 --> 00:44:57,118
If we take over Speed's supply,

735
00:44:57,118 --> 00:44:58,720
is it difficult to take over...

736
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,655
according to their original contract?

737
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:03,558
It probably depends on the contract.

738
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:06,728
SHIMIZ might have added a condition
about resales.

739
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,766
Isn't this monopoly, Mr. Oh?

740
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:13,668
Probably not. For this to be...

741
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,470
I'm sorry,

742
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:17,939
but can you keep your voice down?

743
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:19,507
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,210
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:31,052
Ready.

746
00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:33,721
Let's make a heart.

747
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,656
A heart.

748
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,225
Make a heart.

749
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,162
One, two, three.

750
00:45:44,632 --> 00:45:45,733
Take a look.

751
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:49,270
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

752
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:51,372
It's a nice place.

753
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:53,875
I'm glad you like it.

754
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:54,909
Thank you.

755
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:56,644
Thank you.

756
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:58,613
Let's return to the hotel now.

757
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,081
Yes.

758
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:18,700
This is Shuzenji.
It's known for its hot spring.

759
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,568
Shuzenji?

760
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,504
Have you been here before?

761
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:25,240
No, I saw it online.

762
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,876
Then...

763
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:29,944
can you spare me ten minutes?

764
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:32,280
There's a place for a foot bath.

765
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:35,150
- Ten minutes?
- Yes.

766
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:41,489
Sure.

767
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,292
Shuzenji, please.

768
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:48,530
If there are any cycle companies...

769
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,099
that haven't canceled the contract yet,

770
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:54,235
we should suggest taking over...

771
00:46:54,235 --> 00:46:56,004
without paying the penalty...

772
00:46:57,005 --> 00:46:58,439
It's best to keep your head cool...

773
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:00,775
and feet warm.

774
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:02,210
It's wasabi ice cream.

775
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,779
- Wasabi ice cream?
- Yes, it's for you.

776
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:20,495
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

777
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:22,864
How is it?

778
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:25,467
Is it good?

779
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,135
- It's good.
- It's good.

780
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,270
I like it.

781
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:35,810
Shall we?

782
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:40,048
It's time for dinner.

783
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:41,716
Are you okay with kaiseki?

784
00:47:41,716 --> 00:47:43,084
(Kaiseki, multi-course dinner)

785
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:45,186
Why not?

786
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:48,089
I hope we're not causing you harm.

787
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:51,593
Actually, I made the reservation already.

788
00:47:51,593 --> 00:47:53,895
You can't have it
without making a reservation.

789
00:47:53,895 --> 00:47:57,098
Then we have no reason to refuse.

790
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:59,267
If we do, we're causing her harm, right?

791
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:02,770
- Let's go.
- Yes.

792
00:48:11,246 --> 00:48:14,082
You'll be served eight courses.

793
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:14,949
They'll give you a brief description...

794
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:17,685
for each course.

795
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:20,288
The description will...

796
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,223
make it taste even better.

797
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:24,692
If you need anything,

798
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,060
don't hesitate to tell me.

799
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,098
Thank you for bringing us here.

800
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:32,066
Thank you.

801
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:33,468
Enjoy your meal.

802
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:37,071
I feel bad for eating by ourselves.

803
00:48:37,071 --> 00:48:38,139
Not at all.

804
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:40,375
Enjoy your dinner.

805
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,978
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

806
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,021
They're important clients.
Please take good care of them.

807
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,689
Understood.

808
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:00,822
Is it good?

809
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:02,023
Yes.

810
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:05,293
If you don't mind,
can we talk while eating?

811
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,162
- Sure.
- Yes.

812
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,265
What's the max price we can offer them?

813
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:13,902
It's 35 dollars
with a 30 percent discount.

814
00:50:14,702 --> 00:50:15,904
Then...

815
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,356
Here is the second course.

816
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,461
Where is the restroom?

817
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:41,796
Go straight outside.

818
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:42,997
Thank you.

819
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:00,582
Hello?

820
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:05,887
This is Lawyer Oh Soon Young
from SANIN M&A Team.

821
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:07,622
Hello.

822
00:51:08,223 --> 00:51:11,626
I called you because you put off...

823
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,294
your order at SHIMIZ.

824
00:51:13,294 --> 00:51:14,696
Yes, that one.

825
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,732
I was wondering if we could take over.

826
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,268
Yes.

827
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:24,239
Right? Then it's the best for both of us.

828
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,475
Can you tell me the discount rate
on the gear?

829
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:29,777
Yes.

830
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:35,083
Thank you.

831
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:40,121
If you don't mind, can you text it to me?

832
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:41,823
Yes, it's okay.

833
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:43,391
How's it going?

834
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,628
Good. They're having kaiseki.

835
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,697
Make sure to take good care of them
to the end.

836
00:51:49,697 --> 00:51:50,632
Yes.

837
00:51:51,332 --> 00:51:53,301
Are you still having a meeting?

838
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:55,703
Yes. Why?

839
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:58,973
Should I join you
after I take them to the hotel?

840
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:03,244
Sure.

841
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:06,748
Call me when you're done.

842
00:52:08,316 --> 00:52:10,752
Only if Speed didn't cancel the contract,

843
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,388
I would be moving to Tokyo right now.

844
00:52:13,388 --> 00:52:14,656
Why do you...

845
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,025
want to go to Tokyo so badly?

846
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,061
You were born in Shizuoka.

847
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:23,198
It's not that I don't like Shizuoka.

848
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,502
I respect...

849
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:31,606
your artisan spirit.

850
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:35,443
But a white collar like me
is getting less and less chances here.

851
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:38,580
Even at our company.

852
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:41,549
They're moving the headquarters to Tokyo.

853
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,219
It's not that I want to leave.

854
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:47,055
My spot in Shizuoka is disappearing.

855
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:01,803
Our clients are still sightseeing.

856
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,640
I guess they're not interested
in business.

857
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,542
That's great.

858
00:53:08,543 --> 00:53:11,479
How did you find out about their deadline?

859
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:15,216
I was doing my best for the company.

860
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:20,889
Good job.

861
00:53:23,057 --> 00:53:25,226
You want to move to
the Tokyo headquarters too, don't you?

862
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:32,534
I'm going to the restroom.

863
00:53:45,213 --> 00:53:46,981
I want to go to Tokyo too.

864
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:49,984
If you take me with you, I'll do my best.

865
00:53:52,387 --> 00:53:54,556
I don't have what it takes to go there.

866
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:59,260
It might be possible
if WIND signs the contract.

867
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:02,030
True,

868
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:07,635
but would they accept it?

869
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,739
They wouldn't leave empty-handed.

870
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,808
Right.

871
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:17,078
I'll do my best.

872
00:54:44,939 --> 00:54:47,108
Thank you for showing us around.

873
00:54:47,108 --> 00:54:48,109
Thank you.

874
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,777
Good work.

875
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:51,679
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

876
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,648
See you tomorrow.

877
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,051
Bye.

878
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:19,774
There isn't much in the Tokyo branch.

879
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:22,343
There isn't much in Shizuoka.

880
00:55:24,012 --> 00:55:25,213
We have Mount Fuji.

881
00:55:25,213 --> 00:55:27,248
That's all you have.

882
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,350
Mount Fuji... What does Tokyo have?

883
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,119
And... Well...

884
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,288
What's in Tokyo?

885
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,823
Okay. There's Tokyo Tower.

886
00:55:34,823 --> 00:55:37,392
Tokyo Tower?

887
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,262
- Tokyo Tower?
- Sky Tree.

888
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:42,897
Sky Tree? Never seen it.

889
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,809
I'm done.

890
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,245
Should I join the meeting?

891
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:02,450
You had a long day. You're good to go.

892
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,918
I don't mind.

893
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:09,054
Don't push yourself.

894
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:11,090
Well done today.

895
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,057
Thank you.

896
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,393
Bye.

897
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,433
I thought I'd leave after working.

898
00:56:22,034 --> 00:56:23,402
We still got to look around.

899
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:26,105
She's going to show us the city around
tomorrow.

900
00:56:27,072 --> 00:56:29,408
I wanted to be helpful,

901
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:31,510
so I studied Japanese culture.

902
00:56:32,077 --> 00:56:34,947
But we won't be leaving
just after sightseeing, right?

903
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:39,418
Do you want to get to work?

904
00:56:41,186 --> 00:56:42,388
Come to my room.

905
00:56:46,191 --> 00:56:49,395
Mr. Oh, can you go over
Speed Bicycle's contract?

906
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:51,897
Yes, I already looked it up.

907
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:54,633
They set the discount rate
based on the quantity.

908
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:56,902
When did you do that?

909
00:56:57,703 --> 00:56:59,071
When we were having kaiseki.

910
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:05,944
Since we ordered 9,000,

911
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:08,947
if you look here,
the discount rate is 40 percent.

912
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:13,485
Yet they offered us zero percent.

913
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:15,354
- How can they do that?
- I know.

914
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:17,256
But we're the desperate ones.

915
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:19,992
It's still hot.

916
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:20,959
So hot.

917
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,595
How nice of you.

918
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:25,698
With that discount rate,

919
00:57:25,698 --> 00:57:28,233
WIND can produce a 4,000 dollar model,
right?

920
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:32,071
Yes, we need at least 30 percent.
So that's 10 percent extra.

921
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:33,305
Speaking of which,

922
00:57:34,173 --> 00:57:36,175
what if we cancel
our previous order of 1,000 gears...

923
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:38,077
and place a new order of 10,000?

924
00:57:38,077 --> 00:57:40,179
Then we can get a 50 percent discount.

925
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,280
No.

926
00:57:41,747 --> 00:57:43,482
That will ruin the contract.

927
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:46,085
They even refuse to produce
additional quantity.

928
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:47,953
And it has to be over 10,000.

929
00:57:47,953 --> 00:57:49,989
So we need to place at least 10,001.

930
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:52,391
That will upset them and ruin everything.

931
00:57:54,226 --> 00:57:57,129
SHIMIZ already knows
that we need their gear.

932
00:57:57,129 --> 00:57:59,098
And it's us who want to sign the contract.

933
00:58:00,966 --> 00:58:02,901
SHIMIZ has no reason to rush.

934
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:06,638
What if they drag time...

935
00:58:06,638 --> 00:58:08,474
and refuse to sign the contract?

936
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:10,976
If they didn't plan to sign it,

937
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,245
they would've refused our visit.

938
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:17,616
They got us on the table
because there is something they want.

939
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:18,817
I see.

940
00:58:18,817 --> 00:58:21,720
If we waste our time like this
until the deadline,

941
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:23,956
we'll have no choice...

942
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:25,557
but to sign what they offer
on the last day.

943
00:58:27,493 --> 00:58:31,096
Perhaps, they're trying to buy time.

944
00:58:31,563 --> 00:58:32,931
Probably not.

945
00:58:33,465 --> 00:58:36,068
They probably have their reason.

946
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:38,270
They can't just waste time like this.

947
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,173
So it's important to hide
each other's deadline.

948
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:43,709
The deadline?

949
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,912
That we're leaving on Saturday.

950
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:54,286
No one leaked our information, right?

951
00:58:54,486 --> 00:58:55,921
Yes.

952
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:01,894
I'm sorry. I...

953
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:03,562
I'm sorry.

954
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,436
Why are you sorry?

955
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,806
She asked me about our departure,

956
00:59:13,806 --> 00:59:16,275
so she could reserve a limo.

957
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:17,609
So?

958
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:19,812
Did you tell her?

959
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:25,918
Really, Jin Soo?

960
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:28,887
I'm sorry.

961
00:59:32,124 --> 00:59:33,892
Jin Soo, can you do it?

962
00:59:34,293 --> 00:59:36,662
- Yes.
- Then try to talk her out...

963
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:40,132
since you're both the youngest. Okay?

964
00:59:40,132 --> 00:59:41,133
Okay.

965
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:43,802
It seems her boss yells at her a lot too.

966
00:59:43,802 --> 00:59:44,803
Really?

967
00:59:44,803 --> 00:59:46,872
I never yelled at you before.

968
00:59:46,872 --> 00:59:50,442
Did Min Jeong yell at you?

969
00:59:54,246 --> 00:59:55,314
Jin Soo.

970
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:58,050
We're not here to travel.

971
00:59:58,651 --> 00:59:59,985
Come to your senses.

972
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:01,954
See?

973
01:00:01,954 --> 01:00:03,589
It's your fault.

974
01:00:05,324 --> 01:00:08,394
I'm sorry.
I won't do that again next time.

975
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:10,629
There will be no next time.

976
01:00:12,431 --> 01:00:15,100
If we don't get it done by Saturday,
we'll be in trouble.

977
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,336
I'll make it up to you.

978
01:00:17,336 --> 01:00:19,672
So how are you going to make it up to us?

979
01:00:20,606 --> 01:00:23,575
If you're the youngest, act like one.

980
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:30,482
Are you sure you're acting?

981
01:00:30,482 --> 01:00:32,284
Keep going. Focus.

982
01:00:32,885 --> 01:00:34,119
Answer me.

983
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:36,355
I'm sorry.

984
01:00:59,878 --> 01:01:00,779
Excuse me.

985
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:16,462
They requested a meeting today.

986
01:01:17,262 --> 01:01:18,764
Do you think they noticed?

987
01:01:18,764 --> 01:01:19,598
Yes.

988
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:23,502
Their youngest employee was in trouble.

989
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:24,937
I see.

990
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,477
Sir.

991
01:01:31,477 --> 01:01:34,880
WIND requested a meeting today.

992
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:41,253
These Koreans are so bold.

993
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:45,457
How typical of them.

994
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:51,530
Considering that they revealed
their deadline,

995
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,298
they might have noticed it.

996
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:56,001
They seem to be in a rush.

997
01:02:00,506 --> 01:02:02,274
Is that okay with you?

998
01:02:02,274 --> 01:02:04,777
Okay.

999
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:05,978
Bye.

1000
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:11,050
Say we'll have the meeting
in the afternoon.

1001
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:11,984
Yes.

1002
01:02:12,985 --> 01:02:15,054
- Hirose.
- Yes?

1003
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:16,422
Don't make a mistake.

1004
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:18,357
Understood.

1005
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:25,464
We had to request this meeting
with short notice...

1006
01:02:25,464 --> 01:02:28,133
due to some scheduling conflicts
on our side.

1007
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:31,804
We appreciate you for taking the time
to meet with us.

1008
01:02:31,804 --> 01:02:33,339
I understand.

1009
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:36,875
We thought you had
a more flexible schedule.

1010
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:41,680
We wanted to show you around Shizuoka
while you were here.

1011
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:48,687
But it seems we might have kept you
longer than expected.

1012
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:52,424
Not at all.

1013
01:02:53,092 --> 01:02:55,394
Mount Fuji was incredible.

1014
01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:57,563
It made me want to visit Japan again.

1015
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:01,934
Now, regarding the contract,

1016
01:03:03,502 --> 01:03:05,938
what are your thoughts on our proposal?

1017
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:10,542
We went over it,

1018
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,578
but it's impossible.

1019
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:20,119
Is that your manual?

1020
01:03:24,923 --> 01:03:26,291
We're checking.

1021
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:29,595
If there is no manual for special cases,

1022
01:03:29,595 --> 01:03:32,931
will we also receive
the existing discount rate?

1023
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:38,871
They're asking if we could apply
the discount rate.

1024
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:49,581
We'll consider it fairly.

1025
01:03:52,117 --> 01:03:56,322
Excuse us. May we have a moment
to discuss this internally?

1026
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,391
Okay. Sure.

1027
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:12,971
They'll consider it fairly again!

1028
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:16,709
With a zero discount rate,

1029
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:19,745
it's more expensive
than the original price,

1030
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:21,113
so it's better to cancel the contract.

1031
01:04:23,248 --> 01:04:26,719
We don't have time
to discuss the unit price.

1032
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:31,190
They already know our deadline.
It won't be easy.

1033
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,393
But our deadline means...

1034
01:04:35,227 --> 01:04:37,162
their deadline as well.

1035
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:45,804
(The Art of Negotiation)

1036
01:05:16,268 --> 01:05:18,937
SHIMIZ is not willing to sign
a contract with us, right?

1037
01:05:18,937 --> 01:05:20,506
I thought you were a spy.

1038
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:22,041
Mr. Yoshida...

1039
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:24,243
needs to raise his record, right?

1040
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:26,245
If the deposit goes up,

1041
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:27,680
the total amount should go down, right?

1042
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,581
Who's in charge of listing?

1043
01:05:29,581 --> 01:05:31,583
Are you saying it's my fault?

1044
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,185
How did the contract go?

1045
01:05:33,986 --> 01:05:35,954
The deadline is imminent.

1046
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:39,124
Because we cannot trust your company.

1047
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:42,094
So? Did he sign the contract?

1048
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:44,763
But he said he'll have to
raise the deposit.

1049
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:47,833
The photo of DAICHI in your office.

1050
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,102
I'll need that photo.

1051
01:05:55,913 --> 01:05:57,913
