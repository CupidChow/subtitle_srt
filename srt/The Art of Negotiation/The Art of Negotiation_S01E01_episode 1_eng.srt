12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,090
 Hey, Yun Ju No is coming. 

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,380
 Serious? Who said that? 

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,880
 Yun Ju No isn't even in Korea. 

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,000
 Exactly! He is supposedly on his way. 

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,590
 It's going to be chaotic. 

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,430
 Attention, passengers, we will arrive at Incheon International Airport shortly. 

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,140
Due to bad weather, we may experience turbulence.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,190
 Please fasten your seat belts. 

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,730
   

21
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,580
 That Yun Ju No is coming? 

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,940
 Indeed, that M&amp;A* legend, Yun Ju No. 
 (*Mergers and acquisitions) 

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,140
 Some of our subsidiaries might be in trouble. 

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,530
 Please, don't let it be us. 

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,670
 I still have years left on my apartment loan. 

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,360
 If I get fired now, 

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,950
 I can't even pay my credit card bills next month. 

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,870
 That's why there is a sudden board meeting today. 

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,940
 You're right. 

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,310
 I've never seen the higher-ups so flustered before. 

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,150
- Sir. 
 - Hey.

32
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,810
Did you hear anything?

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,230
I didn't.

34
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,310
 But M&amp;A doesn't always mean selling, right? 

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,350
 Yun Ju No could be coming to buy another company. 

36
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,940
 Hey, haven't you been watching the news? 

37
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,040
 There are rumors everywhere saying that we're going under. 

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,920
 He's not buying anything. 

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,180
 He's coming to take us down. 

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,400
 That's why everyone is panicking. 

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,090
 Goodbye. Thank you. 

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,100
 Goodbye. 

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,140
   

44
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,650
   

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,460
Who's coming that there's such an uproar?

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,970
There's this guy named Yun Ju No.

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,470
He handles M&amp;A.

48
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,860
He–

49
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,470
But do you even know what M&amp;A is?

50
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,360
Isn't it buying, selling, and merging companies?

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,930
What would an intern like you know?

52
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,000
Sure.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,300
People who don't know may think like you.

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,960
Hey,

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,550
I'll teach you.

56
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,170
M&amp;A is... not about buying and selling.

57
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,240
It's about killing off and saving.

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,720
  ­ 

59
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,820
Look at this guy.

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,180
Hey.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
What is a corporation?

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,740
It's an entity created by law.

63
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,040
M&amp;A is... either merging two together or eliminating them.

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,620
Look.

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,630
If you erase an entity, isn't that basically murder?

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,550
Come on, how is that murder?

67
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,130
This guy!

68
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,160
What happens when a company is sold?

69
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,180
Its employees are all laid off.

70
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,600
If they get laid off, they lose their salaries.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Then what about their families?

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
They would starve. You know?

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,700
And that can lead to some ending their lives.

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,420
Ever heard the phrase, "Layoffs are murder"?

75
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,790
That is true, but...

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,350
Also, that guy Yun Ju No...

77
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,350
 Hey, 

78
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,640
 do you know what his nickname is? 

79
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,970
 What is it? 

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,660
 White Snake. 

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,590
 White Snake? 

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,400
 Yes, White Snake. 

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,860
 Yes, a white snake. 

84
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,150
 He moves silently 

85
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,030
 and eliminates prey without a trace. 

86
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,660
But why is he called White Snake?

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,900
You could call him a viper or a cobra.

88
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,710
It means he's so cold-blooded that he's pale.

89
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,300
Hey.

90
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,990
Why do people do M&amp;A?

91
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,310
Money.

92
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,150
It's all about money.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,460
They buy a 10 billion won company for 100 million

94
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,870
and flip it for 100 billion.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,910
Do you think a guy who does that

96
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,000
would care if a few hundred or

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,100
a few thousand employees like us lost their jobs?

98
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,640
Not at all.

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,600
So if he's an M&amp;A expert,

100
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,680
that means he's a psychopath.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,310
Is that why he's called White Snake?

102
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,050
So...

103
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,310
if Yun Ju No is coming to the headquarters,

104
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,690
it means it has already begun.

105
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,250
What has?

106
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,310
Managing Director, when Yun Ju No arrives,

107
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,380
he'll cut us up into pieces.

108
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,860
Exactly.

109
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,990
We need to come up with a plan.

110
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,930
What plan?

111
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,160
He worked under me for ten years.

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,460
Do I need a plan just because he's coming?

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,270
I was wondering if Yun Ju No's coming

114
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,620
was Mr. Lee's doing.

115
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,870
Mr. Lee always says he wants to retire,

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,420
but who knows how he truly feels.

117
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,910
If Mr. Lee is calling in Yun Ju No

118
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,950
 to use him as his sword... 

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,590
   

120
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,370
Please take me to Sanin Headquarters.

121
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,660
 Executive Director, I arrived at the airport. 

122
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,570
   

123
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,450
Yes?

124
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,150
- Executive Director? 
 - Hello.

125
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,190
Why come all the way here?

126
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,400
You could've gone ahead.

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,570
We should take you since we're on the way.

128
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,590
Goodness.

129
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,890
Do you understand now

130
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,660
what it means for Yun Ju No to come?

131
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,500
Hello.

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,350
Hello.

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,150
With increased volatility in global financial markets,

134
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,040
the stability of financial companies is decreasing.

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,920
Thus, the financial authorities decided that risk management is necessary

136
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,800
and have recommended that banks maintain a BIS* ratio of over 13%. 
  (*Capital Adequacy Ratio) 

137
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,620
Sanin's main bank, Hanbit Bank, currently has a 12% ratio.

138
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,660
As a result, they have effectively conveyed

139
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,030
their refusal to postpone the due date.

140
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,050
Those bank jerks begged us to borrow money,

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,180
and now they're demanding payment.

142
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,740
Moreover, the debt ratio of our Sanin Group

143
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,120
is 428%, which is somewhat high compared to

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,310
the average debt ratio of the top 10 corporations,

145
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,720
which is 250%.

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,100
We already know all this from the documents, so let's get to the point.

147
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,570
The Private Placement Fund has publicly demanded

148
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,620
that we reduce our debt ratio.

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,550
So the financial papers are covering this crisis.

150
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,460
Some even mention the possibility of bankruptcy.

151
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,000
We asked you to get to the point. You don't get it.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,490
They're demanding payment. How much is the debt?

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,830
Okay.

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,630
It's 11 trillion won.

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,760
By when?

156
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,500
It's due by the first quarter of next year,

157
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,620
but we should take care of it this year.

158
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,850
Are you joking?

159
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,870
Eleven trillion won isn't chump change.

160
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,130
We don't have to do everything the bank says.

161
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,920
What business operates with its own money?

162
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,170
At the end of the last quarter, the Chairman promised to reduce

163
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,100
Sanin Group's debt ratio on the market to 200%.

164
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,180
Our stock price, which was declining sharply,

165
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,500
rose by 11% that day.

166
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,540
Since then, it has retained its upward trend

167
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,600
and is currently 40% from its previous low.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,280
But will our stock prices crash if that promise can't be kept?

169
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,700
Yes.

170
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,560
We must come up with the funds to pay it back.

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,590
You're a Sanin employee, right?

172
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,870
You work at a good company.

173
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,390
Sanin has the best apartments in Korea.

174
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,370
Look over there.

175
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,750
Sanin built all those.

176
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,250
   
 (*Convertible Bond) 

177
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,820
   

178
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,270
Besides the bank loans, we also have private placement convertible bonds.

179
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,860
Yes.

180
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,350
The amount we borrowed with CB from the funds

181
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,040
is three trillion won.

182
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,480
When is the private placement due?

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,300
It's due in the first half of next year.

184
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,800
They overlap.

185
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
- But we can extend that one. 
 - Yes.

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
What is the put option again?

187
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
If our stocks drop below

188
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,030
the conversion price of 100,000 won,

189
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,980
the private placement can re-fix it

190
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,760
or demand principal and interest repayment.

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
So that means if our stock prices fall below 100,000 won,

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
they'll take all our shares?

193
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes. If the entire loan is recouped as shares,

194
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,500
the private placement fund will

195
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,690
become the majority shareholder.

196
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,870
The chairman will collapse.

197
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,730
What a mess. What a mess.

198
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,950
But the current stock price is supported

199
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,640
at 150,000 won.

200
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,030
So unless there's a major negative factor,

201
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,520
it won't be affected.

202
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,790
That is a relief.

203
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,660
- A relief! 
 - A relief?

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,370
Goodness.

205
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,170
So what are we supposed to do?

206
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,960
You are saying to pay off the 11 trillion

207
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,990
and maintain the stock price.

208
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,900
Yes.

209
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,200
- At all costs. 
 - Yes.

210
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,110
He got us into this mess,

211
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,520
but he talks like it's not his problem.

212
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,260
Isn't that his specialty?

213
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,880
How did things end up like this?

214
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,360
I don't think it's time to be arguing that.

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,990
That's what I'm saying.

216
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,420
I feel we'll receive a lot of media attention.

217
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,360
Probably.

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,910
The current regime is in the second half of the term

219
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,830
and will need an excuse for the economic failures.

220
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,280
If we catch their attention, then,

221
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,850
we can't even expect any stimulus measures.

222
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,590
Forget stimulus measures.

223
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,150
If they make an example of us,

224
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,620
we'll be criticized on display.

225
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,230
Then our Sanin Group could cease to exist.

226
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,990
Thus, the chairman told us to give it our all

227
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,860
with the fate of the group on the line.

228
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,190
Mr. Lee, don't you have anything to say?

229
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,500
All right.

230
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,380
That is why

231
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,330
Team Leader Yun Ju No is coming.

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,800
What line of work do you do?

233
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,620
I was wondering what you did in Sanin.

234
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,150
You kept looking over the files.

235
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,210
I buy and sell.

236
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,740
You're in the sales department, I see.

237
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,950
 Pardon? 

238
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,900
I heard there's a problem with him.

239
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,030
If you bring someone like him back to HQ,

240
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,680
what will the employees say?

241
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,290
Exactly.

242
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,080
How can a troublemaker who ran off

243
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,000
have the nerve to return to HQ?

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Managing Director,

245
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
I think there's a misunderstanding.

246
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,720
What misunderstanding?

247
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,120
Please tell me if I am misunderstanding something.

248
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,560
Well, since he's already coming,

249
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,400
you should at least hear him out.

250
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,610
Did you call for him, Mr. Lee?

251
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,250
No.

252
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,740
The chairman did.

253
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,970
You all must have your opinion

254
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,390
on this as executives.

255
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,300
Let's have some coffee while we talk.

256
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,260
We've already got a headache.

257
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,500
Come, let's get coffee.

258
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,820
Hurry!

259
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,020
If we delay, the line will get long.

260
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,470
All the executives

261
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,000
seem to hate Mr. Yun Ju No.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,690
Hey, would you like him if you were in their shoes?

263
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,750
Especially Mr. Ha...

264
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,400
hates him on another level.

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,480
Why?

266
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
Other executives are

267
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,800
worried they'll lose their positions,

268
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,610
but for Mr. Ha,

269
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,470
Yun Ju No was his underling.

270
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,360
- Really? 
 - Yes.

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,590
Before Mr. Ha became the CFO, he led the M&amp;A team.

272
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,610
 ­  

273
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,100
 Mr. Ha has nowhere to go now. 

274
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,360
 It's either he becomes the CEO, or he's out. 

275
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,600
 But the chairman is bringing back the guy 

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,470
 who worked under him to hand over his task. 

277
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,220
 Mr. Ha has to put it all out there. 

278
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,050
Hey, wait.

279
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,230
Let's go.

280
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,730
Why is the chairman doing this?

281
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,490
Why else?

282
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,900
He wants to push them to give it their all.

283
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,450
He's pitting them against each other

284
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,580
and keeping whoever wins and cutting whoever loses.

285
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,220
Then what will happen?

286
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,150
They'll absolutely give it their all.

287
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,300
No one wants to die,

288
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,050
so they'll do whatever it takes.

289
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,090
 Your drinks are ready. 

290
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,730
- Oh, okay. 
 - Thank you.

291
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,050
It came out so quickly.

292
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,420
Let's go.

293
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,770
Still,

294
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,860
isn't the gap between Mr. Ha

295
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,150
and Mr. Yun Ju No too big?

296
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,540
Mr. Ha is ranked second in power.

297
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,770
I am curious about that as well.

298
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,690
Does the chairman think of Yun Ju No as the next CEO?

299
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,270
Or is he giving Mr. Ha a chance to avoid blame

300
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,080
by using Yun Ju No as a scapegoat?

301
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,350
How could we know what he's really thinking?

302
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,540
Executive Director Lee is here.

303
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,250
Do you think the chairman really called him in?

304
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,430
I'm not sure.

305
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,980
Mr. Lee probably talked him into it.

306
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,070
Yes, I suppose.

307
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,350
Mr. Lee has direct access to the chairman.

308
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,290
Maybe he just called him in for no special reason.

309
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,820
Since Mr. Ha has to be the CEO now,

310
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,260
maybe he called in Yun Ju No

311
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,610
to have him do random menial tasks.

312
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,290
CEO Ju, you're young.

313
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,370
Pardon?

314
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,990
You have no idea how scary an old man's greed is.

315
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,010
You're young.

316
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,910
Anyway, it's war now.

317
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,320
If Mr. Ha wins, he will get the CEO position.

318
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,960
If he doesn't, he will be fired.

319
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,310
If Yun Ju No wins, well,

320
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,230
maybe he'll become an executive.

321
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,320
You said Mr. Yun Ju No is

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,740
a money-obsessed psychopath.

323
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,120
Why would they make him an executive?

324
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,450
Hey.

325
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,500
- That is why they'd make him. 
 - What?

326
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,490
Owners like guys like him.

327
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,890
He will make sure their money's safe.

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,940
Hey, wait inside the conference room.

329
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,130
Managing Director, here's the coffee.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 ­  

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,970
Whatever happens, he can't fix this.

332
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,660
I suppose.

333
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,600
I mean, I've never heard of

334
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,940
an 11 trillion won debt before.

335
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,580
He also needs to maintain the stock prices as well.

336
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,620
But what happens if he fails?

337
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,990
What do you think?

338
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,210
Yun Ju No will take responsibility for the mess

339
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,140
and leave the company.

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,100
Then you will naturally become the next CEO, right?

341
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
 I can accept Yun Ju No's return 

342
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,090
since that was the chairman's decision.

343
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,910
But who will he work under?

344
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,560
He had worked under you before,

345
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,530
and you are the CFO, so–

346
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,140
Me?

347
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,130
Mr. Yun has his own opinions.

348
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,900
Have him create his own team.

349
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,980
And if he needs anything, you can help him.

350
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,680
Hey.

351
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,370
He wants to draw a line

352
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,310
between friend and foe.

353
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,400
- Is that it? 
 - Yes.

354
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,850
I guess Mr. Ha is confident.

355
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,870
Then how will he form his team?

356
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,180
We can have people apply to join.

357
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,160
M&amp;A is quite popular.

358
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,390
Should I apply?

359
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,050
Do you want to board a sinking ship?

360
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,480
In any case,

361
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,600
what's the first thing Mr. Yun will sell?

362
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,500
Let's hear what plan Mr. Yun has

363
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,100
when he comes.

364
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,740
Do we have to hear it from Mr. Yun?

365
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,990
I'm the CFO of Sanin Group.

366
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,700
All right.

367
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,690
Then let's hear the CFO's opinion first.

368
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,180
 ­  

369
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,420
   

370
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,320
"Yook Cham Gol Dan."

371
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,270
"Yook" for flesh, "Cham" for cutting,

372
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,000
"Gol" for bone, "Dan" for severing.

373
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,240
Cutting one's own flesh to sever the enemy's bones.

374
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,550
The group is in crisis,

375
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,100
so we can't just sit and watch.

376
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,420
We've got a problem, so we need to cut it out.

377
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,110
Let's take a look

378
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,220
and see what's flesh and what's bone.

379
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,600
Here are the financial statements of Sanin Group affiliates.

380
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,020
First, the Construction division.

381
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,530
It was steadily growing,

382
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,320
and then its revenue doubled.

383
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,320
That was when I acquired Yongah, Inc.

384
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,710
Due to that, Construction is earning good revenue.

385
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,800
So why is our group in this mess?

386
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,810
Okay, these are other subsidiaries.

387
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,670
Most of them have negative revenues.

388
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,410
Hotel, entertainment,

389
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,810
travel agency, food products.

390
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,030
They're all in the red.

391
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,180
Gosh, it's a bloodbath.

392
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,310
Go to the previous slide.

393
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,610
What is that? Wind, yes...

394
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,070
The bicycle company that didn't even get listed!

395
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,410
So what does this mean?

396
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,630
Construction is carrying the entire company.

397
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,060
But now, it has reached its limit

398
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,200
and cannot sustain the rest of the group anymore.

399
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,690
So what will you do about it?

400
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,240
You can see it now, right?

401
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,950
You can see what's flesh and what's bone.

402
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,640
We have to cut off the dead weight.

403
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,940
We will calculate the revenue and operating profits

404
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,640
and start selling from the worst performers.

405
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,710
Are you kidding me?

406
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,960
Do you think a company is an idol audition?

407
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,030
Why? Why can't we do that?

408
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,040
Even the kids are competing so fiercely.

409
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,290
Shouldn't we be even more fierce to survive?

410
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,780
Managing Director,

411
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,290
how much do you plan to sell?

412
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,920
Until we secure 11 trillion won.

413
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,820
Wait,

414
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,960
if it's 11 trillion,

415
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,650
will you sell everything except Construction?

416
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,120
And why do you get to decide that?

417
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,430
Because this is what a CFO does.

418
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,440
Can't you see this?

419
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,910
No matter how much Construction earns for us, we're still 11 trillion won in debt!

420
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,900
If we don't cut off Sanin's limbs, we're about to lose its head, thanks to you!

421
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,990
But they're not the only division making a profit.

422
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,400
We are also...

423
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,940
making a profit.

424
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,260
You mean Sanin Fashion.

425
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,260
All right, Sanin Fashion.

426
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,200
Its revenue was 4.2 trillion won,

427
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,050
and its operating profit was 29.8 billion won.

428
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,900
With these numbers, it'd be better to

429
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,300
put that in the bank and collect interest, right?

430
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,990
It's not our fault last winter wasn't cold.

431
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,380
The fashion industry is heavily dependent on weather–

432
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,390
You should know and prepare for that in advance.

433
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,100
Don't you watch the news?

434
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,790
They talk about global warming and all.

435
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,250
Yet, you made a ton of padded jackets

436
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,630
and are sitting on inventory, unable to sell them even at half price.

437
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,160
CEO Min,

438
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,120
managing supply and demand is a skill too.

439
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,220
All right, next.

440
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,200
Sanin Hotel.

441
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,380
They said this would boom after COVID-19.

442
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,760
Does this look like a boom to you?

443
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,230
Come on. Honestly,

444
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,680
we were counting on China.

445
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,940
What can we do about the current political climate?

446
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,450
That's what I'm saying.

447
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,940
If you can't make it work,

448
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,690
you should shut it down.

449
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,690
Look.

450
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,030
Mr. Yun may have something to say about this, too—

451
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,080
That Mr. Yun—

452
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,190
Must I wait for Mr. Yun?

453
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,240
I'm sorry for making you all wait.

454
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,530
Hello, I'm Yun Ju No.

455
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,570
Thanks for making the trip here.

456
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,090
Do you know our situation?

457
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,150
I've looked over all the files you sent me.

458
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,800
So?

459
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,430
What are your thoughts?

460
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,950
I'll submit a report after analyzing the details.

461
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,020
Analyze?

462
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,190
I understand that a major sacrifice is needed.

463
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,780
However—

464
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,780
Hey, what's with this atmosphere?

465
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,970
You made it.

466
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,580
Sit down.

467
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,210
Are you confident?

468
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,030
Yes.

469
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,010
Is there anything I can help you with?

470
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,520
I need to select my own team members.

471
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,860
Okay. Make your own team.

472
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,720
Go for it.

473
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,860
Are there any...

474
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,760
applicants here?

475
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,740
Why?

476
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,330
Now that you think about it,

477
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,380
do you think things won't work out?

478
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,900
- I'll be going. 
 - Okay.

479
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,460
Then I'll be leaving to recruit my team.

480
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,800
- The applicant. 
 - Yes?

481
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,070
Let's have an interview at the office at 5 p.m.

482
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,640
All right, then.

483
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,800
 ­  

484
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,480
Are you crazy?

485
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,410
You're done for now.

486
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
I mean, he seemed pretty decent and...

487
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,900
- you said he's competent. 
 - Gosh, this guy!

488
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,450
Don't you know the basics of working at a company?

489
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,320
For employees like us, it's best not to stand out.

490
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,090
If this works out, I could be a full-timer—

491
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,690
What are you saying?

492
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,300
T-That's not how you should understand this!

493
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,100
You know nothing about politics!

494
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,530
 Can a team leader beat a managing director? 

495
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,980
 Yun Ju No is doomed— 

496
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,530
 He'll take all the blame for this. He's done for! 

497
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,600
 You're such a headache! 

498
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
What if Mr. Yun fixes this?

499
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,340
You said that he's competent.

500
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,500
Competent?

501
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,610
Hey, do you think 11 trillion won is a joke?

502
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,390
Someone earning 100 million a year

503
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,500
couldn't pay it off in 100,000 years.

504
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,390
Even if a monkey saved

505
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,050
100 million a year, while evolving into a human,

506
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,570
couldn't pay off 11 trillion won.

507
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,780
Seonbae.

508
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,250
What?

509
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,530
You're so quick with numbers.

510
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,450
Gosh, this guy.

511
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,390
You were so dense back in school.

512
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,600
You haven't changed one bit.

513
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,790
You were really clever back in school, too.

514
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,940
You're still the same.

515
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,110
This jerk.

516
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,260
Hey, you...

517
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,380
You're smiling now, but you're in big trouble now.

518
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,120
   

519
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,410
   

520
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,520
   

521
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,580
Please come this way.

522
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,400
Wow, you look great in uniform, Min Jeong.

523
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,870
Okay.

524
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,360
Min Jeong,

525
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,320
were you like this at the HQ, too?

526
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,620
What do you mean?

527
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,270
Were you also so stiff back at the HQ?

528
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,440
Or are you looking down on the storefront

529
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,530
because you're from HQ?

530
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,680
Min Jeong.

531
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,960
Do you think you'll go back to HQ?

532
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,700
While you're here, you need my support

533
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,840
for things to open up for you, Min Jeong.

534
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,180
You get what I mean, right?

535
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,960
Eonni, they need a consultation.

536
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,610
Okay.

537
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,980
- Hello. 
 -  Hello. 

538
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,850
Is this popular?

539
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,970
Let's see.

540
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,690
Honey, if you ask that here,

541
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,420
of course, she'll say everything's good.

542
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,030
She works here.

543
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,270
First, let me calculate your score.

544
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,520
It's 42 points

545
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,560
so you're at the estimated cutoff score.

546
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,720
For 84 x 84 apartments, there are 55 available,

547
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,270
but there are 2,380 applicants.

548
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,300
The competition is a little greater than 43:1.

549
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,200
That'll likely increase by three times,

550
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,330
so quadrupling it would be about 173:1.

551
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,640
See? They say lines they've memorized.

552
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,590
Right?

553
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,800
You can calculate it yourself. It's correct.

554
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,100
Give me a second.

555
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,260
She said 43

556
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,330
multiplied by 4, right?

557
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,420
Honey, 43 times 4 is 172.

558
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,320
But she said it was 173.

559
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,880
I told you that it's a little over 43.

560
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,490
To be exact, it's 43.2727272727 repeating.

561
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,840
So quadruple that would be 173.0909090909 repeating.

562
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,800
So 173 is the more accurate number.

563
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,370
Wow, you're like a computer.

564
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,910
Not really.

565
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,390
But the calculation is correct.

566
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,020
By the way, if you are pregnant...

567
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,760
How did you know that I'm pregnant?

568
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,060
What? Honey, are you pregnant?

569
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,930
Mr. Yun?

570
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,970
Mr. Yun, how did you get here?

571
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,310
I came by taxi.

572
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,380
No... I mean...

573
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,540
were you demoted?

574
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,830
It's not like that, but it's something similar.

575
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,340
Can you work with me?

576
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,060
Your consultation.

577
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,000
- Yeong Su. 
 - Yes?

578
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,960
If you're pregnant, get a different one for more kids.

579
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,620
I wouldn't get this one if I were you.

580
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,080
When did you get transferred here?

581
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,620
It was shortly after you left, Mr. Yun.

582
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,610
It was Mr. Ha's decision, right?

583
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,340
But working there was fun for me.

584
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,070
You should've gotten a new job.

585
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,450
Many places would've wanted you.

586
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,820
Actually, no one wanted me.

587
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,130
That's a relief.

588
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,600
Yes.

589
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,060
But where are we headed in Suwon?

590
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,340
Hyerang Legal Firm.

591
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,200
Attorney Oh Sun Yeong?

592
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,470
- Uncle. 
 - Yes?

593
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,350
Can't we order sweet and sour pork?

594
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,090
No, we can't.

595
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,400
We didn't get a single case this month.

596
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,420
You're to blame for that, not me.

597
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,320
Geez...

598
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,510
Hey, Attorney.

599
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,310
You know what I told you last time?

600
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,760
B-But we didn't order this.

601
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,930
Try it.

602
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,180
This is the best-selling dish in our restaurant.

603
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,910
Thank you.

604
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,870
I told you that realtor is badmouthing me, right?

605
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,970
I was wondering if that may be defamation.

606
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,820
It was the realtor?

607
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,240
What did he go around saying?

608
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,580
That rotten jerk went around saying

609
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,750
I used weird meat in my food!

610
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,820
Do you know how hard it is to catch pigeons?

611
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,980
So, the thing is,

612
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,260
there is defamation by truthful statement

613
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,300
and defamation by spreading false information.

614
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,840
Which one is it?

615
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,030
What does that mean?

616
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,930
I'm asking what meat you use.

617
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,750
Pigeons.

618
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,590
It's a joke.

619
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,530
A joke!

620
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,870
We only use Grade-A pork for our food.

621
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,410
Right?

622
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,270
Then it is spreading false information,

623
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,960
but just make peace.

624
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,170
From what I hear from the realtor,

625
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,130
you mocked him for being bald.

626
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,340
But he is bald.

627
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,790
Did I say something wrong?

628
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,040
I called him bald because he is.

629
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,090
Even if he wears a wig, it's obvious.

630
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,820
I mean, how is that defamation?

631
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,670
Well, you see,

632
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,180
that is defamation by truthful statements.

633
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,480
They say it causes mental distress,

634
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,020
and they punish it more strictly these days.

635
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,160
Bodily harm used to be more important,

636
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,360
but emotional pain is considered important now.

637
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,450
Whatever, whatever, whatever!

638
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm just going to sue him.

639
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,880
You two should just settle this.

640
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
That realtor keeps trying to scare me

641
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,600
saying his adopted son is a lawyer!

642
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,250
But are there still adopted sons these days?

643
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,600
In any case, I will sue him.

644
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,390
Writing up a complaint costs 50,000 won.

645
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Just make up instead of regretting it later.

646
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,020
No, I made up my mind.

647
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,920
I'll go to the police station today.

648
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,860
I'll sue him.

649
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,770
All right.

650
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,570
A lawyer is like a hunting dog. A hunting dog.

651
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,420
Exactly! I want you to bite that realtor.

652
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,980
I'll give you the money.

653
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,730
That's what I mean. If I bite the realtor,

654
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,220
will he just stay put?

655
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,690
He'll probably hire a lawyer.

656
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,240
And if he does and sues you, what will happen?

657
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,850
My lawyer will win, of course!

658
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,970
Those sons of bitches. Tell them to come at us!

659
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,120
Of course, I'd beat them all.

660
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,280
But lawyers don't fight each other.

661
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,690
His lawyer will tear at you

662
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,710
while I tear at the realtor.

663
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,410
It means you two will suffer

664
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,590
while the lawyers sit back and make money.

665
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,900
Then what do you want me to do?

666
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
Just make up.

667
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,400
This is why we can't afford sweet and sour pork.

668
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,080
Geez, you're built like a gangster, but you're so scared.

669
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,730
"Scared"? This is not about being scared.

670
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,800
How can you compare me to a gangster?

671
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,720
I'm cute, actually.

672
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,380
   

673
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,390
Son!

674
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,770
Have a cup of coffee before you go.

675
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,210
Why do you keep calling me son?

676
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,260
Our age difference isn't that much.

677
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,520
You don't have to be blood-related to be my son.

678
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,220
If I like you, you can be my son.

679
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,970
Others say you are scary because of your first impression,

680
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,190
but I find you cute.

681
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,040
Let's go inside.

682
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,400
I'll go ahead.

683
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,260
It was the...

684
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,030
Chinese food guy, who badmouthed you, right?

685
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,110
Did he trash me with you, too?

686
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,200
No, you hear about it if you are an attorney.

687
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,720
So, what will you do? You will sue him, right?

688
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,900
Just reconcile.

689
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,880
I heard you also said he uses pigeon meat in his dumplings.

690
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,720
Me? That's not true.

691
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,260
I never said that.

692
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,230
You told me that, too.

693
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,920
Oh, is that right?

694
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
So what about it?

695
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,100
That jerk insulted my appearance first!

696
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,100
But you know, it's easy to prove

697
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,580
their drop in revenue after the rumor spread.

698
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,510
All he has to do is show his ledger.

699
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,450
But it's difficult to prove that your feelings were hurt.

700
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,580
It's not like you can open up your heart and show it.

701
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,480
That's what I mean.

702
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,210
Do you know how hurt I was?

703
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,400
So you should consider your hurt feelings

704
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,390
and his loss of revenue even.

705
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,160
What are you saying?

706
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,600
How can you say that when you don't know my pain?

707
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,760
Ever since that jerk called me bald,

708
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,770
I'm embarrassed when I wear this

709
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,030
and when I take it off.

710
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,240
It feels like I'm not wearing it when I am,

711
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,030
and I feel like I'm wearing it when I'm not.

712
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,920
I am more sad that my son

713
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,010
doesn't know how I feel.

714
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,170
Well, so... um...

715
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,640
think about it and...

716
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,450
make peace.

717
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,930
  ­ 

718
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,640
 ­  

719
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,090
You have guests.

720
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,740
What? Guests?

721
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,250
Attorney.

722
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,830
Why don't you work on a project with me?

723
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,400
I had the most fun when I worked with you and Min Jeong.

724
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,680
It's not in my blood to fight,

725
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,530
so M&amp;A is perfect for me.

726
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,710
You look like you'd do MMA*, 
  (*MMA: Mixed Martial arts) 

727
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,480
but I guess M&amp;A is perfect for you.

728
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,760
But didn't I get cuter while we were apart?

729
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,660
My neighbors said I'm pretty cute.

730
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,670
I can't be part of this team if this is how it is.

731
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,170
Then are we doing this by ourselves, Mr. Yun?

732
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,240
Is that so?

733
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,010
There is one more person.

734
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,280
I set it up like this. Is that okay?

735
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm only here for an interview.

736
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,740
Everyone does it like this. It should be fine.

737
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,010
It looks a bit tacky...

738
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,410
Are you waiting for him?

739
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,510
Why are you here?

740
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,580
I thought I'd grab some coffee.

741
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,420
Seonbae, you drink coffee like it's water.

742
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,220
Hey,

743
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,710
"Coffee flows in an office worker's veins."

744
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,400
Don't you know?

745
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,130
The M&amp;A Team...

746
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,440
I feel bad for them.

747
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,380
- Why? 
 - Hey.

748
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,990
Let's go.

749
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll show you

750
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,480
what a successful team is like.

751
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,760
Why are we going there?

752
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,570
I know, right?

753
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,130
I'm bringing an intern to such a high-level place.

754
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,090
Hey, this is the highest floor.

755
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,120
There is a floor above this one, though.

756
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,320
That is the chairman's office.

757
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,350
For normal employees, this is the highest floor.

758
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,350
All right.

759
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,790
On the left, there's Mr. Ha.

760
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,220
And on the right, there's Mr. Lee.

761
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,310
All right, Jin Su.

762
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,700
Look at this.

763
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,210
There's class here.

764
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,210
Hey, Jin Su. You know,

765
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,850
if you work with me,

766
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,800
you get to drink stuff like this,

767
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,530
and if you work down there in that corner

768
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,000
with that doomed team,

769
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,440
you'll just drink instant coffee all the time.

770
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,240
Do you understand?

771
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,230
So what do you think?

772
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,510
Will you work with me?

773
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,320
Are you scouting me?

774
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,930
That depends on your behavior.

775
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,830
But it's rumored that Mr. Yun is the heir.

776
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,470
Oh, really?

777
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,750
I thought I was the heir.

778
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,150
The chairman said

779
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,420
he won't pass ownership to his child.

780
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,840
I don't know if that's a good thing.

781
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,930
Due to that, office politics got more fierce.

782
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,100
But I heard the chairman has a secret daughter

783
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,830
and he will marry her off to Mr. Yun.

784
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,300
That's why he won't pass ownership to his child.

785
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,180
Who told you that?

786
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,530
I just happened to overhear it.

787
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,930
Oh, really?

788
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,360
But Mr. Yun Ju No...

789
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,020
Is the chairman okay with that?

790
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,550
He's a married man.

791
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,100
What?

792
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,590
Mr. Yun is a married man.

793
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,520
He's married.

794
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,210
By the way, did you come by yourself?

795
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,020
Yes.

796
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,040
You should've brought her with you.

797
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,590
Then did you come back to Korea for good?

798
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,190
Not sure.

799
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,400
Does that depend on how this project goes?

800
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,170
When this project is over,

801
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,450
I'll probably get fired.

802
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,360
Whether it goes well or not.

803
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,460
 In any case, for Yun Ju No, 

804
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,880
if he fails this project, he's screwed for failing.

805
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,530
If he succeeds,

806
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,250
he's screwed for getting on Number 2's wrong side.

807
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,570
- Mr. Ha? 
 - Yes.

808
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,260
Hey, it's better to fail than to get on the future CEO's wrong side.

809
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,170
Working is all about politics and picking the right side.

810
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,290
This is...

811
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,050
historically proven to be an unchanging truth.

812
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,460
Hey.

813
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,900
Did Yi Sun Shin die because he was bad at fighting?

814
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,790
Even if you're great, you'll die if you can't navigate politics.

815
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,940
The moment you work under Yun Ju No,

816
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,740
you will end up having the same fate as him.

817
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,700
So you should just...

818
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,340
think about how you'll fail the interview.

819
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,130
   

820
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,870
 Yes? 

821
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,550
Hello, I'm Intern Choi Jin Su.

822
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,860
Is there a reason you applied for the M&amp;A Team?

823
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,970
Yes.

824
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,400
I felt it was an opportunity to learn from you.

825
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,430
We have to procure 11 trillion won right now,

826
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,590
while keeping our stock price above 100,000 won.

827
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,900
You know that, right?

828
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,880
Since you heard it in the meeting room earlier.

829
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,120
Yes.

830
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,090
Wait, how was an intern there?

831
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,590
I couldn't leave when the meeting suddenly started

832
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,830
while setting up the refreshments.

833
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,090
What is our company's market capitalization?

834
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,000
I know it to be around 19 trillion won.

835
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,960
What if we pay off our goal of 11 trillion won?

836
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,270
The market capitalization?

837
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,780
Yes.

838
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,200
There's no way to know.

839
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,150
Why is that?

840
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,700
If we pay it off, shouldn't it go back up?

841
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,280
The current stock price already reflects all that.

842
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,220
Will it then remain at 19 trillion won?

843
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,230
No. It will probably change,

844
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,160
but I think it's up to how Mr. Yun performs.

845
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,790
You were a president of a stock investment club.

846
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,700
 This is Manager Yang Hyeon Ah from the HR. 

847
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,420
 I'm contacting you via phone since you're 

848
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,750
 logged out of the company messenger. 

849
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,080
 If you give me a list of your members, 

850
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,740
 I'll process them as transfers. 

851
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,180
 Thank you. 

852
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,970
Did you profit?

853
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,460
-  Manager Kwak Min Jeong  
 - Did you lose money?

854
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,220
 and Attorney Oh Sun Yeong. 

855
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,340
You're saying no to everything.

856
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,620
I don't know yet since I haven't cashed out yet.

857
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,090
What's your current return on investment?

858
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,090
It's 700%.

859
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,700
Wow.

860
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,470
I think I just got lucky.

861
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,920
What team do you want to join if you don't make it?

862
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,520
Pardon?

863
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,160
Oh, well...

864
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,790
Actually, someone had asked me to work with him.

865
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,040
Already? Where?

866
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,910
I don't know if I can tell you, but he's in the HR Team.

867
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,730
The HR Team is a popular department.

868
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,300
I guess they were impressed with you, Jin Su.

869
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,960
I suppose they'd be the first to notice a talent.

870
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,660
No, I prefer the M&amp;A Team.

871
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,570
 Does the HR Team have an opening? 

872
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,900
Did you say it was the HR Team

873
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,280
that offered you a position?

874
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,770
Yes.

875
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,930
 On our HR Team? 

876
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,270
 No, there isn't. 

877
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,350
 Are those two the only members for the M&amp;A Team? 

878
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,870
 Yes. 

879
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,030
Finally, do you think this project will succeed?

880
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,540
No.

881
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,600
Then why did you apply?

882
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,800
To be honest,

883
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,880
I've heard some rumors about you, Mr. Yun.

884
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,100
I feel you'll do everything you can

885
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,550
in the process of this project failing.

886
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,210
I think I'll learn a lot from that.

887
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,640
But it might succeed, though.

888
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,060
True, true.

889
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,990
Let's see how it turns out.

890
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,000
Have I been accepted?

891
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,200
I'm Kwak Min Jeong.

892
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,500
I'm in charge of finance.

893
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Okay.

894
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,770
I'm Oh Sun Yeong.

895
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,960
I specialize in corporate law.

896
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,010
I do a bit of everything.

897
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,130
 Including Intern Choi Jin Su, 

898
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,510
 there are a total of three people. 

899
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,830
Could I ask you a question, Mr. Yun?

900
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,950
Yes, ask away.

901
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,510
By chance,

902
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,940
are you married?

903
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,570
Yes.

904
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,700
Aigoo, goodness.

905
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,000
What's wrong with your stamina?

906
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,900
You need good stamina

907
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,000
if you want to accomplish big things, right?

908
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,450
I haven't been able to work out lately,

909
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,940
but I was gifted with natural stamina, Chairman.

910
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,170
I'm not so sure about that.

911
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,480
No, really, Chairman.

912
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,200
I'll improve my stamina right away.

913
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,300
Good, good.

914
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,000
As you should if you want to do big things.

915
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,750
Work is all about

916
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,000
stamina in the end.

917
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,960
Would you like a cup of tea?

918
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,010
Yes, I'd like one.

919
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,710
Is this our product?

920
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,480
Yes, this is a tumbler from Bareun Lifestyle.

921
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,330
Being eco-friendly is in right now,

922
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,860
so many young people are buying it.

923
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,740
Making those probably harms the environment more.

924
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,560
But that's popular among young people?

925
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,170
I know, right?

926
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,180
That won't sell well for long.

927
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,560
Tell them to make affordable and pretty ones.

928
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,100
Okay.

929
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,620
I have a long way to go before I can attain

930
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,930
your level of insight.

931
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,080
Thanks for the tea.

932
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,800
Managing Director Ha.

933
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,440
Yes, Chairman.

934
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,370
If you want to...

935
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,400
climb up higher,

936
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:41,450
you need to know how to manage people well.

937
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,930
Why do everything yourself?

938
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,350
Just have others handle it for you. Got it?

939
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:50,670
Yes. I'll take that to heart, Chairman.

940
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,180
 ­  

941
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,800
What will you do about lunch?

942
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,560
I've reserved a restaurant.

943
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,830
Let's eat another time.

944
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,440
I'm not that hungry.

945
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,830
Okay.

946
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,850
Hey,

947
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,580
saving the company is the first priority, okay?

948
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,020
Pardon?

949
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,330
Oh, yes. I'll keep that in mind, Chairman.

950
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,910
Where did you park your car?

951
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,100
Oh, I parked it over there.

952
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,610
Get going, then. Bye now.

953
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,110
Let's go.

954
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,560
Goodness.

955
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,660
Hey, look. Let me see behind us.

956
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,530
That's enough. Let's go now.

957
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,700
Should I take you home?

958
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,250
 I'm going to the flea market today. 

959
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,560
 Do you have time? 

960
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,290
Forget that. Let's go to Cheonggyecheon.

961
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,340
Why did you ask me to come out?

962
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,790
Is he trying to discipline us or something?

963
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,400
Managing Director.

964
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,880
- Mr. Ha, you're here. 
 - Did you go hiking?

965
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,300
Yes, with the chairman.

966
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,790
Just the two of you?

967
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,170
Yes, we go occasionally.

968
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,290
You must've talked to him a bit.

969
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:27,340
He always says the same things.

970
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,860
"Take good care of the company"

971
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,520
and "You have to do well."

972
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,130
But he spoke so strongly today that

973
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,030
it made me wonder...

974
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,040
if I should accept it now.

975
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,070
Since the chairman is getting old now,

976
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,110
I'm worried our company may end up in trouble.

977
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,190
Of course.

978
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,680
He didn't say anything regarding Yun Ju No?

979
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,360
He probably implied it.

980
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,530
Since operating the group includes everything.

981
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,530
Here you go.

982
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,960
Mr. Ha, I'll buy you a drink today.

983
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,570
I'll make a reservation right away.

984
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,690
This place is really tasty.

985
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,810
No, no. Next time.

986
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,670
I already ate with the chairman.

987
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,890
What will happen to Mr. Lee?

988
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,820
He'll probably leave, right?

989
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,130
- Probably. 
 - Yes.

990
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,160
He should. Let's go.

991
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,530
Sir, how much is this?

992
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,890
- Do you want to buy that? 
 - Yes.

993
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,740
You know your mother-of-pearl*. 
  (*pearlescent interior of mollusc shell) 

994
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,420
It's 500,000 won.

995
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,830
That's expensive.

996
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,570
500,000 won is cheap for mother-of-pearl.

997
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,710
So what if it's cheap

998
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,520
when I don't have that much money.

999
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,710
How much do you have?

1000
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,270
Maybe about 400,000 won.

1001
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,390
Okay.

1002
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,050
Wait, wait, wait.

1003
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,190
Why are you buying something useless again?

1004
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,310
He says this is mother-of-pearl.

1005
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,820
Mother-of-pearl or clam.

1006
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,550
Why would you buy a used item?

1007
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,350
Let's go get some noodles.

1008
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,510
Let's go.

1009
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,400
Damn that wretched jerk.

1010
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,300
Why interfere?

1011
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,610
Thank you.

1012
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,880
Your tastes don't change from your youth.

1013
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,970
Of course not.

1014
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,750
That's how it becomes a cherished memory.

1015
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,540
You're right.

1016
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,010
Why are you quitting?

1017
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,200
You're bringing that up again.

1018
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,120
You and I share so many memories.

1019
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,870
It makes me so sad.

1020
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:20,080
I just thought it was time to leave now.

1021
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,830
I feel like I've become greedier.

1022
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,550
They say an old basin can hold much more.

1023
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,510
What more could you want when you have everything?

1024
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,220
My desire for people.

1025
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,810
People are leaving me as time goes by.

1026
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,130
I can't help it when people die,

1027
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,290
but when a live person runs away from me,

1028
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,550
that's no good.

1029
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,970
How could you say that when so many follow you?

1030
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,710
They just want my company since I'm not passing it

1031
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,100
to my children. How can I trust those people?

1032
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,870
That's why...

1033
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,200
I depend on you a lot.

1034
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,770
I'm sorry.

1035
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,960
You're not interested in passing it onto Mr. Ha?

1036
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,990
Well, let me see...

1037
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,930
We'll see.

1038
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,300
In any case,

1039
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,500
about Yun Ju No...

1040
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,490
- Yes? 
 - You said it was your final request

1041
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,420
so I brought him back.

1042
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,440
However, I don't trust him.

1043
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,420
- Okay. 
 - So until he finishes his job,

1044
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,230
you can't leave me.

1045
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,070
I really want to rest a bit.

1046
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,670
If that guy causes trouble again,

1047
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,000
won't you have to take responsibility for it?

1048
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,380
You know, I'm trusting you,

1049
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,580
not him. Do you understand?

1050
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,410
I understand.

1051
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,950
But...

1052
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,090
Yun Ju No isn't like that.

1053
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,730
Forget it. Stop it. Okay?

1054
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,940
Aigoo, friend.

1055
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,910
How could you be so naive at your age?

1056
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,400
What will you do without me?

1057
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,180
You tried to buy a used mother-of-pearl. Aigoo...

1058
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,670
Goodness.

1059
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,510
Just eat your noodles. Okay?

1060
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:57,280
 I was curious about something. 

1061
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,200
 Okay. 

1062
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,310
 Do you have a different reason for coming to Korea? 

1063
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,620
 I know you called me back to Korea 

1064
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,840
 to save Sanin, Executive Director. 

1065
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,610
 I asked if you have any ulterior motives. 

1066
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,910
 Yes. 

1067
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,820
 If you are working with such a motive, 

1068
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,880
 take your hands off of it. 

1069
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,950
 Mr. Yun, 

1070
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,240
 if you work with such a motive, 

1071
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,380
 you will mess up the task and ruin yourself. 

1072
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:03,040
   

1073
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,750
 How could I ruin myself more than I already am? 

1074
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,040
   

1075
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,620
You're here.

1076
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,240
You all came in early.

1077
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,950
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

1078
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,000
No. I slept well.

1079
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,860
Let's hear it.

1080
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,540
   

1081
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,420
It's true that Construction is carrying the rest.

1082
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,740
The problem is Construction's profit margin

1083
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,730
is also trending down due to delays

1084
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,930
in easing regulations on reconstruction.

1085
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,500
But for Construction,

1086
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,900
a change in regulations can give it momentum,

1087
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,840
so its profit margin could rebound.

1088
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,160
The market price for selling every subsidiary,

1089
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,570
apart from the Construction, is about 7 trillion won.

1090
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,880
If selling all but Construction gets us to 7 trillion,

1091
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,800
could we produce 11 trillion if we do well?

1092
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,190
It won't be easy, but it's not impossible.

1093
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,000
If we sell other subsidiaries well,

1094
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,060
- it's not impossible? 
 - No.

1095
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,810
The only thing is, the sales

1096
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,930
are lagging overall.

1097
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,170
Why?

1098
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,040
Our failure to enter the online market

1099
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,700
is a major factor.

1100
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,370
Most of our key businesses

1101
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,570
rely on offline store sales.

1102
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,050
Other companies started transitioning to

1103
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,190
D to C* more than a decade ago. 
  (*Direct to Consumer) 

1104
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:49,040
Now, their online sales make up a larger portion.

1105
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,750
In comparison, Sanin has

1106
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,830
barely any presence in the online market.

1107
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,060
Only in Fashion, I guess.

1108
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,370
Honestly,

1109
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,810
it's a miracle they haven't gone under yet.

1110
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,210
Everyone shops on their phones nowadays.

1111
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,910
But...

1112
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,180
why aren't they making the shift?

1113
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,900
If you order on your phone,

1114
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,390
it arrives the next morning.

1115
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,060
The fact they only sell in offline stores...

1116
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,170
I'm honestly shocked

1117
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,600
that Sanin doesn't do online sales.

1118
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,120
I see you were very shocked, Intern.

1119
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,130
We don't even do advertising.

1120
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,000
- No advertising? 
 - No.

1121
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,520
Sanin Group's subsidiaries fall directly under HQ,

1122
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,800
which means the chairman's opinion is crucial.

1123
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,500
But shouldn't someone tell him that this won't do?

1124
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:41,060
- Right. 
 - But who will do that?

1125
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,120
Hello, I am Team Leader Yun Ju No of the M&amp;A division.

1126
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,130
I'll start with the corporate analysis.

1127
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,170
First, I'll start with the name

1128
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,890
for the project to raise 11 trillion won.

1129
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,790
 Let's come up with the project name first. 

1130
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:05,590
 This is the most important part. 

1131
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,770
 Naming is always the hardest. 

1132
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,100
 Since we're taking on an impossible mission... 

1133
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,380
 How about this? 

1134
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,750
 Project Mission Impossible. 

1135
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,720
 - That's too long. 
 - It's too long, I see. 

1136
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,990
 How about you give us one, Ms. Kwak? 

1137
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,880
 I think this project will be 

1138
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,440
 a big momentum driver for Sanin. 

1139
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,770
 Project Momentum. 

1140
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,980
 Project Momentum... 

1141
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,250
 It doesn't roll off the tongue. 

1142
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,430
 We're the M&amp;A Team. 

1143
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,700
 Jin Su is good at 

1144
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,320
 stating the obvious like it's new, right? 

1145
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,280
 M&amp;A, Mission Impossible, 

1146
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,760
 Momentum... 

1147
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,200
 Since they all start with M... 

1148
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,050
The project name is

1149
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,700
Project: M.

1150
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,420
We reviewed the corporate report you gave me.

1151
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,820
Thanks to your cooperation,

1152
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,810
we were able to complete due diligence.

1153
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,440
Now, let's go over the prepared materials.

1154
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,070
You'll see most of the profit margins are not good.

1155
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,640
But you also gave strategies for growth this year

1156
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,410
so we reviewed them together.

1157
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,610
Construction made

1158
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:11,920
half our revenues last quarter too.

1159
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,950
Yes, that's right.

1160
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,940
But due to the overall poor condition of the group,

1161
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,430
the sale of certain businesses is inevitable.

1162
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,900
We're aware of that, too.

1163
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,200
- Get to your conclusion. 
 - Okay.

1164
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,790
I will now announce the business to be sold off.

1165
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,100
 If we sell everything except for Construction, 

1166
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,710
 we may be able to raise 11 trillion won? 

1167
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,150
 Yes, though, it won't be easy. 

1168
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,950
 Could it be that not entering the online market 

1169
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,880
 actually works in our favor? 

1170
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,200
 What do you call that again? 

1171
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,600
 Untapped potential. 

1172
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,310
 Not entering the online market is untapped potential. 

1173
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,690
 We could get 30% more based on that potential. 

1174
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,210
 No. 

1175
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,200
 Due to its late start, 

1176
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,120
 there will be marketing costs involved. 

1177
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,710
 It's going to be tough. 

1178
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,560
 You mean construction laws could change, right? 

1179
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,280
 Government policies are favorable for construction. 

1180
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,910
 - Why? 
 - With the election coming up, 

1181
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,760
 they'll try to prevent an economic slowdown. 

1182
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,000
 If that happens, companies like Sanin Construction 

1183
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,100
 that secured strong regional projects will benefit. 

1184
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,920
 Construction really is profitable. 

1185
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,130
 Yes. 

1186
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,140
 Then we have no choice. 

1187
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,080
We reviewed all the subsidiaries

1188
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,990
and arrived at the following conclusion.

1189
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,340
   

1190
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,920
We will sell off Construction.

1191
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,300
Are you crazy?

1192
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,720
 - If we sell off Construction— 
 - Hey. 

1193
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,360
Sanin stays afloat with Construction.

1194
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,000
If we sell Construction, we'll be doomed.

1195
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,300
We're not doomed even if Sanin Construction is sold.

1196
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,850
It'll be close,

1197
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,800
but we won't go under from selling Construction.

1198
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,150
Yun Ju No, shut your mouth.

1199
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,230
You're absolutely crazy.

1200
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,100
Let's hear him out a bit more.

1201
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,400
"Hear him out"? He's talking nonsense!

1202
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,330
Hey...

1203
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,690
you're doing this to target me.

1204
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,060
You're not trying to save the company.

1205
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,580
You're trying to take me down!

1206
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,130
Isn't that right?

1207
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,360
Is there anyone who doesn't know that

1208
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,430
Construction keeps Sanin afloat?

1209
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,480
As you've said,

1210
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,000
even the market knows that Construction is

1211
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,800
carrying Sanin Group.

1212
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,670
So if we keep Construction and sell the rest,

1213
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,680
at that very moment,

1214
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,480
Sanin will go down.

1215
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,700
What?

1216
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,030
If Sanin sells everything except Construction,

1217
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,910
the market will say we're keeping what's profitable

1218
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,360
and selling off the bad ones.

1219
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,910
In other words, we won't be selling them

1220
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,140
but throwing them away.

1221
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:52,920
Then we can't sell them at their proper value.

1222
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,510
People won't pay a fair price

1223
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,800
for something that's thrown away.

1224
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,750
In that case, it's impossible to make 7 trillion.

1225
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,840
If so, this project

1226
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,120
will fail.

1227
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,990
 The opposition will be fierce. 

1228
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,550
 Indeed. 

1229
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,600
 Mr. Ha will not sit idle if it's Construction. 

1230
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,260
 That's true, 

1231
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,890
 but what do you think is right for Sanin? 

1232
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,510
 - Okay. 
 - I'll follow your opinion, Mr. Yun. 

1233
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,270
 Let's do that then. 

1234
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,020
 Oh, how about you, Jin Su? 

1235
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,460
 I also believe your opinion is right, Mr. Yun, 

1236
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,810
 but will the stock price be okay? 

1237
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:31,910
 If Construction is out, 

1238
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:34,560
 Sanin will become a loss-making company. 

1239
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,970
 But that doesn't mean we'll be delisted. 

1240
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:42,370
 Okay. We're buying ourselves some time first. 

1241
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,490
Even so,

1242
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:49,170
Sanin Construction will only be a bit over 6 trillion.

1243
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,730
Construction has the benefit of regulatory easing.

1244
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,460
It's possible to get up to 7 trillion.

1245
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,270
Well, what we need is 11 trillion won.

1246
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,350
How about the rest?

1247
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:01,450
We can't fix all the problems at once right now.

1248
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,100
If we secure 7 trillion won after selling Construction,

1249
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,640
- we can look for the next— 
 - You...

1250
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,140
You said you agreed with my opinion.

1251
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,810
How could you betray me like this after that?

1252
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,400
Yes.

1253
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,720
I completely agree with your opinion, Mr. Ha.

1254
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,000
"Yook Cham Gol Dan."

1255
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,480
"Cutting one's own flesh to sever the enemy's bones."

1256
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,900
I also believe we should do that.

1257
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,720
The only thing is

1258
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,030
the flesh that Sanin must cut off

1259
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,180
is Construction.

1260
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,150
You jerk!

1261
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,530
Sit down.

1262
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,780
Sit, sit.

1263
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,880
So how are things going?

1264
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,690
Well,

1265
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,610
we will sell Construction.

1266
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,270
How much can we get for it?

1267
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:15,580
The current market value can reach 7 trillion won.

1268
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,240
Come on.

1269
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,500
We should get at least double digits for it.

1270
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,710
Pardon?

1271
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,130
Sanin Construction was my first business.

1272
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,580
So...

1273
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,850
shouldn't we get a fair price for it?

1274
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,180
Chairman.

1275
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,360
Getting 3 trillion over the market value is—

1276
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,920
Why?

1277
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,370
You don't think you can do it?

1278
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,600
Well?

1279
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:06,850

1284
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,850
 If we want to save Sanin, 

1285
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,120
 we should sell the best thing we've got. 

1286
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,810
 The moment he said he'd sell Construction, 

1287
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,790
 he was done for. 

1288
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,460
 Ten trillion won is impossible. 

1289
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,740
 Then I won't sell it. 

1290
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,190
 He's digging so hard without realizing 

1291
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,140
 it's his own grave. 

1292
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,170
 You're the negotiation expert. 

1293
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,910
 Why don't you show me your skills? 

1294
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,720
 This crazy jerk—

01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,550
 M&amp;A fights with contracts. 

1296
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,820
 If you are emotional, you lose the war. 

1297
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,180
 How's the CEO here? 

1298
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,740
 You guys are pure thugs! 

1299
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,100
 I don't like any of it. 

1300
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,300
 I want to buy it cheaply. 

1301
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,940
 But we have to sell it at a high price. 

1302
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:19,340
