 Suspect Yun Ju Seok is your brother, right? 

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,170
 Yun Ju No? 

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,370
 This guy... 

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,870
 He's sleeping in front of a prosecutor. 

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,560
 Young man... 

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,870
 You are a young man, right? 

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,980
 You know? 

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,030
 How could you do something like this already? 

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,200
 You're so gutsy. 

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,660
 What are you suspecting me of doing? 

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,110
 You are suspected of using the info you learned in your M&amp;A work 

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,830
 to sell the acquiring company's stocks. 

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,080
 You know that, right? 

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
 Yes. 

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,900
 Do you admit it? 

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,240
 Okay. 

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,750
 No. 

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,070
 I'm saying I know I'm accused of that. 

30
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,760
 - I'm not saying I admit to it. 
 - Come on... 

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,460
 So you're going to be like this, aren't you? 

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,020
 Yu Ju No, this is only the background check on you. 

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,880
 Do you see this? 

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,250
 These are all yours. 

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,270
 Illegal stock transactions using insider info, 

36
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,090
 proxy trading, and breach of trust. 

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,680
 How much did you honestly make? 

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,430
 I'm really just curious. 

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,040
 I'll say this again, but I didn't— 

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,340
 Are you happy that you made a lot of money? 

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,250
 Are you happy? 

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,070
 Because of this, 

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,300
 more than 1,000 people lost all their savings. 

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,990
 All of those people went bankrupt, 

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,440
 and their families were destroyed. 

46
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,730
 Some people even committed suicide, Man. 

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,600
 How do you feel... 

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,730
 when you think about those people? 

49
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,590
 It's an unfortunate situation. 

50
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,950
 An unfortunate situation... 

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,170
 That's it? 

52
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,710
 I understand there may be allegations of insider trading. 

53
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,480
 - But— 
 - Right. 

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,530
 You did do something that may look suspicious, but you didn't do it. 

55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,780
 And I need to bring concrete evidence. 

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,330
 That's it, right? 

57
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,070
 That wasn't what I meant, 

58
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,540
 but now that I hear you out, 

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,710
 you have circumstantial suspicion, 

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,890
 but no actual evidence. 

61
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,800
 Is that it? 

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,300
 This jerk... 

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,140
 You really think prosecutors are a joke. 

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,830
 Yun Ju No? 

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,610
 You can go. 

66
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,850
 October 11, 2021, 17:00. 

67
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,670
 This concludes your witness investigation 

68
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,950
 for the charges of 

69
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,390
 illegal use of a company's confidential info 

70
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,350
 and proxy trading. 

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,680
 What's the reason? 

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,290
 The suspect's death. 

73
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,000
 The investigation is over so please leave. 

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,400
   

75
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,590
Hey, Mom.

76
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,870
 Did you just wake up? 

77
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,460
 Shouldn't you get ready for work? 

78
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,670
I go to work at 9:00 a.m.

79
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,570
And right now...

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,150
it's 6 a.m.

81
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,960
 You're lucky. 

82
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,380
 I wake up at 4 a.m., prepare breakfast, 

83
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,330
 and head to the orchard before sunrise. 

84
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,620
 Why did you call me? 

85
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,600
 You have a car, right? 

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,110
 My car? Why? 

87
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,520
 Let Sang Hun use it. 

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,560
 Why would Sang Hun use my car? 

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,370
 There's no need to say yours or mine in a family! 

90
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,920
 Whoever needs it should use it. 

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,520
 So why does he need a car? 

92
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,660
 Sang Hun is handsome, so whenever he goes out, 

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,080
 people ask him where he bought his clothes. 

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,690
 But if he tells them, that'd only benefit them. 

95
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,240
 Sang Hun could be selling them. 

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,860
 These days, you don't even need a store. 

97
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,400
 I heard you can make money selling online. 

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,290
 To do that, he will need to meet people. 

99
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,030
 Don't you think he will need a car? 

100
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,640
Did he say he will run an online shopping mall?

101
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,600
 That's right. 

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,550
 Tell your co-workers to buy them. 

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,640
 Also brag about your younger brother. 

104
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,040
 I'm not close to anyone at work. 

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,680
 Also, not just anyone can run a shopping mall. 

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,950
 Is Sang Hun just anyone? 

107
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,440
 Your only brother is trying to work things out. 

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,340
 Don't you feel sorry for him? 

109
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,160
 Why would I feel sorry for him? 

110
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,260
 ­  

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,990
 Do you know how much money he got from me? 

112
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,880
 If he needs a car, tell him to spend his money. 

113
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,950
 I sent you to Seoul alone, and now, you think you're all that. 

114
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,510
 Do you know how stressed he is 

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,470
 because he can't find a job? 

116
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,010
 Gosh, this is so upsetting! 

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,980
 I need my car for work. Let's hang up. 

118
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,640
 ­  

119
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,970
What's with the suitcase?

120
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,060
I came straight to work from Gimpo Airport.

121
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm dead tired.

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,760
Did you come back from vacation?

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,380
No, from a business trip.

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,520
What business trip?

125
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,000
You know the secretaries can't say anything, right?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,320
Pretend not to hear, not to see,

127
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,780
and not to know.

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,510
Here.

129
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,970
Thanks.

130
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,470
Why did you come to work so early?

131
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,490
You know my team also has many secrets, right?

132
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,700
I know.

133
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,040
How's working at the Secretariat? Is it okay?

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,830
Well, you know, we're just maidservants.

135
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,180
Thanks for the desserts.

136
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,330
- Have a good day. 
 - Okay...

137
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,540
 ­  

138
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,310
Oh, right, my coffee.

139
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,650
- Are you back from Jeju? 
 - Yes.

140
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,520
What did he say?

141
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,830
Good work.

142
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
This says the chairman used Sanin's stocks as collateral to secure a 50 billion won loan.

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,370
Be careful this info isn't leaked.

144
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,780
Okay.

145
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,880
Why did the chairman borrow 50 billion won?

146
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,600
If he used his personal stocks as collateral, it means he was in a rush.

147
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,980
Wouldn't the chairman have 50 billion won?

148
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,280
What?

149
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,690
Pardon?

150
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,170
Fifty billion won is a lot of money,

151
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,250
but he's the chairman of a large corporation.

152
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,150
It's rare to have 50 billion won in cash,

153
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,300
even for the chairman of a large corporation.

154
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,810
Not only that,

155
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,340
our chairman values control over Sanin

156
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,140
so he holds most of it in stock.

157
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,250
But he borrowed money using stocks as collateral?

158
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,510
This is strange.

159
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,870
Where do you think he spent it?

160
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,930
Chairman.

161
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,500
 Hello. 

162
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
Song Jae Sik...

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,830
   

164
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,320
   

165
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,740
Sanin's Sharing Management...

166
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,320
Patients with incurable diseases...

167
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,380
   

168
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,190
This is perfect.

169
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,350
I was craving something sweet.

170
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,470
Enjoy.

171
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,950
But it appears the chairman was in quite a hurry.

172
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,420
Yes. The interest rate was 10%, too.

173
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,960
At that rate, I wish I could lend to him.

174
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,260
Do you have 50 billion won?

175
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,480
No, I don't.

176
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,610
Indeed, eat this. It's tasty.

177
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,330
Thank you.

178
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,780
Don't serve tea. I'll be right out.

179
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,280
Okay.

180
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,920
Let me give you updates, Chairman.

181
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,250
Okay. Come in.

182
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,720
Did you get a call from Jeju?

183
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,190
He refused.

184
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,870
  ­ 

185
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,120
Is that all?

186
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,930
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

188
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,200
- Call in Mr. Ha. 
 - Okay.

189
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Mr. Lee as well.

190
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,370
I understand.

191
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,860
 ­  

192
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,420
Call in Mr. Lee and Mr. Ha.

193
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,840
Okay.

194
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,660
Yes, Chairman?

195
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,290
Yes, all right.

196
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,620
What is it?

197
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,120
He wants Mr. Yun to come in as well.

198
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,000
Mr. Yun has come a long way.

199
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
Yes?

200
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,110
 Mr. Ha, the chairman is looking for you. 

201
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,580
What? Oh, when?

202
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,920
 He says to come up right now. 

203
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,550
Oh, okay, okay.

204
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,640
Wait. How is his mood today?

205
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,500
He's in a decent mood.

206
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,770
Is this about what you told me yesterday?

207
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,460
Yes, I think so.

208
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,190
Did you look over that contract?

209
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes, I checked it.

210
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,390
It appears the chairman borrowed some money

211
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,810
with stocks as collateral in the past.

212
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,700
He needs to pay that back,

213
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,050
but he says he will sell his stocks to repay it.

214
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,770
Is he saying he will sell Sanin's stocks?

215
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,930
He says he will repay it that way if necessary.

216
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,560
No, he must not.

217
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,860
The market is doubting whether Sanin can repay its debt.

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,340
If the chairman sells Sanin's stocks now—

219
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,480
The stock price will drop, right?

220
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,950
Yes.

221
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,430
If that happens, PPF could exercise its option.

222
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,230
If that happens,

223
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,780
Sanin will fall into the PPF's hands.

224
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,290
But... why did the chairman need 50 billion won in cash?

225
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,860
I don't know.

226
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,020
You don't know where he spent it, either, right?

227
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,660
He's got a strong ego.

228
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,080
I think he's suffered in silence on his own.

229
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm the only one who knows about this.

230
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,380
And now, only the two of us know about it.

231
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,770
Okay.

232
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,250
 Come in. 

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,730
All right.

234
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,970
You don't have to worry, Chairman.

235
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,210
It's not like it's a lot of money.

236
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:55,080
Even so, there should be multiple ways to repay.

237
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,020
Which way are you thinking of, Mr. Ha?

238
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,070
We should do what's most beneficial to the chairman.

239
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,550
And what is that option?

240
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,080
Well...

241
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,220
Chairman, an interest rate of 10% is a bit high.

242
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,690
How about you switch to another loan?

243
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,790
That will be complicated.

244
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,890
Why?

245
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,900
It's due in about a month.

246
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,700
- There's too little time. 
 - That's why we need to rush.

247
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,400
We'll be in big trouble if we fail to get a loan or pass the deadline.

248
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,880
What big trouble? Did I borrow the money for free?

249
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,990
I heard you used stocks as collateral.

250
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,780
Exactly. They can just take my stocks then.

251
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,500
You cannot... do that.

252
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,630
Why not?

253
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,490
Why can't the chairman pay with his stocks?

254
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,060
They're his personal stocks.

255
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,770
The market is doubting if Sanin can repay the 11 trillion won.

256
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,630
Sanin will go under if it cannot.

257
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,920
But what will the market think if the owner sells his stocks now?

258
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,190
They'd think the chairman, who knows the company best,

259
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,000
is trying to escape first.

260
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,770
Will they say Song Jae Sik is trying to escape?

261
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,190
Yes.

262
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,250
Whatever, I don't care.

263
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,330
If you sell Sanin's stocks in this situation,

264
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,680
other shareholders will sell theirs, too.

265
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,200
If so, the stock price could plummet.

266
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,770
Look, no one will die just because the stock price drops.

267
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,970
Still,

268
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,220
you cannot sell your stocks.

269
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,380
What?

270
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,600
Insiders and major shareholders must disclose any sale of 1% of their stock

271
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,550
or assets over 5 billion at least a month in advance.

272
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,460
But with only 29 days left,

273
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,600
he can't sell even if he wants to.

274
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,800
Doesn't he need to disclose it within 5 days of the trade?

275
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,100
No, the law changed.

276
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,500
To prevent insiders from running off with the money.

277
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,640
He missed the timing.

278
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,330
Fifty billion must be paid in cash, no matter what.

279
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,990
With interest, it's 55 billion won.

280
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,270
You must pay it all in cash.

281
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,280
I don't have any cash. All I have is stocks.

282
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,310
Chairman, why would you need cash?

283
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,120
If you don't pay in cash now,

284
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,770
it will become a major problem later.

285
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,700
Are you sure?

286
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

287
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,320
Given the repayment notice was sent with 29 days left,

288
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,590
it seems the bank is also aware of this.

289
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,060
That's why you must pay in cash.

290
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,100
Exactly.

291
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,190
We need to borrow from elsewhere and repay the money quickly.

292
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,080
Do we just sit back and do nothing just because there's no time?

293
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,470
Whether it's banks or funds, we should reach out.

294
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,010
You said he needs to pay in cash.

295
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,660
But what if rumors spread?

296
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,350
- What? 
 - What if rumors spread that Sanin is going around

297
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550
to borrow 50 billion won?

298
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,360
If rumors circulate that Sanin doesn't even have 50 billion won...

299
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,410
Then selling the stocks may be better.

300
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,170
Hey! I said that's not possible.

301
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,930
Then what do you want me to do?

302
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,490
Tell me!

303
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,490
May I ask you what you used the 50 billion on?

304
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,800
Who do you think you are?

305
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,130
Must you know that, too?

306
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,530
Rather...

307
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,250
I think he's trying to come up with different ideas.

308
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,080
I bought a resort.

309
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,850
It looked nice...

310
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,400
and I wanted to use it to wind down.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
I see.

312
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,880
Of course, Chairman.

313
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,690
Other chairmen all have their own resorts.

314
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,100
Of course, you should have one, too.

315
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,070
I'm glad you did that.

316
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,990
Are you happy now?

317
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,020
Yes, Chairman.

318
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,610
Then may I also see the resort purchase contract?

319
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,390
Why would you need to see that?

320
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,810
How about reselling that resort?

321
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,800
Mr. Yun.

322
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,900
Yes, Chairman.

323
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,560
The things you're trying to sell when you got here.

324
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,660
They're like my babies.

325
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,640
You know that, right?

326
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,220
- Yes. 
 - So...

327
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,600
do you dislike my babies that much?

328
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,440
Well?

329
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,940
There are ones you can sell and ones you must never touch.

330
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,350
Okay.

331
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,890
Then Mr. Ha, are you saying we should borrow?

332
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,970
Yes. That will resolve this.

333
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,060
Mr. Yun is still lacking in experience.

334
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,430
He doesn't know how the market works yet.

335
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,670
You don't need to worry about this.

336
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,180
What about you, Mr. Yun?

337
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,520
I'll report back to you after considering it.

338
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,110
Okay then.

339
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,830
Whether you borrow or sell, you two work it out.

340
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,260
Pardon?

341
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,040
Mr. Yun and me?

342
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,240
Why? You don't want to?

343
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,340
N-No, Chairman.

344
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,300
We'll do it.

345
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,660
Yes, understood.

346
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,780
All right then. Let's end this here.

347
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,410
You guys can leave.

348
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,980
Mr. Ha.

349
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,500
Yes, Chairman.

350
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,800
Finish this before you go.

351
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,880
This is expensive stuff.

352
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,300
Okay.

353
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,490
It would've been better if I spoke to you separately.

354
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,730
But I rushed it, Mr. Lee.

355
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh, no, no.

356
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,480
We don't even have a month left,

357
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,490
so we should hurry.

358
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,620
In any case, it looks like he's having you two compete.

359
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,720
Will you be okay?

360
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,830
It doesn't matter to me.

361
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,640
It may become an opportunity for you, but...

362
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,510
Opportunities come with risks.

363
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,500
Yes.

364
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,140
But the resort that the chairman bought...

365
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,160
You don't know where it is either, right?

366
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,680
He didn't go anywhere out of the ordinary...

367
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,620
It seemed Mr. Ha didn't know either.

368
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,720
It seemed that way, right?

369
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,130
Yes.

370
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,770
Did the meeting go well?

371
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes.

372
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,170
Have you been to that resort, Chief Secretary?

373
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,110
Excuse me? I'm not sure what you mean.

374
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,290
The chairman said he bought one because he liked it so much.

375
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,450
Is that so?

376
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,340
I don't know much about that.

377
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,570
Thank you.

378
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,540
What for?

379
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,150
It's nothing.

380
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,490
Chief Secretary seems to know about it.

381
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,770
Yes. Even if he knows,

382
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,390
he probably can't say anything about it.

383
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,680
The Secretariat wouldn't have bought it directly.

384
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,720
They probably went through a middleman, right?

385
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,350
Even so, they also won't be able to say anything.

386
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,460
They probably signed an NDA before doing it.

387
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,960
I suppose.

388
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,420
But...

389
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,850
you won't actually sell the resort, right?

390
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,700
Do we have any other choice?

391
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,030
Okay. I understand.

392
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,900
I'll meet with the chairman again.

393
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,330
Mr. Ha.

394
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,590
Yes, Chairman.

395
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,650
Is what he said true?

396
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,290
He talked as if it'd be a major problem.

397
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,880
Oh, Mr. Yun?

398
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,330
It's not entirely without reason,

399
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,530
but it's just an excuse.

400
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,130
An excuse?

401
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,550
Yes.

402
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,660
Mr. Yun is essentially an outcast in this field

403
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,170
so he probably can't borrow that money in a month.

404
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,540
That's why he's saying that.

405
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,370
Then...

406
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,630
do you think you can do it?

407
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,900
Yes, Chairman.

408
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,170
Don't worry about it. I'll fix this.

409
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,060
There's not much Yun Jun No can do about this.

410
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,530
He lacks the experience to fix something like this.

411
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,310
Is that so?

412
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,810
Yes.

413
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,630
Aigoo...

414
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,980
I guess I've become an old man now.

415
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,160
I just want to rest now.

416
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,650
Pardon?

417
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,660
I hear Jeju is pretty nice.

418
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,500
Should I go live there?

419
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,740
Aigoo, don't say such a thing, Chairman!

420
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,120
Sanin can't run without you.

421
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,700
You're probably just tired.

422
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,780
If you leave the important work to me

423
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,450
and take some time to recharge, you'll be fine.

424
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,100
Could I do that?

425
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,600
Of course, Chairman.

426
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,800
Take a break, and I'll handle this problem.

427
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,740
Okay.

428
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,380
- Go ahead and eat. 
 - Yes.

429
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,180
Who do you think will fix this problem, Eun Jeong?

430
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,720
Between Mr. Ha and Mr. Yun?

431
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,310
Mr. Ha.

432
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,320
Really? Why?

433
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,570
Mr. Ha has a lot more experience

434
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,040
and has more connections.

435
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,620
Manager, you think it's Mr. Yun, right?

436
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,190
Why do you think that?

437
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,970
I just do.

438
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,330
Hey.

439
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,380
It's not because he's handsome.

440
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,700
Then why do you think that way?

441
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,040
Mr. Yun has a screw loose.

442
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,630
- Then wouldn't that be a problem? 
 - No.

443
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,760
I feel only someone like that can fix this.

444
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,610
I think that's why he'll cause trouble.

445
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,360
How did it go?

446
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,720
The chairman bought a resort with 50 billion won.

447
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,110
Aigoo.

448
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,350
It won't be easy to make a profit with a resort.

449
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,360
Well, Chaebols don't buy resorts to make money.

450
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,430
Really? How do you know that?

451
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,660
That's what I hear.

452
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,880
Why do they buy it then?

453
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,720
Kind of like a luxurious hobby?

454
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,130
Like how ordinary people buy luxury cars.

455
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,830
Buying a luxury car can ruin an ordinary person.

456
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,160
Oh, yes.

457
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,790
The chairman can't also be ruined.

458
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,260
So I think we can just resell that resort.

459
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,860
Since he bought it for 50 billion,

460
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,670
we can resell it for that much.

461
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,410
With interest, it's 55 billion won.

462
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,210
Oh, 55 billion won.

463
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,900
I want to find out if it's still worth that much,

464
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,190
but I can't figure out which resort it is.

465
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,490
Should we look up which resorts are worth 50 billion?

466
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,790
There are probably quite a few.

467
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,240
Yes.

468
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,480
Oh, we ate it all.

469
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,370
It was pretty good.

470
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,220
Should I give you mine?

471
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,840
The one you gave me earlier.

472
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,210
Mr. Yun, try this. It's pretty tasty.

473
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,310
Where did you get this?

474
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,550
My colleague gave it to me.

475
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,980
"Your colleague"?

476
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,790
Yes, she works in the Secretariat.

477
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,660
- This is... 
 - It's called Gwajeul.

478
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,930
They eat it a lot in Jeju.

479
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,330
Why do you know all this stuff?

480
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,840
I just...

481
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,870
tried it when I visited Jeju a while back.

482
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,440
Thank you.

483
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,200
Is that so?

484
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,100
Hello, Director.

485
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,520
 Hello, Mr. Yun. How can I help you this time? 

486
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,140
I have something to ask you.

487
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,620
Do you know the chairman's resort in Jeju?

488
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,950
 Oh, yes. What was it again? Dado? 

489
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,500
Yes.

490
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,140
Dado.

491
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,550
 What about Dado? 

492
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,780
How much will it sell for

493
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,860
in the current market?

494
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,360
 Are you selling it? 

495
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,980
If the price is right, we might consider it.

496
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,760
You didn't sell last time,

497
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,210
even when I arranged the price for you.

498
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,800
 I'm sorry about that. 

499
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,690
 Director, I'll call you back. 

500
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,640
Oh, okay.

501
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,560
Wait a second.

502
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,740
What's this?

503
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,400
I have a bad feeling.

504
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,860
What do you mean?

505
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,720
I'm sure he just robbed me.

506
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,420
Something that only I'm not aware of.

507
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,980
What could it be?

508
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,750
It looks like this place.

509
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,250
   

510
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,630
Is this it?

511
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,450
Yes, this is the only resort in Jeju named Dado.

512
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,470
I thought resorts only consisted of tall buildings.

513
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,460
It's famous because Itami Jun designed it.

514
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,060
It's also infamous for hard-to-get reservations.

515
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,650
Itami Jun?

516
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,050
- Yes. 
 - Itami?

517
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,690
Is he Japanese?

518
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,000
He's a Zainichi Korean.

519
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,450
He had a deep affection for Korea.

520
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,410
He kept his Korean nationality.

521
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,000
He wrote many books while traveling and built many architectural structures,

522
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
many of which are in Jeju.

523
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,400
Have you been there?

524
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,790
No.

525
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,950
I saw it in a documentary.

526
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,580
It makes sense why the chairman wanted it.

527
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,230
So will we conduct due diligence on the resort?

528
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,900
Should I book a reservation?

529
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,200
- Let's do the due diligence. 
 - Yes! Jeju!

530
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,690
- Yes, Mr. Kang. 
  - Mr. Yun, 

531
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,260
 I want to meet with you and explain something. 

532
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,300
 I think I made a mistake. 

533
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,470
No, Mr. Kang.

534
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,300
I know what you're saying,

535
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,000
but you don't need to worry.

536
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,640
No, no, I still want to meet with you.

537
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,240
I also have something to tell you about the resort.

538
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,940
Okay, I understand.

539
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,940
You guys can go ahead tomorrow.

540
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,030
I will meet Mr. Kang first before I come.

541
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay.

542
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,640
One standard, one premium, one suite.

543
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,120
Should I book the rooms like this?

544
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,330
Since we need to compare, that sounds good.

545
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,060
We're doing this without the company knowing.

546
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,020
So use this to pay for it.

547
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,740
Okay, I'll do so.

548
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,840
A standard room is about 700,000 won per night,

549
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,330
a premium room is 1.5 million won,

550
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,510
and a suite room is 8 million won.

551
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,420
W-Wait.

552
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,540
How much?

553
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,340
Jin Su, book the standard room.

554
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,180
Oh, okay.

555
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,840
I'll book three standard rooms.

556
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,280
Book one standard room,

557
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,500
but for two nights, making it 1.4 million won.

558
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,890
Including the breakfast,

559
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,410
since we're working on the weekend.

560
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,570
Just book two rooms.

561
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,930
No, I'm fine.

562
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,530
Okay, I'll book two rooms.

563
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:35,010
   

564
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,050
   

565
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,010
Hello, CEO!

566
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,140
 Yes, Mr. Ha? 

567
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,010
I just had something to tell you.

568
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,690
I was wondering if we could have a meal together.

569
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,590
Oh, a meal with you, Mr. Ha?

570
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,400
 Of course. 

571
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,100
 - Where would you like to go?  
 - Well...

572
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,100
Okay.

573
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,180
Yes, yes, that sounds good. Yes, yes.

574
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,890
 I'll book a reservation, so please come right away. 

575
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,900
Okay.

576
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,930
I thought you would refuse.

577
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,960
Yes, well, I've got no reason to eat with him.

578
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,310
Then?

579
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,060
But it's entertaining.

580
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,430
What?

581
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,870
The things he does.

582
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,730
I wish I could benefit

583
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,980
from investing other people's money.

584
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,970
Didn't I say the Secretariat should work

585
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,970
as though we're the chairman's shadow

586
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,490
but not hide behind the chairman?

587
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,150
Yes.

588
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,440
Did he have to end up calling in Mr. Ha, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Yun?

589
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,320
But, well,

590
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,120
we've never done this before.

591
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,370
So we just did what the chairman told us...

592
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,150
Exactly.

593
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,670
That's what I mean by hiding behind the chairman.

594
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,520
If you only do what the chairman ordered, is that working?

595
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,950
Is that the role of a secretary?

596
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,980
We should figure out the chairman's intentions and handle the matter smoothly.

597
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,910
Do you know what a joke the Secretariat has become?

598
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,290
Everyone's asking where the chairman's resort is.

599
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,810
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

600
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,160
In the future,

601
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,000
if the chairman says something,

602
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,200
let's make sure he won't have to bring it up again.

603
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,770
 Yes. 

604
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,740
Get back to work.

605
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,450
Here you go.

606
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,570
It looks a bit rundown here, but...

607
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,820
Enjoy your food.

608
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,770
This place has really good food.

609
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,900
It looks good. Thank you for the food.

610
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,020
But Mr. Kang,

611
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,820
I received info about Dado Resort

612
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,600
through various routes,

613
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,560
so he won't think you leaked the info.

614
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,930
And I won't say that either.

615
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,480
Gosh, well...

616
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,890
The Secretariat took care of it

617
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,640
and I naturally thought you were handling it.

618
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,280
But when I thought about it,

619
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,810
I realized that was impossible.

620
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,590
What do you mean by that?

621
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,030
Pardon?

622
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,970
I guess you didn't know.

623
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,220
Is there a reason I can't handle it?

624
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,890
I made another mistake, didn't I?

625
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,920
Feel free to look around.

626
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,590
Try putting it on.

627
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,000
I think it'd look good on you.

628
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,780
Look at it in the mirror.

629
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,140
There's only one left.

630
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,190
My youngest asked me to put it aside for her.

631
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,010
But it's not her size. It's too small for her.

632
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,260
I think it'd fit you perfectly.

633
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,680
Try putting it on. Wearing it is different from

634
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,760
just looking at it.

635
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,200
Oh, my. Since you have a cool skin tone,

636
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,360
it looks so good on you!

637
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,260
Take a look. It's made for you, isn't it?

638
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,260
This is on sale, right?

639
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,210
Of course. It was originally 320,000 won,

640
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,360
but it's now 160,000 won, 50% off.

641
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,310
By chance, do you also give employee discounts?

642
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,220
Are you a Sanin employee?

643
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,610
Yes.

644
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,520
This price is lower than with an employee discount,

645
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,040
so it doesn't apply.

646
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,170
Still, it is cheaper than the lowest online price.

647
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,500
Gosh, it looks so good on you.

648
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,470
Do you want it?

649
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,400
Jin Su.

650
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,220
- You're already here. 
 - You made it.

651
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,390
- Attorney. 
 - Yes?

652
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,220
You look different in casual clothes.

653
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,490
What, do I look cool?

654
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,810
No, you just look different.

655
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,120
I guess I'm last.

656
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,340
Hey, you're here.

657
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,770
We just arrived, too.

658
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,420
Really?

659
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,510
You should've dressed down. We're going to a resort.

660
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,240
Maybe I should've.

661
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,930
Will they find out we're doing due diligence?

662
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,520
No, that's not it.

663
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,680
You're always in work mode.

664
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,170
But we are going there to work, though.

665
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,790
Maybe I should be driving.

666
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,000
No. I'll drive here.

667
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,010
No, I just feel more comfortable driving.

668
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,240
We came all the way to Jeju. You can relax.

669
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,500
- I'll take your bags. 
 - I-I'll do it.

670
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,770
Thank you.

671
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,540
Here is Room 117.

672
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,250
And Room 121 is this way.

673
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,330
Thank you.

674
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,790
Give me the key.

675
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,160
Get some rest, Ms. Kwak.

676
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,070
Oh, Ms. Kwak.

677
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,620
Take this.

678
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,500
Get some rest.

679
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:39,250
A room that costs 30,000 won per hour...

680
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,030
Let's take a look around.

681
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,240
   

682
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,240
Are the colors of the carpets and

683
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,390
wallpaper harmonious?

684
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,170
Hello.

685
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,450
I'm the tenant of Room 123.

686
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,700
I see.

687
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,900
Did you come today?

688
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,290
Pardon?

689
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,300
Where did you come from?

690
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,860
From Seoul.

691
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,460
How long will you be staying?

692
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,870
Pardon?

693
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,550
Well, I'm alone here.

694
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,780
I was just bored.

695
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,430
Do you want to be friends?

696
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,490
Friends?

697
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,830
Yes.

698
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,800
 Ms. Kwak, 

699
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,970
 should we go eat if you're done looking around? 

700
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,490
Okay, let's.

701
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,290
 I'll wait at the restaurant with the attorney. 

702
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:29,130
Okay, I'll be there shortly.

703
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,060
See you again, Neighbor.

704
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,520
Okay. Bye now.

705
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,470
Do you need a receipt?

706
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,620
Oh, yes, please.

707
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,720
Here you go.

708
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,930
Thank you.

709
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,500
That way.

710
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,810
Hello. Did you make a reservation?

711
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,560
- Over there. 
 - Okay, I'll guide you to your table.

712
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,120
Okay.

713
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,810
- You made it. 
 - Oh, yes.

714
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,280
Here's the menu.

715
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,020
We should try different things on the menu, right?

716
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,850
Okay, let's do that.

717
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,770
Then two people can order individual entrees

718
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,300
and one person can order a course menu.

719
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,740
Well, you know, I eat a lot.

720
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,540
One entree won't be enough, don't you think?

721
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,770
Do you want two entrees for yourself?

722
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,170
No, well...

723
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,150
since the course menu has more quantity.

724
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,190
Okay. You can have the course menu.

725
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,800
Okay.

726
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,750
We'll have two udon sets...

727
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,100
A hearty Jeju-style course meal,

728
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,900
crafted with sincerity, rustic yet humble flavors from the pristine waters of Jeju.

729
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,920
I'll have this, please.

730
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,140
Okay, I'll get you two udon sets and one Dado course menu.

731
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,410
Thank you.

732
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,360
Thank you.

733
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,450
Thank you.

734
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,550
How was your room, Ms. Kwak?

735
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,250
It was good.

736
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,760
Of course, it'd be good.

737
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,960
I think the air in the room is a bit dry.

738
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,380
Aren't hotels a bit dry in general?

739
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,200
I see you here again, Neighbor.

740
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,810
How do you know each other?

741
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,240
Oh, we're neighbors.

742
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,900
I see. She's from your neighborhood then.

743
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,710
No, that's not it.

744
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,310
She is staying in the room next to mine.

745
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,140
I see.

746
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,130
If it's all right with you, could I join you?

747
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,870
Oh, sure, sure. Please take a seat.

748
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,910
When did you come here?

749
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,970
Pardon?

750
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,400
It's been a while.

751
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,310
About a year?

752
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,170
Has it been a year since you arrived in Jeju?

753
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,070
That's also been a year.

754
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,770
Are you saying you stayed here for a year?

755
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,200
Yes.

756
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,430
I really, really love this place.

757
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,930
Oh, I see...

758
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,960
The noodles are coming.

759
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,510
Aigoo. Thank you.

760
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,210
- Aigoo, it's hot. 
 - Okay.

761
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,890
- Enjoy the food. 
 - Thank you.

762
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,810
Are you upset?

763
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,190
What?

764
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,910
No, I'm fine.

765
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,050
I just craved something spicy today.

766
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,790
Why are you pretending not to know what I mean?

767
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,780
I'm talking about me buying a resort.

768
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,020
I understand, Sir.

769
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,600
What's with the formal talk?

770
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,600
I'll get upset if you talk like that.

771
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,610
When we are by ourselves,

772
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,580
aren't we friends?

773
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,730
Don't worry about it.

774
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,110
I'm sure you had your reasons, Chairman.

775
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,460
Well...

776
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,320
the company is at war trying to pay off its debts,

777
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,900
but the chairman is

778
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,490
messing around buying his own resort.

779
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,830
That's what you think, right?

780
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,520
I just figured he must have a reason for it.

781
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,830
Do you mean that?

782
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,860
Yes.

783
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,500
Then why aren't you asking me what that reason is?

784
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,280
What's the reason?

785
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,090
That resort...

786
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,460
is Ji Oh's.

787
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,500
Are you saying the chairman isn't the owner?

788
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Yes, that's right.

789
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,480
Then why did he keep it a secret?

790
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,120
I really don't know about that.

791
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,030
Okay.

792
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:47,240
Mr. Yun, what I told you today...

793
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,840
You really have to keep it a secret.

794
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,970
Don't worry.

795
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,960
 ­  

796
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,900
She said it was her last wish before she died.

797
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,060
That's why I bought it for her.

798
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,800
I couldn't really tell others,

799
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,590
so I couldn't tell you either.

800
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,370
You can understand me, right?

801
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,940
Yes.

802
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,090
So...

803
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,400
is there another way to fix this

804
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,180
without selling the resort?

805
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,870
She refuses to leave that place.

806
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,500
Since you let me sit with you,

807
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,950
it's my treat.

808
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,420
Oh, no, that's fine.

809
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,530
- Oh, no, don't! 
 - Please charge it to my room.

810
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,650
It's already been paid.

811
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:56,240
By chance, do you want to swim?

812
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,250
Wait... well...

813
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,170
Is there a swimming pool here?

814
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,290
It's in my room.

815
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,370
I see you have a suite.

816
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,540
Would you like to come? I'll invite you over.

817
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,860
Really?

818
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,900
- Yes. 
 - I was curious about the suite.

819
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,090
If it won't be too much trouble...

820
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,360
Of course not.

821
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,620
She must be filthy rich.

822
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,100
- That lady? 
 - Yes.

823
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,300
She paid for our meal and is staying in a suite.

824
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,950
She's been here for a whole year!

825
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,270
She must be no ordinary rich person.

826
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,450
I don't think so.

827
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,090
Rich people don't spend money like that.

828
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,650
Really?

829
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,480
Then what's going on?

830
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,920
Is she someone with a backstory?

831
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,810
A backstory?

832
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,880
You know people like that.

833
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,530
They spend all their money before they die

834
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,790
and with no regrets...

835
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,440
Forget it.

836
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,800
I don't think that's it.

837
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,940
- Yes, Mr. Lee. 
 -  Hey, Mr. Yun. 

838
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,220
 About that resort... 

839
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,260
Go on.

840
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,150
 Are you seriously thinking of selling it? 

841
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,130
I believe that's what needs to be done.

842
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,530
 I understand why you think that, 

843
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,870
 but don't sell it. 

844
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,430
That resort isn't the chairman's.

845
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,590
 I already know that. 

846
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,860
How did you find that out?

847
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,710
It turns out someone named Song Ji Oh is the owner.

848
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,900
 Do you know who that is? 

849
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,950
Have you tried this before?

850
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,200
It's really good.

851
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,000
Thank you.

852
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,290
I'm Kwak Min Jeong.

853
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,740
I'm Song Ji Oh, Min Jeong.

854
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,350
I see.

855
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,620
Thank you for inviting us to your room.

856
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,400
No, I'm the one who's grateful.

857
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,780
Please call me Ji Oh.

858
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,820
Okay, Ji Oh.

859
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,110
Mr. Yun?

860
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,640
He does look like him.

861
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,220
It's Mr. Yun.

862
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,000
Mr. Yun!

863
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,960
- Did you eat? 
 - Yes.

864
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,220
You made a long journey, Mr. Yun.

865
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,290
 She's Chairman Song's daughter. 

866
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,160
Oh, she is...

867
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,020
Hello, CEO Song Ji Oh.

868
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,550
CEO?

869
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,300
Is she a CEO?

870
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,380
I guess she's a CEO of a company.

871
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,250
You are Dado Resort CEO Song Ji Oh, right?

872
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,840
Hello.

873
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,890
I'm the CEO of Dado Resort, Song Ji Oh!

874
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,810
I should've known when she paid...

875
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,360
 I've known Ji Oh since she was little. 

876
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,650
 The chairman especially adored her. 

877
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,060
 She's his only daughter. Of course, he cherished her. 

878
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,460
 But after her mom's death, 

879
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,390
 Ji Oh struggled for a long time. 

880
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:28,500
 She lost her mom when she was so little. 

881
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,860
 The chairman probably couldn't pay enough attention. 

882
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,110
 In the end, he sent her abroad. 

883
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,170
 But she couldn't adjust there either. 

884
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,610
 She came back last year. 

885
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,770
 I thought she was staying with the chairman, 

886
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,310
 but she must've thrown a tantrum, 

887
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,630
 wanting to live in Jeju. 

888
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,400
 So the chairman gifted it to her. 

889
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,630
 If you try to take that away from her, 

890
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,150
 how will you survive that? 

891
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,810
- Go home. 
 - Okay.

892
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,270
Yes, Chairman.

893
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,070
All right.

894
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,080
 Chairman, it's me, the chief secretary. 

895
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,700
Yes.

896
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:07,050
Was it a good place to live?

897
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,150
Are you talking about Jeju?

898
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,190
That's right.

899
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,650
Yes, I heard she seemed peaceful.

900
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,500
- Go home and rest. 
 - Okay.

901
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,090
I guess you're in a high position.

902
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,050
But how did you know I was the CEO?

903
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,350
You must be a Sanin employee, right?

904
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,570
Yes, CEO.

905
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,710
I'm Yun Ju No of M&amp;A Team.

906
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,890
That's perfect.

907
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,960
Then I should show off my resort.

908
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,650
It's so pretty, right?

909
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,270
And private as well.

910
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,510
Yes, it is.

911
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,710
If you walk this way, you can see the view again.

912
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,350
It's beautiful, right?

913
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,070
Yes. It's much more beautiful

914
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,030
seeing it in person rather than from the photos.

915
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,790
Of course.

916
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,410
It's much better to see it in person.

917
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,550
Do you see that hill over there?

918
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,490
Try going there early morning.

919
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,050
Okay.

920
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:12,390
But are you able to wake up early in the morning?

921
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,580
Probably.

922
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,290
I guess you won't be going there.

923
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,090
I go up every morning.

924
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,980
Oh, no.

925
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,160
I'll make sure to go there tomorrow.

926
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,740
Really?

927
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,490
You mean that, right?

928
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,280
Promise me.

929
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,840
Okay.

930
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,060
They're working even here.

931
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,630
Isn't this too much, Mr. Yun?

932
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:53,380
But what team did you say you're from again?

933
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,450
We are the M&amp;A Team.

934
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,820
M&amp;A?

935
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,330
Oh, like buying and selling companies?

936
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,550
Yes.

937
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,880
We are doing due diligence to prepare for

938
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,650
the sale of Dado Resort.

939
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:09,150
Due diligence... What's that?

940
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,530
You can think of it as

941
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,600
evaluating Dado Resort's worth.

942
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,680
Really?

943
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,620
I'm curious.

944
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,530
I hear you came to sell my Dado.

945
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,110
Wow, you people do some scary work.

946
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,850
I forbade Sanin employees from coming here.

947
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,520
I don't really understand what I'm looking at.

948
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,190
This is Dado Resort's financial statement.

949
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,260
Financial statement?

950
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,980
What's that?

951
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,690
It's a chart that shows the financial stability

952
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,540
of Dado Resort.

953
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,030
Oh, it's like a health check-up report.

954
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,100
That was a great analogy.

955
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,240
It's the company's health check-up report.

956
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,310
Right?

957
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,240
Yes, totally.

958
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,260
So is my Dado healthy?

959
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:21,870
Dado Resort's financial stability isn't very good.

960
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,130
What do we do about my Dado then?

961
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,180
We are looking for a solution, CEO.

962
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,710
If you have time tomorrow,

963
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,310
we'll provide the answer together.

964
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:34,140
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

965
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,810
Then please let me know tomorrow

966
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,260
how I can save my Dado Resort.

967
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,400
CEO.

968
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,950
We are considering selling Dado Resort.

969
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,500
So?

970
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,880
I wondered if you knew about that.

971
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,410
Yes.

972
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,220
But it's fine.

973
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,270
Because...

974
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:08,870
I'm not going to sell Dado Resort.

975
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,440
I see.

976
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:25,210
   

977
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,890
♫  On the road to the road above you  ♫

978
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:47,270
♫  Measure each move you make  ♫

979
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:52,020
♫  Hold on to the ones who love you  ♫

980
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:55,320
♫  Don't let money take your heart away  ♫

981
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,500
♫  Take your heart away  ♫

982
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,530
 This isn't to make money. 

983
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,100
 It's a second generation chaebol's hobby. 

984
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,690
 So the problem is her management skills? 

985
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:05,510
 Someone who already borrowed 3 trillion won 

986
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,180
 asks to borrow 55 billion more? 

987
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,310
 Does the chairman also know that's a difficult task? 

988
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,870
 Will anyone want to buy this place? 

989
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,780
 We are thinking of a minimum of 60 billion won. 

990
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,060
 Why are you trying to ruin it! 

991
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:19,950
 Chairman! 

992
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,790
 The chairman found out you went to Jeju. 

993
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:23,910
 Did they sell it? 

994
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,070
 No! 

995
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:27,220
 Did you get fired because of me? 

996
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,900
 We've given up on selling Dado Resort. 

997
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:38,100
