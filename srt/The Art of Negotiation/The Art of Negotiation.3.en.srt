How much did we hit this month?

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,050
A little shy of 300,000 dollars.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,520
With 900 dollars more today, we'll get a bonus.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,720
What a shame.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,390
Won't it be possible?

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,260
When have you seen a guy in a suit buy a washing machine before?

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,670
I guess. I'll send him away.

16

- Let's wrap up for the day. - Okay.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,570
Is there anything specific you need?

18

Is it past business hours?

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,910
Gosh, no. Take your time looking around.

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,679
That's a relief.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,149
Could I ask you something?

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,050
Sure. What about?

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,919
I need a washing machine and a dishwasher.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
Is that so?

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,230
The one you were observing is our best-selling washing machine.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,260
As for dishwashers...

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,270
Here. This is our best one.

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,730
And the price?

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,139
The washing machine is 810 dollars,

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,409
while the dishwasher is 450 dollars.

31
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,910
That'll bring your total to 1,260 dollars.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,950
I was told my budget was 1,000.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,650
Yes, including the microwave.

37

What I'm asking for is probably the employee discount price.

Right?

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500

Why don't you call your wife?

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,909
We're offering a special discount...

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,020
for the residents of Astro Apartments.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220

No.

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,490
Even so, we'll offer a discount...

49

It was the biggest acquisition of the year.

67
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,609
It seems to have been a move...

68
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,580
to improve the former's financial health.

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,679

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,850
Hasn't it prompted any concerns?

71
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,980

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,249

74
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,420
- That's better than expected. - Right.

75

Now that Sanin generated cash through this deal,

76
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,689
people must be excited...

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,429
about the new momentum it may present.

78

A new momentum?

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,499
Is there any word as to what that might be?

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,170
I'm afraid there's no chatter about it yet,

81
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,969
but I'll look into it.

What is the meaning of this?

126

is that Sanin's crisis is far from simple.

There's a structural aspect to it.

132

Exactly. But that is for us to decide.

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,780
You're in no position to bring that up.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,490
This is a failed project that was once attempted.

138
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,020
Yes, I lacked in many ways.

139
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,429
However, Mr. Yoon must have the same idea as me.

140
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
Exactly.

141
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,470
But this can't fail again.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Mr. Yoon, do you believe you can make this happen?

143
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,209
Yes, that's why...

144
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,310
The key to e-commerce is a platform.

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,180
However, platforms keep users strongly locked in.

146
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,850
We stick to one platform and rarely jump ship.

147
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,250
But you're suggesting we steal users from other platforms.

148
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,050
How?

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,859
As you said, consumers stick to one platform...

150
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,020
and rarely use another.

151
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,260
They're extremely loyal.

152
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,489
Because of that, NAVER and Coupang...

153
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,700
have been dividing the market...

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,729
which has led to an aggressive competition.

155
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,730
Let me get this straight.

156
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,300
Those dividing the market is battling for the throne,

157
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,570
but you think we have a chance.

158
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,909
Yes, whichever of the two that wins...

159
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,580
will try to improve its earnings rate...

160
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,940
that suffered a blow from the long-term battle...

161
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,309
by raising the price of its shipping or membership fee.

162
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,919

163
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,980
for its bloody victory.

164
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
Right.

165
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,050
I see that as an opportunity.

166
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,819
How can that be an opportunity when the throne is now taken?

167
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,589
Are you saying we'll have a chance by taking on the winner...

168
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,830
of the cutthroat battle that just ended?

169
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Exactly.

170
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,329
Moreover, e-commerce...

171
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,730
is now shifting from a platform war to that of logistics.

172
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,840
This, also, is an opportunity for Sanin since logistics...

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,739
- is one of its strengths. - It is the power of logistics...

174
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,379
that lowers prices and ships items faster.

175
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,579
For that reason, making a move on e-commerce...

176
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,110
is a new opportunity for Sanin,

177
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,850
as well as a survival strategy.

178
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,190
Sanin Retail has Bareun Life,

179
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,760
and Sanin Fashion has its SPA brand,

180
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,330
but sales have been declining.

181
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,529
That's because most consumers...

182
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,130
now use e-commerce platforms.

183
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,130
The same can be said about the other subsidiaries.

184
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,600
As the e-commerce market grows,

185
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,270
this will only get worse.

186
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,470
That is why this is the right time...

187
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,510
and the last window.

188
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,880
So tell me.

189
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,649
How can we sell our products online?

190
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,789
We're not NAVER.

191
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,420
We don't have a platform.

192
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,990
Then allow me to inform you about platforms.

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,789
Rather than recruiting new developers...

194
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,800
or collaborating with a company in that area of expertise,

195
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,829
an M and A deal...

196
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,429
will cut costs and save time...

197
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,530
Mr. Yoon.

198
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,140
Go ahead.

199
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,670
Do it.

200
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,180
In a nutshell, you want to purchase a platform.

201
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,080
Go ahead.

202
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,619
But if this doesn't work, you'll be held responsible.

203
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,680
Got it?

204
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,890
Director Ha.

205
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,789
Why don't we discuss this internally and...

206
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,330
He called it an opportunity and a survival strategy.

207
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,460
We're doomed without it.

208
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,760
Aren't I right?

209
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,870
Yes, you're right.

210
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,200
Exactly.

211
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,870
The company is close to shutting down,

212
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,510
so you should stick your neck out as well.

213
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,210
Don't you agree?

214
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,950
Yes, I'll do as suggested.

215
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,780
Okay. Then that's it for today's meeting.

216
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,220
Director Ha, did the chairman agree to this?

217
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,790
Let's grab tea.

218
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,930
- CEO Kim. - Yes?

219
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,400
Are you worried about losing the distribution sector?

220
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,970
That won't happen.

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,170
This will be Yoon Joo No's demise.

222
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,610
How so?

223
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,880
Our logistics is strong,

224
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,550
so the plan could work with the right platform.

225
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,420
That is why I once took the initiative myself.

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
However,

227
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,860
there's a reason Director Ha gave in this easily.

228
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,200
Director Lee once tried to have this ship sail as well.

229
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,630
Right. Why did it fail back then?

230
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,840
His words were identical to what Yoon Joo No said today.

231
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,910
Have you heard of Collection?

232
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,480
The online shopping platform?

233
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,640
Yes.

234
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,450
It's too famous not to know.

235
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,420
Of course you know what it is.

236
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,850
That's where the younger generation buys their clothes.

237
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,260
It has been a roadblock for Sanin as well.

238
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
It once...

239
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,960
suggested an acquisition on our end.

240
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,970
The group had a chance to acquire Collection?

241
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,240
You were in Hawaii at the time.

242
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,480
How much is Collection currently worth?

243
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,439
In the off-exchange market,

244
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
its estimate is around four billion dollars.

245
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,080
Unbelievable.

246
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,750
Back then it was ten million dollars.

247
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,780
That's 400 times more.

248
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,590
It started off as a blog.

249
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,930
From there, it grew into a giant.

250
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,190
That's right.

251
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,759
People visited the blog,

252
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
so the management thought it could sell a few things.

253
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,270
They offered to sell our clothes on its blog.

254
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,530
And?

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,770
We offered...

256
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,870
to buy the blog for ten million dollars...

257
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,980
as long as it exclusively sold our products.

258
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,410
It was to be Sanin's platform.

259
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
Right.

260
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:34,150
That way, the company would have a foothold in e-commerce.

261
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,920
I doubt Collection took the deal.

262
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,560
Collection did.

263
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,530
It was the chairman who upended the deal.

264
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,629
Our chairman wouldn't have had...

265
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,300
the slightest idea of what this business was.

266
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,300
Didn't Director Lee try to convince him?

267
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,140
Even when the distribution sector and in-person shopping hit a low,

268
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,610
the land still increases in price.

269
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
After the business itself didn't work out,

270
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,420
we were still able to turn a profit by selling the land.

271
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,060
As for e-commerce, you're left with nothing.

272
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,390
The opportunity cost is higher.

273
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,090
In the chairman's eyes, e-commerce was a gamble.

274
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,470
Our chairman continuously states he's a merchant and trader.

275
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,969
Why would he opt to gamble...

276
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,470
when he could choose the safer route?

277
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,210
Since then,

278
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,980
the idea of e-commerce has only been enraging him.

279
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,549
Still, right now,

280
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,680
Sanin must show that it has the power to grow.

281
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,380
If not, the stock price might plummet...

282
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,250
before we raise the 11 billion dollars.

283
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,320
I agree with you on that,

284
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,060
but isn't it too late?

285
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
It will be possible with an M and A deal.

286
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,900
You'll acquire a platform?

287
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,970
There aren't any platforms that are on the market.

288
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,510
It didn't seem that tricky,

289
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,880
but this is harder than it looks.

290
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
(Mission Failed)

291
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,320
Just for being late,

292
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,190
I'm getting an earful. This is one cruel boss.

293
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,219
The customer is returning the item because shipping took too long.

294
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
(Requesting Return!)

295
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,890
Forget it. I'm done.

296
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,930
Whatever.

297
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,070
How are you doing, Ms. Kwak?

298
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,740
I'm not big on video games and can't tell how I'm doing.

299
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,570
Jin Soo, what about you? Don't you know games well?

300
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,110
- I'm not sure. - You don't find it straightforward?

301
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,110
It's not that.

302
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,150
I just can't explain it in words.

303
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,760
Did the briefing go well?

304
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,090
Yes.

305
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,190
What did you think of the game?

306
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,329
Right. This game may seem simple,

307
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,969
but there's a nice balance of features...

308
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,870
such as timing-based action, business strategy, and simulation.

309
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
The graphics aren't that bad,

310
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,769
and there are details utilized in the game...

311
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,739
that could only be known by an actual courier...

312
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,140
which adds realism.

313
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,180
Also, an actual map has been integrated into the game...

314
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,780
and that's the sickest.

315
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,880
Let me put it on the screen.

316
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,219
As you can see,

317
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,390
the delivery map is just like what we use in real life.

318
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,499
After you complete a mission,

319
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,760
it gives you feedback on possible improvements.

320
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,840
A lot of resources must've gone into a game this sophisticated.

321
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,770
Is this game worth all that praise?

322
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,170
Yes.

323
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,310
However, I believe this game to be a failure.

324
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,740
Why?

325
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,079
(Delivery King)

326
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,610
The game is of good quality, but...

327
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,250
But the BM lacks.

328
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,350
- BM as in business model? - Yes.

329
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,189
Even the worst games become a success...

330
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,990
with the right business model.

331
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,459
That's why the worst game is actually a well-made game...

332
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,799
that can't generate money.

333
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,229
Because it costs more to create but doesn't make any profit.

334
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes, and that's the story of this game.

335
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,299
Now that I think about it, the game was free,

336
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,540
and I didn't buy anything while playing the game.

337
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,510
There aren't any ads either.

338
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,740
It could've easily had ads here and there.

339
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,250
Right. Which is why...

340
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,110
this game will flop.

341
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,790
You're right. It flopped.

342
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,190
It flopped for real.

343
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,859
"We thank all gamers who loved CHACHA Games."

344
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,099
"Unfortunately, Delivery King will end its service..."

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,769
"at the end of this month."

346
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,739
"We appreciate the support..."

347
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,300
"and will be back with even a better game."

348
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,370
There's no coming back from this.

349
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,910
Then, why don't we meet the developer ourselves?

350
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,620
This is the place.

351
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,620
I don't think this is it. It's a private home.

352
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
This is the correct address.

353
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,930
The developer must've renovated a private home.

354
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,230
This could just be the billing address.

355
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,830
One that was written when the business was registered.

356
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,339
Don't let this discourage you too much.

357
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,800
We can always try again.

358
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,770
We spent all our money.

359
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,340
Come on. I'll get the money somehow.

360
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,480
Who'd pay us?

361
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,279
Hey, don't you want pizza?

362
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,380
Shall I order some?

363
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,550
Sure.

364
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,460
Get going.

365
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,360
Hang in there too.

366
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,890
I'll see you.

367
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,230
- Bye. - Bye.

368
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,760
Who are you?

369
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,830
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No from Sanin's M and A Team.

370
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,930
Sure. So what?

371
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,970
Let me get this straight.

372
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,170
You're a fan of the system and not the game.

373
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,440
We're fond of them both,

374
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,980
but it's the system we want.

375
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,440
What do you need it for?

376
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,610
To enter the e-commerce sector.

377
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,420
Hold on. Is Sanin still not in the e-commerce market?

378
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,230
Seriously. That's hilarious.

379
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,340
You want a real-life version of Delivery King...

380
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,070
as your platform.

381
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,640
It must've been a foolish idea on my part.

382
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,940
Gosh, no.

383
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,780
It actually makes sense.

384
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,950
Digital transformation. Everyone does that these days.

385
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,349
Right.

386
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,690
That's why we're here to suggest a pivot.

387
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,990
A pivot?

388
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,030
I'll have to take this to my boys first.

389
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,200
Pizza's here.

390
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,970
I see we didn't bring enough.

391
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,280
No way. That actually makes sense.

392
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,849
Ho Jin worked as a courier when he wanted out.

393
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,550
Hey. Why would you tell them that?

394
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,779
They kept saying he was awful at his job.

395
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,819
He was sick of getting chewed out, so he made it.

396
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Hey, that's not what happened.

397
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,620
The system was awful,

398
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,859
but they kept blaming the part-timers,

399
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,120
so I made it out of frustration.

400
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,359
I see.

401
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,100
No wonder it's so realistic.

402
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,060
The character is you, right?

403
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,330
- I see the resemblance. - No, it's not me.

404
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,669
In addition to handling deliveries,

405
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,769
they also have to accept orders, secure products,

406
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,639
and assign jobs to drivers.

407
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Did you have experience with that too?

408
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Yes.

409
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,350
I took care of the deliveries at first, but they said I was too slow.

410
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,480
So, they had me handle orders and dispatch drivers instead.

411
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,490
When you do that,

412
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,049
customers complain like crazy...

413
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,890
even if their orders arrive just a day late.

414
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,789
But they were using a paper calendar to manage the delivery schedule.

415
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,030
Are we still living in the Joseon Dynasty?

416
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,130
So, I made all of it by myself.

417
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,070
And?

418
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,270
Did you actually try using it?

419
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
No.

420
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:39,940
I showed the owner,

421
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,210
but he said they didn't need it. Old folks don't get it.

422
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,140
So, I just ended up...

423
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,140
turning it into a game.

424
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,679
So, it was originally made for that.

425
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,249
Yes, you're right.

426
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,679
Let it serve its original purpose as a platform.

427
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,979
No, the details are different.

428
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,919
Come on. We can tweak those things.

429
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,990
Besides, we can't afford to be that picky right now.

430
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,630
- Do you think it can be done? - Yes.

431
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,959
The game allows you to get data on information such as...

432
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,300
the total number of orders and manufacturing output.

433
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,500
We've already set it all up to control the difficulty levels.

434
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,779
Yes, we can use the data to cut down on the distribution costs,

435
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,780
and I believe we can also utilize them in marketing as well.

436
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,550
Oh, so you know what you're talking about.

437
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,450
My gosh. We really struggled to set that up.

438
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,390
Who knew it'd be useful like this?

439
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,020
See? I told you we should do it.

440
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,660
You? When? It was my idea, you punk.

441
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,500
Wait, I have a question, though.

442
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
If we turn this into a platform,

443
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,530
we'll have to scrap this game, right?

444
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,670
Yes, I believe so.

445
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,280
Do you want to think about it?

446
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,650
No, I won't sell it.

447
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,450
Okay.

448
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,050
But I still learned a lot from you.

449
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,420
Thank you for your time.

450
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,719
What? Wait.

451
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,230
How much will you pay us?

452
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,930
About that...

453
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,160
We'll have to learn more about CHACHA to be able to answer that.

454
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,699
When is the latest we can let you know?

455
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,770
The sooner, the better.

456
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,140
- Can we contact you at this number? - Hey.

457
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,610
We won't sell it.

458
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,050
Shouldn't we find some other options?

459
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,080
Not all games have that system.

460
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,950
If Mr. Cha is a good leader,

461
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,390
he'll probably contact us.

462
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Right.

463
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,830
Does he think he's Elon Musk or something?

464
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,160
Hey, are all young people like that these days?

465
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,400
Well, those in the gaming industry tend to be like that,

466
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,040
but those guys are a bit extreme.

467
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Right?

468
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,810
They made me feel like a boomer.

469
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,310
But Mr. Cha is the one who calls the shots,

470
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,580
and everyone on the team seemed to be fine with it,

471
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,280
which tells me that Mr. Cha is probably a good leader.

472
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,550
How do you know these things?

473
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,790
Honestly, I don't really know either. I'm just...

474
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,620
hoping that's the case.

475
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
But even if we do hear from them,

476
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm not sure if Mr. Cha will accept the pivot.

477
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,470
Right. He seemed very proud of his game.

478
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,240
The pivot...

479
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
Hey, Jin Soo.

480
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,440
Do you play basketball?

481
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Come on. Do a pass.

482
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Pass.

483
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
All right.

484
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,220
Look. Keep one foot planted like this.

485
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,390
Like this. Left and right!

486
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,130
You get it, right? Like this.

487
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
Think of Michael Jordan.

488
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,399
Like this.

489
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,229
Attorney Oh. Stay still, will you?

490
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,470
The car is shaking.

491
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,170
Okay.

492
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,540
Pivoting describes the process of changing direction in business.

493
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,580
Actually, I knew that.

494
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,910
Oh, you did?

495
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,510
Then you should've told me.

496
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,350
I got scolded because of you.

497
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,120
It looks like we'll need a consultant for this deal.

498
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,920
We don't know much about video games.

499
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,660
I'll try to find someone who knows a lot about video games.

500
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,459
Actually, a friend of mine is a consultant...

501
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,530
and a video game addict.

502
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Should I call my friend?

503
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,529
I hear Yoon Joo No wants to start a whole new ball game...

504
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,040
to get into e-commerce.

505
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,840
Then Director Ha wouldn't have approved it.

506
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,680
Right. Even Yoon Joo No got him good.

507
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,580
Oh, you made it.

508
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,650
My goodness. Why didn't you go ahead and start eating?

509
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,850
We should eat together.

510
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,590
- What? - Hello.

511
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,790
Director Ha said he wanted to take me to a famous restaurant.

512
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,360
I see. Come on in and take a seat.

513
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,730
- Well, then... - This way.

514
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
So,

515
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,400
how are things going at the store level?

516
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
What do you think?

517
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,470
You must be very upset with Director Lee.

518
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,139
Distribution is doing great,

519
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,050
but they want to change it all up and try e-commerce.

520
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,220
I'll be honest.

521
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,860
Director Lee is like a father to me.

522
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,259
He used to be in charge or Distribution, you know.

523
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,759
When he announced that he'd hand it over to me,

524
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,900
so many people were against it as you know.

525
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,100
He managed to persuade every single one of them,

526
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
so think about...

527
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
how grateful I must've felt.

528
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,570
I should be grateful.

529
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,110
Right, we know all about it.

530
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,550
You truly look up to Director Lee.

531
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,610
Who here doesn't know that?

532
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,120
The thing is,

533
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,749
wanting to get into e-commerce...

534
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,650
means they want me to hand over Distribution.

535
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
My gosh.

536
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,389
It's like he gave it to me only to take it back.

537
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,690
That's exactly what's happening.

538
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,799
I feel like an illegitimate son who is being pushed off...

539
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,430
to the side by his real son.

540
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,600
So, Yoon Joo No is the real son?

541
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,100
Hey, that's why...

542
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,100
you should've chosen your side wisely.

543
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,710
What? Me?

544
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,170
I'm not on Director Lee's side.

545
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,910
I'm just grateful to him. That's all.

546
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,680
People seem to have the wrong idea about me.

547
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,450
They think I'm on his side.

548
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,950
- Well, then... - Oh, thank you.

549
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,320
What's your plan now?

550
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,160
I must protect my position.

551
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,360
After everything I've been through to come this far.

552
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,630
After all, that's how I can do my duty to Sanin, you know?

553
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,170
Oh, boy.

554
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
My goodness.

555
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm dying over here.

556
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,269
Come on. You exercise to live longer.

557
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,440
Don't die just yet.

558
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,980
How much is the ice cream?

559
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,310
It's three dollars.

560
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,320
Goodness. That's expensive.

561
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,750
Then go back down and get one.

562
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,320
- I'll take two. - It's too expensive.

563
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,290
He distributes these himself,

564
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,060
so he should charge a fee for that.

565
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,400
- Oh, my. - Here you go.

566
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,829
- Oh, boy. - Have a good day.

567
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,839
You too.

568
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,600
He knows how to run a business, doesn't he?

569
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,870
Let's sit down.

570
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,670
- Oh, dear. - By the way,

571
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
I see that young people aren't buying this.

572
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,819
Right. These days, you can get everything delivered...

573
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,380
right to your door without a delivery fee,

574
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,190
so young people probably can't understand...

575
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,020
having to pay extra in the middle of the mountain.

576
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,259
They won't buy it because it's overpriced.

577
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,330
If it's cheap, everyone will buy it.

578
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,330
It's good.

579
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,450
Aren't you coming?

580
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
Got a death wish?

581
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,219
- Hello. - Hello.

582
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,290
Hello.

583
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,269
I'm Jenny, an analyst.

584
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,540
I specialize in video games and entertainment.

585
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,170
Hello.

586
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,070
I'm Yoon Joo No from the M and A Team in Sanin Group.

587
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,439
(CEO Cha Ho Jin)

588
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,910
CHACHA Games, Cha Ho Jin.

589
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,509
He was born in Ulsan in 1988.

590
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,319
He went to Science and Technology High School and dropped out...

591
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,350
of Seoul National University as a math major.

592
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,490
The elite track.

593
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,120
Yes. The typical elite track, including dropping out of college.

594
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,519
While attending college,

595
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,889
he cofounded DC Games with his classmate, Do Han Chul,

596
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,030
and quit college.

597
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,500
He cofounded DC Games?

598
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,570
How many shares does he have in the company?

599
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,499
Even if he just held onto one percent...

600
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
That'd be ten million dollars.

601
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,040
But from what I know, he doesn't have any shares in the company.

602
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,809
That's right. Cha Ho Jin doesn't have any DC shares.

603
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,509
Up until the time when Cha Ho Jin left DC,

604
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,380
DC wasn't a company. It was just the name of their team.

605
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,419
D from Do Han Chul and C from Cha Ho Jin. Hence the name, DC.

606
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,219
Why did the two of them end up drifting apart?

607
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,220
That's...

608
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,660
Attorney Oh must know more about it than I do.

609
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,630
Oh, they have a lawsuit going on at the moment.

610
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,300
DC has a game that became a hit. What was it called?

611
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,729
- High Square? - Yes, that's it.

612
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,400
- It became a big hit. - That's right.

613
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,100
It turned DC into the company we know today.

614
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,069
But Cha Ho Jin...

615
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,710
sued them, saying he got the game stolen.

616
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,509
The game was developed when he and Do Han Chul were a team,

617
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,979
so it should've been approached...

618
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,480
as a plagiarism or copyright infringement case,

619
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,980
but he sued them for theft, which is...

620
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,049
It's an absurd strategy.

621
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,689
That's right. People in the industry...

622
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,090
all called it absurd too.

623
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,289
Have they reached a verdict?

624
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,420
Cha Ho Jin lost.

625
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,860
What if it was a plagiarism or copyright infringement case?

626
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,230
He still would've lost.

627
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,400
Plagiarism cases are very tricky for judges.

628
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,270
Did they really copy it?

629
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,940
Or are the similarities a mere coincidence?

630
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,310
It's also possible they came up with similar ideas at the same time.

631
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,609
That's why anecdotal evidence is important.

632
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,680
Right, but the timing of when Cha filed the lawsuit seems sketchy.

633
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,749
When he was struggling financially while developing a new game,

634
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,019
he asked Do Han Chul to invest in his project only to be turned down.

635
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,560
He sued him right after that.

636
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,930
In the judge's eyes,

637
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,459
it could seem that Cha sued Do to get back at him...

638
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,729
for turning him down when he asked for an investment,

639
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,370
so I think...

640
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,700
he would've lost, either way.

641
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,740
- Has he appealed the decision? - Yes, it's in progress now.

642
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,540
And DC has sued him for a false accusation.

643
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,350
I bet CHACHA Games can't even afford the legal fees.

644
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,949
It all comes down to money, so they'll have to settle the case.

645
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,020
Well...

646
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,790
The thing is, they have such a hostile relationship.

647
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,620
They've unfollowed each other on social media.

648
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,360
Is that important?

649
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,870
For your generation, the action of unfollowing someone is like...

650
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,000
ending your friendship with the person.

651
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,940
It must be true because...

652
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,609
DC keeps releasing new games when CHACHA's new games...

653
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,349
are being launched,

654
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,980
although DC says it's a mere coincidence.

655
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,879
It doesn't look like a coincidence to me.

656
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,080
It can't be a coincidence.

657
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,020
How much do you think CHACHA would be valued at?

658
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,120
We don't estimate game companies' values.

659
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,159
It's really hard to predict which games would become successful.

660
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,489
And the value can change drastically...

661
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,960
depending on whether or not it's successful.

662
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,630
But I can tell you a thing or two about CHACHA.

663
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,670
CHACHA is worth nothing.

664
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,770
Delivery King is already doomed,

665
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,509
and they're in a legal battle with DC,

666
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,110
the dominant company in the industry,

667
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,680
so no one would want it even if they offered it for free.

668
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,390
Thank you for coming.

669
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,960
Take care.

670
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,430
My boss told me...

671
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,940
your manager's nickname was the White Snake.

672
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,570
People think he got the nickname because of his white hair.

673
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,609
But apparently, it means he thinks a hundred times...

674
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,080
before making a decision.

675
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,710
- Really? - Yes.

676
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,750
So, I was excited to see how impressive this guy could be,

677
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,350
but I'm disappointed.

678
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,890
Why?

679
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,730
He wants to buy CHACHA Games.

680
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,300
He thought it over a hundred times before deciding?

681
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,470
If he thought it over even just once,

682
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,270
he couldn't be saying he wants to buy it.

683
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,870
CHACHA doesn't want to sell the company anyway.

684
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,440
Is that right?

685
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,440
Then I'm relieved.

00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,630
You know him, right? That intern.

723
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,230
Intern? Which one?

724
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,400
You said you went to school with him.

725
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,840
That intern, you know.

726
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,970
Oh, Choi Jin Soo?

727
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,480
You two are close, right?

728
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,810
Why do you ask?

729
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,950
Find out what he's up to now.

730
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,020
He's on the M and A Team now.

731
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,390
No, I mean...

732
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,030
I need to find out what Yoon Joo No is up to,

733
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,830
so ask that guy.

734
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,100
Got it, sir.

735
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,970
Can you not take hints?

736
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,240
Why are you following me?

737
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,070
Oh, sorry.

738
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,579
Can't he give clear directions?

739
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,380
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

740
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,320
When his contract is up, tell him that's it.

741
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,529
Yes, sir. This time, the interns...

742
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,900
We'll tell the interns that none of them will get a permanent position.

743
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,830
Good. Now, you understand what I'm saying.

744
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,170
Sir.

745
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,410
About CHACHA Games, the CEO doesn't want to sell it.

746
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,840
Would it be a bad idea to sell more of our subsidiaries?

747
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,250
CHACHA Games will sell the company.

748
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,310
Pardon?

749
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,150
CHACHA will go bankrupt if they don't sell it.

750
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,990
Selling it is the only choice they have.

751
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,660
At times like this, it's important to help them protect their pride...

752
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,490
so they can make the decision on their own.

753
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,490
I see.

754
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,930
And we can't sell another subsidiary.

755
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,500
If Sanin were to sell another subsidiary,

756
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,770
would you buy shares in Sanin?

757
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,810
I probably wouldn't.

758
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,210
The market reaction wouldn't be much different.

759
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,510
It's hovering around 110 dollars at the moment,

760
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,980
but if we sell another subsidiary, the stock price will tank.

761
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,380
It'd be like admitting that the company is struggling.

762
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,560
If it drops to under 100 dollars, we'll get a call from Samoel.

763
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,889
"Pay us back, or hand over the company."

764
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,699
What's that called?

765
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,630
- Bankruptcy. - Bankruptcy, bingo.

766
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,669
Just like how CHACHA has no other choice,

767
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,400
we don't have any other option either.

768
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,800
So, I'm convinced this deal will work out.

769
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,070
It has to.

770
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,980
So, let's do our best.

771
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,280
CHACHA Games had filed a criminal case against DC.

772
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,650
Shouldn't it have been a civil case?

773
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,620
Good point. I'll look into it.

774
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,160
I'll do my best.

775
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,230
Please find out how things are at DC.

776
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,660
Sure.

777
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,360
And you, Jin Soo.

778
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,930
Have you ever completed the final level in Delivery King?

779
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,100
Pardon? No.

780
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,770
- Keep at it. - Okay.

781
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,640
For Mobile and Online, the numbers don't match.

782
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,880
There's a slight difference.

783
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,810
- Please check page 18. - Do you want to grab a drink?

784
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,080
Pardon? Where?

785
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,820
- Bye. - Get home safely.

786
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,520
- Bye. - Bye.

787
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,960
Basement One. Going down.

788
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,390
The doors are closing.

789
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,200
Well, I'll be off then.

790
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,700
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

791
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,170
Sir.

792
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,470
Do you just want me to keep playing the game?

793
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
Yes.

794
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:31,570
It takes a while to beat the final level.

795
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,210
Or should I look into the developers?

796
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,380
No.

797
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,320
Try to beat the final level. It's fun.

798
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Okay.

799
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,050
- Good job today. - Thank you for everything today.

800
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Hello?

801
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,600
Hey, I texted you. Do you not know how to text back?

802
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,910
No. I don't know how to do anything.

803
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,710
I know nothing.

804
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,510
Is that so?

805
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,910
Then let's grab a drink.

806
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,580
- Isn't it so pretty? - What?

807
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,380
Stand over there.

808
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,820
Oh, yes.

809
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,890
Hey, I said we should grab a drink. Why did you bring me here?

810
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,660
I...

811
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,030
come here often when I'm stressed out.

812
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,770
How old do you think this place is?

813
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,600
When I'm sitting here,

814
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,070
I think, "My worries are just fleeting thoughts."

815
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,470
I think that to myself.

816
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,110
- Well, all right. - I'll take it now.

817
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,780
- One, two, three. - Hey.

818
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,420
Do you know why work is stressful?

819
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,019
I don't know.

820
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,190
It's stressful because you don't know how it works.

821
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,590
Once you get to know how it works,

822
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,460
it stops being stressful,

823
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,030
but it kills you.

824
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,360
Can you come down?

825
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,340
(Delivery King)

826
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,539
(Delivery King)

827
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,780
So, what are you working on now?

828
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,950
I'm playing a game.

829
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,850
Not that.

830
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,690
I'm talking about the M and A.

831
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,390
We're trying to buy the company that made this game.

832
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,730
Why buy that company?

833
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,400
I don't know, okay?

834
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,470
Why are you venting your anger at me?

835
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,340
- Hyeong Seop. - What?

836
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,240
You won't betray me, will you?

837
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,910
Betray you?

838
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,480
It's...

839
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,610
tough because I'm no good yet.

840
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,980
Mr. Yoon isn't giving me a hard time.

841
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,980
Don't tell anyone.

842
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Gosh.

843
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,250
That's a given.

844
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Mr. Yoon...

845
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,130
seems to be a nice person.

846
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,260
And he's competent.

847
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,670
Hey.

848
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,400
Don't let him fool you, okay?

849
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,670
All people are selfish.

850
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,510
But your team manager...

851
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,110
is selfish in a complicated way.

852
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,880
Those are the scariest people.

853
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,150
Be careful.

854
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,120
What do you mean by that?

855
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,790
In other words...

856
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,620
He sees others as simply bad...

857
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,290
and himself as complexly good.

858
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,430
That's who your team manager is.

859
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,800
Jin Soo. You see,

860
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,300
if you're going to be selfish, at least be honest about it.

861
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,470
Right?

862
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,409
Instead of secretly doing everything,

863
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,480
it's better to do it openly.

864
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,260
Hello, Director? Yes.

865
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,890
Yes, it's CHACHA Games.

866
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,430
That's right. The company that makes games.

867
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,300
That's their next target.

868
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,670
I'm not sure about that.

869
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,940
Yes.

870
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,240
Okay. Yes. Please call anytime.

871
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,919
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness.

872
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,880
- Mr. David. - Director Ha.

873
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,560
Right. He's Director Song, the future of Samoel Fund.

874
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
You know him, yes?

875
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,560
Of course. There's no way I wouldn't know him.

876
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,700
- Take a seat. - Sure.

877
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:53,170
You can just call me Teo.

878
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,140
Director Teo...

879
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,739
was extremely strict...

880
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,380
when Sanin used convertible bonds.

881
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,079
It caused our chairman to fly into a rage.

882
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,580
Persuading him wasn't easy at all, you know?

883
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,649
My apologies for back then.

884
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,959
I was simply trying to protect my clients' money.

885
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,990
Of course.

886
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,360
I totally understand the fund's situation.

887
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,660
Here. Have a glass.

888
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,100
- Mr. David. - Thank you.

889
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,070
Well, that was all in the past.

890
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,369
We should live in the present.

891
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,370
Exactly.

892
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,410
What I meant was that having you was reliable.

893
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,049
Let's sail smoothly together this time.

894
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,410
Let's do it.

895
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,790
Nice.

896
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,290
By the way,

897
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,419
I heard what we were taking over...

898
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,590
was Yoon Joo No's.

899
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,390
That's right.

900
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,830
Will it be all right?

901
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,930
Don't worry. We've got you, don't we?

902
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,170
But it's best to be careful.

903
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,770
You know Yoon Joo No isn't your average man.

904
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,100
What is he like?

905
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,670
Remember JUMBO Pharmaceuticals?

906
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,040
He's the one who ruined them.

907
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,709
That guy's the one who ruined JUMBO Pharmaceuticals?

908
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,710
Yes.

909
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,349
I guess you wouldn't know as you were in the US.

910
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,750
That was Yoon Joo No's doing.

911
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,320
And here's the witness.

912
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,490
Was he not questioned by the prosecutors?

913
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
He was.

914
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,160
That's why he fled overseas.

915
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,359
Thanks to blocking corporate-level news...

916
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,930
and people keeping quiet about it,

917
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,230
not many know about it.

918
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,040
But little did I imagine he'd return to Korea.

919
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,170
Is he shameless or just courageous? Who knows?

920
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,910
He could've fled from the US.

921
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,610
Many return after running away overseas.

922
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,609
Well, he must've used up...

923
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,180
all his fortune to cover that incident up.

924
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
I'm sure his family went down too.

925
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,250
Go bankrupt, and most men get divorced.

926
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,390
Good grief. Money is a terrifying existence.

927
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,350
Hello?

928
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,080
Oh Woon.

929
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,250
It's Dad.

930
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,690
You're doing well, yes?

931
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,690
Dad...

932
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,600
is doing fine.

933
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,470
Oh Woon. Who is it?

934
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Hello?

935
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,270
Hey. It's me.

936
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,770
Right.

937
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,910
How is it over there? All good?

938
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Yes.

939
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,220
I'm going to see my brother this week.

940
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,120
Should I take a photo?

941
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,290
Sure.

942
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,670
Listen.

943
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,870
Yes?

944
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,600
Don't call yourself Dad to Oh Woon.

945
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,580
I'm hanging up. Take care.

946
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,650
Okay.

947
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,209
High Square is DC's cash cow,

948
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,709
ensuring stable earnings.

949
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,679
The money is then reinvested into game development,

950
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,610
resulting in a virtuous cycle.

951
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,620
High Square is the engine that's operating DC.

952
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,290
Correct. Thanks to it,

953
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,320
the new games see results.

954
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,960
The stock price jumped recently.

955
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,330
Did DC announce a new game?

956
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,059
No. It's because of the photo CEO Do Han Chul uploaded...

957
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,300
onto his social media.

958
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,700
Let's see.

959
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,899
It looked like he landed a government project,

960
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,940
but...

961
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,600
it was simply clickbait.

962
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,080
The CEO is known for his unpredictable behavior.

963
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,979
Shareholders even signed a petition...

964
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,180
demanding he quit social media.

965
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,910
I see. Great work.

966
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,350
Oh, right. You're moving today, yes?

967
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,690
Yes. I'm almost completely moved in.

968
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,220
I sent some move-in gifts.

969
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,630
See you tomorrow.

970
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,130
"Gifts?"

971
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,230
Hi. Hello.

972
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,600
You ordered a washing machine, dishwasher, and microwave, right?

973
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,970
Me?

974
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,570
Yoon Joo No. Do I have the right person?

975
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,910
Oh, I see.

976
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,450
Shall I install the dishwasher over there?

977
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,079
Yes, please.

Prosecutor.

982
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,460
Pretend you don't know me. And keep a distance.

983
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,660
I'm scared the chief might see us together.

984
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,359
Come on.

986
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,600
Oh, this?

987
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,200
Yes. How did that happen?

988
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,500
Why must I tell you that?

989
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,670
"Why?"

990
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,410
What are batchmates for? To help out at a time like this.

991
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,249
But didn't you quit after trashing...

992
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,579
the prosecutors for being corrupt...

993
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,610
on the message board?

994
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,250
I thought of going to the press.

995
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,989
But worried my kind batchmates would get the blame,

996
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,519
I wrote it on the message board.

997
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,160
- Can I have this? - Sure, whatever.

998
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,730
Here's what happened.

999
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,869
The prosecution also advised CEO Cha Ho Jin...

1000
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,770
to pursue a civil lawsuit.

1001
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,169
However, CEO Cha Ho Jin...

1002
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,970
is suing for theft,

1003
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,739
claiming DC's Do Han Chul broke into...

1004
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,080
CHACHA Games.

1005
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,780
DC's CEO broke into CHACHA Games?

1006
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,410
Putting everything aside,

1007
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:45,980
it's absurd...

1008
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,220
a game company's CEO would break into another company.

1009
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,790
But Cha Ho Jin insisted he had hard evidence.

1010
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,220
So, I told him to bring it over.

1011
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,259
He brought a bunch of codes,

1012
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,060
declaring it to be blockchain or something and the evidence.

1013
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,930
Good grief.

1014
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,169
Prosecutors don't even know how to use Excel.

1015
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,970
As if they'd know blockchain.

1016
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,269
Looking down on the prosecutors...

1017
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,540
is the reason you quit.

1018
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,409
And so? Did you ask the Digital Team?

1019
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,440
I did.

1020
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,410
But there were no traces of hacking.

1021
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,820
Apparently, blockchain records everything as evidence.

1022
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,919
But nothing was there,

1023
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,150
suggesting he was innocent.

1024
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:26,890
True.

1025
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,690
The CCTV installed to catch the criminal...

1026
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,529
proved the criminal's innocence.

1027
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,530
Exactly.

1028
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,230
But Cha Ho Jin claims that's evidence of breaking in.

1029
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,930
What does that mean?

1030
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,170
I don't know. He says the absence of evidence is the evidence.

1031
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:41,870
But it's ridiculous, right?

1032
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,240
DC released a game similar to CHACHA's.

1033
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,209
But with no traces of hacking,

1034
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,580
DC Games had stolen it physically?

1035
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,950
Yes.

1036
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,679
The argument that DC's CEO himself...

1037
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,420
had broken into is outrageous.

1038
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,150
Reversing his statement...

1039
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,320
made it less credible.

1040
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,260
Mr. Cha insisted he said so from the start,

1041
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,060
but it was dismissed.

1042
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,130
I see. Thank you.

00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,380
- Why? - Be careful.

That punk is a scumbag.

1048
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,820

1049
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,760
He's like Yoon Joo No.

1050
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,430
- What? - Soon Young.

1051
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,590

- I do. - What a fool.

1053
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:46,400
And you quit being a prosecutor to work with him?

1054
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,670
- Yes. - You're no smartie pants.

1055
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,780
Do Han Chul and Yoon Joo No are both con artists.

1056
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,610
You can tell at a glance, no?

1057
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,219
I think it's best that you stay away from Do Han Chul.

1085
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,200
We're not doing games.

1086
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,070
Don't let me down.

1087
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,440
You do know how much DC is worth, right?

1088
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,180
Of course.

1089
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,550
We only came to greet Mr. Yoon today, didn't we?

1090
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,220
I should go since that's done.

1091
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,890
Mr. Yoon. Let's meet as friends next time,

1092
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,590
not for business.

1093
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,060
I'm fine with that.

1094
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
Thank you.

1095
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,970
- I'll see you again next time. - Yes.

1096
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,750
If there's no deal, how about you and I...

1097
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,250
He's a huge jerk.

1098
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,180
Sorry?

1099
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,190
It's nothing.

1100
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,190
I put you in the spot by asking you to introduce him to me, right?

1101
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,030
Don't worry about it. It's all business.

1102
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,229
Exactly. I thought you two were actually close...

1103
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,400
when you said you were friends with him.

1104
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,310
(Sanin)

1105
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,690
Did he come knowing that we were interested in CHACHA?

1106
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,599
- Who came? - Welcome.

1107
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,530
CEO Do Han Chul of DC stopped by.

1108
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,599
But how?

1109
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,270
Director Kang must've told him.

1110
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,970
And how did he know about it?

1111
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,640
I asked him...

1112
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,810
how much DC would need to create a game.

1113
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,050
Yes, Director Kang. You're on speakerphone.

1114
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,820
Okay. Right.

1115
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,319
As you mentioned, he's very interested in investments.

1116
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,259
When I brought up Sanin, he wanted to meet you right away.

1117
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,490
I'm grateful you came.

1118
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,160
How was he? Not that pleasant, right?

1119
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,200
I'm not sure.

1120
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,170
But does DC need an investment?

1121
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,100
They must have sufficient funds.

1122
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,110
DC's stock price went up recently.

1123
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,509
The cause was him uploading a social media post...

1124
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,739
as if he secured a government support project.

1125
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,080
It'll soon drop again.

1126
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,820
But he wants to maintain that price.

1127
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,179
Correct.

1128
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,990
Why? Are stock options involved?

1129
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,389
Is it to sell his stocks when the price is high?

1130
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,390
No. Rather than that...

1131
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,460
I think there's no particular reason.

1132
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,060
No reason?

1133
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,029
Yes.

1134
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,670
He just seems to want to maintain the market cap ranking.

1135
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,469
Mr. Do tends to think of it...

1136
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,240
like a game score ranking.

1137
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,340

He chose DC after getting rejected by us.

1145

(Sanin)

1146
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,510
Sanin must be signing the contract with Do Han Chul.

1147
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,809
We need to do it, Ho Jin.

1148
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,580
Or DC will take it from us again.

1149
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,260
Hi. You're Team Manager Yoon Joo No, yes?

1150
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Who are you?

1151
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:10,229
I'm Jouranlist Han Ji Eun from Jungang Economy.

1152
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,090
Are you free for a quick interview?

1153
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,800
Is there an issue?

1154
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,870
Rumor has it Sanin will make its way into the game industry.

1155
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,899
Where's the source from?

1156
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,169
Considering Sanin's past nature,

1157
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,509
it's definitely an unconventional move.

1158
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,910
I'm curious about the background,

1159
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,080
since you're directly handling the M and A process.

1160
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,980

1161
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,180
Correct?

1162
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,120
Nothing has been set.

1163
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,190
Then, may I use an insider quote saying,

1164
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,530
"Sanin and DC have no affiliation?"

1165
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,960
No.

1166
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,530

Yes.

1247
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,529

will develop a game together.

to start the rumor?

1261
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,630
The CEO came to us when I hadn't invited him.

1262

01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,970
That could be a good excuse for CHACHA Games.

1264
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,109
An excuse for what?

1265
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,140
CHACHA Games...

1266
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,609
isn't selling because the company is going under.

1267
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,110
They're selling to beat their rival.

1268
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,850
The CEO kept his pride.

1269
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,250
Oh, right. Jin Soo, did you play the game?

1270
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,920
Oh, the game? Yes, I did.

1271
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,290
But I couldn't beat the game yet.

1272
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,270
I checked the email, though.

1273
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,170
What does TSA mean?

1274
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,610
It means the title says it all.

1275
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,610
Is that something young people use these days?

1276
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,580
Well, the fad is over now.

1277
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,120
TSA.

1278
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,020
The screen is up now.

1279
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,830
This is the back end.

1280
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,730
In other words, it's Delivery King's program.

1281
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:08,240
That's what we see when computers bog down.

1282
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,570
Here's what I think.

1283
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,209
The black part is the screen,

1284
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,210
and the white things are the letters. Right?

1285
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,010
What we usually see is the front end.

1286
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,410
This is the program behind the screen, correct?

1287
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,650
Yes. That's right.

1288
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,050
Do developers share this kind of information with others?

1289
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,420
No. They never do that.

1290
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,860
How should I put it?

1291
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,329
If they were fund managers,

1292
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,290
this would be their portfolio.

1293
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,530
Like the recipe of a famous dish from a popular restaurant.

1294
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,200
Yes, that's it.

1295
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,629
He emailed me his trade secret...

1296
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,630
and his know-how?

1297
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,670
Why did he do that?

1298
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,170
Is it his way of showing his confidence?

1299
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,680
Maybe, this was more like, "You guys don't know anything."

1300
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,710
I didn't understand that either. So I asked Jenny for her insight.

1301
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,610
She wanted to explain it in person.

1302
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,520
Did you show this email to her?

1303
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,250
Oh, yes.

1304
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:06,490
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1305
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,630
Why do you think CHACHA Games sent us this?

1306
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,770
They revealed their back-end codes.

1307
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,510
- Isn't this just irrational? - Exactly.

1308
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,680
We could easily copy the codes.

1309
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,880
Us?

1310
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,680
Well, everyone can write codes these days.

1311
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,179
Sure.

1312
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,020
I've never seen anyone do this.

1313
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,520
I thought it had to be 1 of these 2 cases.

1314
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,859
He's either dumb...

1315
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,330
or trusts you too much.

1316
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,090
Or he's looking down on us.

1317
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,400
Well, I don't know about that.

1318
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,730
But anyway, both of my guesses were wrong.

1319
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:47,870
Then what is it?

1320
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:50,970
It's the blockchain.

1321
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:55,180
By blockchain, are you talking about cryptocurrency?

1322
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,510
Yes, that's a blockchain too.

1323
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,979
But as for this blockchain,

1324
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,210
the key point is that it can prevent possible hacking attempts.

1325
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,249
Records of any access...

1326
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,480
will remain permanently.

1327
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,050
And the records can't be changed.

1328
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,590
So...

1329
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,130
since there would be a record of us opening the email,

1330
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,990
they felt safe to send over their asset. Is that right?

1331
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:15,860
Yes.

1332
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:21,300
CHACHA Games is trying to show off.

1333
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,670
Yes. I agree.

1334
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,440
They're showing off...

1335
01:08:25,441 --> 01:08:26,470
- their blockchain technology? - Yes.

1336
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,810
Using this would revolutionize inventory management.

1337
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,010
What does this have to do with inventory management?

1338
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,080
Jin Soo. Could you?

1339
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,929
People say when inventory check is conducted in the military,

1340
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,860
even the number of helicopters doesn't match up.

1341
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,469
That shows inventory quantities are changing every minute...

1342
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,470
and it is difficult to keep up with the updates.

1343
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,100
Well, I'm sure it's the same way with companies.

1344
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,610
Yes. That's right.

1345
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:01,410
But you can use this system to keep your inventory updated...

1346
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,579
because all the departments in the company can use...

1347
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,510
a single ledger together in real time.

1348
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,520
This might not seem much to you.

1349
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,790
But it will revolutionize the logistics industry.

1350
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,850
Jenny.

1351
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,859
Then do you believe...

1352
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,990
the value of the company should be reevaluated?

1353
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,830
Yes. Absolutely.

1354
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,860
Okay.

1355
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:27,200
CHACHA Games recently launched a game called Delivery King.

1356
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,700
It didn't perform well, so the game is shut down for now.

1357
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,840
However, using this game's system will allow us...

1358
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,939
to manage everything from customer orders...

1359
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,380
to product procurement and delivery...

1360
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,810
all in one go.

1361
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,950
What? Delivery King?

1362
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,889
My gosh. What are you trying to achieve with a game that flopped?

1363
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,520
This isn't a joke.

1364
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,360
Do you think logistics is just a game?

1365
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,130
How much?

1366
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,760
They asked for ten million dollars.

1367
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,230
Ten million?

1368
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,960
I see.

1369
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,000
If I were to get on board with this,

1370
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,400
would you be able to buy it with ten million dollars?

1371
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Yes.

1372
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,539
We decided to draft a binding MOU that grants us...

1373
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,370
exclusive rights to negotiate with them.

1374
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,339
Once the MOU is signed, we'll be able to move forward...

1375
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,680
with ten million dollars.

1376
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,450
When?

1377
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,079
It's today.

1378
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,019
Many speculative articles have been published as of now.

1379
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,520
- We must hurry. - Okay. Due diligence.

1380
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,190
Let's wrap up for today.

1381
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,120
Ten million?

1382
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:22,659
Why would we waste ten million dollars on that?

1383
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,790
That's not the point now. Sir.

1384
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:25,930
Oh, right.

1385
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,200
You'll report this to the chairman yourself.

1386
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,860
It's not a problem, right?

1387
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,630
Director Lee?

1388
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,430
Oh, that's not a problem.

1389
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,370
(Acquisition Plan of CHACHA Games)

1390
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,980
I'll be back after I report this to the chairman.

1391
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,320
He'll be against this, right?

1392
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,890
- Probably. - I'm so scared.

1393
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,960
Oh, right. What time is CEO Cha coming in?

1394
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,560
Is our contract ready?

1395
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,900
Yes. He's coming in at 5pm.

1396
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,000
I might be late.

1397
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,800
Please inform him about the delay.

1398
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,320
Is going up to see the chairman this big of a deal?

1399
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,950
It is a big deal.

1400
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,259
Meeting with the decision maker...

1401
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,400
is the most critical moment in negotiations.

1402
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,130
Things that are above our pay grade...

1403
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
can be finalized at the meeting.

1404
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,370
He could approve acquiring CHACHA Games.

1405
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:47,240
Or he could dismantle our team.

1406
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,780
Sir, Team Manager Yoon Joo No is here.

1407
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,650
Come on in.

1408
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,490
Sit down.

1409
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,600
We've never had a 1-on-1 meeting like this, right?

1410
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,100
- This is our second time. - What?

1411
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,670
I met you 1-on-1 before I left for Hawaii.

1412
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,480
Director Lee wasn't there then?

1413
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,440
No.

1414
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,950
It was just you and me at the meeting.

1415
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,450
I see.

1416
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,190
I called you in here...

1417
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,220
to make something clear.

1418
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,760
You.

1419
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:39,930
Are you with me?

1420
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,930
I'm asking you if I can trust you.

1421
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,440
Director Lee said you didn't.

1422
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,810
But didn't you manipulate the stock price?

1423
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,509
If you're talking about JUMBO Pharmaceuticals...

1424
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,520
Yes.

1425
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,920
You wanted to buy the company.

1426
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,660
Didn't you?

1427
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,959
All right. Let's keep at it.

1428
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,390
- Let's keep at it. - There.

1429
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Goodness.

1430
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,900
So...

1431
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,840
it's about JUMBO.

1432
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,180
You were nowhere near it, right?

1433
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,950
You know, I asked just in case.

1434
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,320
Well, that's a fair question.

1435
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,930
It's not like I don't know how you work.

1436
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,900
Let me only give you the facts.

1437
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,540
If we were to go to my office right now,

1438
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,600
I would be able to show you Yoon Joo No's report,

1439
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,510
advising the company to buy JUMBO Pharmaceuticals.

1440
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:01,910
Really?

1441
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,780
I asked you if you advised Sanin to buy JUMBO.

1442
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,120
Yes.

1443
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,990
Buying JUMBO was my idea.

1444
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:17,060
But despite that, you still claim you did nothing wrong?

1445
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,890
- That's correct. - Then...

1446
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,130
why did your brother hold so many stocks of JUMBO?

1447
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,170
Why?

1448
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,610
That's why Yoon Joo No was questioned by the prosecution.

1449
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:32,970
I see.

1450
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,140
But he managed to avoid serving time.

1451
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,510
That's because he bought the stocks under his brother's name.

1452
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,880
So he borrowed his brother's name.

1453
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,920
Naturally, the prosecution questioned his brother first.

1454
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,860
But he died.

1455
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,730
How?

1456
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,560
He took his own life.

1457
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,360
So...

1458
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,870
you're blaming Sanin for your brother's death?

1459
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,300
Will you take revenge?

1460
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,110
No.

1461
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,980
Can you promise me that?

1462
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,720
Yes.

1463
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,060
If you can promise me that, buy it.

1464
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:25,490
Pardon?

1465
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,730
You're probably here because you want to buy a company.

1466
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,730
Yes.

1467
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,370
I want to acquire a gaming company called CHACHA Games.

1468
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,970
CHACHA Games asked for ten million dollars.

1469
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,479
If we were to accept the deal, we'll do due diligence...

1470
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,310
and negotiate the price.

1471
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,479
If there's a non-disclosure agreement...

1472
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,520
Yes.

1473
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,950
Buy it.

1474
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,670
He's running late, isn't he?

1475
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,370
Should I call him?

1476
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,240
I'll do it.

1477
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,130
Some people don't like taking calls these days.

1478
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,500
Then should we call his company instead?

1479
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,540
Sure.

1480
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,480
Is this CHACHA Games?

1481
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,780
This is Kwak Min Jeong from the M and A Team of Sanin.

1482
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,990
We're supposed to have a meeting with the CEO today.

1483
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,420
Oh, he already left.

1484
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,420
I see.

1485
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:05,560
I guess there's traffic.

1486
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,630
He left a while ago.

1487
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,030
Okay. I'm sure he'll be here soon.

1488
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,500
Okay, thank you.

1489
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,530
Then I'll proceed with the contract.

1490
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,340
But...

1491
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:21,380
make sure to buy it.

1492
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,240
Understood?

1493
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,550
Yes, sir.

1494
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,220
Is there a special reason for that?

1495
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,620
What reason?

1496
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,320
I'm a businessman. What other reason could there be?

1497
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,020
Okay. I understand.

1498
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,040
For a con artist,

1499
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,880
he's an awful liar.

1500
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,650
What happened?

1501
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,650
- We can proceed. - Really?

1502
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,990
He didn't scold you?

1503
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,590
I knew you could do it, Mr. Yoon.

1504
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,400
It seems CEO Cha is running late.

1505
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,399
- I see. - Darn it.

1506
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,900
Are game developers not punctual?

1507
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,240
I guess not.

1508
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:27,510
I could've been late to the meeting. It all worked out.

1509
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,610
Yes, but still. This is an important meeting.

1510
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,530
Yes, Mr. Cha.

1511
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,370
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.

1512
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,070
Should we reschedule then?

1513
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,510
No. It's not that.

1514
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,850
Another company offered more money.

1515
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:09,380
By how much?

1516
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,320
They doubled it.

1517
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,390
I'm sorry.

1518
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:29,470
Messing with someone like him could give us a headache.

1519
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,640
He'd do anything to get his way.

1520
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,810
Well, you're right about that.

1521
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:38,210
But I know all of Yoon Joo No's moves.

1522
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,080
Is that so?

1523
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,580
Then what will happen according to our plan?

1524
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:48,020
It's perfect.

1525
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,590
Hello. Is this CHACHA Games?

1526
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,400
Yes.

1527
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,630
I'm here because I have an offer for the CEO.

1528
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,100
Is the CEO here?

1529
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:11,179
("DC Games Drops Lawsuit Against CHACHA Games")

1530
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,510
(CHACHA Games, DC Games)

1531
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,590
(CEO Do Han Chul)

1532
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,460
Ho Jin, it's been a while.

1533
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,830
We need to talk. How about over a drink?

1534
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,370
It's my treat.

1535
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,350
Mr. Yoon.

1536
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:39,200
(The Art of Negotiation)

1537
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,099
They would double our offer.

1538
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,600
Is that the condition?

1539
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,430
- This is a setup. - They played me.

1540
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,570
I didn't know Yoon Joo No could be played too.

1541
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,639
Securing the location is the first step in battles.

1542
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,240
You're indeed a negotiation expert.

1543
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:23,809
With the Easter egg, developers can secretly plant their traces.

1544
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:26,179
There's a game DC Games developed called High Square.

1545
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,279
That's crazy, isn't it?

1546
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,380
They didn't hack it, but the Easter egg is still there.

1547
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,580
Should I try to cut a deal?

1548
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:33,289
I can promise you. He won't give you ten million dollars.

1549
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,449
He's a con artist.

1550
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,089
How dare he dupe a reporter?

1551
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,519
Don't you want to go back to making games?

1552
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,630
I hear people like you perceive the world only in terms of money.

1553
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,130
It's not over yet.

1554
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,200
Money isn't the only condition we can offer in negotiations.
