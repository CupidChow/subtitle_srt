Hello.

00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,180

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes, let's go inside.

I'm sorry.

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh, no.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,340
This is business.

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,200
I just got played. That's all.

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,610
I guess I played you.

25
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,990
Are you okay with the cigarette smoke?

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,660
I'm fine.

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,810
You're kind.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,370
No, no.

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,330
♫  You intertwine your fingers with mine  ♫

30
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,150
But how did you learn Korean?

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,480
I learned it at Yonsei University.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
In Sinchon? At the language school?

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,850
I also went to Yonsei University.

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,090
Really?

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,640
I enrolled in 2015.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,950
I also enrolled in 2015.

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,610
I drank a lot in Sinchon.

38
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,380
I also played a lot in Sinchon.

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,240
We may have met before.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,110
You're right.

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,550
Back then, I thought all I needed was to get hired.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,390
Yes.

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,000
I miss those days as well.

44
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,580
Would it get better once I'm no longer the maknae?

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,940
I know, right?

46
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,210
I'm also the maknae.

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,450
Come on.

48
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,550
Though we're both maknaes, you and I are different.

49
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,270
I got played by you, Hirose.

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,900
You were praised, but I got yelled at.

51
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,410
♫  Until dawn, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  ♫

52
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,140
And I'm also hungry.

53
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,620
Shizuoka is famous for its fish cakes.

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,250
By chance...

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,360
Shall we go?

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,020
Could I ask you something?

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,610
Sure.

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,960
What are you curious about?

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,520
This way.

60
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,830
Shimizu isn't interested in a deal with us, right?

61
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,630
That's their "tatemae,"

62
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,210
but we're not picking up on that, right?

63
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,170
Actually, Shimizu is trying to move its main branch.

64
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,130
Isn't Shizuoka its main branch?

65
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,120
That's right.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,180
But Shizuoka's population has diminished greatly

67
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,540
so we're trying to move the main branch to Tokyo.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,870
Who will go to Tokyo and who will stay in Shizuoka

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,520
will be decided this month.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,680
Team Leader Yoshida ended up staying behind

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,850
because of his performance.

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,810
Everyone tries to go to Seoul in Korea, too. It's a problem.

73
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,800
Since Shizuoka is a smaller city than Tokyo.

74
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,110
What about you, Hirose? Will you go to Tokyo?

75
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,200
Or will you remain in Shizuoka?

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,260
One person from my team can go to Tokyo.

77
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,420
It's more likely that Ozaki will go, not me.

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,910
But you also want to go, Hirose?

79
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,970
I don't know.

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,520
Going to Tokyo would be better for my resume.

81
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,640
But...

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,570
can't Mr. Yoshida improve his performance

83
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,460
by signing the contract with us?

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,420
A contract with Wind

85
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,450
wouldn't be enough to improve his performance.

86
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,080
Something is only recognized as a performance

87
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,720
when a payment is received.

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,530
But Wind's deposit wasn't enough.

89
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,310
Oh, is that why

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,120
he won't give us a discount?

91
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,390
If he doesn't give you a discount,

92
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,190
he may be able to meet his performance target.

93
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,820
If we can't get a discount,

94
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,730
there's no reason to sign this contract.

95
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,650
This is hard.

96
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,100
   

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,360
This is where I come often.

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,510
Wow.

99
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,870
It's so charming. Awesome.

100
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,030
Let's go inside.

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,710
   

102
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,110
 - Hey there. 
 - Did you wait long? 

103
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,810
 Ban-chan, you're late. 

104
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,570
 Sorry, the train was delayed. 

105
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,280
 Excuse me, Waiter. 

106
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,920
 - My friends just came, so...
 - Hi, Sir. 

107
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,550
 We'd like to place our orders. 

108
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,610
So how much do you usually take as a deposit?

109
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,950
The manual says to pay 10% by the end of next month.

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,650
If it's next month,

111
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,810
whoever is Tokyo-bound would be set already,

112
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,760
so it wouldn't matter to Mr. Yoshida.

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,470
Yes.

114
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,630
Enjoy.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Here is your ten-skewer set.

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,330
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

117
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
Pick one to try.

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,810
I choose this one.

119
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,420
The meat.

120
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,180
- I'll try it. 
 - Okay.

121
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,230
How is it?

122
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,420
It's so good.

123
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,540
- It's good? 
 - It's tasty.

124
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,390
It's tasty?

125
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,740
It's good.

126
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,410
But...

127
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,040
why are you telling me about Shimizu's situation?

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,230
I feel kind of bad,

129
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,680
and I just wanted to.

130
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,760
By chance,

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
if you also need performance points

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,190
to go to Tokyo,

133
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,940
then I'll look for a way.

134
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,780
Okay.

135
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,450
- It's good. 
 - Eat up.

136
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,340
Excuse me.

137
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,230
 I'd like a lemon sour. 

138
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,190
 Right away! 

139
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,180
Oh, it's strong.

140
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,790
It's strong?

141
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,560
  ­ 

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,430
Thank you.

143
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,180
Thank you so much for today.

144
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,490
Also for the good food.

145
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,760
I should've paid.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
Next time, you can buy, okay?

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,750
Okay. Next time,

148
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,480
I'll buy you something tasty if you come to Korea.

149
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,330
Jin Su, you seem like a pure person.

150
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,920
Excuse me? M-Me?

151
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,550
Yes.

152
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,110
This is "tatemae," right?

153
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,450
Pure...

154
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,910
No.

155
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,280
It's "honne."

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,480
♫  But that's okay  ♫

171
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,600
♫  'Cause I know  ♫

172
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,200
♫  Can all tomorrow  ♫

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,530
♫  Hopefully tomorrow  ♫

174
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,550
♫  We'll meet again  ♫

175
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,820
♫  Don't you see what I see in my heart?  ♫

176
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,600
♫  Baby, oh  ♫

177
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:17,140
♫  Do you know what I need in my eyes?  ♫

178
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Attorney.

179
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,310
 Excuse me, could I have some water?­ 

180
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,790
I thought you were a spy.

181
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,610
Did you hear anything useful?

182
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,600
Yes.

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
It turns out Shimizu also has an internal situation.

184
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,480
Did she tell you all about that?

185
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,190
Yes.

186
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,190
Performance is important

187
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,390
for Mr. Yoshida right now, right?

188
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes.

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,680
What was the needed deposit again?

190
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,210
Based on an order of 9000, with a 40% discount,

191
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,590
it would be 16.666%.

192
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,760
How about a 50% discount?

193
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,820
If we want a 50% discount,

194
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,450
we'd need to order more than 10,000.

195
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,160
Yes.

196
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,430
It would be a deposit of 18%.

197
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,830
That would be a good amount.

198
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,480
Should I set up a meeting?

199
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,680
No. I'll meet with Mr. Yoshida first.

200
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,300
Okay.

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,780
I'll go make a call. Be right back.

202
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,600
 Mr. Yun, is everything going well? 

203
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,900
Yes, CEO. We're in the process.

204
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,880
I had something to ask of you.

205
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,570
 Okay. 

206
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,660
I was wondering if we could pay a higher deposit early.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,120
 How much? 

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,570
Twenty percent.

209
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,610
We'd have to pay it this month.

210
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,730
 We don't have that much funds this month, Mr. Yun. 

211
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,110
Then, CEO,

212
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,460
let me make a different request.

213
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,390
You can request short-term funding from HQ.

214
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,020
Just make sure...

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,460
 you don't go to Mr. Ha. 

216
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,170
 It'd be best if you spoke to the chairman directly. 

217
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,040
 But... as for funding, 

218
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,850
 Mr. Ha is the CFO. 

219
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,300
 If I tell the chairman directly, 

220
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,390
 that'd be like skipping past Mr. Ha. 

221
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,410
 Yes, that's true, 

222
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,280
 but our current situation at HQ is a bit messy. 

223
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,500
 I think it's best you tell the chairman 

224
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,810
 directly this time. 

225
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,180
 And even better to naturally run 

226
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,070
 into the chairman in the lobby. 

227
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,240
Chairman.

228
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,150
Oh, hey.

229
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,650
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,290
I should've managed the business better.

231
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,340
Gosh, what are you saying?

232
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,650
Just focus on making good products.

233
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,540
Didn't we say we'd handle the sales?

234
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,640
Still,

235
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,370
I heard you were furious over the listing issue.

236
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,600
Furious? No...

237
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,020
What is it? Do you have something to tell me?

238
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,660
I was told they could close the deal by raising the deposit.

239
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,930
Who told you that? Was it the Team Leader?

240
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,780
- Yes, Team Leader Yun Ju No. 
 - Aigoo...

241
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,550
Well, if I increase the deposit,

242
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,440
the total sum should be reduced, right?

243
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,190
Yes.

244
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,740
Provide him with the funds.

245
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,340
Okay.

246
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,720
Aigoo, I guess you work out a lot these days.

247
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,120
Look at your thighs. You've still got it.

248
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,160
Yes, well...

249
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,670
those with good stamina also do well in business.

250
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,310
Drink.

251
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,830
The chairman says to proceed.

252
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,460
Okay.

253
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,810
This is the secretary's office.

254
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,050
Is the Planning Team Leader there?

255
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,090
Yes, go ahead.

256
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,370
But was this really the chairman's order?

257
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,220
Yes, I understand. Okay.

258
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,770
He approved it right away, as you said.

259
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,950
 That's good. Great work. 

260
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,240
But he said to lower the price a bit.

261
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,300
Closing the deal is hard enough.

262
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,890
I don't know if you can lower the price.

263
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll need to make it happen.

264
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,100
You should hurry on out before Mr. Ha comes.

265
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,330
Yes, I know...

266
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,980
Hey, CEO Park!

267
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,510
What's wrong with you!

268
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,340
If you came to HQ to borrow money,

269
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,420
you should've come to me, the CFO!

270
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,210
Who are you to go directly to the chairman—

271
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,780
I did come to see you, Mr. Ha.

272
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,640
But I happened to run into the chairman in the lobby.

273
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,120
He asked me why I came

274
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,740
so I had no choice but to tell him.

275
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,980
So did they close the deal?

276
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,170
I don't think they did yet.

277
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,120
I hear they might need to increase the deposit.

278
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,300
A decision needs to be made by tomorrow.

279
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,140
I'll submit the transaction approval tomorrow.

280
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,810
Thank you for responding to such an urgent call.

281
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,520
No problem.

282
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,930
Thank you for your call.

283
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,470
I prefer traditional Japanese tea over coffee.

284
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,360
Is that all right with you?

285
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,840
I wanted you to experience Japan

286
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,100
while you are here.

287
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,150
Of course. I appreciate it.

288
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,720
We proposed purchasing

289
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,530
a significantly large quantity,

290
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,600
around ten times the original amount,

291
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,700
believing it would be a favorable offer for Shimizu.

292
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,560
However,

293
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,360
it seems we may have underestimated

294
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,190
the cultural differences

295
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,650
between Japan and South Korea.

296
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,130
Yes.

297
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,780
It can happen if you are not

298
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,800
familiar with the culture.

299
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,260
Thank you for understanding.

300
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,880
Thank you for the tea.

301
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,670
Then...

302
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,660
we would like to inquire

303
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,700
about how we can reach an agreement appropriately.

304
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,480
The requested quantity can be done,

305
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,560
but there are concerns

306
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,380
regarding the change in the schedule,

307
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,030
issues of responsibility, and such.

308
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,730
Sure.

309
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,310
How about we address those concerns

310
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,220
by paying in advance?

311
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,710
But why did Mr. Yun meet with him by himself?

312
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,110
To be considerate of Mr. Yoshida.

313
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,740
How is that being considerate?

314
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,390
He knows signing a contract with us

315
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,490
is good for Shimizu,

316
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,910
but he rejected it for his own promotion.

317
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,140
So Mr. Yoshida would lose face

318
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,890
to talk about it in front of others.

319
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,700
I hear Japan cares a lot about saving face.

320
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,550
Well, Korea is like that too.

321
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,480
By "in advance,"

322
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,390
what deadline are you referring to?

323
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,950
Based on the current contract terms,

324
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,630
we are expected to pay

325
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,740
10% of the down payment next month.

326
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,350
But we would like to pay 20%

327
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,670
this month instead.

328
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,470
This month?

329
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,850
Yes. Additionally,

330
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,080
we request the cancellation of

331
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,450
Wind's current order of 1,000 units.

332
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,320
We would like to place a new order instead.

333
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,250
It is because of the discount, right?

334
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,030
That may not be a concern.

335
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,130
From 1,000 to 10,000 units,

336
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,170
the discount rate is the same at 40% anyway.

337
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,280
No. We intend to order 10,001 units.

338
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,750
In that case,

339
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,610
we understand that the discount rate will be 50%.

340
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,110
Isn't that Shimizu's manual?

341
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,650
We will need to consider it.

342
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,590
Yes.

343
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,820
But as you know,

344
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,150
the deadline is imminent.

345
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,480
Yes, Mr. Lee.

346
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,240
Shimizu decided to accept our offer.

347
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,150
 That's good. 

348
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,160
 The chairman should calm down a bit now. 

349
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,700
You're okay, right?

350
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,230
 Of course, I'm okay. I'll step down soon, anyway. 

351
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,800
 I just feel bad for you. 

352
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,250
- Are you stepping down? 
  - I should. 

353
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,000
 I can't keep working like this forever, you know. 

354
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,930
 I should retire and rest. 

355
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,550
Even if you do retire,

356
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,100
you should do so while being celebrated.

357
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,230
Thank you for your kind words.

358
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,470
Get some rest.

359
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,110
   

360
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,990
You should go home now.

361
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,640
Yes.

362
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh, the chairman...

363
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,530
I have something to report to him.

364
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,340
Do you think it's too late now?

365
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,620
Should I check with the secretary's office?

366
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,000
Or how about you do so tomorrow?

367
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,830
Okay.

368
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,860
Hello.

369
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,050
   

370
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,970
 Aigoo, it's been a while. 

371
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,420
 - I've been busy with work. 
 - I see. 

372
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,800
 You've got a lot of customers? 

373
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,700
 - Someone's over there for you. 
 - Oh, okay. 

374
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,990
   

375
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,280
   

376
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,390
I suddenly got an important message to check.

377
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,460
So why did you ask to see me, Mr. Ha?

378
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,470
I noticed you were having a hard time last time,

379
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,860
so I wanted to comfort you a bit.

380
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,210
Comfort me?

381
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,520
I mean, you're going through a lot emotionally.

382
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,970
Didn't you acquire Wind, Mr. Ha?

383
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,330
I did.

384
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,640
Then you should take responsibility, too.

385
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,030
Completely ignoring it is messed up, isn't it?

386
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,110
What do you mean, messed up?

387
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,150
Listing is the Investor Relations Team's responsibility.

388
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,000
Mr. Lee apologized to me.

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,670
Also, Wind...

390
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,360
will get listed.

391
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,540
CEO.

392
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,020
How did you become an executive

393
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,480
when you're so clueless?

394
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
What are you talking about?

395
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
I thought...

396
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,320
you heard an earful from the chairman recently.

397
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,580
He just lost his temper and took it out on me.

398
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,940
And honestly,

399
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,110
he didn't really say that much! Goodness.

400
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,160
That's not it, man.

401
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,150
CEO Oh,

402
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,500
do you think you got scolded by him

403
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,260
because of Wind?

404
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,240
The chairman also called in Mr. Lee and scolded you in front of him

405
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,640
for Mr. Lee to hear. It wasn't for you, CEO Oh.

406
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,450
But...

407
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,090
they are quite close.

408
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,090
So why?

409
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,540
Since they're close,

410
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,410
it'd be hard to tell him directly.

411
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,420
That's why he brought you in

412
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,030
and said what he wanted to say to Mr. Lee.

413
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,380
I told you already

414
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,360
that listing is handled by the IR Team.

415
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,240
- So? 
 - What do you mean, so?

416
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,910
I'm saying you shouldn't just take things.

417
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,070
Stop beating about the bush.

418
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,920
If you have something to say, just say it.

419
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,300
Your contract renewal is coming up, right?

420
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,810
If you want to stick around,

421
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,180
you need to make these things clear.

422
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,850
Make what clear?

423
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,210
That Mr. Lee is to blame.

424
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,570
You should make that clear.

425
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,940
Could you do that?

426
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,670
You said the chairman scolded me since he couldn't tell him directly.

427
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,780
That's why

428
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,850
we need to call for a board meeting.

429
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,090
Pardon?

430
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,530
Well, do you have any other ideas?

431
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,620
Yes.

432
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,620
- I'm sorry I'm late. 
 - No, no.

433
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,090
You came right on time.

434
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,560
I invited them for drinks. That's okay, right?

435
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,790
Mr. Han.

436
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,790
- I'm here. 
 - Hey.

437
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,980
CEO Kim.

438
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,140
You're here, too, CEO Oh.

439
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,360
What brings you here?

440
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,210
What do you mean? I came to eat.

441
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,390
Why else?

442
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,990
How good are you?

443
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,830
I'm around a tier-three player.

444
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,380
You're lying.

445
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,600
I can tell you're a pro.

446
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,180
Then we can just not place bets.

447
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,800
If we don't place bets, it won't be fun to play.

448
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,040
Please take a seat.

449
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,580
This place has the best sashimi in Korea.

450
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,330
I cannot betray Mr. Lee.

451
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,740
I'll be leaving first.

452
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,850
My goodness.

453
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,320
Whoever told you to betray him?

454
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,700
Then is CEO Kim a traitor?

455
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,870
Let's just eat and leave. I'll do the same.

456
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,170
Do you pick and choose sides

457
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,820
even when your job is at risk?

458
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,010
Look around here.

459
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,320
Even without you, the board meeting will happen.

460
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,130
Then why did you call me here?

461
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,550
Leave then.

462
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,590
Gosh, seriously.

463
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,090
Will you listen while standing there?

464
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,810
I said I had something to say.

465
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,600
CEO Oh.

466
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,490
Come on.

467
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,780
I mean,

468
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,820
holding a board meeting is too much.

469
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,440
I'd be turning my back on Mr. Lee in his presence.

470
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,980
Then

471
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,840
will you resign in his place?

472
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,040
Why should I resign?

473
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,360
If you can't renew your contract,

474
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,800
that's a resignation.

475
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,300
Mr. Lee and Yun Ju No really shouldn't do that.

476
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,560
Then how about

477
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,790
Yun Ju No just takes responsibility for it?

478
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,330
Well, that's a good idea as well.

479
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,430
Please, eat.

480
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,190
Oh, okay.

481
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,940
Well, I'll go ahead.

482
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,740
Here.

483
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,170
So I'm not saying

484
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,090
we should do something against Mr. Lee.

485
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,980
I'm saying

486
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,760
we give him a good reason to give up Yun Ju No.

487
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,290
He can make the decision himself.

488
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,920
But...

489
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,740
what if Mr. Lee says he'd take all the blame and retire?

490
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,970
How will you get rid of Yun Ju No then?

491
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,470
Won't he just be receiving a pardon?

492
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,410
Pardon...

493
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,140
Why do you think Yun Ju No came to HQ?

494
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,700
Do you know why?

495
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,730
Here.

496
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,860
When a person starts handling large sums of money,

497
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,510
they start getting confused.

498
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,420
Even though they know it's not their money,

499
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,220
it feels like it's theirs while it's in their hands.

500
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,200
That's why money is a scary thing.

501
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,380
Is that really so?

502
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,130
I'm telling you.

503
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,290
When you do M&amp;A,

504
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,840
you end up handling tons of billions of won.

505
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,480
Over time, money seems trivial,

506
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,190
and it all feels like it's yours.

507
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,070
You should know to be wary of money.

508
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,620
Exactly.

509
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,280
When you go out to acquire a company,

510
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,170
you meet people who want 20 billion for 10 billion won company.

511
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,650
But those guys can't beat an expert.

512
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,970
In the end, they sell the company for 5 billion.

513
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,700
Then how about me?

514
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,030
Since I got a 10 billion won company for 5 billion,

515
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,900
I earned my company 5 billion won.

516
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,040
That's true.

517
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,100
But when I look at my paycheck,

518
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,020
it's pathetic in comparison.

519
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,320
And you never know when you could be laid off.

520
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,060
So it's natural for people to think they should siphon some while they can.

521
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,640
It's true then.

522
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,730
The easiest thing would be to tell the guy selling

523
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,540
a 5 billion won company that I would buy it for 7 billion

524
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,190
if they give me 1 billion won.

525
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,790
Then I say that

526
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,890
I bought a 10 billion won company for 7 billion.

527
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,020
This would be so easy.

528
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,830
Then...

529
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,120
are you saying Yun Ju No received a rebate?

530
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,290
You know,

531
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,470
I'm not saying to treat a guy I trained badly

532
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,020
just because he took some money.

533
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,800
He is...

534
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,680
I really never told anyone this anywhere.

535
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,700
You know Jumbo Pharma, right?

536
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,650
Of course, we do.

537
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,720
Sanin almost went under because of it.

538
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,260
That was...

539
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,550
That was Yun Ju No's doing.

540
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,720
But didn't he get investigated by the prosecution

541
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,120
and they found nothing?

542
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,520
It's not that they found nothing.

543
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,670
Yun Ju No did that under his brother's name.

544
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,780
Then his brother died while being investigated.

545
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,430
Thus, the investigation closed

546
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,310
due to the death of the suspect.

547
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,450
That's what Mr. Lee feels bad and sorry about.

548
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,720
You know his personality.

549
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,580
You're good.

550
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,780
 He's happy this way or that. 

551
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,010
 He doesn't want criticism so he says nothing mean. 

552
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,920
But people like him make problems worse.

553
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,610
The problem only festers.

554
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,650
Yun Ju No is bound to blow up.

555
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,710
It's inevitable.

556
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,380
Therefore, Mr. Lee needs to get rid of him quickly,

557
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,190
or he's also doomed.

558
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,310
But...

559
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,520
Yun Ju No should be an expert in that field.

560
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,370
He bought stocks under

561
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,620
his brother's name so obviously?

562
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,940
You see.

563
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,890
Nice guys are like this.

564
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,960
No, I'm not nice.

565
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,000
If someone tries to

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,280
entrust their entire fortune to someone else,

567
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,360
they wouldn't be able to do it.

568
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,930
Most couldn't even entrust it to their own children.

569
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,390
 Basically, 

570
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,550
 Yun Ju No was very close to his brother. 

571
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,180
 That's why all that went down. 

572
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,490
 Ju No. 

573
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,720
 Help me out. 

574
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,600
 You're investing in Jumbo, right? 

575
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,450
 How do you know that? 

576
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,370
 Well? 

577
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,640
 I asked how you know that, Hyeong. 

578
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
 Sanin isn't investing in that company. 

579
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,880
 That company is a scam! 

580
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,480
 Don't lie. 

581
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,160
 If Sanin invested in it, shouldn't its stocks go up? 

582
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,800
 But... 

583
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,360
 why is it falling? 

584
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,980
 Ju No. 

585
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,610
 Save me this once. 

586
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,240
 If you don't, I'm dead! 

587
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,880
 Please? 

588
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,410
Hello.

589
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,090
The quantity is 10,001.

590
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,890
The unit price is 25 dollars.

591
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,260
20% of the total amount will be paid this month,

592
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,930
and this payment will serve as a deposit.

593
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,010
I understand.

594
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,460
The quantity, at 10,001 units, exceeds 10,000,

595
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,240
so please reconfirm the discount rate of 50%.

596
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,030
Please reconfirm that the discount rate is 50%.

597
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,350
We've already obtained Wind CEO, Park Rae Gyeong's signature.

598
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,610
A document guaranteeing our role as his agent is also included.

599
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,300
A document guaranteeing our role as his agent is also included.

600
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,770
Thank you.

601
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,930
There's no problem.

602
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,260
We will take over the supply Shimizu sent

603
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,600
to Speed in Korea.

604
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,290
The MOU contract with Speed will be attached later.

605
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,640
Thank you.

606
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,180
There are no issues.

607
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:41,090
But are you sure Wind makes bicycles?

608
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,830
Does this company really make bicycles?

609
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,460
Is Wind really a company that makes bicycles?

610
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,240
Yes, it is.

611
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,300
Could I give him a brief explanation?

612
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,040
Well, Wind also makes archery bows.

613
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,500
It's number one in archery bows—

614
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,890
I'm sorry,

615
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,410
but I cannot sign this.

616
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,780
He says he cannot sign this.

617
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,220
What's the reason?

618
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,420
Why can't you sign it?

619
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,630
I cannot trust this company.

620
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,090
Mr. Naito!

621
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,060
Mind your manners! They are guests.

622
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,890
Team Leader.

623
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,120
You're signing this contract so you can meet your quota and go to Tokyo.

624
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,890
Calm down, Mr. Naito.

625
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,050
You're the same as him.

626
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,320
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,020
- Hey, look... 
 - Mr. Naito.

628
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,020
- Mr. Naito. 
 - What happened, Mr. Naito?

629
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,450
Mr. Naito. Please wait a moment.

630
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,120
Are you unable to trust us because of the quantity change?

631
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,050
If we wanted to deceive Shimizu,

632
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,530
we could've bought the gears from other bike companies.

633
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,630
As I've mentioned already, the bicycle industry in Korea is struggling.

634
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,380
Well...

635
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,840
if you're changing it like this, can't it change again later?

636
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,630
There's no point in such a contract.

637
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,840
If it's this changeable, there's no point in redoing the contract.

638
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,340
That's why we are writing up a contract today.

639
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:31,440
A contract is a promise we need to keep but also decides the penalty for breaching it.

640
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,580
I don't know about any of that.

641
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,840
But I know that a company that broke a promise once will break it again.

642
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,560
I know that very well. If you'll excuse me.

643
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,930
He says if you break a promise once, you can break it again.

644
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,470
I'm so sorry.

645
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,780
My apologies.

646
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,330
For changing the quantity on the contract,

647
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:23,890
the production manager's approval is required

648
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:29,510
from the perspective of managing supply issues.

649
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,160
I'm very sorry things have turned out this way.

650
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,700
There must be a reason Naito is taking such a stance.

651
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,870
I-I can't say what the reason is.

652
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,690
But it should be noted that

653
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,120
he comes from generations of craftsmen.

654
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:59,690
That's why he's very strong-willed and lacks business acumen.

655
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,230
Did Naito's parents also make gears?

656
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,590
Not gears.

657
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,070
But his father was also a master craftsman.

658
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,580
Specifically, precision machining.

659
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,610
He even had his own factory.

660
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:23,040
The work clothes Mr. Naito was wearing were probably from his father's company.

661
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,820
Yes. Yes.

662
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,700
That... That factory is currently Shimizu's.

663
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,790
 Mr. Naito is continuing his family legacy 

664
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,930
 by running the factory himself. 

665
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:48,410
 I believe Japan is sustained by such craftsmanship. 

666
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,040
 ­  
   

667
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,000
Dad!

668
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,780
Ken, I told you not to come.

669
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,290
- Are you done with school? 
 - Yeah.

670
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,940
Hello, Sir.

671
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,580
Did you sign the contract?

672
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,280
- Did you have one this morning? 
 - No, not yet.

673
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,310
Did something happen?

674
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,960
We have too many canceled units these days.

675
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,220
I already know that.

676
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,750
Our warehouses are full too!

677
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,430
We just have to do our job well.

678
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,380
I see...

679
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,180
Hello.

680
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:58,330
I don't think we can proceed with the contract any further.

681
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,690
I'm very sorry.

682
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,770
I'm sorry.

683
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,430
No.

684
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,410
I'll escort you back.

685
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,140
- Hirose. 
 - Yes?

686
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,870
I'd like to meet with Mr. Naito.

687
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,040
Is there a way?

688
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,470
He usually heads to the factory for work.

689
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,370
Excuse me, could you take us here?

690
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,460
Oh, Shimizu Factory?

691
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,900
Oh, yes. Do you know the place?

692
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,280
Of course, I do.

693
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,640
It's been around for over 100 years.

694
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,030
Is that so?

695
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,810
Will we absolutely need Shimizu's permission to receive Speed's inventory in their place?

696
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:08,780
Yes, the contract contained a strict resale ban.

697
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,260
Can we delay the supply contract?

698
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,780
No, we can't. We have an OEM contract scheduled.

699
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,810
Hello.

700
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,870
May I have your name?

701
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,980
We are from the Korean company Wind.

702
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,030
Could we meet the Factory Manager?

703
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,900
You're the ones trying to make a contract.

704
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,460
Yes.

705
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,990
Mr. Naito.

706
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,970
Mr. Naito. There are Korean people looking for you.

707
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,410
   
 (T/N: Gain new insights through old experiences) 

708
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,090
How could you come without an appointment?

709
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,760
He's saying we came without an appointment.

710
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,160
I'm sorry.

711
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,050
I just had something to ask you.

712
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,690
But I don't want to speak to you anymore.

713
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,010
Please go back.

714
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,220
M-Mr. Naito.

715
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,150
Cutie!

716
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,800
Otherwise, the number of...

717
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,170
So...

718
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,420
Could you ask if he's working tomorrow?

719
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,610
Is Mr. Naito coming to work tomorrow?

720
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,220
He comes to work every day.

721
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,040
I see.

722
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,580
He says he is coming to work tomorrow.

723
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,410
   

724
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,910
CEO Park's name was also on the contract, right?

725
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:55,300
Yes. It had both CEO Park's name and signature.

726
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,300
You know how he asked if Wind was a bicycle company?

727
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,440
- Before signing? 
 - Yes. So, I said yes

728
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,800
and explained that it also makes archery bows.

729
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,860
 So did the contract go well? 

730
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,470
I'm sorry.

731
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,600
We failed to do so.

732
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,280
 H-How did that happen? 

733
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:27,290
The factory manager is a metalcraft artisan and is opposing it.

734
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,710
 That's understandable in Japan. 

735
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,670
 The artisans over there have a lot of pride. 

736
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,250
 I went through a lot because of that when I was acquiring Daichi. 

737
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,320
Yes, that makes sense.

738
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
 Yes. 

739
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,490
Until the early 1990s, Daichi was number one when it came to archery bows.

740
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:55,300
But they were already losing the market to us among the athletes.

741
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,050
In the end, Daichi's situation got bad and had to sell the company.

742
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,860
 And that's why you acquired it, CEO. 

743
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,930
I didn't buy it because I needed Daichi's technique.

744
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,960
We were already ahead of Daichi

745
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,170
in terms of technique by then.

746
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,230
 Then why did you acquire it? 

747
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:23,380
 Daichi had built a strong reputation. 

748
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,730
 If another company acquired it, 

749
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,450
 I thought they could quickly catch up 

750
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,560
 to Wind with that reputation. 

751
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,110
 So you acquired it as a defensive move. 

752
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,340
 Yes. 

753
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,270
 But... 

754
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,560
 Daichi set this as the condition 

755
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,720
 for the acquisition at the time. 

756
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,780
 "Please make a better bow than Daichi." 

757
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,970
 At first, I was a bit taken aback. 

758
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,500
 At first, I thought it was just bravado. 

759
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,640
 But looking back now, 

760
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,670
 I think he truly meant it. 

761
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,780
 CEO, could I see you for a moment? 

762
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,090
 I'll come to you right now. 

763
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,040
 What is this about? 

764
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,820
 The photo of Daichi hanging in Wind's office... 

765
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,910
 The one taken when I acquired Daichi? 

766
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,270
 Yes. The artisan in that photo 

767
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,790
 drew that blueprint, right? 

768
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,340
 Yes. 

769
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,550
 That's why I also gifted him the framed calligraphy. 

770
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,500
 "On Ko Chi Shin." 

771
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,790
 Oh, you remember it. 

772
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,270
 You said you wrote it yourself, right? 

773
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,660
 The artisan requested it. 

774
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,690
 The boy in the photo is the artisan's son, right? 

775
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,260
 He is. 

776
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,870
 Do you remember his name? 

777
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:05,010
 I don't remember the son's name. 

778
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,640
 But the name of the artisan was... 

779
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,670
 Daichi Naito. 

780
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,330
 I see. 

781
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,000
 CEO. 

782
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,190
 I think we'll need that photo. 

783
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,360
 Pardon? 

784
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,930
 You need this? 

785
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,600
 Yes. 

786
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,280
Thank you.

787
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,930
You work on your day off, too. That's amazing.

788
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,610
Can you please leave already?

789
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,820
There's something that he needs to tell you.

790
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,300
Could you please wait a moment?

791
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,580
We'll be in trouble if you keep staying here.

792
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,230
How much longer are you going to stay here?

793
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,360
Please.

794
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,920
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

795
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,550
Okay. What do you want to tell me?

796
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,410
There's something I'd like to confirm first.

797
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,980
Is the reason you didn't want to sign our contract

798
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,730
because you saw "Park Rae Gyeong" on the contract?

799
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,900
There's something I'd like to check.

800
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,460
Did you reject the contract

801
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,830
because you saw Park Rae Gyeong's name on it?

802
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,360
The previous contracts had no changes in quantity,

803
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,200
so you wouldn't have seen Park Rae Gyeong's name.

804
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,120
But this time, your approval was necessary

805
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,360
and you saw Park Rae Gyeong's name there.

806
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,140
Isn't that right?

807
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,400
Unlike before,

808
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,520
you ended up participating in an amendment contract.

809
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,250
And you saw

810
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,870
Park Rae Gyeong's name for the first time.

811
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,620
What about that?

812
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,120
CEO Park previously acquired

813
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,150
the archery bow company Daichi.

814
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,260
As a result,

815
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,730
the number one archery company, Daichi, disappeared.

816
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,680
With Wind's acquisition of Daichi,

817
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,870
the number one archery company Daichi disappeared.

818
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,740
Hang on.

819
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,120
I can't take this anymore!

820
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,820
Come on.

821
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,670
Wasn't your father

822
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,700
an artisan who made bows at Daichi?

823
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,160
Wasn't your father

824
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,800
an artisan who made bows at Daichi?

825
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,440
Yes, that's right. Yes.

826
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,890
Did you come all this way to say such things?

827
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,770
I have something to give you.

828
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,700
Well, Mr. Yun went back to Korea

829
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,620
to bring you this.

830
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,000
The flight back was delayed, so he was a bit late.

831
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,030
Please understand.

832
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,920
If what you want is a contract,

833
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,430
I already told you

834
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,150
that I cannot sign it.

835
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,960
It's not a contract,

836
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,940
but it is about a promise.

837
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,910
It's not a contract,

838
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,110
but it is about a promise.

839
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,860
   

840
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,770
This is a photo of your father

841
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,380
and Wind CEO Park Rae Gyeong from thirty years ago.

842
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,750
At the time, your father

843
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,470
sold Daichi to CEO Park and gifted him

844
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,690
a bow blueprint that he personally drew.

845
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,910
At the time, your father sold Daichi to CEO Park

846
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,140
and gifted him a bow blueprint

847
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,590
that he personally drew.

848
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,680
With the request to make the world's best bows.

849
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,980
With the request to make the world's best bows.

850
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,770
And CEO Park also gifted your father a slogan.

851
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,270
And the meaning is

852
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,100
"On Ko Chi Shin."

853
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,150
 At the time, CEO Park 

854
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,280
 gifted him a framed slogan that read, 

855
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,780
"Learn the old, understand the new."

856
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,890
This...

857
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,390
is an insult to my father!

858
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,610
He said he would protect the old things!

859
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,160
The contract breaks this promise!

860
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,250
That's how you interpreted it, I see.

861
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,340
Still, I see that you hung it up there.

862
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,600
Is there a reason you hung up the slogan

863
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,100
- despite that? 
 - What?

864
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,890
I look at it every day,

865
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,160
trying to understand how my father felt!

866
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,970
That slogan was requested by your father.

867
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:38,580
He says your father requested those words.

868
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,590
Don't you think your father

869
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,900
wanted you to carry on his legacy,

870
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,420
while also wanting you to forge your own path?

871
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,400
I think your father would want you to

872
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,920
carry on his legacy,

873
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,330
but also take a new path for yourself.

874
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,760
 Dad! 

875
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,650
 I'm back! 

876
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,070
 Welcome back. 

877
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:12,530
 Okay.­ 

878
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,190
 I told you not to come to the factory. 

879
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,560
 No! I don't want to! 

880
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,690
 I'm going to become an artisan just like you, Dad! 

881
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,550
 Really? 

882
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,640
 Yes, I promise! 

883
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,990
This is Dad.

884
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,570
You see that?

885
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,880
Dad...

886
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,960
I'm sorry.

887
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,560
I'm trying my best, though...

888
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,520
And this little one has grown up this much.

889
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,680
What's this?

890
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,350
Is this for me?

891
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,570
Whenever I came to the factory after school,

892
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,010
Grandpa used to give me candy.

893
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,650
Thanks.

894
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:33,010
This is a letter

895
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,190
from CEO Park to you, Mr. Naito.

896
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:42,320
This is a letter from CEO Park to you.

897
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
 Hello. 

898
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,310
 This is Park Rae Gyeong of Wind. 

899
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,670
 When I acquired Daichi, 

900
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,790
 your father asked me to make the world's best bow 

901
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:16,700
 and gave me a bow blueprint he personally drew. 

902
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,270
 Though bows from then are different from bows now, 

903
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:27,230
 my desire to make good bows hasn't changed. 

904
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:31,080
 Wind didn't cause Daichi to disappear. 

905
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,780
 Wind is the only company to carry on 

906
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,350
 your father's artisan mentality. 

907
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:40,310
 Also, "On Ko Chi Shin." 

908
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,060
 That slogan was 

909
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,020
 what your father wanted to tell you. 

910
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:52,680
 I heard you are living out your father's wishes. 

911
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,530
 I will continue to support your future endeavors. 

912
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,960
 Sincerely, Park Rae Gyeong. 

913
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,670
Thank you.

914
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,660
Thank you.

915
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,000
Thank you.

916
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,950
Yes, Mr. Lee.

917
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,910
We finalized the contract and are about to return.

918
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,530
The discount rate is 50%,

919
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:04,070
a much more favorable condition than before.

920
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,080
 You did great. 

921
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,050
 It's impressive. 

922
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,920
 You haven't reported it yet, right? 

923
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,970
No. Today is a holiday

924
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,880
so I will report it once we return to work.

925
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,410
 But could you delay it a bit? 

926
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,640
Yes, okay.

927
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,320
Jin Su.

928
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,300
Aren't you sad to leave Japan?

929
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,180
Gosh, still...

930
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,790
I'm relieved we managed to secure the contract.

931
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,700
Yes, that's true.

932
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,350
So that's why!

933
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,990
I'm hungry because we secured the contract.

934
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,400
Gosh, aren't you hungry?

935
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,460
A little bit.

936
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,970
Right?

937
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,290
You haven't left yet?

938
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,420
I didn't think you had eaten yet.

939
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,930
My team leader asked me to take care of it.

940
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,890
He's such a good guy.

941
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,620
It so happens that we are hungry.

942
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,780
Oh, no.

943
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,270
I know what this means now.

944
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,420
- Telling us to leave quickly, right? 
 - N-No!

945
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,470
I sincerely want to treat you to a meal.

946
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,330
Are you really being honest?

947
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,560
Really!

948
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,590
Really.

949
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,990
Now that I can relax after being tense all day,

950
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,350
I am a bit hungry.

951
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,770
We're about to go eat.

952
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,020
Would that be okay with you, Mr. Yun?

953
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,060
Of course. Sounds good.

954
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,320
Where would you like to go?

955
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,720
What's tasty?

956
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,060
Then how about ramen?

957
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,600
Since you've already had fish cakes.

958
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,710
That goes for both of you, too, right?

959
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,220
- Me? 
 - Yes.

960
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,610
Then...

961
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,740
did Hirose know we were following them?

962
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,570
It seems like it.

963
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:03,220
Isn't this her true feelings for you, Jin Su?

964
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,150
It's nothing like that!

965
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,310
Thank you for the food!

966
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,420
Let's sit together.

967
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,180
Oh, Attorney.

968
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:19,990
Thank you for the food.

969
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,760
Thank you for the food.

970
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,800
Jin Su asked me to help you go to Tokyo.

971
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,240
Yes, I heard from the Team Leader.

972
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,880
But I like Shizuoka.

973
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,790
Yes, I heard that's what you decided.

974
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,470
We received so much help from you.

975
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:48,460
No, I received so much from you.

976
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,200
Thank you for all your hard work.

977
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,570
- I'll get in touch again. 
 - Okay.

978
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,530
Thank you.

979
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,800
Thank you.

980
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,770
Thank you.

981
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,180
Thank you for everything.

982
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,210
   

983
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,040
Hello.

984
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,290
Hello. Hello.

985
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:34,160
It appears Mr. Lee isn't going to show up.

986
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,800
The current situation doesn't look good for him.

987
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,300
- You all understand, right? 
 - Pardon?

988
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,670
Are you saying Wind is Mr. Lee's responsibility?

989
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,320
Are you crazy?

990
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,350
Then whose responsibility is it?

991
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,240
Who's in charge of the listing?

992
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,760
I see.

993
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,460
We haven't released the article yet, right?

994
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,460
No. It's on standby.

995
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,970
Should we release it?

996
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,030
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

997
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,940
Should we say Mr. Lee is absent and proceed?

998
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,040
Yes, let's do that.

999
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:21,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

1000
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,800
We will start the board meeting

1001
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,710
since everyone's here.

1002
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,230
- The main agenda is— 
 - Discuss the side issue first.

1003
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,150
I think that's more important.

1004
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:40,680
Oh, okay.

1005
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:47,260
The side issue is about Wind's failed listing.

1006
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,980
I think Mr. Lee should provide an explanation.

1007
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,500
Wind's listing won't be a problem

1008
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,000
as long as sales are strong.

1009
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,430
Listings aren't about numbers.

1010
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,660
It's about momentum.

1011
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,710
So...

1012
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,850
are you saying it's my fault?

1013
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,580
How could it only be your responsibility?

1014
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:16,420
But wouldn't it also look bad for you

1015
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,930
if you blame others, Mr. Lee?

1016
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,030
It'd be a different story

1017
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,990
if we secured that deal in Japan.

1018
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,350
But everything fell through, didn't it?

1019
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,050
If you feel that way, why don't we put it to a vote?

1020
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,490
Why would we do that?

1021
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:32,000
This isn't even a yes-or-no agenda.

1022
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,300
Shouldn't we clarify whose responsibility this is?

1023
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,860
Let's do that then.

1024
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,200
Okay. Then...

1025
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,890
if you think Wind's failed listing is

1026
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,850
IR Team's fault,

1027
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,070
raise your hand.

1028
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,340
CEO Oh, did you just raise your hand?

1029
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,950
Yes.

1030
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,850
Aigoo...

1031
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,560
Hello.

1032
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,030
I stopped by to report something.

1033
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,300
We secured the gear supply contract

1034
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,690
with Shimizu in Japan.

1035
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:21,130
What about the contract deposit payment?

1036
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,560
The contract took place on the weekend

1037
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,420
so I will be processing the payment today.

1038
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,950
Also, Wind will release

1039
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,810
an article on their new product.

1040
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,570
Since sales concerns made the listing difficult,

1041
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,310
we believe this contract will help

1042
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,120
address those concerns.

1043
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,270
Then I'll take my leave.

1044
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,850
May I leave as well?

1045
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,720
H-Hey, Mr. Lee.

1046
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,640
Mr. Lee, t-that's not what I meant...

1047
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,300
- CEO Oh. 
 - Yes, Mr. Lee.

1048
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,030
If you blame others for feeling wronged,

1049
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,390
you should quit.

1050
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,890
I'm not saying I feel wronged...

1051
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:31,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

1052
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,990
Go about your business.

1053
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:37,380
You said your contract renewal is coming up soon.

1054
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:01,810
   

1055
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,850
Yes, Seonbae.

1056
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,580
 Did you have a nice trip to Japan? 

1057
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,900
Yes, we resolved it well.

1058
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,590
 As I thought. 

1059
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,850
 I found all the members for the plan. 

1060
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,560
 They still live like that. 

1061
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,020
That works out.

1062
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,550
 Then should we start? 

1063
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,030
Seonbae, I'll call you right back.

1064
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,000
Yes, Mr. Lee.

1065
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,890
 You're still up. 

1066
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,850
 I'm sorry for calling you at this hour. 

1067
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,440
 It's okay. Please go ahead. 

1068
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,610
 There's been an incident. 

1069
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,480
 The chairman took out a loan 

1070
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,100
 with his stocks as collateral, 

1071
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,800
 and he processed it through the secretary's office. 

1072
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:14,760
 It seems he was trying to do it discreetly. 

1073
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,070
 With no public disclosure, 

1074
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,740
 the secretary's office realized it was a problem 

1075
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,920
 when it got close to the due date. 

1076
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,520
   

1077
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:29,200
 Maybe the chairman didn't want it to be made public. 

1078
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,630
Will it be okay, Mr. Lee?

1079
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:34,200
Of course not.

1080
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,050
Think of it as saving my life.

1081
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,970
Please resolve this for me.

1082
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:41,120
 Let's talk about the details in person. 

1083
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,080
Okay. I understand.

1084
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:07,970
   

1085
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,390
   

1086
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:34,210
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 🐺 Wolf in a Suit 👔 Team @ Viki 

1087
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,820
 May I ask you where you spent the 50 billion won? 

1088
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,110
 Something's off about this. 

1089
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,900
 We should borrow money elsewhere and pay it off. 

1090
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,040
 Are you confident? 

1091
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,160
 I'll fix it. 

1092
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,860
 If a rumor says we don't even have 50 billion... 

1093
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,560
 Our stock price may plummet. 

1094
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,890
 I bought a resort. 

1095
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,620
 Are you really thinking of selling it? 

1096
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,440
 I believe we need to do that. 

1097
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,080
 I'm a tenant of Unit 123. 

1098
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,840
 I guess you're Sanin employees. 

1099
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,030
 You stayed here for a year? 

1100
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:08,550
 It turns out Song Ji Hyo is the real owner. 

1101
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,000
 Don't sell it. 

1102
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,200
 Is there a reason I shouldn't? 

1103
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:18,760
 ­
