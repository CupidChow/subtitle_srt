00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,460
Yes, hello.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm Kim Hyeon of Sanin's PR Team.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,350
Is Reporter Han Ji Eun available?

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,820
Well, before replying to the email, I wanted to confirm with her.

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,220
Sanin.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,160
Yes?

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,740
 Are you Reporter Han Ji Eun? 

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,340
I'm Kim Hyeon of Sanin's PR Team.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,390
If you have complaints, please send me an email.

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,940
 No, this isn't a complaint. 

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,350
I was hoping you could give us a chance to explain.

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,470
Yes, so please do so by email.

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,440
I'll try meeting with her first.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,210
Yes, I'll prepare a counter-article.

31
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,840
Okay.

32
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,460
Did something happen?

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,070
No.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,570
What do you mean, no?

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,450
Something came up.

36
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,630
I didn't think you'd personally ask to see me.

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,430
Reporter Han.

38
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,910
I saw your last article, too.

39
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,740
I thought we should explain ourselves this time.

40
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,500
I guess the rumors were true then, right?

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,560
Actually, we are preparing e-commerce.

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,910
Oh, really?

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,480
Yes.

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,890
There are still internal decisions left to be made,

45
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,600
but once made,

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,830
we will also start promoting it.

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,690
I'd like to offer you an exclusive interview then.

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,450
With the chairman?

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,510
You can do it with me first.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,470
I'll also consider an interview with the chairman.

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,770
Well, I'd be grateful if you could give me an exclusive.

52
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,820
So what did you want to say to me today?

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,210
I wanted to tell you that

54
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,480
Sanin isn't in a state

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,370
to waver due to Wind's listing issues.

56
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,930
As I've told you, once we enter the e-commerce market—

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,050
But...

58
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,400
the article was already published.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,830
The deadline has passed.

60
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,500
Well, it's not like my article was false, right?

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,760
   

62
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,350
 As the count goes down, your mind starts racing. 

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,600
 You lose your focus as well. 

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,500
 This is the most important time to steady yourself 

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,410
 and focus. 
   

66
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,050
 Okay, Archer Oh Yu Hwan. 

67
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
Yes?

68
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,820
 Mr. Yun, did you check Sanin's stock price? 

69
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,370
No.

70
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,650
What is it?

71
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,460
 It's at 101,000 won. 

72
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,270
 If it falls below 100,000 won, PPF can exercise its put option. 

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,870
 If it falls any further... 

74
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,410
Sanin will be...

75
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,490
taken over by PPF.

76
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,770
- Was there an issue? 
 -  An article was published. 

77
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,080
 I'll text it to you. 

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,200
 It's about how Sanin will be taken over 

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,450
 by PPF if they fail to list Wind. 

80
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,620
 Due to the put option. 

81
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,700
What's the reporter's name?

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,140
 Reporter Han Ji Eun. I think you'd know her. 

83
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,020
I think so.

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,800
 - Welcome!  
 - When we did Cha Cha...

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,610
Just a moment.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,240
Three egg mayo sandwiches. Exactly the same, please.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,070
Okay.

88
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,730
Can we meet right now?

89
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,180
 Yes, I already told others. 

90
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,860
 They should be on their way now. 

91
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,870
 By the way, Mr. Yun, I sent you a text. 

92
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,860
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,980
Let me redo my order.

94
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,570
I'd like a veggie sandwich on wheat bread,

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,540
no pickles, and with just olive oil.

96
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,080
Okay.

97
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,220
Anything else?

98
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,610
Did that one article cause the stock price to fall?

99
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,120
Yes, since Sanin is particularly vulnerable right now.

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,980
We should prepare for more articles that may come.

101
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,180
What's PPF's put option?

102
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,590
They can request repayment in stocks.

103
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,650
I'll check the detailed conditions.

104
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,800
Did Mr. Kang release the report on Wind's listing?

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,030
Yes. Should I tell Mr. Kang to come?

106
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,710
Tomorrow morning, if possible.

107
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,130
Okay.

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,590
Couldn't the stock price rebound tomorrow?

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,030
That would be so great.

110
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,610
   

111
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,170
   

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,400
   

113
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,170
What is this?

114
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,990
   

115
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,550
What's with this crazy stock price?

116
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,560
Yes, Chairman.

117
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,510
It's CEO Oh Chi Yeong of the Leisure Division.

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,740
Yes, I understand.

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,020
What did he say?

120
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
CEO Oh of the Leisure Division is being called in.

121
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,560
Yes, Chairman.

122
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,840
All right.

123
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,120
He wants Director Lee to come in as well.

124
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,820
 They are looking for you at HQ. 

125
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,070
 - Why? 
 - An article... 

126
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,340
Take me to HQ quickly.

127
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,990
What is this?

128
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,200
Yes, Mr. Lee.

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,010
I just came back from an overseas business trip.

130
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,270
I just received the call.

131
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,960
 Take care and come. 

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,870
Okay. B-But...

133
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,080
why is he calling us in?

134
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,890
 An article was published today... 

135
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,600
There are no issues with Wind.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,550
Why did such an article get published?

137
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,000
- Was there an issue? 
 - I'm not sure.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,780
Since they asked me to pay back my debt,

139
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,490
I sold Construction and paid them back.

140
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,110
Now, the stock prices are flipping out.

141
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,550
Look.

142
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,210
They say Sanin will collapse because of Wind.

143
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,480
Wind was a division we were already carrying.

144
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,950
Then...

145
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,820
why haven't we listed it yet?

146
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,260
An IPO depends on market conditions,

147
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,650
but the current atmosphere wasn't great.

148
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,020
Hey,

149
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,530
was the market ever good?

150
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,010
Tell me.

151
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,870
You're right.

152
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,520
Yes?

153
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,720
CEO Oh Chi Yeong is here.

154
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
Come in.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,490
Yes, Chairman.

156
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,080
I got back from my overseas business trip yesterday

157
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,100
so I received your call late. I'm sorry.

158
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,760
- On a business trip? 
 - Yes.

159
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,900
You know our resort in Saipan?

160
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,040
We're developing a tour package there right now.

161
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,270
These days, a lot of people travel abroad.

162
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,340
- Take a seat. 
 - Yes, yes.

163
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,220
Was it fun?

164
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,380
- Pardon? 
 - Did you have fun

165
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,050
traveling overseas after

166
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,730
letting Wind sink like this?

167
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,310
Well...

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,450
- Wind is my— 
 - Chairman.

169
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,270
Listing is my responsibility.

170
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,900
It would've...

171
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,700
- It would've been fine if you did well. 
 - Well,

172
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,830
after COVID, the leisure market was terrible.

173
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,800
You! Are you making that excuse again?

174
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,340
- You! What did I tell you? Well? 
 - Pardon?

175
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,070
Why don't you go to the Han River right now?

176
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,740
There are bicycles everywhere!

177
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,510
Chairman...

178
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,670
You're the CEO,

179
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,690
but you're blaming others?

180
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,450
Do CEOs...

181
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,410
blame others?

182
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,920
Well?

183
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,550
Is CEO Oh in charge of Wind?

185
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,720
Yes. I think he came to HQ.

186
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,920
To see the chairman?

187
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,780
Yes, I believe so.

188
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,860
I thought he might call for you as well, Mr. Ha.

189
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,870
Okay, okay.

190
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,200
- Hurry and get ready. 
 - Okay.

191
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,680
The chairman just lost his temper.

192
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,080
Don't take it too personally.

193
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,880
How is Wind my responsibility?

194
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,200
Honestly, I never said I'd take it on.

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,700
Mr. Ha acquired it, and someone else manages it.

196
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,100
CEO Oh, let's talk about it downstairs.

197
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,190
CEO Oh, working hard?

198
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,200
You're here.

199
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,530
- Would you like a cup of coffee? 
 - Coffee...

200
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,170
- I'm okay. 
 - Please take a seat.

201
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,560
I tried to get Wind listed

202
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,230
but received a negative report.

203
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,820
That's why we put it on hold.

204
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,760
Why? Wind was doing so well.

205
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,410
After Wind was acquired in 2015,

206
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,000
it went through some ups and downs.

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,530
But from 2021 to last year,

208
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,500
its sales grew by 30% every year.

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,700
My goodness.

210
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,500
Bicycles are not like IT.

211
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,760
How could it grow by 30%?

212
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,450
Many of my friends belong to cycling clubs.

213
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,970
Exactly. It was impressive.

214
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,210
Looking back now, it benefited from COVID.

215
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,610
At the time, there was much optimism about leisure.

216
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,990
It was my mistake, really.

217
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,210
Since cycling was an individual sport

218
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,330
without face-to-face contact,

219
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,660
I didn't realize it benefited from COVID

220
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,400
and thought it would grow further.

221
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,170
So I waited.

222
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,410
But that's not your fault, Mr. Lee.

223
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,750
I should've reported it to the chairman sooner,

224
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,670
but I hesitated to tell him.

225
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,250
I think Mr. Lee made a mistake, Chairman.

226
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,920
He should've listed it when it was trending up.

227
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,800
I feel it's a bit too late now.

228
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,580
Enough about Mr. Lee.

229
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,190
You tell me what you think.

230
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,410
In my opinion,

231
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,710
stopping the put option is most important.

232
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,450
And?

233
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,250
How about we persuade PPF?

234
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,540
Do you want to do it?

235
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,120
Yes, I'll try meeting with them.

236
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,380
Then make them sign,

237
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
saying they won't exercise the put option.

238
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,250
- Pardon? 
 - If they just say they won't

239
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,770
but decide to do so later,

240
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,670
I'd be the only one getting kicked out.

241
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,700
There's no way.

242
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,150
Then you are also saying Wind is hopeless.

243
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,010
Yes, Chairman.

244
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,440
Why is he so afraid?

245
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,950
Pardon?

246
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,210
Can't Mr. Ha just go to PPF and persuade them?

247
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,440
They're close.

248
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,460
If PPF was going to help us, they would've already.

249
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,840
"We are joint partners with Sanin."

250
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,270
That's all they had to say,

251
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,600
and the stock price wouldn't have plummeted.

252
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,840
But they're pretending not to know anything.

253
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,920
Now that Mr. Ha has lost Construction

254
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,790
and has no influence over PPF,

255
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,840
he has nothing, right?

256
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,230
CEO Oh was crying.

257
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,510
Pardon?

258
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,190
For failing to list Wind,

259
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,030
he got yelled at by the chairman and was crying.

260
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,640
Then how about you go and talk to PPF?

261
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,830
I offered to do so,

262
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,000
but the chairman says to let it be.

263
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,700
He said just break it this time and move on

264
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,050
whether the listing happens or not.

265
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,340
W-Wind?

266
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,550
Whether it's Wind or whatever else.

267
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,500
He was furious.

268
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,180
I guess you met with the chairman.

269
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,570
Yes, just now.

270
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,830
Wind should've been listed a long time ago.

271
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,200
What's the point now?

272
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,780
I know, right? Now that COVID is over,

273
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,420
people with money are busy traveling abroad,

274
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,480
and those without are busy making ends meet.

275
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,910
Who's going to ride a bike these days?

276
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,560
CEO Oh must've wanted to cry.

277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,040
He didn't just want to cry.

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,900
He actually was a waterworks.

279
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,410
- Geez. 
 - But that guy, Mr. Ha!

280
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,400
Isn't he culpable as well?

281
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,410
He should've bought something that could get listed.

282
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,950
He left me with something that wasn't going to work.

283
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,600
He spoke as if he had nothing to do with it.

284
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,060
He's so annoying!

285
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,380
I'll see what I can do

286
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,850
so calm down for now.

287
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,440
Honestly, Mr. Lee, this is...

288
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,810
my second year now.

289
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,260
Because of my contract renewal,

290
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,200
I worked so hard on the Saipan project.

291
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,140
And out of nowhere...

292
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,490
Wind? Goodness.

293
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,150
The market sentiment is key to an IPO, right?

294
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,510
Listing Wind wouldn't be an issue if things looked up,

295
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,570
but it was so bad lately that

296
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,210
it needs to show that it'd get better.

297
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,760
But Wind's sales actually declined.

298
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
That's why you had to give a negative report.

299
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,860
Yes. If I reported that it'd succeed when it likely won't,

300
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,240
we'd be doomed.

301
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,820
You did the right thing.

302
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,960
What are the terms of our option with PPF?

303
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,170
Looking at our put option with PPF,

304
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,160
Sanin's stock price has to stay below 100,000 won

305
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,600
for 20 consecutive trading days.

306
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,510
So that's how it works.

307
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,900
Twenty trading days are four weeks.

308
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,250
Then we should just raise the stock price in four weeks.

309
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,620
How?

310
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,430
By getting Wind listed?

311
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,240
 If it were that easy, we would've done it already. 

312
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,430
It's ended up like this because he kept pushing off telling the chairman.

313
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,290
Yes.

314
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,560
Gosh...

315
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,620
It's really tough to say something isn't going to work.

316
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,040
Who could say that?

317
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,240
If you speak up like that, you'd only get criticized.

318
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,010
This is like hot potatoes.

319
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,180
That's a good way to put it. Hot potatoes.

320
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,180
Come, let's go.

321
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,500
Chairman.

322
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,030
The chairman is leaving.

323
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,160
Should I get the car ready?

324
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,690
- Hey, let's go over there. 
 - Pardon?

325
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,710
What floor is the team leader on?

326
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,400
Oh, he's on the 13th floor.

327
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,580
Let's go.

328
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,670
But there are many bicycles around Han River.

329
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,560
Yes, there are quite a lot.

330
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,330
So how come Wind didn't sell?

331
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,410
There are more shared bikes now.

332
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,390
I see. Aren't those nearly all free?

333
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,900
All the bicycle companies will go down. I mean...

334
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,710
how can you beat a government-run business?

335
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,100
I don't intend to beat them.

336
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,390
No, no, it's all right.

337
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,490
You heard the news, right?

338
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,080
If you're referring to Wind, I read the article.

339
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,330
Okay.

340
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,790
What are your thoughts?

341
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,320
I thought it'd be difficult from the start.

342
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,440
You all think it won't work, right?

343
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,350
But did everything fail when COVID hit?

344
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,040
Some places did well despite the fact.

345
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,100
Am I wrong?

346
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,230
You're right. But even if COVID didn't hit,

347
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,640
the bicycle market wouldn't have done well.

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,310
What do you mean by that?

349
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,120
With the rise of shared bikes, more people started riding bikes

350
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,290
but most bike companies have poor performance.

351
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,620
You're right.

352
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,850
The government is giving free access to bikes.

353
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,380
So who'd buy one?

354
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,270
They did that with tax money.

355
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,940
How could we beat that? Isn't that right?

356
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,120
Yes, so there needs to be an incentive

357
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,100
to make bike riders want to ride better bikes.

358
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,410
With such an incentive,

359
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,500
I think the high-end market could actually improve.

360
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,940
Then...

361
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,120
do you think you can do it?

362
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,900
Well?

363
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,030
Yes.

364
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,990
The CEO used to be an archery athlete.

365
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,600
He started with archery before transitioning into cycling with his expertise in carbon materials.

366
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
So he's only dealt with making carbon bikes,

367
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,390
leading him to focus on the high-end market.

368
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,030
You don't have any questions?

369
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,330
Why did you say you can do it?

370
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,970
All we had to do was stay quiet. Tell me.

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Why did you do it?

372
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,700
Because I felt like it would work.

373
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm used to it by now.

374
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,390
   

375
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,230
Hello. Welcome.

376
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,410
I'm Park Rae Gyeong.

377
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,650
Hi. Nice to meet you.

378
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,790
We've displayed the archery equipment we've made in order.

379
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:41,280
The photos are a collection of important and meaningful moments.

380
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,200
During the Olympics, forget everything else, I always watch archery.

381
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,420
Hitting the bullseye is impressive already,

382
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,290
but it's amazing to hit a 10-point shot.

383
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,170
How do they do it?

384
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,600
Are they born with it?

385
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,190
You can do it with enough practice.

386
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,480
Still, don't you need natural talent?

387
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,710
You do need a natural talent.

388
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:08,080
But keeping on doing something is important than doing it well.

389
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,730
You were an athlete, too, right?

390
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,990
I wasn't that great as an athlete.

391
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,770
I didn't win any medals.

392
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,420
But these bows won gold medals for me.

393
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Then you've won too many medals, right?

394
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,010
This was when we acquired Daichi.

395
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,780
Daichi used to be the number one company, right?

396
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,400
Back in the 1990s, it was.

397
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,020
But we acquired them after we surpassed them.

398
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,150
Who's the person next to you?

399
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,100
He's the one who drew this blueprint.

400
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,550
He was Daichi's best technician.

401
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,200
Then did this artisan give you this blueprint?

402
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
Yes, as a gift.

403
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,150
And I gave him this slogan as a gift.

404
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,290
Did you do this brush calligraphy yourself?

405
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,270
When I used to do archery,

406
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,220
I thought it'd help with focusing, so I dabbled in it.

407
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,330
What does it say?

408
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,040
"On Go Ji Sin."

409
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,670
"Learn the old, understand the new."

410
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
He's a cutie.

411
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,910
   

412
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,160
He's the artisan's son he had in later years.

413
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,860
He was so cute.

414
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,160
From here on, it's all bikes.

415
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,650
How much is a bike like this one?

416
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,880
It's about 30 million won.

417
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,380
The bike is more expensive than a car.

418
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,520
Indeed.

419
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,910
I thought it'd be about one million won at most.

420
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,190
That's because this is for professional athletes.

421
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,770
Oh, I see.

422
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,720
The fact that athletes ride Wind bikes is a testament to the quality, right?

423
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,140
Of course.

424
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,600
Athletes bet their lives on 0.1 or 0.01 seconds

425
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,610
so they won't ride it unless it's the best.

426
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,210
But selling only to athletes would limit your sales.

427
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,810
Well, that's the issue.

428
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,330
It's something Wind has to solve.

429
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,170
Let's solve... that issue together.

430
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,620
   

431
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Wind has released 12 models ranging from five million to 30 million won.

432
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,900
You'd think the five million won model would sell the most,

433
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,360
but surprisingly, it sold the least.

434
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,140
Sports are all about competition, right?

435
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,750
The same goes for equipment.

436
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,040
Nobody likes being last.

437
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,840
That's why the model that's one tier above the cheapest model, Wind-A, sold the most.

438
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,490
Yes.

439
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,720
That's the nature of sports.

440
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,800
Nobody likes being last.

441
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,460
What if Wind-A isn't last then?

442
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,180
Pardon?

443
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,270
Bicycles are ranked based on the material.

444
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,480
That's right.

445
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,610
It's steel, aluminum, then carbon.

446
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,970
To go from a competitor's aluminum model to Wind's carbon, it's an additional one million won.

447
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:18,140
That extra million creates a barrier that prevents people from upgrading from aluminum to carbon.

448
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,620
Carbon is on a completely different level.

449
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,420
It's not even worth comparing it to aluminum.

450
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,590
Right.

451
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,060
What if we could sell Wind-A, on another level, for around four million won?

452
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,680
In this competition with aluminum bikes

453
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,870
wouldn't we be sure to win?

454
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,810
We'd win for sure.

455
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,780
Absolutely. For the same price, nobody would pick aluminum.

456
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,650
They'd choose carbon.

457
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,010
Yes. Then, naturally, we can bring in

458
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,860
aluminum consumers to Wind.

459
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,830
Well...

460
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,110
I agree,

461
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,890
but matching the price point isn't easy.

462
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,180
Even the five million won price was a real stretch,

463
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,580
so four million won is really tough.

464
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,730
What if the market grows?

465
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,920
Wouldn't we be able to mass produce then?

466
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,490
We would.

467
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,240
But in the bicycle industry, it's not just about the frame.

468
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,970
The gears are really important.

469
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,040
Shimizu in Japan is the best for that.

470
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,520
They hold the patents, too.

471
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,230
They need to provide us with the gears.

472
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,330
If they don't, we can't mass produce, even if we want to.

473
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,280
It's like semiconductors.

474
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,790
That's right.

475
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,080
Shimizu is essentially the top player.

476
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,980
It'll be hard to get more supply from them.

477
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,430
We'll meet with Shimizu and negotiate that.

478
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,330
If so, we need it resolved by next week

479
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,100
because we have an OEM contract lined up.

480
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,300
In that case, we'll need to go immediately.

481
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,880
Mr. Yun, this is my first overseas deal.

482
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,500
Is there anything I should watch out for?

483
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,240
It's important to respect the rules of that country, since we're the visitors.

484
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,160
Wouldn't that be too disadvantageous for us?

485
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,240
That's not always true.

486
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,700
Both sides have to follow the rules,

487
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,650
so we won't be at a disadvantage

488
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,590
as long as we know what those rules are.

489
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,900
   

490
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes?

491
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,560
Hey.

492
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,210
Come in.

493
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,560
- Take a seat. 
 - Okay.

494
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,960
Did you come from Wind?

495
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,460
Yes.

496
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,780
I feel like I've just passed the burden onto you.

497
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,960
Don't feel that way.

498
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,200
I heard you've already tried it once, Mr. Lee.

499
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,200
Yumin IB said you tried to get it listed,

500
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,740
but you stopped after receiving a negative report.

501
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,370
Yes.

502
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,950
Since Wind focused on the high-end market,

503
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,800
scalability was an issue.

504
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,760
That's why I thought nothing could be done.

505
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,780
But after hearing what you said to the chairman...

506
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,760
I was ashamed.

507
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,160
No, don't be.

508
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,820
Also, that article was written by a reporter who's connected to me.

509
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,860
Reporter Han Ji Eun?

510
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,790
Yes.

511
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:11,550
When I was acquiring Cha Cha Games, she wrote an article about Sanin and DC in an M&amp;A.

512
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,210
She asked me about it.

513
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,770
I see.

514
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,400
That's why I need to resolve this issue.

515
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,470
It's also something Project M needs to handle.

516
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,150
As you've said, the market sentiment for bike companies isn't good.

517
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,380
Speed is the largest company in Korea, right?

518
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,090
Among the bike companies, yes.

519
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,500
They probably had a large supply of gears.

520
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,600
Yes, but they've put it on hold after paying a penalty.

521
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,270
The timing is a bit of a shame.

522
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,020
Speed was disappointed as well.

523
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,320
If they knew sooner, they wouldn't have paid the penalty

524
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,020
and sold the excess gears to Wind.

525
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,640
Yes.

526
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,530
Aigoo, you should get going now.

527
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,780
- See you later, then. 
 - All right.

528
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,830
What is that?

529
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,270
I found it while looking up Japanese business words.

530
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,820
Have you heard of "honne" and "tateme"?

531
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,910
Of course, I have.

532
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,770
You're referring to using cushion words, right?

533
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,250
Yes.

534
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,030
Attorney, you're so smart.

535
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,730
Now, you finally recognize it.

536
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,120
But it was "honne"?

537
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,330
You can lower the unit price if you increase the quantity.

538
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,630
Supposedly, Japanese people hate changing plans.

539
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,000
Even if we're buying tenfold? Why wouldn't they like it?

540
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,300
That's understandable since they go by the book.

541
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,790
Dear passengers, please put up your seats.

542
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,200
Please put up your seats.

543
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,150
Please put it up a bit.

544
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,940
Please put up your seat.

545
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,650
Please put it up a bit.

546
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,580
Please put up your seat.

547
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,450
 ­  

548
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,920
Hello.

549
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,660
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

550
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,110
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

551
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,150
Thank you for making the long journey.

552
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,960
I hope it was pleasant.

553
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,790
I'm Ryuu Ozaki.

554
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,390
I'm Ju No Yun from Sanin.

555
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,480
I appreciate you taking the time to come out and see me today.

556
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,060
Not at all. The honor is all mine.

557
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,980
You're Team Leader Yun Ju No, right?

558
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm Hirose Haruka.

559
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,310
Please call me Hirose.

560
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,070
Hello, my name is Yun Ju No.

561
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,620
You're good at Korean.

562
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,070
Oh, no.

563
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,500
I'm currently learning Korean.

564
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
We'll take you to our headquarters first.

565
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,910
What's wrong?

566
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,810
The limousine might not be here.

567
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,940
Why the hell not? Did you contact them?

568
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,870
So? What is it?

569
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,190
You contacted them, but they're not picking up?

570
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

571
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,190
Did you check properly?

572
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,090
Then...

573
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,900
I'll take the guests. You take a taxi.

574
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,540
Okay.

575
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,890
You can go first.

576
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,550
I'll follow after you.

577
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,100
It's all right.

579
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,700
Mr. Yun, I'll take the next car as well.

580
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,830
Okay. Thank you.

581
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,000
No.

582
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,150
No, let's ride together.

583
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,080
I'm really sorry.

584
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,330
It's okay. I'm the maknae*, so I don't mind going alone. 
  (*The youngest) 

585
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,730
Oh, maknae. Me, too.

586
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,550
At what price would you agree to it?

587
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,470
We should get at least this much discount.

588
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,120
That's reasonable enough.

589
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,410
Look on your left. That's Mt. Fuji.

590
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,040
It's really impressive.

591
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,200
Yes.

592
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,180
It's quite rare to have such a clear day, you know.

593
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,170
It only happens 30% of the time.

594
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:17,670
Do you know that many Japanese people never even get to see Mt. Fuji in their lifetime?

595
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,820
Seems like we caught a lucky day.

596
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,050
Of course.

597
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,040
Would you like to see it up close?

598
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,480
I mean, if we get the chance?

599
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,830
Yes, if we get the chance.

600
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,020
How long will you be staying?

601
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,980
Until the deal is done.

602
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,200
I see.

603
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,790
I'm sorry for making you ride a taxi.

604
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,630
No. You can stop apologizing now.

605
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,170
Okay.

606
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,460
I brought something from Korea.

607
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,590
By chance,

608
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,160
would you like to have this?

609
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,340
I heard Japanese people buy it when they visit Korea.

610
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,890
No, it's all right.

611
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,850
If you don't like this one,

612
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,690
how about this?

613
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,110
Okay. Thank you.

614
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,350
You're quite thoughtful.

615
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,610
Thoughtful... Oh, yes.

616
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm sorry.

617
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,190
Hello?

618
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,630
Yes.

619
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,570
What? You weren't hurt, right?

620
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,720
That's a relief.

621
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,660
We are riding a taxi there.

622
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,060
Yes.

623
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,270
Oh, just a moment.

624
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,220
Could you tell me when you're going back?

625
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,430
Pardon?

626
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,270
I'm trying to reserve a limousine,

627
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,930
and we have to do it in advance.

628
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,480
I'll make sure you don't ride a taxi when you leave.

629
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,360
- I'm sorry. 
 - No, that's all right.

630
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,400
We go back on the 14th at 7 p.m..

631
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,500
It's a Saturday.

632
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,480
Then would 4 p.m. at the hotel work for you?

633
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,720
Yes.

634
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,690
We'd like to reserve for the 14th at 4 p.m.

635
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,990
Yes. Thank you.

636
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,390
The limousine got into an accident on its way to us.

637
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,970
That's why they couldn't make it.

638
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,790
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,650
Don't be sorry.

640
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,910
But you came despite a busy schedule.

641
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,660
Oh, I'd like to tour Japan since I'm here,

642
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,260
but we've got another meeting scheduled after this.

643
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,200
It's cute.

644
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm Naito Senichi.

645
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,890
I'm Yoshida Osamu.

646
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm the Overseas Sale Team Leader.

647
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Glad to meet you.

648
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm Ju No Yun from Sanin's M&amp;A Team.

649
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,130
The pleasure is all mine.

650
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,340
I'm Kwak Min Jeong from Sanin.

651
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,760
- I'm Yoshida. 
 - Oh, you're Yoshida.

652
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,160
I'm Naito Senichi.

653
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,230
It's nice to meet you.

654
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,290
Thank you.

655
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,470
Our request is to increase the quantity tenfold to 10,000.

656
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,870
We want to know if the quantity can be changed to 10,000.

657
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:27,240
Since the original order quantity is a thousand,

658
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,770
you're saying you want to order an additional 9,000.

659
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,210
Yes.

660
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,250
We'll look over it, but...

661
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,030
We are producing a fixed quantity

662
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,540
according to a strict guideline.

663
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,580
Please understand that Shimizu produces a fixed quantity

664
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,190
based on a strict manual for quality assurance.

665
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,110
Are you saying you can't handle the supply?

666
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,240
Are you saying that you can't supply 10,000?

667
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,160
We can.

668
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,800
However, we can't give you a discount.

669
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,200
We can.

670
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,910
However, we can't give you a discount.

671
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,260
I believe Shimizu has a discount manual

672
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,350
based on order quantity.

673
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,840
Doesn't Shimizu have a manual for discount rates

674
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,070
based on order quantity?

675
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,020
They are asking about our internal discount rates.

676
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,970
That's only for general cases.

677
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,670
Wind is a special case.

678
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,070
What is the manual for special cases?

679
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,420
We'll look into it.

680
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,800
Please give us some time.

681
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,000
We'll need some time to check internally.

682
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,160
How about we wrap up for today and rest a little?

683
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,540
If there is no manual pertaining to special cases,

684
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,710
should we proceed with the existing discount rate?

685
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,940
We will consider it favorably.

686
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,910
Thank you in advance.

687
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,910
I look forward to working with you.

688
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,470
Could you wait just a moment?

689
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,280
I will bring you to your hotel.

690
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,340
When they say they'll consider it favorably,

691
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,200
does that mean they'll do it or not?

692
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
- They rejected the offer. 
 - What?

693
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,310
Saying they'll consider it favorably is "tatemae."

694
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,860
Then rejecting the offer is "honne"?

695
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,650
So tough.

696
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,310
How could you tell them we can supply more?

697
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,310
Wouldn't you accept the offer without any discount?

698
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,640
Don't you know we're struggling with falling sales?

699
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,480
But, Team Leader,

700
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,520
is there a manual for a situation like this?

701
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,860
Probably...

702
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,550
- not. 
 - That's what I thought.

703
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,960
Hirose, take care of the guests.

704
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,330
Okay.

705
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,650
Please.

706
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,390
Oh, Hirose.

707
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,350
Yes?

708
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,570
This all depends on you, you know?

709
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,010
Sure.

710
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,210
It seems the Sales Team Leader

711
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,670
and Factory Manager are at odds.

712
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,890
Yes.

713
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,720
Still, the Sales Team Leader said

714
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,940
they can provide the supply.

715
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,400
But...

716
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,060
what if they lie about a special case manual?

717
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,380
We can't accept that on our end.

718
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,650
They won't be able to deceive us that easily.

719
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,150
They don't know how much we know.

720
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,210
I'm sorry for making you wait.

721
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,880
Let's go.

722
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,050
Okay.

723
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,520
I'll be waiting for you here.

724
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,340
"You'll be waiting for us here"?

725
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,230
Yes. I heard you wanted to see Mt. Fuji.

726
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,490
Oh, that's all right.

727
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:38,130
Oh. I see.

728
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,930
How long would it take?

729
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,380
It'd only take an hour.

730
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,260
- Let's go then. 
 - Okay.

731
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,110
Thank you.

732
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,860
If we manage to get Speed's supply,

733
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,570
would it be difficult to take over the terms also?

734
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,190
Based on their contract.

735
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,230
It would depend on the contract.

736
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,270
But there's a good chance Shimizu

737
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,540
included a resale clause.

738
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,510
But, Attorney, isn't this a monopoly?

739
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,840
Probably not. For this to be a monopoly—

740
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,130
I'm sorry, but...

741
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,800
please maintain a respectful silence.

742
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,010
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,710
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,900
- Taking the picture now. 
 - Wait, wait.

745
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,470
One moment. All right, a heart pose.

746
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,140
Heart.

747
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,010
Please do a heart pose.

748
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,860
One, two, three!

749
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,470
Please check it.

750
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,730
- Is it okay? 
 - Yes.

751
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,570
This is a beautiful place.

752
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,580
I'm glad you liked it.

753
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,050
Thank you.

754
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,380
No, thank you.

755
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,900
Then shall we return to the hotel?

756
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,440
Okay.

757
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,470
This is Shuzenji, famous for its hot springs.

758
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,930
Oh, Shuzenji?

759
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,380
Have you been here before?

760
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,020
No, I just saw it on a blog.

761
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,520
I see. In that case,

762
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,030
could you give me ten minutes of your time?

763
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,700
There's a place you can soak your feet.

764
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,240
Ten minutes?

765
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,690
Yes.

766
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,180
Okay.

767
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,040
Please take us to Shuzenji.

768
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,460
If there is another bike company that didn't cancel its contract,

769
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,090
maybe we can offer to acquire it

770
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,690
without paying a penalty—

771
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,290
It's good to have

772
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,510
your feet warm, but your head cool.

773
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,990
It's wasabi ice cream.

774
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,900
- Wasabi ice cream? 
 - Yes.

775
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,820
Yes. Enjoy.

776
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,310
Thank you.

777
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,930
Sure.

778
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,200
How is it?

779
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,120
- Is it okay? 
 - It's tasty!

780
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,050
It's tasty?

781
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,990
It's good.

782
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,370
Shall we go?

783
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,760
It's time for you to have dinner.

784
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,840
Are you okay with having a kaiseki* meal? 
  (*Traditional multi-course Japanese meal) 

785
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,730
Gosh, there's no reason for it not to be.

786
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,810
I fear we're being too much of a burden.

787
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,310
Actually, I already reserved it.

788
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,630
We can't have it without a reservation.

789
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,960
Oh, then, we have no reason to refuse.

790
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,930
We'd be causing her trouble if we refused, right?

791
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,510
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

792
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,780
You will be having an eight-course meal.

793
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,910
A brief introduction will be given

794
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,680
before each course.

795
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,090
If you try the dish after hearing the introduction,

796
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,680
you can enjoy it even more.

797
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,580
Please enjoy and if you need anything,

798
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,730
let me know any time.

799
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,320
You've brought us to such a luxurious place.

800
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,770
Thank you.

801
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,820
Enjoy your meal.

802
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,780
I feel so bad that we're eating by ourselves.

803
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,870
No, it's okay.

804
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,050
Enjoy your meal while conversing freely.

805
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,700
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

806
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,710
They are important guests.

807
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,770
Please take good care of them.

808
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,210
Yes, certainly.

809
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,530
I'm sorry, but...

810
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,150
Is it good?

811
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,600
Yes.

812
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,680
If it's okay, could we talk while we eat?

813
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,420
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

814
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,630
What's the maximum unit price we can offer?

815
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,580
It's 35 dollars, which is the 30% discounted price.

816
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,330
Then...

817
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,980
This is the second course.

818
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,250
Where is the restroom?

819
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,580
Straight down the hall outside of this room.

820
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,650
Thank you.

821
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,290
Yes, hello.

822
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:06,340
Yes, this is Attorney Oh Sun Yeong of Sanin's M&amp;A Team.

823
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,020
Yes, hello.

824
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,240
I wanted to ask...

825
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,130
you know how you deferred your order from Shimizu?

826
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,550
Yes, yes, those.

827
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,890
We were wondering if we could take them instead.

828
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,430
Yes, yes.

829
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,000
Yes, of course. That'd be good for both of us.

830
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,130
Could you tell us the unit price discounts for them?

831
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,120
Yes.

832
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,310
Oh, okay. Thank you.

833
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,940
By chance, could you text it to me?

834
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,650
Yes, everything is okay.

835
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,230
 Oh, really? 

836
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:47,620
Yes, they're eating a kaiseki meal right now.

837
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,560
 Treat them well to the end. 

838
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,100
Okay.

839
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,910
By the way, are you still in a meeting?

840
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,040
Why do you ask?

841
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,560
 Could I join after I'm done with the Korean guests? 

842
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,190
Well, let's see.

843
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,220
Call me after you're done.

844
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,520
If only the Speed didn't cancel the contract,

845
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,210
I'd be headed to Tokyo by now.

846
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,680
Team Leader, do you want to go to Tokyo that badly?

847
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,400
Shizuoka is your hometown.

848
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,910
It's not that I don't like Shizuoka, though.

849
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,190
Of course, I respect those who live

850
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:31,440
with a craftsman's mindset like you,

851
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,390
but opportunities for white collars like me are decreasing here.

852
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,090
Just look at our Shimizu.

853
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,000
They moved the main shop to Tokyo.

854
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,840
It's not that I want to leave here.

855
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,590
But I just feel like there's no place for me in Shizuoka.

856
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,470
The Korean guests are still touring.

857
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,280
I guess they don't take their work seriously.

858
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,290
That's great.

859
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:12,010
But how did you find out about their deadline?

860
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,580
I tried to do whatever I could for Shimizu.

861
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,770
You never disappoint us.

862
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,900
I guess you want to go to the Tokyo HQ, too, right?

863
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,730
I'm going to use the restroom.

864
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,770
I believe I should go to Tokyo as well.

865
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,430
Please let me join you.

866
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,650
I'll do my best.

867
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,230
I'm short on my performance, too.

868
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,960
Won't it be possible if we get Wind to sign the contract?

869
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,740
That's true,

870
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,590
but I wonder if they'll accept the terms.

871
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,660
But it's not like they can go back empty-handed.

872
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,370
I suppose.

873
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,610
I'll do my best.

874
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,930
We got to do a lot of sightseeing, thanks to you.

875
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,420
Thank you.

876
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,100
Great work today.

877
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,520
Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow.

878
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,460
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

879
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,710
Great work today.

880
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,790
There's nothing special about the Tokyo branch.

881
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,720
No, there's nothing special about Shizuoka.

882
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,750
What do you mean?

883
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,950
There's Mt. Fuji.

884
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,040
It only has Mt. Fuji.

885
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,160
Mt. Fuji- What does Tokyo have?

886
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,810
It's not only that...

887
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,130
What does Tokyo have?

888
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,640
Tokyo has Tokyo Tower.

889
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,740
Tokyo has Tokyo Tower?

890
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,100
Tokyo Tower.

891
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,030
- Tokyo Tower! 
 - Sky Tree.

892
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,920
Never seen Sky Tree.

893
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,210
It's amazing.

894
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,560
Yes, yes, yes.

895
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,580
 I'm done with everything. 

896
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,040
 Should I join you at the meeting? 

897
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,870
Well,

898
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,250
you worked hard today, so go home.

899
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,540
 I'm fine. 

900
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,940
Don't be too hard on yourself.

901
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,010
Yes, you should go home.

902
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,360
 Okay. 

903
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,290
 I'll see you tomorrow. 

904
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,160
Okay.

905
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,870
I thought we'd only do business and leave,

906
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,970
but we did everything here.

907
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,030
They prepared a city tour for tomorrow.

908
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,350
This time, I wanted to be helpful,

909
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,990
so I researched Japanese culture and all.

910
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,710
But we won't return after just touring, right?

911
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,030
Should we do some work?

912
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,090
Let's go to our room.

913
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,390
Attorney, please look over Speed's contract.

914
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,830
Well, I looked into it.

915
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,550
They set discount rates based on order quantity.

916
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,680
When did you look into this?

917
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,040
While we were having the kaiseki meal.

918
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,930
Since our order quantity is 9,000,

919
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,810
you can see here that it'd be a 40% discount.

920
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:14,300
Then isn't it messed up that they want us to buy without a discount?

921
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,300
It's messed up.

922
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,700
But we're the ones in a rush.

923
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,900
- That's still hot! 
 - It's hot.

924
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,600
How grateful I am.

925
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,710
If we get the discount rate,

926
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,200
Wind can produce a four-million-won model, right?

927
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,210
Yes, since it required 30%, there's 10% room left over.

928
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,130
But you know...

929
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,540
can't we just cancel the 1,000 we ordered

930
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,960
and reorder 10,000 to get the 50% discount?

931
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,720
No, no.

932
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,360
You'd risk breaking the relationship.

933
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,930
They don't even want to give additional contracts.

934
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,850
Also, the quantity must be over 10,000, so we'd need to order 10,001.

935
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:53,180
Then they'd get offended and call off the contract.

936
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,050
Shimizu knows we need the gears.

937
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,880
And we're the ones pushing for the contract.

938
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,610
Shimizu has no reason for urgency.

939
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,840
They wouldn't drag this out and say they won't sign the contract, right?

940
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,580
If they weren't interested in signing a contract,

941
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,540
they would've refused our visit.

942
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,840
Yes. Shimizu probably brought us to the table

943
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,740
because they had something they wanted.

944
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,900
If we spend our time like this and the deadline hits,

945
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,420
we'll have no choice but to sign their contract on the last day.

946
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,510
Then maybe Shimizu is stalling for time?

947
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,320
I don't think that's the case.

948
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,220
Shimizu probably has their own circumstances so they can't keep wasting time.

949
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,430
So it's crucial to hide deadlines from each other.

950
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,580
Deadline?

951
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,610
The fact that we have to return on Saturday.

952
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,360
We haven't leaked any info, right?

953
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,690
No, we haven't.

954
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,460
I'm sorry! I...

955
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,160
I'm sorry.

956
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,240
Why would you be sorry, Jin Su?

957
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,600
She asked me when we were leaving to book the limo.

958
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,690
So?

959
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,610
Did you tell her?

960
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,680
Really, Jin Su?

961
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,500
I'm sorry.

962
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,790
- Jin Su, you can pull this off, right? 
 - Yes.

963
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,580
Of course, you can. As fellow maknaes,

964
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,120
talk to her and bond over common hardships. Okay?

965
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,950
Okay.

966
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,620
It seems Hirose's superiors yell at her often, too.

967
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,790
Really?

968
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,820
I've never yelled at you, Jin Su.

969
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,900
I guess Ms. Min Jeong must've yelled at you then.

970
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,940
Jin Su,

971
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,600
did we come to Japan for sightseeing?

972
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,950
Get your act together.

973
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,870
See, see?

974
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,370
Jin Su, it's your fault.

975
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,730
I'm sorry.

976
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,300
I won't make a mistake next time—

977
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,300
What next time? Huh?

978
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:15,500
We're in big trouble if we don't sign by Saturday.

979
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,170
I'll do whatever I can to fix this.

980
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:20,460
So what can you do about this, Jin Su?

981
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,470
If you're a maknae, please act like one.

982
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,400
Are you really... acting... right now?

983
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,800
Keep going, keep going. Focus.

984
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,490
Aren't you going to answer me?

985
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,140
I'm sorry.

986
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,690
...do that today.

987
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,990
I need to talk to my—

988
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,430
Excuse me.

989
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:17,160
They requested to meet today.

990
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,660
They've caught on, right?

991
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,330
Yes.

992
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,420
Their maknae was being reprimanded.

993
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,830
I see.

994
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,600
Team Leader, Wind requested a meeting.

995
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,760
And they want to meet today.

996
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,150
So typical of Koreans.

997
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,260
As expected of them,

998
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,160
their spirit of challenge is extraordinary.

999
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,560
Yes, that's right.

1000
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,480
From the fact that they disclosed their deadline,

1001
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,910
it seems they've caught on,

1002
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,610
and they seemed to be quite desperate.

1003
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,090
Yes.

1004
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,040
May I?

1005
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,540
Yes. Understood.

1006
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,700
Thank you.

1007
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,090
Ask to meet this afternoon.

1008
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,870
Okay.

1009
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,950
- Hirose. 
 - Yes?

1010
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,290
Don't make any mistakes.

1011
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,310
Okay.

1012
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,360
We had to request this meeting on short notice

1013
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,550
due to some scheduling conflicts on our side.

1014
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,680
We appreciate you taking the time to meet with us.

1015
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,280
I understand.

1016
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,760
We thought you had a more flexible schedule.

1017
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,340
We wanted to show you around Shizuoka

1018
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,170
while you are here.

1019
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,310
But it seems

1020
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:49,410
we might have kept you longer than expected.

1021
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,860
Not at all.

1022
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,230
Mt. Fuji was incredible.

1023
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,770
It made me want to visit Japan again.

1024
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,330
Now,

1025
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,630
regarding the contract,

1026
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:06,350
what are your thoughts on our proposal?

1027
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,320
We reviewed it,

1028
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,530
but I don't think we can accept it.

1029
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,710
Is that what Shimizu's manual says?

1030
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,840
Did you check the company rules?

1031
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,220
We're in the process of checking.

1032
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,440
If there is no manual for special cases,

1033
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,570
will we also receive the existing discount rate?

1034
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,900
They want to know if they can receive the existing discount rate.

1035
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,610
Please tell them that we'll consider it.

1036
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,320
We will consider it favorably.

1037
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,370
Excuse us.

1038
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,770
May we have a moment to discuss this internally?

1039
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,480
Okay.

1040
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,010
Go ahead.

1041
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,690
They'll consider it favorably again!

1042
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,460
If the discount rate is zero,

1043
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,630
the unit price would be much higher.

1044
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,860
It'd be better not to sign the contract.

1045
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,950
But we don't have time to negotiate the unit price.

1046
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:30,010
They already found out our deadline,

1047
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,860
so it won't be easy.

1048
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,110
Still, our deadline

1049
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:38,070
is their deadline as well.

1050
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,650
   

1051
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:53,380
♫  Of greed, loss, and betrayal  ♫

1052
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,240
♫  Hang onto your sweet emotions  ♫

1053
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,910
♫  'Cause money takes the heart  ♫

1054
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:03,400
♫  Money takes the heart  ♫

1055
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,120
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

1056
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,250
♫  Takes the heart away  ♫

1057
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:12,820
♫  Feed your greed, all that glitters is cold  ♫

1058
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,120
♫  You know you're gonna lose it someday  ♫

1059
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,900
 Shimizu doesn't want to negotiate with us, right? 

1060
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,430
 I thought you were a spy. 

1061
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,150
 Performance is important 

1062
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,690
 for Mr. Yoshida right now, right? 

1063
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,250
 If I increase the down payment, 

1064
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,570
 the total should be reduced. 

1065
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,410
 Who's in charge of the listing? 

1066
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,440
 Are you saying it's my fault? 

1067
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,920
 Did the contract go well? 

1068
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,420
 The deadline is imminent. 

1069
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,430
 I can't trust HQ. 

1070
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,020
 So did they close the deal? 

1071
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:45,060
 I heard they requested a larger down payment. 

1072
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:48,330
 The photo of Daichi hanging in Wind's office... 

1073
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,000
 I think we'll need that photo. 

1074
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,060
