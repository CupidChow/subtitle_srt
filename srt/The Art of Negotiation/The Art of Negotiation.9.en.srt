(The Art of Negotiation)

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,890
You.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,490
Do you want to be a board member?

11
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,070
Why? Don't you want it?

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,250
If it's a registered member, then yes.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,620
I see. You want voting rights, is that it?

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,620
Yes.

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,760
I wish to be a member of the board.

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,930
No wonder you're an expert in negotiations.

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,340
Do you own hiking boots?

18
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,540
Is it true that Yoon Joo No will be on the board?

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,850
Is this a done deal?

20
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,850
Yoon Joo No is going hiking with the chairman.

21
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,990
To Mount Bukhan?

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
Yes, Mount Bukhan.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,130
What's significant about Mount Bukhan?

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,199
CEO Min, didn't you hike up Mount Bukhan...

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
before sitting on the board?

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,240
I joined the company as a member of the board.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,710
I see.

28
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,039
You were already one...

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,440
when Director Lee offered you this position.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,510
You won't know of its significance, then.

31
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,450
So what's the big deal about Mount Bukhan?

32
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,390
Apparently, the chairman's fate is tied to a lot of water.

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,989
The chairman's fate is tied to a lot of water?

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,030
That's right.

35
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,659
Since too much water is around him,

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,830
he must change the flow of the water to avoid bad luck.

37
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,300
However, that can't be done with trees or soil.

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,469
Since trees rot when damaged by water,

39
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,240
and water washes soil away.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Then what?

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,910
Rocks are what he must keep close.

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,880
So that's why he goes to Mount Bukhan.

43
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,560
Mount Bukhan is all rocks, you see.

44
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,059
He must go there...

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,660
for the stars to align and bring him luck.

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,430
He even chooses an auspicious day for the hike.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,970
There's also steel.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,840
CEO Choi. With steel, there's a risk of rust.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,110
Rock and stone are the right option.

50
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,240
Right. Let's go.

51
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,320
You've been to his office before.

52
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,460
There's a grand suiseki blocking the entrance.

53
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,730
It was placed there to block the flow of water.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,230
I see.

55
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,370
The chairman always voices the importance of good health,

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,339
so I thought it was to test one's stamina.

57
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,179
The hike isn't just for potential board members.

58
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,380
He always climbs up Mount Bukhan to make important decisions.

59
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,120
You're right.

60
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,650
Yoon Joo No...

61
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,860
By the way, have we paid all our debt?

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,290
There's still some left.

63
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,630
Is that so? Tell me, then.

64
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,630
How much?

65
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,440
About 2.5 billion dollars, sir.

66
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,700
Really? Then,

67
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,440
- I guess we're almost done. - Yes, sir.

68
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,710
It's slippery here.

69
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,980
Come in.

70
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,860
These are hot.

71
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,230
Right. Thank you.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,209
Hold on. Doesn't he give you a mission...

73
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,310
before letting you on the board?

74
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,680
Right. I wonder what it'll be.

75
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,120
Who knows?

76
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,390
There are a lot of tasks he could give Yoon Joo No.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,260
Yoon Joo No's capability isn't what anyone's questioning.

78
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,930
We're almost there.

79
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,970
Goodness.

80
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,240
Nice, isn't it?

81
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,590
As you grow older, the headaches get worse.

82
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,250
Do you know why?

83
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,560
Because...

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,630
you can see through people.

85
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,700
However, one can't point out all the lies and ironies, can he?

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,340
Turning a blind eye is worse though.

87
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,910
Being able to see through people gives me a headache,

88
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,550
but you're a mystery to me.

89
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,120
I have a country club in North Chungcheong Province.

90
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,360
See if you can sell it.

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
Sure.

92
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,000
Good.

93
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,940
Mr. Chairman.

94
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,979
Why are you all out here?

95
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,710
What about your work?

96
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,349
Also... Goodness me.

97
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,150
I didn't think you'd be this good at hiking.

98
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,959
Sir, it'll be a first to have a team manager...

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,060
become a registered board member.

100
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,759
Get him something to eat before you go.

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,530
- Yes, sir. - I'll get going.

102
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,330
Let's go.

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,320
What did the chairman say?

104
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm to sell the country club in North Chungcheong Province.

105
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,260
A country club?

106
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll take a rain check on that meal.

107
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,560
Or maybe you two can enjoy it yourselves.

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,570
Hey!

109
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,710
Did the chairman tell you to do anything else?

110
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,950
No. Selling the country club is all that he mentioned.

111
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,880
You must've impressed the chairman.

112
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,190
Because he gave me an easier task?

113
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,050
Yes.

114
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,830
(Episode 9: The Direction)

115
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,730
Come in.

116
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,400
- Right. - Mr. Chairman.

117
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,610
Sure. Have a seat.

118
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,110
- What is this about? - I had something to say.

119
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,980
- Sure. Have a seat. - Thank you.

120
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,420
Go on.

121
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,430
It's nothing serious. I just wanted to talk about Joo No.

122
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,799
He's still relatively young and making the jump to director...

123
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,270
doesn't seem ideal.

124
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,630
Is this a formal complaint?

125
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,170
No, I'm not speaking for myself.

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,010
The other members of the board might be uncomfortable.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Maybe it'd be wiser to call a board meeting first.

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
And? If the directors veto the idea,

129
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,279
should I go back on my word?

130
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,620
No, of course not.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,020
- Director Ha. - Yes?

132
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,720
This shouldn't be your concern right now.

133
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,260
As you know, we sold Sanin Construction.

134
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,760
Yes, sir.

135
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,630
I'm thinking about building a new apartment complex.

136
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,040
- What's your take on that? - Sorry?

137
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,439
Why are you so shocked?

138
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,910
I can build apartment complexes without breaking a sweat.

139
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,150
Yes, of course.

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,680
That's not something I doubt, sir.

141
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,350
However,

142
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,090
we sold the construction company.

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,149
Exactly. That's why...

144
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,220
I'm suggesting we start anew.

145
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,659
We can't, sir.

146
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,190
There's a clause preventing us from doing the same line of business.

147
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,830
For how long?

148
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,170
I'll have to check to be sure,

149
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,530
but I believe it's five years.

150
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,500
Goodness. Is that so?

151
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,610
Look into another company, then.

152
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,580
We'll help it grow and buy it when we can.

153
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,240
Pardon?

154
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,720
Why? Won't it be possible?

155
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,120
By the way, who was that again?

156
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,660
What's he up to these days?

157
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,160
Who could you be referring to?

158
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,830
You know, the one who looks like this.

159
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Like this.

160
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,690
Get that out of here.

161
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,960
That too!

162
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,500
Hurry up.

163
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,130
Clear that side, will you?

164
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,300
Hey! Get that away!

165
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,210
Clear that already.

166
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,640
You! Hey, clear those away.

167
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,280
What now?

168
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,790
- Goodness. - Tae Soo!

169
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,250
My gosh.

170
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,420
It's been a while since I saw you in a hard hat.

171
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,729
The macho Lee Hun Min. It's a good look on you.

172
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,030
Tae Soo!

173
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,200
My gosh, you're being silly.

174
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,840
I see you're working hard.

175
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,409
How's GREEN VIEW Country Club?

176
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,210
The golf business isn't what it used to be.

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,110
That's right.

178
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,909
A lot of my friends posted on social media...

179
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,450
that they got into golfing,

180
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
but I haven't heard much of it since then.

181
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,250
I'm guessing it suffered a downturn in sales.

182
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,590
Director Kang shares that view.

183
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,590
We're now seeing what's worth keeping and not.

184
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,159
According to the financial statements,

185
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,930
it's maintaining its earnings rate.

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,069
Compared to other country clubs,

187
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,270
GREEN VIEW is holding its ground.

188
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,770
That's a relief.

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,710
Although, we won't know the details until we assess it ourselves.

190
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,510
Director Lee,

191
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,050
during the last board meeting,

192
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,150
I was asked who should be held responsible.

193
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,860
All that mounted stress...

194
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,330
I mean,

195
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,860
the travel and hotel business isn't doing well,

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,900
so I let my temper get the best of me.

197
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,140
I apologize.

198
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,370
Goodness.

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,710
I didn't ask to see you regarding that matter.

200
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,510
- Here. - Goodness.

201
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,290
Come to think of it,

202
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,959
I said something I shouldn't have that day.

203
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,220
Gosh, no.

204
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,490
Something must've come over me. I'm such a fool.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,670
Why is that loser back here?

206
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,610
Here.

207
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,610
These are playing stones for Go...

208
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,180
which I bought in China on a business trip.

209
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,780
These look expensive.

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,420
You love playing Go, sir.

211
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,050
Aren't these stunning?

212
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,060
Right. I appreciate the gift.

213
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,230
Anyway, I asked you here...

214
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,099
to talk to you about something.

215
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,130
Sure.

216
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,770
- Don't get the wrong idea. - Do tell, sir.

217
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,470
I'm afraid...

218
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,340
another subsidiary of yours might have to be sold.

219
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,680
Sorry?

220
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,050
The country club is trying to be sold.

221
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,079
But sir, I mean it when I say I've been trying to do better.

222
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,350
Gosh, no. This is why I said you shouldn't get the wrong idea.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,490
This is a test to see if Yoon Joo No can make it as a board member,

224
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,460
so I ask for your assistance.

225
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,480
Are you sure there's no ulterior motive?

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,380
Of course not. Why would there be one?

227
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,450
(Lawyer Hall)

228
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
You there.

229
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,489
You can't leave the packages here.

230
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,519
Take them up.

231
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,159
I was going to take them all up at once.

232
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,390
Hurry up, then.

233
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,760
I'm almost done.

234
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,270
What the...

235
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,170
Hey.

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,600
What about the order I put in?

237
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
It's ready.

238
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,840
I've been waiting for you.

239
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,710
I'm almost there too.

240
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,380
How much progress have you made?

241
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,150
I'll be on the board.

242
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,020
I see. Okay.

243
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,960
But being on the board...

244
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,430
Aren't you interested in getting a job elsewhere?

245
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Not really.

246
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,170
I need to get back in there.

247
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,770
I know.

248
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,910
But...

249
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,480
let's say you joined the board...

250
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,350
and requested the case to be reinvestigated.

251
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,520
What if they object?

252
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
Then I'll know...

253
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,990
who's responsible.

254
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,880
Yes, Director Kang.

255
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,649
Mr. Yoon, it's about GREEN VIEW.

256
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Someone's willing to buy it.

257
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,950
Already? That's good to hear.

258
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,390
I was hoping to see you tomorrow. Are you free?

259
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,960
Yes, of course.

260
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,370
Mr. Yoon.

261
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,109
This is Choi Sung Il at Dream Securities.

262
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,170
I'm Choi Sung Il.

263
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,909
Greetings. I'm Yoon Joo No.

264
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,979
I heard a lot about you, so it's a pleasure.

265
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,209
Right. One of our clients...

266
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,849
is interested in the country club business,

267
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,580
and GREEN VIEW owned by Sanin seemed like the perfect fit.

268
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,920
And the client is suggesting a deal on a no-name basis?

269
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,619
Our client reacts quite sensitively to rumors.

270
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,830
- That's okay, right? - Well, sure. Why not?

271
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,189
But what is the purpose of the acquisition?

272
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,959
Is it to run the country club?

273
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,660
Or is it for investment purposes?

274
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,269
They manage funds,

275
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,170
but they won't sell it. They'll run it themselves.

276
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,270
Right, so you'd need to replace the current CEO.

277
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,480
Just the CEO?

278
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,780
Yes.

279
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,809
As for the employees, we'll keep all of them...

280
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,980
unless there's a problem with them.

281
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,820
Don't steal the good ones.

282
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Got it.

283
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,120
As for the value, how much are you thinking?

284
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,820
Eighty million dollars will be sufficient, right?

285
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,560
That isn't enough at all.

286
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,430
You're open to negotiating upwards, right?

287
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,730
Come on, Mr. Yoon.

288
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,439
Everyone knows that Sanin is in urgent need of cash right now.

289
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,370
Besides, the golf industry...

290
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,770
isn't all that attractive anymore.

291
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,040
We already have plans in place to raise the funds,

292
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,480
so we don't really need to sell the country club.

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,980
For 11 billion dollars?

294
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,150
We're almost there.

295
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,190
We're wrapping up the project too.

296
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,960
Thank you.

297
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,560
You said you'd heard a lot about Mr. Yoon.

298
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
Then should we review it and let you know?

299
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes, let's do that.

300
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,880
- Thank you for coming today. - Thank you.

301
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,319
- So, you'll call us, right? - Yes, we'll be in touch.

302
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,350
We'll talk soon.

303
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,700
I feel like I'm losing for some reason, even though I'm buying it.

304
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,160
Everyone feels like that after talking with Mr. Yoon.

305
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,970
People call him the White Snake for a reason.

306
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,800
Hey, but 80 million? Seriously?

307
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,070
Hey, that is a generous offer.

308
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,770
Do you not have enough bullets?

309
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,409
I have more than enough bullets.

310
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,840
Should I go ahead and shoot you?

311
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,410
All right.

312
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,920
Hold on. Who's the client again?

313
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,320
I said they'd like to do it on a no-name basis.

314
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,650
Oh, right. You said that. Got it.

315
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,020
What does a no-name basis mean?

316
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,230
No-name... It literally means...

317
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,460
they'll proceed with the deal without revealing who the client is.

318
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,070
Can that be done?

319
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,430
It's actually quite common.

320
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,570
Let's say the buyer is a big company...

321
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,569
or really needs the company they're buying.

322
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,609
If such information is revealed,

323
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,080
the seller might ask for more money.

324
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I see.

325
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,480
Then will their name remain a secret until the deal's over?

326
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,610
No.

327
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,980
Once we decide to sell it, they'll have to reveal themselves too.

328
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,750
I see.

329
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,700
Hey, I heard you went to Mount Bukhan.

330
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
Yes.

331
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,840
I guess I'll see you more often from now on.

332
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,180
The doors are closing.

333
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,330
Once you become a board member,

334
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,430
you'll have many questions.

335
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,300
If there's anything you want to know, just ask me. Anytime.

336
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,970
Thank you.

337
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,900
Or we could have dinner with Director Lee sometime.

338
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,840
Sure.

339
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,110
Let's go.

340
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Attorney Oh isn't here yet.

341
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,220
He'll meet us there.

342
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,790
At the country club?

343
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,490
He's originally from North Chungcheong Province.

344
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,200
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

345
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,539
Soon Young really is perfect.

346
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,540
I know. He's good-looking and has a good personality.

347
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,879
- On top of that, he's a prosecutor. - Exactly.

348
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,110
I'm not a prosecutor.

349
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,110
He quit that job, you know.

350
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,479
Now, he's a lawyer at Sanin.

351
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
I know.

352
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,520
I hear they pay him even better.

353
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,219
Do you make a lot of money?

354
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,360
Then how come you're still not married yet?

355
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,690
I wonder too. It wasn't intentional.

356
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,759
He has high standards, just like his father.

357
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
My goodness.

358
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,729
I guess your mom isn't going to charge us for this meal today.

359
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,669
Soon Young, you have to find a good woman for yourself.

360
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,899
Don't make the mistake your father made.

361
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,570
Goodness. Don't be ridiculous.

362
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,309
Thank goodness I had low standards for men.

363
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,040
If it weren't for me, Soon Young wouldn't even have been born.

364
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,280
Oh, then I should thank my mom too.

365
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,649
Not your dad?

366
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,680
Well, I take after my dad.

367
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,050
Look at me.

368
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,050
- Yes. - You're right.

369
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,190
Oh Soon Young.

370
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,460
Bon Joo!

371
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,930
- Hey, it's been so long. - Yes, it's been a while.

372
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,169
I heard you became a prosecutor.

373
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,230
- Yes. - He quit.

374
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,670
He's a lawyer at Sanin now.

375
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,740
Yes, thank you.

376
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,510
Yes, sit here.

377
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,480
I must say, being a prosecutor doesn't suit you.

378
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,050
Right?

379
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,149
Anyway, how are things with you?

380
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,949
Me? Pretty good.

381
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,550
I work at a country club.

382
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,890
- You do? - Yes.

383
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,590
- My gosh. It's been so long. - Hey, Soon Young!

384
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,290
Hey, class president. It's been so long.

385
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,060
Hey, long time no see.

386
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,959
Hey, do you not recognize me?

387
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,200
- Hey. Of course, I remember you. - Look at that.

388
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,940
My goodness. How long has it been? Hey.

389
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,899
Oh, I guess you guys came here because you heard I was here.

390
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,439
What? No.

391
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,740
We came here to eat and saw you.

392
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,909
Mother! Three servings of soft tofu stew, please!

393
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,610
Can't you order something more expensive?

394
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,480
I've spent my entire paycheck.

395
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,250
Soft tofu stew, three servings. Make it extra tasty.

396
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,149
What's this? Didn't you come here to see me...

397
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,420
because you heard I was here?

398
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,119
I'm hungry. Let's eat first and catch up.

399
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,260
I'm starving.

400
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,490
Fine. I hope you pig out and get indigestion.

401
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,959
- I'll sue you. - Sure, I'm a lawyer.

402
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Fine.

403
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,770
Your mom bragged to everyone that you were coming.

404
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,739
She did?

405
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,970
You'll have a drink with us, right?

406
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,210
Sorry. I have to work.

407
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,380
Let's get together soon for a drink.

408
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,950
- I'm done being friends with you. - Goodness. Thanks.

409
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,620
Hey, Jin Soo.

410
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,420
Hello, Attorney Oh. We're on our way now.

411
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,260
We're almost there, but I'm starving now.

412
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,690
But right now...

413
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,300
I don't think you guys can come here now.

414
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,030
Why not?

415
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,570
Many of the neighbors are here now.

416
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What?

417
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,670
It must be very popular. Should we wait in line?

418
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,970
No, it's not about the restaurant.

419
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,580
Many GREEN VIEW employees are here now.

420
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,950
We don't want rumors going around about the company selling it.

421
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,750
I see.

422
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,050
I'll meet you guys by the main road.

423
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,450
Okay.

424
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,860
Attorney Oh will meet us by the main road.

425
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Okay.

426
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,800
Mom, I'm off.

427
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,070
Where are you going? Have some tofu before you go.

428
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,700
- Where are you going? - I'm sorry.

429
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,270
Something urgent has come up at work, so I have to go.

430
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,640
Let's get together soon for a drink.

431
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,849
- Hey, you should eat. - We have all this food left.

432
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm sorry. It's very urgent.

433
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,549
I'll call you guys.

434
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,880
- Okay. - We hope all goes well.

435
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,050
Mom, I'm sorry.

436
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,350
Gosh, you.

437
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,390
- Bye. - Bye.

438
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,420
All of my close friends work at GREEN VIEW.

439
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,190
It is your hometown.

440
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,860
Yes. There aren't any big companies here.

441
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,729
Then what will happen to your friends...

442
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,400
once the country club gets sold?

443
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,700
The buyer plans to run it themselves,

444
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,240
so they'll all get to keep their jobs.

445
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,670
Right, although there will be a new CEO.

446
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,340
They'll just replace the CEO?

447
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,610
They're interested in buying GREEN VIEW because it's doing well.

448
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,119
If the CEO is getting fired for doing a good job,

449
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,420
that's not fair. Don't you agree?

450
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,590
Yes, it is unfair.

451
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll never be a CEO.

452
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,990
I'll never make you a CEO.

453
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,930
I mean, I don't understand what's good about being a CEO.

454
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,599
Even the executives. They all seem anxious...

455
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,300
about losing their positions,

456
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,270
but I don't think they do any work.

457
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,670
Right.

458
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,270
For them, it's all about politics.

459
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,010
Exactly.

460
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,310
I think it's better to be just a line-level employee.

461
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,720
But if you aren't an executive, you will get fired eventually.

462
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,490
Right.

463
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,590
If this goes well,

464
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll become one of them.

465
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,470
Congratulations, Mr. Yoon.

466
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Congratulations.

467
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,880
- Congratulations - Congratulations

468
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,210
- Congratulations - Congratulations

469
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:55,490
- Congratulations on your promotion - Congratulations on your promotion

470
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,310
The CEO will get angry too, right?

471
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
Jin Soo.

472
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,750
You won't get all worked up again and swear at them, right?

473
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,550
Look at me. Let's rehearse.

474
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,150
I'll hold back this time.

475
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,130
Hello. Mr. Yoon Joo No, right?

476
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,630
Hello. You must be Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

477
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,960
I am Yoon Joo No.

478
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,360
Nice to meet you.

479
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,729
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

480
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,640
We'll talk over a cup of tea.

481
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,150
I must say,

482
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,780
the vibe isn't bad.

483
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,150
Agreed.

484
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,120
Please come on in.

485
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,720
You can sit here.

486
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,060
No, you should sit there.

487
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,160
My goodness. Please, take a seat.

488
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
Sure.

489
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,930
Please sit here.

490
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Oh, my.

491
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,039
When I saw the four of you arriving together,

492
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,750
I thought you came to play.

493
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,379
Sorry, we aren't here as your customers.

494
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,620
Gosh, don't say that.

495
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,450
I didn't mean to say I was disappointed.

496
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's sit down.

497
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,590
Sure.

498
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,410
The head office gave me a heads-up.

499
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,940
So, I hear the company wants to sell the country club.

500
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
Yes.

501
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,150
It hasn't been decided yet,

502
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,550
but Sanin is struggling financially at the moment,

503
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,820
so the company has no choice but to sell what it can.

504
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,990
Right.

505
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,860
I understand.

506
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,230
Then...

507
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,360
will the country club be shut down?

508
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
No.

509
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,030
The company that takes over will run it.

510
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,900
So, the employees will all be transferred,

511
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,940
but we'd like to keep it from the employees...

512
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,640
until the decision becomes finalized.

513
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,109
Hearing about it now...

514
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,180
could shake up the employees.

515
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Right.

516
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,719
I understand.

517
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,160
And if there's anything you need to tell us, do tell us now.

518
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,329
The buyer will thoroughly inspect the premises...

519
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,960
to assess the value of the business.

520
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,230
Things will become complicated if problems are discovered then.

521
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,040
The business isn't doing so well. But other than that,

522
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,470
there are no problems.

523
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,810
But isn't it doing pretty well compared to other country clubs?

524
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,380
I have been working hard.

525
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,920
Anyway, I'm glad to hear that the country club won't be shut down.

526
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,290
I thought I was getting fired.

527
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,860
The company that's interested in buying GREEN VIEW Country Club...

528
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,600
wants a new CEO.

529
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,570
So, I can't keep the position?

530
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,279
It is the prospective buyer's mandatory condition,

531
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,540
so that won't be easy.

532
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,649
However, you could transfer...

533
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,550
to another subsidiary of Sanin,

534
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,520
or we could help you find a position at a different company.

535
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,690
The deal could also fall through, right?

536
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,890
Yes, that's also possible.

537
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,630
Then...

538
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,730
can I take some time to think about this?

539
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,100
To figure out what I should do.

540
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,510
I'd need to talk to my wife about it too.

541
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,480
Yes, take your time.

542
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,180
Just let us know during the due diligence process.

543
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,690
Then may I take it that you will cooperate with due diligence,

544
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,250
Mr. Lee?

545
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,260
Well, I have no choice.

546
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,130
Oh, hello.

547
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,300
Oh, Ms. Jeong.

548
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,340
Hello.

549
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,580
This is Ms. Jeong, our financial manager.

550
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,480
She takes care of GREEN VIEW's housekeeping.

551
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,380
She's the one I turn to when I have any questions.

552
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,290
I'm flattered.

553
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,090
Do you two know each other?

554
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,730
Yes, we've been friends since childhood.

555
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm originally from here.

556
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,570
I see.

557
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,380
Get back safely, then.

558
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,110
Thank you. We'll wait to hear from you.

559
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,390
Take care.

560
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,560
They're from the head office, right?

561
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,700
Yes.

562
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,330
They came to do an inspection.

563
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,370
Let's go back inside.

564
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I feel bad for Mr. Lee.

565
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,510
I understand how you feel, Jin Soo.

566
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,780
But with these things, it's better to be honest and tell him the facts.

567
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Pardon?

568
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,530
You say you feel bad for him,

569
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,500
but what you really mean is that you pity him.

570
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,430
Pity isn't exactly...

571
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,730
the kind of emotion...

572
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,070
we should feel toward the CEO of this place.

573
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,880
It'd help him to know exactly what's going on...

574
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,680
so he can figure out his next move.

575
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,080
That's true, but it's not really fair.

576
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,300
If Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek was a good CEO,

577
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,270
his accomplishments as a CEO will be recognized.

578
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,640
Although, we don't know when or how that will happen.

579
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,859
Doesn't that mean...

580
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,500
he might not get a proper evaluation his whole life?

581
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,360
Yes.

582
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,600
What then?

583
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,040
What would you do in that situation, Mr. Yoon?

584
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,840
Let's see.

585
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,840
I would...

586
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,680
do as I always have.

587
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,450
- Aren't you? - Exactly.

588
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,180
(Junior Managing Director Lee Dong Joon)

589
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,660
Director Cho. What brings you here?

590
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,160
I have a question.

591
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,360
For me?

592
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,930
Yes.

593
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,540
Since I'm in HR, I only need to focus on human resources.

594
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,280
But due to the affiliate company CEOs' different stances,

595
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,650
the company's atmosphere has recently become overly intense.

596
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,820
Everyone's on edge.

597
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,880
True.

598
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,220
They must be very worried as the company's situation...

599
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,819
is not that good at the moment.

600
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,830
Exactly.

601
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,830
It's at times like these that we should help each other out.

602
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,770
You see...

603
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,740
I find Mr. Yoon quite unfriendly,

604
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,440
but everything he says is right.

605
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,480
What stops me from taking his side is that...

606
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,180
you never know who'll get fired.

607
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,480
I see.

608
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,090
Mr. Yoon is simply doing his job.

609
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,789
You know the current situation of the company.

610
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,830
Of course.

611
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,700
Someone will lose their job.

612
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,970
Although, as the HR manager,

613
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,370
I've nothing to do with M and A.

614
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,880
Well, of course not.

615
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,710
Our stance is different from that...

616
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,750
of the affiliate company CEOs.

617
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,490
Mr. Yoon seems to be the stubborn type,

618
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,760
but he minds his manners, doesn't he?

619
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,500
He does.

620
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,430
Once he joins the board of directors,

621
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,770
he'll become more flexible.

622
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,840
Right? I think so too.

623
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,810
- Weren't you going home? - I was.

624
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,840
Director Choi.

625
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,010
We're selling the country club.

626
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,380
Do you want to sign an MOU first?

627
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,220
The buyer will be there in person, yes?

628
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,250
Yes, of course.

629
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,020
But he wants to meet at the country club.

630
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
At GREEN VIEW?

631
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,599
Yes.

632
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,730
He's an impatient man and wants to see the country club.

633
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,300
All right. Let's do that.

634
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,140
We'll meet at the country club.

635
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,180
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

636
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,720
No, don't worry.

637
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,589
The MOU for GREEN VIEW will be signed tomorrow,

638
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,160
and the inspection will begin.

639
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
It's a relief that...

640
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,230
a buyer turned up right away.

641
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,900
Yes.

642
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,940
You simply have to ensure there are no hiccups.

643
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,070
What else is there to talk about?

644
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,510
When this deal goes through, I'll join the board of directors.

645
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,580
I'm wondering what the existing directors think about that.

646
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
You think they'll bully you?

647
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,120
What you're currently doing...

648
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,090
is cutting out Sanin's wounds.

649
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,960
The chairman basically complimented you on your job.

650
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,570
It's a big deal among the directors.

651
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,570
But...

652
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,910
the current situation isn't working against you.

653
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,810
Just do your job as you always have.

654
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,180
- Understood. - Good.

655
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,730
- Director Cho. - Good evening.

656
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,970
Gosh. You've gotten much better at it.

657
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,370
Aren't you good at golfing?

658
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,639
I only golf every once in a while for fun.

659
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
I see.

660
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:38,880
But something came up, so I'm practicing after a long time.

661
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,950
Right.

662
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,590
After all, business requires playing golf.

663
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,090
We should play a round of golf together.

664
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,020
Right. We should.

665
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,960
Oh, no.

666
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,870
Your shoulders are quite stiff today.

667
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,630
It seems like it.

668
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,770
What is it? Is something bothering you?

669
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,140
Me? No, not really.

670
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,410
When it comes to golf,

671
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,150
you don't win just by hitting the ball farther.

672
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,380
The key is the direction.

673
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,290
Keep a consistent direction,

674
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,760
and you'll win.

675
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
I see.

676
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,160
I hope you're like that, Director Cho.

677
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Well...

678
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,299
Allow me to be frank with you.

679
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,470
Okay. Go ahead.

680
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,170
How about...

681
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,010
getting along with Mr. Yoon?

682
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,950
- Sorry? - I was thinking...

683
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,250
it'd be nice if you thought better of him.

684
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,980
We'll often see him from now on.

685
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,690
I see.

686
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,819
So you're on that side.

687
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,430
Gosh, no. It's not about which side I'm on.

688
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,460
Honestly, our company...

689
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,159
doesn't listen to the directors' opinions.

690
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,930
And it's not like we own many shares.

691
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,670
The chairman's approval is all we need.

692
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Okay.

693
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,510
I didn't know...

694
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,810
you were such a romantic person.

695
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,510
Sorry?

696
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,350
Wait...

697
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,260
Be careful on your way.

698
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,170
Romantic, my foot.

699
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,320
Mr. Kim. Are you outside?

700
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,089
I'm dining out with my family right now.

701
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,950
Then, I must've interrupted your time.

702
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,860
No, it's all right.

703
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,660
I need to talk to you.

704
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,360
Are you free later in the night?

705
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,630
Yes.

706
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,830
Now then...

707
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,600
Let's meet at our regular Japanese restaurant.

708
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,270
I'll call again after making a reservation.

709
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,579
Enjoy your dinner with your family.

710
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Okay. That sounds good.

711
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,889
My apologies when you were talking.

712
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,890
It was a call from home.

713
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,390
Right.

714
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,530
Where did I leave off?

715
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,630
Let's see. About Go.

716
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,900
You said it was fun and that I should learn how to play.

717
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,810
That was all meaningless talk.

718
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,180
What I want to say is...

719
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,309
- Yes? - We're preparing...

720
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,280
for e-commerce, right?

721
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
Yes.

722
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,390
But we won't be hiring outsiders.

723
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,889
I'm well aware of how well you've been...

724
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,190
managing Sanin Mart.

725
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,830
Thank you.

726
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,600
And I'll assist you in making our e-commerce successful.

727
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
No.

728
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,270
I'll be resigning.

729
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,810
How come?

730
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,070
Is it because...

731
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,040
of Mr. Yoon becoming a director?

732
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,750
No. My point is that...

733
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,050
you should be in charge of it.

734
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,050
No way. It's your project, isn't it?

735
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,160
I should quit, with how old I am.

736
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,090
What about Mr. Yoon?

737
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,100
Mr. Yoon...

738
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,060
has no plan to stay in Sanin forever.

739
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,470
I see.

740
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,970
So, taking over e-commerce...

741
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,240
will be your golden chance.

742
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,580
Gosh.

743
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,720
Because I had no idea,

744
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,120
I was...

745
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,459
quite disappointed.

746
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,490
Right.

747
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,160
But to think there was a bigger picture.

748
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,600
May I take it that...

749
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,630
you're okay with e-commerce?

750
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,940
Of course.

751
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,970
In the end, e-commerce is distribution.

752
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,940
- Yes, it is. - Right.

753
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,780
- I'd like a glass. - Sure.

754
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,180
(Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo)

755
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,890
You can take the call.

756
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,460
It's all right. My family needed me to grab something.

757
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,770
- Stop the car. - Yes, sir.

758
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,250
These jerks are putting their minds to work.

759
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,050
Mr. Lee.

760
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,760
We won't have enough people tomorrow.

761
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,690
Yes. You should bring one more party.

762
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,960
Yes. Good.

763
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,130
Director Choi. We've arrived.

764
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,870
Right, Mr. Yoon.

765
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,809
We arrived hours ago...

766
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,310
and are now on the golf course.

767
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,840
I see.

768
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,410
We'll be waiting in the lobby.

769
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,909
But it'll take a while.

770
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,180
How about coming out here? I'll send a caddie over.

771
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,960
Why don't we sign it next time?

772
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,589
No. The CEO feels bad about it...

773
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,000
and wants to meet and sign the MOU today.

774
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,700
Isn't this wrong?

775
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,740
It totally is.

776
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,410
Even if the buyer has the upper hand,

777
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,880
this is crossing the line.

778
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,920
Let's go.

779
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,010
The road ahead is rough.

780
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,240
Please hold onto the safety bar.

781
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,520
Good shot!

782
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,199
My apologies for making you come all the way here.

783
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
This way, please.

784
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,040
We shouldn't disturb the tee shot.

785
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,610
Nice shot!

786
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,350
Oh, gosh. It's been a while, Mr. Yoon.

787
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,160
- Right. - You two are acquainted, yes?

788
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,030
Didn't you know that I was the one buying this club?

789
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,900
I see.

790
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,670
We're in your care.

791
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,240
No, I'm the one in your care.

792
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,000
Let me buy it at a cheap price.

793
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,809
How about stopping the game here?

794
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:54,910
No way.

795
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,750
I'm winning right now.

796
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,250
Tae Soo. Don't you see that Mr. Yoon is about to cry?

797
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,590
Don't get the wrong idea.

798
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,889
Mr. Lee and I are close friends.

799
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,929
Even after he resigned, we kept in touch...

800
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,060
and even played golf together.

801
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,230
But this guy.

802
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,069
He wanted me to tag along...

803
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,029
to check out the country club...

804
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,240
he was looking to buy.

805
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,640
You must've known we were trying...

806
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,139
to sell the country club.

807
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,610
That's why I'm telling you not to misunderstand.

808
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,780
I only found out when I got here.

809
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,510
Really.

810
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,220
Here comes Mr. Lee.

811
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,149
Making a deal with him will be easy...

812
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,390
with his direct personality.

813
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,959
If he doesn't listen to you, tell me.

814
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
A word from me, and he'll give in.

815
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,000
All right. Now then, I'll let you two talk.

816
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,099
- I'm leaving. - Already? What about our drinks?

817
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,670
Come on, Mr. Lee.

818
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,809
It's a waste if you drink after working out.

819
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,270
Or we should've skipped golfing.

820
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
Aren't I right?

821
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,180
Mr. Yoon.

822
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,550
Becoming a director isn't easy, is it?

823
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,900
- Take care. - Bye.

824
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,839
Gosh.

825
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,640
I feel light after working out for the first time in ages.

826
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,340
It's light as a feather.

827
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,049
Mr. Lee. Is there a reason...

828
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,420
you're proceeding with this deal on a no-name basis?

829
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,660
I do.

830
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,930
It's due to the fear of information leaking...

831
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,160
and someone manipulating the stock price.

832
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,570
Right. That's a possibility.

833
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,970
And you're sincerely interested in the acquisition?

834
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,410
I am.

835
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,939
Aren't we signing the paper today?

836
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,940
We are.

837
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,330
Thank you.

838
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,130
We'll give it back after reviewing it.

839
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,900
Are you still an intern?

840
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,710
Yes.

841
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,150
It's about that, right?

842
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,310
Our deal is confidential,

843
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,179
and no falsifying of documents.

844
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,220
Yes, sir.

845
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,120
I'm sure you covered all corners with the contract.

846
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,190
After all,

847
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,060
it was handled by the best law firm in Korea.

848
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,670
Attorney Oh. What are you checking so thoroughly now?

849
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,840
- Are you afraid I might scam you? - Wait.

850
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,860
After you review it, give it back to him.

851
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,900
- Okay. - Yes, I'll take care of it.

852
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,900
All right then.

853
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,900
Let's conduct due diligence.

854
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,040
Which cohort were you in?

855
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,110
I was in Cohort 42.

856
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,050
I see.

857
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,090
I was in Cohort 38. My name is Kang Min Ho.

858
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,620
I'm Oh Soon Young.

859
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,640
Will you go through with this deal?

860
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,470
I must. Nothing is stopping me.

861
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,580
Let's make no mistakes.

862
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,080
Yes, sir.

863
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,730
Ms. Kwak. Could you review the documents?

864
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,469
I'll check the documents...

865
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,470
related to financial statements going back ten years.

866
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,640
- Ten years? - Yes.

867
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,069
The retention period for accounting-related documents...

868
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,680
is ten years.

869
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,550
Here are the files for financial statements from 2015.

870
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,380
Here you go. They're from 2016.

871
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,620
Okay.

872
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,820
But when will you finish reviewing all these?

873
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,190
Pretty soon.

874
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,520
Jin Soo. Could you check the field?

875
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:12,090
Yes, I'll start tomorrow.

876
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,340
- It's been a while. - My gosh, yes. It's been a while.

877
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,280
You, Intern. Let's grab a meal. Come with me.

878
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,720
- No. It's okay. - Come with me.

879
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,990
Enjoy your meal.

880
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,800
Excuse me.

881
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,900
What are you doing?

882
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,540
Well...

883
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,369
I'm drawing.

884
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,509
Once we begin conducting due diligence,

885
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,640
the employees are bound to feel insecure.

886
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Right. I'll explain that to them.

887
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,379
Some of your friends work at the country club.

888
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,520
Are you sure?

889
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,720
That's why it will be better if I do it.

890
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,020
The country club will be acquired by a foreign fund company.

891
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,459
A former CEO of Sanin's subsidiary,

892
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,300
Mr. Lee Hun Min, is the buyer.

893
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,030
He plans to run the country club himself after the acquisition.

894
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,470
As he used to work for Sanin, I'm sure he'll be highly dedicated.

895
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,240
He seemed too scary.

896
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,410
You already met him.

897
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,510
What if he fires us?

898
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,680
No.

899
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,980
The country club will continue to operate.

900
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,750
The buyer set employee succession as part of his terms.

901
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,280
He says that now. But what if he still fires us?

902
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,449
No. If he dismisses the majority of the employees,

903
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,420
running the country club will be difficult.

904
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,060
If that was his plan, buying the country club would be moot.

905
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,030
He wants to make a profit.

906
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,229
Actually, Sanin Group failed...

907
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,570
to take the initiative to invest in GREEN VIEW Country Club.

908
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,829
Once a new company acquires the country club,

909
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,370
investments can be more robust with new investors.

910
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,109
Furthermore, I'm sure employee benefits...

911
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,410
will improve a lot compared to now.

912
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,340
We will see to it that these conditions are met...

913
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,310
as a requirement of the sale.

914
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,049
Please read the document in front of you.

915
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,720
If you have any questions, please ask me.

916
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,320
Do you want to get a drink after work?

917
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,760
- Cheers. - Cheers.

918
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,100
Oh, right.

919
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,540
By the way, did you know that you were the one who taught me...

920
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,280
how to drink?

921
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,079
- I did? - Really?

922
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,410
- Really? - Yes.

923
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,419
It was in the village hall. We secretly drank the ginseng wine.

924
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,979
Then we filled it up with water.

925
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,120
Oh, was it that day?

926
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,689
Yes.

927
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,890
Back then, I didn't have any tolerance for alcohol.

928
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,960
I passed out after a few drinks. And when I woke up,

929
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,560
I saw you begging for forgiveness.

930
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,130
Right. I also had to pay it back.

931
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,769
My gosh. Everyone was at fault.

932
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,439
But you said you would take the fall for everyone...

933
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,670
and take responsibility for it.

934
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:11,970
Good grief.

935
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,940
Do you know what your nickname was after that incident?

936
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,410
I don't know.

937
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,180
Bon Joo of Justice.

938
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,949
- Bon Joo. - My gosh.

939
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,980
- Bon Joo. - Here.

940
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,630
By the way,

941
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,290
how did we get caught?

942
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,030
- It was because of Moon Jin. - Yes?

943
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,230
Moon Jin confessed because she didn't want to lie.

944
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,640
Right.

945
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,700
What's she up to now?

946
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,040
She's well.

947
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,340
She also works at the club. She's a caddie.

948
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,680
What?

949
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,650
- I didn't see her at the club. - She's taking a break.

950
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,120
I see. Is that so?

951
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,620
By the way, is everything you said earlier true?

952
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,889
Of course, it's true.

953
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:01,920
Then...

954
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,360
no one is getting fired, right?

955
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,500
Right. No one is getting fired.

956
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,230
Wait. But a new CEO will take over.

957
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,970
The acquirer wants to run it himself.

958
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,940
The current CEO will probably be transferred to a subsidiary.

959
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,840
Alternatively, he will resign with a generous severance package.

960
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,080
That's it for the CEO?

961
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,410
Yes. Probably.

962
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,349
The KTX train bound for Gwangju Songjeong Station...

963
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,350
will depart soon.

964
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,589
If you purchased a ticket,

965
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,059
please get on the train at Platform Ten.

966
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,060
Thank you.

967
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:39,590
Attention. The KTX...

968
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,760
I think this is it for me.

969
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,240
Would you like me to look into another position at a subsidiary?

970
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,810
No.

971
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,940
I know that Sanin Group isn't doing well.

972
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,510
I'm worried that if I accept the transfer,

973
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,350
I might be taking over someone else's position.

974
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,990
It seems only right that I resign.

975
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:09,190
Or I can help you get a position in our partner's company.

976
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,430
No.

977
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,800
I'd like to rest now.

978
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,070
Is there a reason behind your decision?

979
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,780
Actually, I live here alone when my family is abroad.

980
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,380
My son and my wife are in the States.

981
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,450
I want to live with my family now.

982
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,260
This is a photo of my son and my wife.

983
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,370
So your wife works with flowers.

984
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,640
Yes.

985
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,780
My son got into New York University.

986
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,050
The university's tuition fee is exorbitant.

987
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,650
The money I sent over wasn't enough.

988
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,250
She works part-time at a flower shop to help pay the bills.

989
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,460
The CEO of the company...

990
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,890
asked her if she was interested in buying the company.

991
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,170
But we're short on cash.

992
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,740
How much capital do you need?

993
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:36,640
I saved up some money over the years.

994
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,280
I need about one million dollars.

995
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,920
Your hard work for the country club is recognized.

996
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,889
But offering you a severance package...

997
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,960
exceeding the Sanin's internal regulations will be difficult.

998
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:54,160
As you know, the company isn't in good shape financially.

999
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,470
I see.

1000
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,270
However, once our due diligence ends favorably,

1001
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,540
we'll have a chance to discuss your severance package.

1002
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,580
I'll see what I can do when that time comes.

1003
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,390
Ball!

1004
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:25,790
Hey.

1005
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,000
- Come here. - Pardon?

1006
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,530
Is the course set up properly?

1007
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,030
Don't you think the design is off?

1008
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,410
I just think you messed up your shot.

1009
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,210
- What? - What's that?

1010
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,849
The golf course was mapped out by BA Golf Design.

1011
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,880
It was also selected as the best golf course in Korea in 2019.

1012
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,620
And our customers are quite satisfied with it.

1013
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:55,290
But still. Shouldn't the green be over there?

1014
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,690
Sir.

1015
01:00:57,691 --> 01:01:00,260
There must be a 20m gap between courses...

1016
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,100
for safety issues.

1017
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,870
So if it was designed based on your suggestion,

1018
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,000
it will be illegal.

1019
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:17,980
Okay.

1020
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,650
Five, six...

1021
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,130
Thirty-eight.

1022
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,860
See?

1023
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,800
There are only 38 carts.

1024
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,270
It says here that...

1025
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,240
there should be 52 carts.

1026
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,240
Were you trying to deceive me on purpose?

1027
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,570
No, sir.

1028
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,610
Some carts are out on the field right now.

1029
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:52,650
Then...

1030
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,980
how many carts are out on the field now?

1031
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,650
It's 14, sir.

1032
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,590
All right. One more cart is coming in.

1033
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,660
Now, there are 13 carts out.

1034
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,490
Please watch out. The cart is coming in.

1035
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,440
Should I go outside and count?

1036
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,710
There's no need.

1037
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,340
Please take a look at this.

1038
01:02:19,341 --> 01:02:21,240
You can check the carts through our system.

1039
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,110
Fine.

1040
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,750
But the carts are way too worn down.

1041
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,150
Right. That was already factored into the depreciation cost.

1042
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,320
My gosh.

1043
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,820
You are all working very hard.

1044
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,730
Learn from them. Okay?

1045
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,460
Yes, sir.

1046
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,650
This was exhausting.

1047
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,420
I hated that.

1048
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,250
But I think it ended well for us.

1049
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,820
My friend, you think it's over?

1050
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,620
We must go back to the office and get back to work.

1051
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,960
Let's go.

1052
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,760
- We must work. - Let's go.

1053
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,800
Ms. Kwak. To the right.

1054
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,830
I had never imagined that the buyer would be Mr. Lee Hun Min.

1055
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,300
He was offered a position in a foreign fund company.

1056
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,869
It's a small company,

1057
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,670
so the details about their funds are limited.

1058
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,979
But Sung Il hid that from me...

1059
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,180
and asked me to introduce you to him.

1060
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,750
I'm not sure. But I couldn't care less about that.

1061
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,590
Rather, could you check if his intention is genuine,

1062
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,390
he plans to run the country club,

1063
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,830
and can guarantee employee succession?

1064
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,030
Sure. I'll look into those things.

1065
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,160
Okay.

1066
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,270
I'm sorry.

1067
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,300
I really had no idea.

1068
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,370
I believe you.

1069
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,540
- Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bye.

1070
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,860
Yes, Ms. Kwak.

1071
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,390
Mr. Yoon, you'll need to come back to the office now.

1072
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,100
Is something wrong?

1073
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,330
The numbers don't add up.

1074
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,170
Go on.

1075
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,480
What happened?

1076
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,109
There was a withdrawal of 100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

1077
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,450
But they weren't accounted for.

1078
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,820
- In cash? - Yes.

1079
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,120
Withdrawals must be approved by CEO Lee Hyeong Taek, right?

1080
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,460
Yes. And there is one more person who can approve of it.

1081
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,400
Thank you. Bye.

1082
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,640
Number 118.

1083
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,439
- Hello. - Hello.

1084
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,680
- How can I help you? - I'm here to make a withdrawal.

1085
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,950
- How much? - All of it.

1086
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,690
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo?

1087
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,150
Yes.

1088
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,390
You want to withdraw everything in cash?

1089
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,690
Yes.

1090
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:35,060
(The Art of Negotiation)

1091
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,759
Selling GREEN VIEW Country Club is our top priority.

1092
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,230
My arm was injured because the cart tipped over.

1093
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,070
I don't have it. I spent it all.

1094
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,169
Will the value be depreciated if embezzlement is involved?

1095
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,340
How many years of imprisonment for one million dollars?

1096
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,570
What a hot mess.

1097
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,710
You must be on your way out.

1098
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,910
Are you suspecting me?

1099
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,250
How about Yoon Joo No? Is he doing a good job?

1100
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,320
Please entrust me with it. I'll grow the business well.

1101
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,449
You managed the fund separately.

1102
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:34,160
That's also embezzlement.

1103
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,990
I can't possibly work with people who committed embezzlement.

1104
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,029
He requested that all country club employees...

1105
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,290
be dismissed.
