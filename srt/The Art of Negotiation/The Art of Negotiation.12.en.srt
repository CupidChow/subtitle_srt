00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,140
- Have you tried it a lot? - My gosh.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,479
- Really? - Wait.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,449
- You've been here often? - This is so good.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,579
- Hey, we're going to line up. - Why isn't the line moving?

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,050
- I should lose weight. - Seriously.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,819
- We should get some for to-go. - You stay out.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,890
Mr. Lee.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,530
Oh, my.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,900
How have you been?

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,660
Well, you know...

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,730
Are you still working for the same company?

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Well...

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,510
What was the name of the company?

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,109
- It's GOGO Consulting. - Right.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,740
- That's the one. GOGO. - Yes.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,010
Why don't we talk?

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,550
Sure. Well...

26
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,420
Excuse me for a second. Get me suyuk, will you?

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,520
Seriously? The name of the company is GOGO?

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,930
Is it a nightclub?

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,929
I don't think you can show your face around Yeouido.

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,960
What?

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,770
This town is filled with con artists.

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,530
I'm considered a straight guy in this town.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,439
Even so, you got caught.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,470
Exactly.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,510
I shouldn't have gotten caught like you.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,750
Word is...

37
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,650
you're still running your game.

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,350
My gosh. You must have lost your mind.

39
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,120
Who told you that?

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,790
Yet, you're not denying it.

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,890
Hey.

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,000
I can bankroll it.

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,700
Do you want to play a hand together?

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,040
You're unbelievable.

45
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,240
- You haven't learned your lesson. - Right.

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,440
I made so much money that I can't come to my senses.

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,050
How much do you have?

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Well,

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,190
I've got some.

(Episode 12: The Game)

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,740
All right.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,940
Mr. Yoon.

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,310
You're also admitting that you own JUMBO Pharma's shares, correct?

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes,

55
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,850
I am.

56
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,630
I was trying to do you a favor.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,360
But you turned it down.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,839
(Sanin)

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,940
You must not know what I'm holding in my hand.

60
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,880
I know exactly what it is.

61
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,880
And you must have more evidence.

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,010
Mr. Yoon.

63
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,190
That's enough.

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,020
Let me tell you.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,789
This proves that Yoon Joo No was...

66
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,590
directly involved in manipulating JUMBO's stock price.

67
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,760
He owned ten times the number of shares his brother did.

68
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,440
With that many shares, he did more than just participate.

69
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,470
He was the leader of this operation.

70
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,240
Director Ha.

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,010
Mr. Chair.

72
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,079
It's too soon to jump to conclusions.

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,110
Then what?

74
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,850
Should we hand him over to the FSS?

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,650
Or the prosecution? Should we ask them for a second opinion?

76
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,050
Listen.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,389
This isn't the time for you to protect your pride.

78
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,460
You must accept your mistake and bow down.

79
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,960
We're just trying to help you with good intentions.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,870
I'm simply answering the questions I've been asked.

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,370
Please continue.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,099
We're not here...

83
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,110
to determine whether or not you committed a crime.

84
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,680
The purpose of our meeting is to decide the disciplinary action.

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,240
Accept the disciplinary action.

86
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,780
If you disagree with our decision, you can seek legal representation.

87
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,850
Let's take a short recess.

88
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,519
A short recess for what?

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,420
We should just finish the meeting. And we'll be free to rest then.

90
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,820
Let's take a break.

91
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,970
Fine. All right. Let's all have a cup of coffee.

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Okay.

93
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
(Sanin)

94
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,280
What's gotten into him?

95
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,380
He must be out of it.

96
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,650
- You think so? - Yes. That's quite common.

97
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,160
Yoon Joo No rarely loses it.

98
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,820
My gosh, everyone loses it at meetings like this.

99
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,459
Everyone pleads and begs us to believe them.

100
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,099
They demand our help to uncover the truth...

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,129
while claiming to be innocent.

102
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,100
They kneel on the floor and beg in tears.

103
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,130
I've fallen for it several times.

104
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,810
But once we present evidence and press hard on them,

105
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,239
they all crumble.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,680
There hasn't been an exception ever. Not even once in my career.

107
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,850
Then shouldn't he plead at least?

108
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,849
I bet he wants to.

109
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,690
He probably wants to get down on his knees right now.

110
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
But as you know, he likes to save face.

111
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,690
He doesn't know when to bow down.

112
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,699
Well, it only takes one shot to take down guys like him.

113
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Precisely.

114
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,380
(Sanin)

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,260
Is it going according to your plan?

116
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,870
Not exactly.

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Then admitting to your actions could be a viable option too.

118
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,940
This could end with your dismissal.

119
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,420
Just like I told you when I first came back to Korea,

120
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,220
I have nothing to lose.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,990
So the severity of the disciplinary action...

122
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,920
doesn't matter either.

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,530
Why doesn't it matter?

124
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,060
You don't know what you're in for.

125
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,070
Will I go to prison?

126
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,400
That's why...

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,970
you want me to agree to dismissal, right?

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,580
Let's say this ends with my dismissal. What then?

129
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,520
What's next?

130
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,790
Sanin Group can file a civil lawsuit against me, right?

131
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,460
It will cost a fortune to compensate for the damage.

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,530
Even so, why play a hand that will backfire?

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,600
If you keep this up, it will cost more than your job.

134
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,270
When they file a lawsuit, it will be an emotional move.

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,270
How will you benefit from that?

136
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,640
I came back here because...

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,880
I wanted to find out the truth about my brother.

138
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,050
So...

139
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm only speaking the truth now.

140
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,690
So you don't care...

141
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,890
if you end up in prison...

142
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,490
or get sued as long as you find out the truth?

143
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes.

144
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
(Sanin)

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,570
- Bring us coffee. - Yes, sir.

146
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,550
- Hear me out. - Sure.

147
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,890
There's no way Yoon doesn't know about the company's situation.

148
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,090
Could it be a suicide mission?

149
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,200
A suicide mission?

150
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,430
"Sanin manipulates stock prices."

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,300
He might be planning to expose us and ruin us completely.

152
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,170
By causing our stock price to crash?

153
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,470
So he could be trying to drag us down with him.

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,610
How will he handle the consequences?

155
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,980
My gosh.

156
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,580
Why would a man who has nothing to lose worry about that?

157
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
Come in.

158
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Gosh, later.

159
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,530
If that's the case,

160
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,830
we must make our move first.

161
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,930
How?

162
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,600
We must get ahead of him and expose that he manipulated the stock price.

163
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,209
My gosh. I told you that wasn't an option.

164
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,570
That's what he wants right now.

165
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
No.

166
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,809
"Sanin Group was able to stop..."

167
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,280
"the corporate raider, Yoon Joo No, from manipulating the stock price."

168
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,480
That's the angle we should play.

169
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,220
"Sanin Group is capable of weeding out internal risks."

170
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,220
That will be our stance.

171
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,030
How will we convince the chairman?

172
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,959
We can't convince him.

173
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,800
The articles would be published without our knowledge.

174
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,230
I see. So...

175
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,770
Sanin Group is facing difficulties because of Yoon Joo No.

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,740
Since he was removed, things will only improve for Sanin?

177
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,140
What?

178
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,610
Yes. We can roll with that.

179
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,510
That's good.

180
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,450
But here's the thing.

181
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,349
For a reporter to put out a decent news article,

182
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,049
the story must sound convincing.

183
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,820
- With facts, it will be better. - Right.

184
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,290
Do you think Yoon Joo No will give us any?

185
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,700
You see, when people get chatty,

186
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,600
they're bound to make a mistake.

187
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,240
Mr. Yoon.

188
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,980
Do you need anything?

189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,980
No. I'm good.

190
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,250
Someone will come to see me.

191
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,390
Could you let me know then?

192
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,120
- Who? - Excuse me.

193
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,700
(Sanin)

194
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,240
Were you able to rest a bit?

195
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,779
I just became curious...

196
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,250
after listening to you earlier.

197
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,420
So tell me. How does this so-called game go?

198
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,260
Could you explain it to us?

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,860
The stock price manipulation is often called the game.

200
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Right.

201
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,100
But I doubt one person can run the game alone.

202
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,899
No.

203
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,800
You will need other players to help you for the game.

204
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,270
Among the players, there's the mastermind. The one...

205
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
who designs the entire operation and reaps the largest profit.

206
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
And...

207
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,950
This way.

208
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,090
Then there's the figurehead to keep the mastermind hidden.

209
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,060
Let me serve it based on age. You ordered jujube tea, right?

210
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,830
Safe.

211
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,729
- Driving. - The bankroll provides the funds...

212
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,459
- to manipulate the market. - I hope we can get along, sir.

213
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,500
I ordered the tea.

214
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,870
- Could you give her the tea? - Yes, sure. Here you go.

215
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,740
Let us be humble.

216
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,909
Then there's the painter who manipulates the stock charts.

217
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,510
I'm going to paint on the charts.

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,940
- And... - As for this guy...

219
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,950
Right.

220
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
My name is...

221
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,980
Jang Won Seok.

222
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,120
A long time ago, I used to work in Yeouido as a finance guy.

223
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,059
I'm a freelancer now.

224
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,120
Exchanging names, are we? What is this, a blind date?

225
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,790
Oh, right. Okay.

226
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,360
He was a technician.

227
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
But he got caught and lost his hand.

228
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,500
But you're back?

229
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,770
Yes.

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm back with a new hand.

231
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,179
He ought to come back.

232
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,039
There's no better business than this.

233
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,050
Exactly.

234
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,320
It's not like I can work as a delivery man at my age.

235
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,350
My gosh.

236
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,660
Anyway, we're going to play this game...

237
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,190
solely based on trust.

238
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,930
You all know that, right?

239
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,200
That's why this is a tough job.

240
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,529
Right on.

241
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,700
No matter how hard or lonely it gets,

242
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,800
- let's trust our team. - Yes.

243
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,640
We should rely on each other.

244
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,240
- Let's take it all the way. - Yes.

245
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
- Okay. - Okay.

246
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,480
They're a group of con artists, to begin with.

247
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,610
- Let's drink. - So they don't trust one another.

248
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,720
In many instances, names aren't exchanged...

249
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,220
and faces remain hidden.

250
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,720
Given the nature of this group,

251
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
to join this family,

252
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,430
you must be introduced by an existing player.

253
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,790
My gosh. Where are you going?

254
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,600
By the way, he's clueless that he was duped.

255
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,570
That's why he's back.

256
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,700
The mastermind must've done a great job driving the car.

257
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,169
It was a hit-and-run,

258
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,270
- but he has no idea what happened. - Right.

259
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,670
- Okay. - Great.

260
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,780
All right.

261
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,780
I invited all of you to the group chat.

262
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,350
Let's make a fortune and never see each other again.

263
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,120
- That's the goal. - That's the goal.

264
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,649
- Bye. - I look forward to it.

265
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,720
Take care.

266
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,159
The mastermind, also known as...

267
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
the biggest player and the architect,

268
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,160
rarely shows up.

269
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,860
Yes, Doctor. The meeting is over.

270
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,299
Yes. I'll tell you in person.

271
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,369
(Yeouido Boutique, Banker, Jujube Tea, Doctor)

272
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,440
I'll be back soon.

273
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,180
Hey. So the Doctor is the mastermind?

274
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
Why are you curious about that?

275
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,380
Well,

276
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,520
the mastermind didn't show up today.

277
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,790
But he's in the group chat. Am I wrong?

278
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,490
Then just let that be.

279
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,730
Why should the identity of the mastermind matter to you?

280
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,260
Seriously.

281
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,400
That punk.

282
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,240
Listen. I have one million dollars at stake in this game.

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,570
I ought to know how this game is going to play out.

284
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,770
Listen up.

285
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,180
I'll only explain it once.

286
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
There's a company named Seono Technologies.

287
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,779
- What kind of company is it? - I don't know. And who cares?

288
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,820
I guess it has some kind of technology.

289
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,319
When the players get together,

290
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,350
they settle on a company for their game.

291
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,490
Usually, they choose companies worth around 100 million dollars.

292
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,490
Why is that?

293
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,160
Shouldn't they pick a big company to have a bigger profit?

294
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,660
And it will be easier to go unnoticed.

295
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,740
Because they can't freely control the price with big companies.

296
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,140
To be able to move ten million dollars,

297
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,170
companies worth around 100 million dollars are suitable.

298
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,440
The company is worth around 100 million dollars.

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,710
Which means we need 100 big ones.

300
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,449
You said you were good for ten, right?

301
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,680
Yes. Ten million dollars.

302
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,250
Then we need exactly 100.

303
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,089
Their stock price is between 1.2 and 1.3 dollars.

304
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,090
Okay.

305
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:27,190
We're going to drive the stock price below a dollar.

306
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,030
That's when you come in.

307
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,130
I see. Okay.

308
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,830
Don't buy them without the green light.

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,429
I'll let you know...

310
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,430
- when it's your turn. - Okay.

311
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,169
Keep the group chat notification on.

312
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,170
Okay.

313
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,699
They will gradually drive the stock price up and down...

314
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,440
as the players buy the stock.

315
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,510
Then when individual investors join them,

316
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,910
they purposely drive the stock price down.

317
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,780
To raid the retail investors, so to say?

318
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,520
Correct.

319
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,119
It refers to their attempt...

320
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
to force individual investors to sell their shares,

321
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
so they can buy them.

322
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,790
Once they have done the market sweep,

323
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,460
as the players sell and buy the shares,

324
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,030
they drive up the stock price.

325
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,770
As the players must be the only ones buying and selling,

326
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,929
they sell and buy...

327
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,570
an agreed-upon number of shares at a scheduled time.

328
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,470
This is called...

329
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,570
a matched order.

330
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,280
Usually, the transaction goes down during lunchtime.

331
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,110
Why is that?

332
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,380
The market activity is at its lowest...

333
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,880
and is the least monitored period around lunchtime.

334
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,090
The people at the FSS must have lunch too.

335
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,820
The devil is in the details.

336
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,960
Once we've gathered enough shares, I'm going to...

337
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,030
drive it up.

338
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,700
Up to five dollars.

339
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
That high?

340
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,969
I'll have to publish news articles and so on.

341
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,540
Tabloids will be part of it too.

342
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,980
I know a few YouTubers too.

343
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,179
I see. Yes.

344
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,850
I hear finance YouTube channels are quite influential now.

345
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Great idea. Nice.

346
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,790
So how does the order go?

347
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,759
Remember the order the drinks were served?

348
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,960
That's the order.

349
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,190
I see.

350
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,930
Then I'm last.

351
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,960
Did you think you'd go first?

352
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,770
Once the stock price skyrockets,

353
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,070
the players sell the shares in the order they agreed upon...

354
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,500
and slowly pull out without getting noticed.

355
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,480
When they do, the stock price doesn't plummet right away.

356
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,109
Due to the influx of individual investors...

357
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,950
misled by the fabricated news from the players,

358
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,320
the stock price often goes up, which is contrary to expectations.

359
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,620
That's why the stock charts from the game often show two spikes,

360
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,420
resembling the camels' humps.

361
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,730
But as JUMBO was a failed game,

362
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,400
the chart didn't resemble the camels' humps.

363
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,470
I barely made any money because the last one was a flop.

364
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,469
So I'm trying to come up with a great game this time.

365
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,140
Seriously, Won Seok.

366
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,680
You have no idea how hard I'm working.

367
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,150
I got it. Thank you for your hard work.

368
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,850
- Okay. - So don't worry. You just wait.

369
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
Okay.

370
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,120
Let's not...

371
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,160
see each other for a while.

372
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,590
Sure. Okay. Bye.

373
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,460
Why did it fail?

374
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,299
Someone broke the agreement first,

375
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,140
sold off the shares, and pulled out.

376
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
A betrayal after a betrayal.

377
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,310
That's the kind of skill set...

378
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,440
the industry requires.

379
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,350
In a failed game like this,

380
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,849
a large number of shares would be available in the market,

381
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,250
so the stock price would plummet.

382
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,220
By the time individual investors figure it out,

383
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,790
it's probably too late.

384
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,720
When it hits the lower limit,

385
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,230
you can't sell the shares even if you want to.

386
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,560
How do you know that?

387
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,100
I think I've been a victim too although I have no evidence.

388
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,640
So...

389
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,010
what was your role in this game?

390
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,170
The architect?

391
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,309
The one who designed and led...

392
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,150
the stock price manipulation of JUMBO was Dr. Ko Byung Soo.

393
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,180
He held the largest number of shares as well.

394
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Is that so?

395
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,590
What happened to that guy?

396
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,420
Did he go to prison?

397
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,960
As you know, it was a failed game.

398
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,859
Therefore, it must have been difficult...

399
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,530
to prove the direct involvement of the players in the game.

400
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,080
Let's say what you're telling us is the truth.

401
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,710
Then don't you want...

402
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,180
to catch this doctor guy?

403
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,560
I must.

404
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,570
That punk. He wants me to clean up the mess.

405
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,070
He's practically putting rubber gloves on my hands.

406
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,610
Darn him.

407
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,710
I think you can talk to them.

408
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,340

I'm not sure.

426
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,660
He wanted to handle the disciplinary hearing alone.

But why?

428
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,959
If we help him,

429
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,130
we could be reprimanded too.

430
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,770

Didn't you come back to conceal the evidence...

460
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,629
that you manipulated the stock price?

461
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,600
I never partook in stock price manipulation of any sort,

462
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,439

showed us that you know an awful lot about it.

You don't need to participate...

467

472
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,530
to doing something I never did.

521

Yes, I heard you.

533

It was strictly based on the documents they gave us.

534
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,130
It doesn't reflect their actual situation.

535
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,069

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,200
Yes, I heard you.

540
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
His pride must be hurt too.

541
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,740
He'll decide against the investment, right?

542
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,710
Isn't that what you're hoping for?

544
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,319
But what if he already got a rebate?

545
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,259
That means he's already in the same boat as them.

546
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,690
Then it won't be easy for him to cancel the plan to invest in them.

If he already received a kickback,

549
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,270
the fact that JUMBO is a scam...

550
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,670
will put him in a difficult position too.

551
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,209
Yes, exactly. If he decides to cancel the investment now,

552
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,210

Yes.

in the report you submitted to me,

685
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,239
you wrote that we should invest in JUMBO.

686
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,709

687
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,210
we should not invest in JUMBO.

691
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,970
isn't that what you had to do to commit the perfect crime?

692
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,840
We didn't have to actually invest in it to make the stock go up.

693
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,740
It was enough to have rumors go around about our investment.

694
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,780
The stock would still go up.

695
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,610
Then you could just sell them all and exit.

696
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,780
In other words,

697
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,990
you said we shouldn't buy JUMBO...

702
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,840
that's not what happened.

703
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,440

704
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,650
Hold on. What do you mean?

My brother couldn't sell his shares and exit.

706
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,620
That's why...

707
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,850
the evidence still remains.

708
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,860
I see.

709
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,530
He didn't sell his shares.

710
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,360
You didn't profit from them, so you did nothing wrong?

711
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

712
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,340
Do you really not know? Or are you just acting dumb?

713
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,639
Just the fact that you had those shares...

714
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,039
makes you a criminal.

715
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,839
That's not what he's saying.

716
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,849
Okay, go ahead and explain. What does he mean?

717
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,149
What's he talking about?

718
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,220

719

720
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,789
and died.

721

All right, then.

728
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,260
Then explain this.

729
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,959
Why did you invest in JUMBO shares?

730
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,300
Fifty thousand shares, at that.

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,130
They...

732
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,130
aren't mine.

733
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,270
What?

734
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,410
Come on, Mr. Yoon.

735
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,970
You shouldn't lie to us.

736
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,079
This letter states that you own 50,000 shares...

737
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,179
and that you should attend their general meeting of shareholders.

738
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,080
We can't talk if you're going to deny this.

739
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,190
You should admit this, at least.

740
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,820
I'm trying to help you here.

741
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,729
The ones at eye level are part of our Gold Line Package.

742
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,730
They're the best ones.

743
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,930
Each niche costs 7,000 dollars.

744
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,970
The ones right above the Gold Line cost 6,000 dollars,

745
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,940
but most people go for the Gold Line.

746
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,009
Otherwise, you'd either have to look up...

747
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,710
or down as they aren't at eye level.

748
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,530
The ones on top are also quite popular.

749
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,700
I'll go with that one.

750
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,600
Are you a Buddhist by any chance?

751
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,539
If so, there's an event we're organizing.

752
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm not interested.

753
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,780
Well, you know...

754
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,510
In Buddhism, taking one's own life...

755
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:56,019
is seen as a harmful action that also hurts...

756
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,820
the people around you.

757
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,860
- So... - I'm not a Buddhist.

758
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,590
Oh, I see.

759
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,840
I heard his brother took his own life in his stead.

760
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,810
What is this nonsense now?

761
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,709
High-ranking executives from Sanin were here.

762
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,310
That's what they said.

763
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,610
What exactly did they say?

764
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,880
That he and Joo No invested in some stock together.

765
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,220
- Goodness. - I see. That must be the reason.

766
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,390
What is it?

767
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,429
Earlier, one worker felt bad about the brother...

768
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,160
and wanted to give him her prayers. But Joo No rejected her,

769
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,030
saying he's not a Buddhist.

770
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,030
How can he do that? Oh Woon is an orphan now.

771
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,940
Well...

772
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,210
- Gosh. - Good grief.

773
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,380
Who will take care of her? She doesn't even have a mom.

774
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,190
Isn't your child around the same age as her?

775
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,189
Raising them together will be easy.

776
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,360
Nonsense.

777
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,160
Raising a stranger's child is not easy at all.

778
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,530
You shouldn't say such things even if we're at a funeral.

779
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,870
- Oh, right. You have it tough. - Hey.

780
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,410
I'm fine.

781
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,350
Oh Woon.

782
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,960
Why don't we...

783
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,500
live together?

784
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,040
Call me...

785
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,240
Dad from now on.

786
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,570
Okay?

787
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,230
Mr. Yoon.

788
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,170
Yes?

789
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,670
I looked into what you asked.

790
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,310
- The inheritance? - Yes.

791
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,280
Before your brother passed away,

792
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,650
he pocketed one million dollars.

793
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,490
He didn't have many assets.

794
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,790
If you inherit,

795
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,560
it'll also include the liability for compensation.

796
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,790
You'll end up with far more debt.

797
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,330
So...

798
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,070
Is Oh Woon the inheritor?

799
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,170
Yes.

800
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,909
The first in order is your niece.

801
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,040
But she's a minor.

802
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,210
You, the second in order, must inherit on her behalf.

803
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,580
Both you and Oh Woon should give up the inheritance.

804
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,820
No.

805
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,390
I will inherit it.

806
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,820
You will...

807
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,860
have to pay the debt in his stead.

808
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,970
I know.

809
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,640
I inherited both...

810
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,080
a one million dollar liability to the bank...

811
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,310
and 50,000 shares of JUMBO Pharma.

812
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,050
In other words,

813
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,149
the 50,000 shares printed...

814
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,320
on the shareholders' meeting invitation you're holding...

815
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,890
are not mine...

816
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,460
but what I inherited from my brother.

817
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,630
Is it true?

818
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,260
Did you inherit his debt?

819
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,030
Of one million dollars?

820
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,000
- Do you have proof? - How is that important right now?

821
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,740
Even from what we've heard so far,

822
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,009
you can be charged with insider trading,

823
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,210
nominee trading,

824
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,510
direct stock price manipulation, and...

825
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
Right?

826
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:18,180
Those can lead to corporate image damage...

827
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,920
and charges of breach of duty.

828
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,050
That's why you're fired. Got it?

829
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,160
I request a chance to explain myself.

830
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,990
Save it. Write your resignation letter and get lost.

831
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,500
Is that an official order?

832
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,600
No, it's not.

833
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
(Sanin)

834
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,740
Could I be granted some time to think?

835
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,880
How much do you need?

836
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,920
About two hours.

837
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,750
Is that enough?

838
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,620
Yes.

839
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,489
Okay. Get some fresh air for two hours.

840
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,330
It's already time for lunch.

841
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,900
Let's all have lunch.

842
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,200
We'll take a break.

843
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,910
Great.

844
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,320
Gosh.

845
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,620
Could he really have inherited his brother's debt?

846
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,190
Director Lee.

847
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,790
Did he?

848
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,390
Who knows?

849
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,270
How could you...

850
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,040
give Yoon Joo No time because he asked?

851
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,869
Director Cho. Are you starving or something?

852
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,910
No.

853
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,940
Let me explain, Director Ha.

854
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,679
Disciplining him without hearing his side of the story...

855
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,310
might cause issues later.

856
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,820
What issues?

857
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,489
The disciplinary proceedings...

858
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,719
clearly state that one gets the chance to show cause.

859
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,060
Ignore that and discipline him,

860
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,619
and he might take legal action...

861
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,330
for not following the proceedings.

862
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,330
Could that result in the nullification of the discipline?

863
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,970
Someone like Yoon Joo No can make that happen.

864
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,200
I get it now.

865
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,670
Two hours can get him nothing.

866
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,240
If you ask me,

867
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,680
not sticking to the proceedings is all Yoon Joo No has...

868
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,580
against us.

869
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,980
I see.

870
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,620
So this punk is playing his last card?

871
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,990
Yes.

872
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,589
I didn't do Mr. Yoon any favors.

873
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,730
It was me making sure he had no way out of this, Director Ha.

874
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,070
All right. What's left now?

875
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,230
You can discipline him once he returns in two hours.

876
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,240
Okay.

877
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,110
Okay.

878
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,820
That jerk.

879
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,790
He earned money just to buy that?

880
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,260
Goodness.

881
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,719
My legs are killing me.

882
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,519
(Daejin Delivery)

883
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,320
(Ko Byung Soo)

884
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,560
Darn it.

885
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,530
Whatever.

886
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,330
I'll end up behind bars now.

887
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,839
Mr. Yoon.

888
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,980
How did it go? Did they decide on disciplinary action?

889
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,120
Not yet.

890
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,390
By any chance, did anyone come by for me?

891
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,060
No, no one.

892
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,460
Yes?

893
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,200
Hey. I found Dr. Ko's laptop.

894
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,040
I did, but it's password-locked.

895
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,710
Did you unlock it?

896
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,780
No, I couldn't.

897
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,980
Didn't you find it?

898
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,780
I found his laptop.

899
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,720
I don't know the password to unlock it.

900
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,420
I'll bring the laptop to you.

901
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,120
Okay. Make your way here.

902
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,620
Okay.

903
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Do you know how to crack a password?

904
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,770
Of a laptop.

905
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,300
No.

906
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,170
Do we have to hack into it?

907
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,740
Can you do it?

908
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,740
Me?

909
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,050
Won't CEO Cha Ho Jin be able to do it?

910
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,310
CHACHA Games?

911
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,150
What?

912
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,990
Nice pass.

913
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,220
You can't.

914
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,260
- No! - No!

915
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,130
Shoot.

916
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,870
What's up?

917
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,440
Why isn't CEO Cha answering his phone?

918
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,940
He's busy at the moment,

919
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,940
pivoting.

920
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,280
I have an urgent favor to ask.

921
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,510
Right now?

922
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,550
Okay. We're on our way.

923
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,590
CEO Cha.

924
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,290
No more basketball.

925
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,089
We need to head to Sanin right now.

926
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,100
To where?

927
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,660
Sanin?

928
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,309
- He's my senior. - I see.

929
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,550
- Hi. - Hi.

930
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,250
Here.

931
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,480
- Did you get caught? - No.

932
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,350
But I soon will. His laptop is missing, after all.

933
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,020
But how will you unlock it?

934
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,930
I don't know.

935
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,570
I need to head back.

936
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,470
Okay. We'll call you as soon as it's unlocked.

937
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,900
Thank you.

938
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,410
- Let's go. - Okay.

939
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,910
- Excuse me. - Sure.

940
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,480
I'm done with my job.

941
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,520
You are. Great work.

942
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,930
I'll get in touch.

943
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,040
Don't. Take care of yourself.

944
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,490
We will now resume the meeting.

945
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,120
It was short,

946
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,260
but could we take it that it was enough time for you...

947
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,860
to prepare an explanation?

948
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,460
Yes.

949
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,960
Go ahead.

950
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,510
My brother realized Sanin had plans to invest in JUMBO through me.

951
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,310
He bought 100,000 dollars worth of JUMBO shares and then sold them.

952
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,250
In the process, he had lost a great deal of money.

953
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,610
To make up for it,

954
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,880
he must've unlawfully used one million dollars of bank money...

955
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,490
to purchase 50,000 shares again.

956
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:13,960
So what?

957
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,420
You had nothing to do with those 50,000 shares?

958
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:17,860
You had no idea?

959
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,630
It wasn't until the inheritance...

960
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,170
that I learned my brother owned that many shares.

961
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,700
We've heard that already.

962
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,970
- If there's nothing new... - However,

963
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,310
with that amount,

964
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,040
I suspect it belonged to a manipulative force.

965
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,279
Timing-wise, when my brother bought one million dollars...

966
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,350
worth of JUMBO shares, only wash trades...

967
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,820
In other words,

968
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,820
only the forces were trading the shares.

969
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,820
What do you mean by that?

970
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,730
Are you implying that your brother was a member?

971
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,030
No.

972
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,029
I'm saying one of the forces...

973
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,300
betrayed by selling 50,000 shares,

974
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,000
and...

975
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,100
my brother happened to buy them.

976
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,970
Come on.

977
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,010
Isn't that too big of a coincidence?

978
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:09,240
Yes. You may think so.

979
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,250
- That's why... - That's why...

980
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,880
you continue to suspect me.

981
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,390
Director Lee. Remember?

982
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,290
I advised you not to buy JUMBO shares.

983
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,690
I do.

984
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,770
Who took my shares?

985
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,310
(JUMBO Pharma)

986
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,420
That jerk.

987
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,940
(Junior Managing Director's Office)

988
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,349
Director Lee. We need to publish an article right now.

989
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,120
What's wrong?

990
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,079
Sanin might...

991
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,990
get caught up in share price manipulation.

992
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,319
We must issue an article that Sanin has nothing to do with it...

993
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,490
and won't investigate.

994
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,489
I don't understand.

995
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,560
Just get on with the article at once.

996
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,930
The one...

997
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,400
who stopped that was me.

998
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,470
You remember, yes?

999
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,870
I do.

1000
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,910
Good. Thanks to me,

1001
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,610
Sanin avoided suffering damage.

1002
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,880
Had I been involved,

1003
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,550
would I have told you we shouldn't buy the shares?

1004
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,650
Like you suspected me,

1005
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,660
couldn't you have done so to create an alibi?

1006
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,090
What?

1007
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,830
So? Do you have evidence or something?

1008
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,200
We have more than enough evidence against you.

1009
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,240
I'm asking if there's any against me.

1010
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,339
Hi.

1011
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,349
- Hi. - Hi.

1012
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,779
What password were you talking about?

1013
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,850
It's this laptop.

1014
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,619
This laptop belongs to a man...

1015
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,749
suspected of manipulating stock prices.

1016
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,750
The documents on here can clear up the misunderstanding about Mr. Yoon.

1017
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,259
You're an expert in this area, right, CEO Cha?

1018
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,890
And you have experience in hacking.

1019
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,160
Instead of hacking, I got hacked into.

1020
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,030
Right. You were the victim.

1021
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,230
And...

1022
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:48,670
It's only in movies that you can easily hack into laptops.

1023
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,470
I can't do it. Plus, it'll take too long.

1024
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,910
You must do it, CEO Cha.

1025
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,280
- Is it an urgent matter? - Yes.

1026
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,990
Let's see.

1027
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,960
- Do you have a screwdriver? - A screwdriver...

1028
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,430
- Yes, I do. It should be here. - Great.

1029
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,060
I do have evidence.

1030
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,500
As I explained, forces don't trust each other.

1031
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,499
As a result, they keep a record...

1032
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,599
of the amount of money traded, the date,

1033
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,270
and the transaction details.

1034
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,670
They even save not only calls...

1035
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,840
but also every text message.

1036
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,350
So the forces leave a record of their crimes?

1037
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,750
Correct.

1038
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,150
After all, they can't go down alone.

1039
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,490
True.

1040
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,820
It's the same as the old days when people...

1041
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,360
bribed politicians with slush funds and kept a ledger.

1042
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,700
Yes.

1043
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,530
That's why they keep a record of everything.

1044
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,770
And?

1045
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,570
Where's that evidence?

1046
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,170
This is what Do Han Chul did to me.

1047
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,070
You know, DC.

1048
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,070
We know.

1049
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,579
Can you hand me that laptop?

1050
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,580
Sure.

1051
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,750
Here.

1052
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,020
Okay.

1053
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,430
(Golf Club Data, External Vendor Orders)

1054
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,500
To think...

1055
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,330
it works like this.

1056
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,430
- What were you looking for? - Ha Tae Soo.

1057
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,569
(Ha Tae Soo)

1058
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,540
Did my name pop up in their files?

1059
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,079
My apologies. I have something to hand over.

1060
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,350
(Sanin)

1061
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,690
What is that?

1062
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,830
It's a record of Director Ha's...

1063
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,930
JUMBO share purchases using insider information.

1064
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,410
From April 26 to April 29, 2021,

1065
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,740
Director Ha bought 25,000 shares in the 4-day period.

1066
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,010
On May 3 at 12:10pm,

1067
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,520
he bought an additional 25,000 shares,

1068
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,220
which totaled up to 50,000 shares.

1069
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,620
It was worth about one million dollars at that time.

1070
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,690
And 27 minutes later, at 12:37pm,

1071
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,900
he sold everything.

1072
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,810
No, listen.

1073
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,250
He made that up.

1074
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,150
I swear I'm innocent.

1075
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,720
Seriously.

1076
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,030
Being wrongly accused is making me tear up.

1077
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,730
And here are...

1078
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,730
the transaction details of my brother, Yoon Joo Seok.

1079
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,610
On April 29, 2021, at 9:10am.

1080
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,250
He bought shares worth 100,000 dollars...

1081
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,180
and then sold everything four days later.

1082
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,880
But...

1083
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,420
he bought 50,000 shares again 30 minutes later.

1084
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,690
Worth one million dollars at that point.

1085
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,530
It was...

1086
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,530
one minute later after Director Ha sold...

1087
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,730
the whole 50,000 shares.

1088
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,870
In short,

1089
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:15,570
my brother Yoon Joo Seok...

1090
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,870
bought the shares Director Ha sold.

1091
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,579
That night, Sanin issued an article...

1092
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,310
stating it would not invest in JUMBO.

1093
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,880
And the next day, the stock price crashed...

1094
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,950
as soon as the market opened.

1095
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,620
The stock price kept falling to the floor.

1096
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:34,660
My brother...

1097
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,060
couldn't sell his shares until the very end.

1098
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,460
So what?

1099
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,930
Are you blaming me...

1100
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,300
for your brother's death?

1101
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,010
That's not what I think.

1102
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,340
Darn it.

1103
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,080
Because of me...

1104
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,220
Because of me, Joo Seok...

1105
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,920
No.

1106
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,960
Don't say that.

1107
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,990
No.

1108
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:27,660
It's my fault.

1109
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:32,830
I simply...

1110
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,070
wanted to know the truth.

1111
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,940
And now I know what they are.

1112
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,480
The record indicates...

1113
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,080
Director Ha took part in the stock price manipulation.

1114
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,680
After hearing my report on JUMBO,

1115
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,720
he sold all the shares to run away...

1116
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,690
behind the forces' backs.

1117
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:55,890
But those shares...

1118
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,360
ended up with my brother.

1119
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,930
I sold them off after a short while.

1120
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,370
I didn't make any money off of it!

1121
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,470
You must've made a profit,

1122
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,410
though not as much as you'd planned.

1123
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,010
But even if you hadn't earned any money,

1124
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,980
the fact that you were in possession of JUMBO's shares proves your guilt.

1125
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,950
That is what you, yourself, told me today.

1126
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,720
Bring that here.

1127
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,930
You should come here instead.

1128
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,360
It is where the subject of the disciplinary hearing...

1129
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,300
sits.

1130
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,150
You punk, get over here!

1131
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,219
- Director. - Yoon Joo No!

1132
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,220
- Director. - Move!

1133
01:11:58,221 --> 01:11:59,550
- You can't do this. - You punk!

1134
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,490
I'm a founding member of Sanin, you fool!

1135
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,729
- Director. - Move.

1136
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,389
I won't take this from kids like you.

1137
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,429
When I first started out at Sanin,

1138
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,099
you were still in your diapers!

1139
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,429
You. Get off me. Stop holding me back.

1140
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,200
Yoon Joo No!

1141
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,439
Step aside. Move.

1142
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,570
Then,

1143
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,340
it was Director Ha all along.

1144
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,350
Mr. Yoon...

1145
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,620
did leak inside information to his brother,

1146
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,749
but it wasn't intentional.

1147
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,750
And...

1148
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,220
his brother died.

1149
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,230
It'd be heartless...

1150
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,460
to find fault with him.

1151
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,360
Then,

1152
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,800
what should be done...

1153
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,140
about Director Ha?

1154
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:03,650
You can't park your car there. Goodness, sir.

1155
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,850
- I won't be long. - Sure thing.

1156
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,460
(Sanin)

1157
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,110
Director Ha did a lot of work around here.

1158
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,080
He was even in charge of Constructions.

1159
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,740
Generating all that funding was no small feat.

1160
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,780
How old is he again?

1161
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,819
He won't be turning 60 any time soon.

1162
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,920
I guess he put in too many hours...

1163
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,390
for someone of his relatively young age.

1164
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,800
The man must be worn out.

1165
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,260
Tell him to take a break.

1166
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,449
At the disciplinary hearing for Yoon Joo No,

1167
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,860
Director Ha was dismissed from his position.

1168
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,729
Really? Director Ha was terminated?

1169
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,360
Yes. He packed up all of his things at night.

1170
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,830
He wasn't even offered severance pay.

1171
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,370
Second-in-command was cut overnight.

1172
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,800
Won't Director Ha sue the company...

1173
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,310
for wrongful termination?

1174
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,440
As if that's an option for executives.

1175
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,480
He probably was let go for a reason.

1176
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,710
By the way,

1177
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:46,410
you've got to hand it to Yoon Joo No.

1178
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,419
Maybe he really is the chairman's son.

1179
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,950
I told you he wasn't.

1180
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,320
Do you see a resemblance?

1181
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,390
The chairman's son is in the US.

1182
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,630
Hold on. Mr. Yoon...

1183
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,390
flew in from Hawaii.

1184
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,430
That's in the US.

1185
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,800
Wait. Is that how it is?

1186
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,160
(The Late Yoon Joo Seok)

1187
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,509
I'll take ten dollars' worth.

1188
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,140
- With random numbers? - Yes.

1189
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,079
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1190
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,720
- Have a good day. - You too.

1191
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,220
In my dream last night,

1192
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:04,020
stars turned into numbers and rained down upon me.

1193
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,360
Sweet, right?

1194
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,360
What if this becomes a winning ticket?

1195
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,860
When will you stop this wishful thinking?

1196
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,430
When I win the lottery.

1197
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I will someday.

1198
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,300
What will you do with the money?

1199
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,740
Buy a house.

1200
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,770
An apartment unit?

1201
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,080
No.

1202
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,049
I'm going to buy a house with a huge yard.

1203
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,250
Like the ones in movies.

1204
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,650
With basement levels.

1205
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,180
I have it all mapped out.

1206
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,120
You, me, Oh Woon, and your wife will live together.

1207
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,290
I'd rather not.

1208
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,630
Is that so? Then give it back.

1209
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,129
You don't want to, so give it back.

1210
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,929
After that sweet dream you had?

1211
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,470
You weren't sold on my vision though.

1212
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,120
Hey.

1213
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,560
I thought you'd express your gratitude...

1214
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,560
with a beef steak.

1215
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,430
- I'll have the beef sandwich. - Sure.

1216
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,700
There's your beef.

1217
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,240
- Are you sure that's beef? - It is.

1218
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:10,820
Hey.

1219
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:16,190
Why did you put your trust in me?

1220
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,430
I didn't.

1221
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,230
Yet, you gave me a task that important?

1222
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,570
It seemed as though...

1223
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,870
you felt wronged.

1224
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:32,210
A robber can't whine...

1225
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,240
after tripping during a robbery.

1226
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,310
Why didn't you file for bankruptcy?

1227
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,480
I thought that was your expertise.

1228
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,420
You've been trying...

1229
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,320
to pay off your debt.

1230
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,860
Says who?

1231
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,830
You've been working as a delivery man to do so.

1232
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,300
How far have you gotten?

1233
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:04,540
Not far...

1234
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,340
which is all the more reason to work harder.

1235
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,110
What about you?

1236
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,080
How much of your brother's debt were you able to pay off?

1237
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,880
Me?

1238
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,350
Well, I make good money.

1239
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,450
You annoying brat.

1240
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:31,730
What's this?

1241
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,130
Why do we need bottled water?

1242
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,000
We have a water dispenser. Did you put in the order?

1243
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:39,270
I thought you did.

1244
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,740
Hold on.

1245
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,250
- Who... - Are you Lee Seung Soo?

1246
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,880
Yes?

1247
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,590
We're from Gangnam Police Station.

1248
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,520
I see.

1249
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,319
Lee Seung Soo is with the chairman...

1250
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,260
- Hold on. - You're coming with us.

1251
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,629
- Wait. - Don't.

1252
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,529
- I'll... Hey! - Hold on.

1253
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:04,600
What is the meaning of this?

1254
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,510
(Korea Securities Depository)

1255
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,980
(Shareholder meeting notice)

1256
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,820
Who sent this?

1257
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,720
I have no idea.

1258
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,859
Jin Soo, good morning.

1259
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,590
Good morning, Mr. Oh.

1260
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,530
Gosh, Ms. Kwak.

1261
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,530
- This is unexpected. - Morning, Jin Soo.

1262
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,100
Doors closing.

1263
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:57,540
Good morning.

1264
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,880
Mr. Yoon, did you stay here all night?

1265
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,750
No, I just got in early.

1266
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,350
You should've gotten some rest.

1267
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,650
I will once my work is done.

1268
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,660
Can we gather to talk?

1269
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,460
Sure.

1270
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,830
This is next year's business plan requested by Samoel.

1271
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
It includes how Sanin will pay the remaining debt...

1272
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,400
and the direction of business...

1273
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,970
the group will be taking in the foreseeable future.

1274
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,939
I know Samoel is the creditor,

1275
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,739
but can they request such things?

1276
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,210
When they lent Sanin three billion dollars? Yes.

1277
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,549
The interest rate is nine percent.

1278
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,679
That's right. Once we renegotiate the terms,

1279
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,250
the conversion price will go down 30 percent.

1280
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,949
Then that'll make someone else the largest shareholder of Sanin.

1281
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:41,960
Right.

1282
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,360
Then today's briefing needs to go well.

1283
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,400
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

1284
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,170
Get over here and lend me a hand.

1285
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,770
But I'm on the M and A Team.

1286
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,869
Why you...

1287
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,510
Hey! Where are you going?

1288
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,080
Lend me a hand.

1289
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:05,380
Get in here.

1290
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,490
Jin Soo, watch me.

1291
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,320
Take one...

1292
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,490
and place it like so.

1293
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,930
Goodness.

1294
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,130
Hey, you know...

1295
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,900
how you said Yoon Joo No was...

1296
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,780
I mean, Mr. Yoon.

1297
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,250
Who told you Mr. Yoon was the chairman's son?

1298
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,020
I don't know.

1299
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,950
I think I stumbled upon it.

1300
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,850
Why do you ask?

1301
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:48,150
Didn't you say he was the son-in-law?

1302
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,820
Did I?

1303
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,660
Word has been traveling among the employees.

1304
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,399
As you know, Yoon Joo No had Director Ha dismissed.

1305
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,469
A team manager had the CFO removed.

1306
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,330
The company's second-in-command.

1307
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,170
That wasn't exactly Mr. Yoon's doing.

1308
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,610
Director Ha's corruption scandal caught up with him.

1309
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:11,910
Still. What happened is unusual and unprecedented.

1310
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:13,710
So?

1311
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,920
So, Yoon Joo No...

1312
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,590
I mean, Mr. Yoon. That's why people are wondering...

1313
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,460
if he's the chairman's son.

1314
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:26,890
Hold on.

1315
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,960
Did you just scoff at me?

1316
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,529
But that's absurd.

1317
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:32,800
They have different surnames.

1318
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:36,900
He could've been born out of wedlock.

1319
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,300
That's not true.

1320
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:41,710
Really?

1321
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,009
Hey. What about this, then?

1322
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,350
Yoon Joo No... I mean, Mr. Yoon.

1323
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,549
The White Snake.

1324
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,850
I hear his nickname is actually the White Thread.

1325
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,190
Because of his gray hair.

1326
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,690
- Is that true? - Sure. If you say so.

1327
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:02,060
Why do I get the feeling that you're looking down on me?

1328
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,030
Did you sense that?

1329
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,870
Get over here.

1330
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,170
Do you think being on Yoon's team gives you some sort of authority?

1331
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,609
Hello, everyone.

1332
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,139
- Hello. - Hello.

1333
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,249
Hello.

1334
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,549
Jin Soo, shall we put up the slides?

1335
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,580
Sure.

1336
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:02,220
- The chairman will be here too. - Sure.

1337
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,130
Are you saying I need to be present at this meeting?

1338
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,800
They wanted to greet you since it's been a while.

1339
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,830
Who are they sending?

1340
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:15,900
Mr. David, sir.

1341
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,910
Let's go.

1342
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,460
Who will deliver the presentation?

1343
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,100
Mr. Yoon Joo No, sir.

1344
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,740
When will the chairman be here?

1345
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:56,439
I'd like for him to be here before those from Samoel arrive.

1346
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,980
Who do they think they are...

1347
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,710
to demand the chairman's presence?

1348
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,420
You know how these funds think they have all the power.

1349
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,190
They wanted to know our business plan moving forward,

1350
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:11,360
and the loan we took out will soon reach maturity.

1351
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:15,360
We'll be in trouble if they don't grant an extension.

1352
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,299
Of course.

1353
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,000
Won't they be taking over the company?

1354
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,270
Are you ready for today?

1355
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,140
Yes.

1356
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:28,910
The chairman is here.

1357
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,420
Sit.

1358
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,130
I heard they wanted to see me in person.

1359
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:58,000
Greeting you is one of the reasons they're attending this meeting.

1360
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,810
It'd be lovely to exchange some kind words.

1361
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,650
Those from Samoel Fund are here.

1362
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:16,560
Goodness. What a pleasure, Chairman Song.

1363
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:22,730
Mr. David, it's you I owe this pleasure to.

1364
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,200
- Please have a seat. - Sure.

1365
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,310
Shall we begin?

1366
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,140
Sure.

1367
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,940
Just a moment.

1368
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,710
My director hasn't arrived yet.

1369
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,550
We should wait.

1370
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,419
I was wondering why you came alone today.

1371
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,390
Sorry? Goodness.

1372
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:51,590
Actually, the company hired a new executive.

1373
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,729
I see.

1374
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:56,000
We came here today so that he could greet you.

1375
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,900
He'll be here soon.

1376
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:02,030
- There he is. - Goodness.

1377
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,540
Chairman Song, hello.

1378
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:08,780
Hurry into your seat.

1379
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,650
Allow me to greet you.

1380
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,760
Right.

1381
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,130
Director Ha.

1382
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,600
Yes?

1383
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,580
Is this your new gig?

1384
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,480
Yes, I'm a director at Samoel Fund.

1385
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:50,120
It's a small world, isn't it?

1386
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,519
This wasn't one of my cases,

1387
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,120
but Mr. David put me in charge.

1388
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:57,020
No one knows Sanin better than I do,

1389
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,730
and I have a soft spot for the company.

1390
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:01,890
It's been a while.

1391
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,530
Yes, sir.

1392
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,199
Allow me to present the business plan...

1393
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,730
for the upcoming year.

1394
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,100
Unbelievable.

1395
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,340
As if a team manager would know anything.

1396
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:17,040
Who are you to dare talk about the future of a company?

1397
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,980
And in front of the chairman, no less.

1398
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,779
You should know...

1399
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,819
that Chairman Song is a man of great insight.

1400
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:28,250
I learned a lot while working under him.

1401
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:32,160
Go on, Chairman Song. Show us how it's done.

1402
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,330
Are you suggesting I present it?

1403
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:43,270
What's wrong? Don't you want to?

1404
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,460
Fine. Whatever.

1405
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,259
Then, go ahead.

1406
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:12,900
(2025 Sanin Business Plan Report)

1407
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,970
Allow me to present Sanin's business plan...

1408
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,410
for the upcoming year.

1409
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,750
(The Art of Negotiation)

1410
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,500
(Thank you for watching The Art of Negotiation.)

1411
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,500
Dr. Park, you might want to consider...

1412
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,600
blue onesies.

1413
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:01,810
Is it a boy?

1414
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,510
The dad must also be thrilled.

1415
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,720
Well...

1416
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,160
Sure.

1417
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,200
I appreciate the beef steak.

1418
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,040
Don't mention it.

1419
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:35,040
Then, is my work done?

1420
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,480
No.

1421
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:40,650
That meal wasn't for free.
