So? How are things going?

10
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,579
Well,

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,390
we will sell Sanin Construction.

12
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,990
At how much?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,559
At the current market price,

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,170
we could get up to seven billion dollars.

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,299
Nonsense.

16
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,299
We should at least get two digits.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,939
Sorry?

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,680
Sanin Construction was my first project.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,879
That being said,

20
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,780
it should get its worth.

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,219
Sir.

22
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,988
Receiving three billion dollars more than its market price...

23
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:27,989
What's wrong?

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,129
Can't you do it?

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,810
Tell me.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,819
I'll give it a shot.

27
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,090
Sure.

28
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,060
You do that.

29
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,489

That's what they're here to do.

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,829
Walk proudly with your chin up.

34

We're not here to do anything bad.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,069
Right.

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,710
As if.

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,209
Hello.

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,478
Don't panic.

Tae Soo, don't worry.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,818
I've been in the construction business for 20 years now.

43
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,250
Exactly.

After what you had to do to be in that seat?

45

48
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,069
Rather than myself being on the board,

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I'm more anxious...

50
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,400
to see you lead Sanin.

51
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,539

52
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,449

57

Yes, we're here to talk to you...

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,569

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,050
There will be a bidding,

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,818
which is why we don't know the exact amount...

64
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,719
You must have an estimate.

65
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,520
After all, you're an M and A expert.

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,090
I'm the CEO here,

67
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,430
so I know how bidding works.

68
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,459
I just...

69
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,829
want to know what you think.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,970
It'll be similar to your estimate.

71
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,240
The price will differ according to the terms,

72
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,079
and retaining all personnel is one of them.

73
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Because of that,

00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,889
the employees may have.

79
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,029

80
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,889
- Well... - What'll happen?

81
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,810
What about me?

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,578
The executives including you...

83
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,109
have a two-year contract...

84
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,180
in accordance with company bylaws.

85
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,879
Keeping the contracts valid will also be one of the terms.

86
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,379
That's not what I meant.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,949
My heart...

88
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,889
has suffered a scratch.

Won't you make up for that?

90
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,959
A compensation will be discussed internally.

91
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,100
A discussion, my foot.

92
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,939
Guarantee a five-year contract as CEO...

93
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,810
and offer me shares. That'll do.

94
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,980
Company shares and a tenure have never been part...

95
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,610
- of your contract. - That's why...

96
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm asking for it now.

97
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,648
That could hinder the process of selling Sanin Construction.

98
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,819
Well, that's not my concern.

99
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,120
Isn't that right?

100
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,328
I doubt anyone...

101
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,528
knows Sanin Construction better than you do.

102
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,560
So you know.

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
This place can't function without me.

104
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,899
Right.

105
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,398
The acquiring company...

106
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,240
will see you as the most valuable asset.

107
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,810
That's why I suggest...

108
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,809
you negotiate in person.

109
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,879
But you're the negotiator.

110
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,350
Show me what you can do.

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,250
We work for Sanin Group,

112
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
not you, CEO Lee.

113
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,660
You darn punk.

114
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,899
You psycho...

115
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,069
What?

116
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,600
Did you just call me a darn psycho?

117
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,378
You. Say that again.

118
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,439
A darn psycho?

119
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,449
He left out "darn," sir.

120
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,480
You're a funny bunch, aren't you?

121
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,620
You're more like a bunch of thugs!

122
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,689
A member of my team made a mistake.

123
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,389
You seem to be worked up,

124
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,430
so we'll come find you another time. Well, then.

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,290
What did you call me again? A darn psycho?

126
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,259
As if you could intimidate me!

127
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,860
If you lay off even one of my employees,

128
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,100
we'll have a problem!

129
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,860
Got it?

130
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,240
Mr. Yoon, I'm sorry.

131
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,779
It just came out.

132
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,920
Can you give me a minute? I need to...

133
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,518
Sure, you should...

134
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,120
I need to use the restroom.

135
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,370
Jin Soo.

136
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,369
Our goal...

137
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,139
is to sell Sanin Construction at the highest price.

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,779
To do so, we must increase its value.

139
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,779
What I'm saying...

140
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,079
is that Sanin Construction isn't our enemy...

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,820
but one we must persuade.

142
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,019
The people there know that...

143
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,820
hence the emotional response.

144
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,889
I apologize.

145
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't.

146
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,159
To be honest, I found it hard to hold back myself.

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,599
I almost punched the guy.

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,899
As if.

149
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,809
It's true.

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,940
If it weren't for Jin Soo, I would've...

151
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,349
My punches are more like a reflex.

152
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,080
Where was he sitting again? Here, right? So...

153
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,648
What was it? Right, you darn punk.

154
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,288
My fist almost shot out when I heard "punk."

155
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,220
Holding back was torture.

156
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,659
Unbelievable.

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,600
He was the first to throw an insult.

158
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,898
I'm not the only one who was improper.

159
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,928
I know.

160
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,739
So wouldn't it have been nice...

161
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,038
to have been the only ones who were insulted?

162
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,569
Since he was disrespectful,

163
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,470
we wouldn't have had to back down.

164
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,739
The employees would've been on our side as well.

165
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,610
He wouldn't have had a way out.

166
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,379
But thanks to you, this turned into an ugly fight.

167
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,509
Jin Soo.

168
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,210
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

169
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,309
Keep emotions out of your work.

170
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,249
Treat it like a game...

171
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,309
even though it's not easy.

172
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

173
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,049
M and A literally means war.

174
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,759
They even say we haven't had any big wars recently...

175
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,090
because of M and A transactions.

176
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,759
If wars are fought with weapons,

177
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,600
M and A transactions are fought with contracts.

178
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,539
Like emotionless guns and swords,

179
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,340
contracts should be without emotion.

180
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,269
Emotions...

181
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,340
will be your demise in this war.

182
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,110
Right.

183
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,379
Although, it's not a bad idea to sulk as well...

184
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,320
if who you're dealing with is being impossible.

185
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,690
Sorry?

186
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,888
That wasn't deliberate, sir.

187
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,019
But even then, it should be without emotion.

188
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,590
Emotions only cloud your view.

189
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,259
Tae Soo.

190
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,399
I played hardball like you suggested,

191
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,470
and he couldn't even squeak.

192
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,898
He must've been embarrassed...

193
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,639
because he returned alone to apologize.

194
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,379
You should've gone easy on him.

195
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,080
I went easy on him,

196
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,779
but he wet himself.

197
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,289
See? What did I tell you?

198
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,490
With tunnel vision,

199
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,860
information is distorted as you receive it.

200
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,289
That was unexpected from CEO Lee.

201
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,259
He yelled not to fire us earlier.

202
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,499
I know.

203
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,929
We always called him a bullhead,

204
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,070
but I guess that has its perks.

205
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,840
Even if you win people over emotionally,

206
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,909
you won't gain their trust.

207
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,379
Then, in any way, that negotiation will leave some kind of side effect.

208
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,220
So before you sit to negotiate,

209
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,960
leave your emotions behind.

210
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,860
Mr. Kim, did I mention this?

211
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,469
Yes?

212
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,330
The eco-friendly products by Bareun Life.

213
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm not too fond of them.

214
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,200
You must have time left on your hands...

215
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,408
to be concerning yourself with Bareun Life.

216
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,980
I was speaking for the chairman, not me.

217
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,549
What?

218
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,820
I was only trying to relay the chairman's thoughts.

219
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,919
I apologize if I offended you in any way.

220
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,219
Did the chairman say Bareun Life...

221
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,518
should cut back on products?

222
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,090
That's not what he meant.

223
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,529
You probably know about the hit list going around.

224
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,269
Yes.

225
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,450
It's good.

226
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,350
Come in.

227
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,690
Hello.

228
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,058
I'm CEO Lee Hun Min of Sanin Construction.

229
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,200
- CEO Lee, come on in. - It's all right.

230
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm here with my boys,

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
and I only dropped by to greet you.

232
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,740
- Is that so? - Yes.

233
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,638
They were walking around like dead people...

234
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,970
when they thought Yoon Joo No...

235
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,279
was going to sell us off.

236
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,509
Thanks to you reassuring us, Director Ha,

237
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,850
we're out here enjoying our team lunch.

238
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,820
This will be our treat.

239
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,349
- Please enjoy your meal. - Sure.

240
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,360
Right.

241
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,039
CEO Kim, you must be close to other subsidiary CEOs.

242
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,279
I am.

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,679
I'd love to treat you all to a meal.

244
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,879
Are you gathering us for a specific reason?

245
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,549
Not really.

246
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,990
As you know, the chairman is on the older side now.

247
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,389
I should now look out for him.

248
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,860
Yes, of course.

249
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,029
The chairman is at that age.

250
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,168
Please allow me to join you when you meet with him.

251
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,399
I'd love to treat him to a meal.

252
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,899
This isn't some book club.

253
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,499
Tell me what you want to say,

254
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,570
and I'll relay the message.

255
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,039
Then,

256
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,409
we'll cut back on our eco-friendly products.

257
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:36,909
You do that.

258
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,590
Exhale.

259
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,429
That's it. Good.

260
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,730
Dr. Park is here.

261
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,059
Right.

262
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,169
Again.

263
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,509
You are to come in.

264
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Right.

265
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,039
Goodness. I didn't expect you to be here in person today.

266
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,580
You're such a busy man...

267
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,379
that I haven't seen you in a while.

268
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,019
Right. Have a seat.

269
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,089
I almost had a heart attack...

270
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,690
thinking you were here to say I was dying.

271
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,389
Hardly, sir.

272
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,490
You only need a flu shot.

273
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,860
And this.

274
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,629
Nothing's up, right?

275
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
- Have you been taking your meds? - Yes.

276
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,840
Then a bit of exercise...

277
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,469
will keep you healthier than those under you.

278
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,340
That's creepy to hear.

279
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,389
Goodness me. She still looks so young.

280
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,360
Is she also a doctor?

281
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,590
Yes.

282
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
She's actually my daughter.

283
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:31,929
Really?

284
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,500
You did a good job raising her.

285
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,298
I don't know about anything else,

286
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,970
but my daughter is better than me at giving shots.

287
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,440
She skipped a year in high school...

288
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,210
and is in her last year as an intern.

289
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,610
All at 24.

290
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,120
Is that so?

291
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,649
Give me a painless shot, then.

292
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Right.

293
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,940
Sure. Let me hold that for you.

294
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,119
There.

295
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,549
Good.

296
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,089
What's your date of birth?

297
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,329
Here.

298
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,269
(Jungang Finance)

299
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,240
Write down your name and date of birth.

300
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,339
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Hold on.

302
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,250
Write it in Chinese characters.

303
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,589
My apologies, sir.

304
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,720
Kids these days are fluent in English but...

305
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,529
Right.

306
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,200
Same for my children too.

307
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:21,609
(Park Eun Chae)

308
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Here you go.

309
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:33,650
Park Eun Chae.

310
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,390
There seems to be something pleasant about you.

311
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,740
They say we are how we look.

312
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,269
Jin Soo, choose his best photo.

313
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,508
Leave emotions out of it.

314
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,380
Leave emotions out.

315
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,309
But this is his best shot.

316
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,679
Good morning.

317
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,220
- Morning. - Morning.

318
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,389
Jin Soo, are you done with the draft for the teaser?

319
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,420
Yes.

320
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,669
It will be hosted...

321
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,199
by Director Kang Sang Bae of Yumin Invest,

322
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,769
and Kwonyeong will provide legal assistance.

323
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,470
How much is the estimated market price?

324
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:28,940
It's 6.5 billion dollars.

325
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,609
Seven billion.

326
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,210
I said 6.5 billion dollars.

327
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,950
What about CEO Lee?

328
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,049
You know how he is.

329
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,680
How is he perceived by others?

330
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,849
I doubt it'll be any different.

331
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,989
I chose one of his best photos,

332
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,289
but maybe it needs retouching.

333
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,759
No,

334
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,130
this could work considering the nature of the business.

335
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,299
Right. There's a reason he was made CEO.

336
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,470
We'll say he takes the initiative.

337
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,339
Sure.

338
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,509
And the fundamental status?

339
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,170
The fundamental status?

340
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,079
Here you go.

341
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,609
- How is it? - It's not too bad.

342
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,450
- However... - But?

343
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,750
The profit rate has dipped recently.

344
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,318
- Why? - They've been taking...

345
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,758
on a new business model...

346
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,390
by purchasing land and reconstructing old buildings.

347
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,358
However, they're having trouble managing the risk...

348
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,859
that comes with real estate purchases.

349
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,069
Risk management?

350
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,470
Can you give me an example?

351
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:35,440
(The residents of Choongryeol supports the development project.)

352
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,609
They tried to push ahead with a redevelopment project here,

353
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,480
but it's been put on hold for several years.

354
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,979
They need consent from at least 75 percent of the residents.

355
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,049
I guess they're still not there yet.

356
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,690
How much are they short by?

357
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,960
We don't have that information.

358
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,359
Let's ask those at the construction company.

359
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,369
I feel like we might see some ghosts here.

360
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,319
Oh, sorry about that.

361
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,359
I'm Lee Jung Eum, the vice president of Sanin Construction.

362
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,460
You must be Mr. Yoon Joo No.

363
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:38,400
Yes, Mr. Lee.

364
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:40,869
- Are you here to give us a tour? - Yes.

365
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,470
I'll show you around.

366
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Be careful.

367
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,210
Everything you see...

368
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,309
could collapse at any moment.

369
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,380
I can't believe people still live here.

370
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm surprised you came here yourself.

372
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,730
Yes.

373
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,859
You could've just sent someone.

374
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,430
Well...

375
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,940
I know this place better than anyone else. That's why.

376
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,740
Despite the situation,

377
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,039
you're still struggling to obtain resident consent?

378
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,140
Well, the thing is...

379
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,710
Yes.

380
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,220
It's because I'm not doing my job well enough.

381
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,859
Anyway,

382
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,930
how much are you short by?

383
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,089
Resident consent.

384
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,700
Out of the 212 households,

385
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,299
fifty-four households haven't consented.

386
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,170
So, you just need one more household on board?

387
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,539
What?

388
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,369
Well, yes.

389
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,779
But it's hard.

390
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,180
Those who are still here have chosen to stay and hold out.

391
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,079
So, they don't actually live here.

392
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I mean...

393
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,220
most of them are in no rush,

394
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,420
so it's hard, to tell you the truth.

395
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,859
- "Most of them?" - Pardon?

396
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,089
Oh, yes.

397
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,829
There's one resident who doesn't...

398
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,869
fit into that category.

399
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,440
And that person lives here?

400
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,779
It's that unit at the very end.

401
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,509
An elderly lady lives alone there.

402
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,119
Can we talk to her?

403
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,119
Now?

404
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,269
She's probably not here now.

405
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
Hello, ma'am?

406
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,809
Are you inside?

407
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,829
(Late Payment Notice)

408
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,599
Can't we just sell it as it is?

409
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,200
I mean, it will be redeveloped eventually.

410
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,839
Whether this gets revolved or not...

411
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,009
makes a bigger difference than you think.

412
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,009
But she won't change her mind.

413
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,910
I've been trying to convince her for years but couldn't.

414
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,779
Is there a specific reason why she's so against it?

415
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,190
Honestly, I'm not sure.

416
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,359
We'll try to persuade her.

417
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,299
Get back safely, then.

418
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,869
Take care, Mr. Lee.

419
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,380
Why isn't Mr. Lee leaving?

420
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,769
The amount the chairman asked for.

421
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,809
It was ten billion dollars, right?

422
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,410
I asked Yumin Invest.

423
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,009
They said it'd be seven billion at the most.

424
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,609
I must say, the chairman is a greedy man.

425
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,519
It means he doesn't want to sell it.

426
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,889
Yoon Joo No kept saying in front of everyone that the company...

427
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,019
would go bankrupt if we didn't sell Construction.

428
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,929
The chairman couldn't interrupt him and say, "No, don't sell it."

429
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,190
Oh, you're right.

430
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,329
The chairman doesn't want to sell it.

431
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,298
It's the goose that lays the golden egg.

432
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,098
It makes no sense to sell it in this situation.

433
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,630
Yes, that's one reason.

434
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,769
The chairman started out in construction.

435
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,339
He's been wanting to build apartment complexes since he was a young man.

436
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,380
That was his dream, you know.

437
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,950
Oh, that's right.

438
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,909
So, Yoon Joo No...

439
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,650
wants to sell the chairman's dream.

440
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,848
- My gosh. - Oh, boy.

441
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,119
An old man can never forget his past.

442
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,559
How could he? That's all he has left.

443
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,929
About Construction too. It was barely staying afloat.

444
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,299
It only became number one when I bought Yonga E and C.

445
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Yes, totally.

446
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,970
That's why...

447
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,700
the chairman is so fond of you, sir.

448
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,939
Don't you think someone would tell Mr. Yoon...

449
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,440
that it's not what the chairman wants?

450
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,569
It's too late.

451
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:48,180
The moment he said we should sell Construction,

452
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,809
it was all over for him.

453
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,278
Totally. He doesn't even know that he's digging his own grave.

454
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,219
He just keeps on digging.

455
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,960
He keeps digging away like this.

456
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,289
Mr. Yoon.

457
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,329
I bet you have no idea how much I missed you.

458
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,789
I missed you too.

459
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,130
But you know,

460
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,930
ten billion dollars is simply not doable.

461
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,230
I know.

462
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,339
Then why did you tell the chairman...

463
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,970
that it was doable?

464
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,539
When the chairman was asking such a question,

465
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,640
I couldn't say we couldn't do it.

466
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,809
Besides, we could make it work.

467
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,490
We haven't met before, have we?

468
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,990
No, we haven't.

469
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,189
I'm from Yumin IB, the book runner of this deal.

470
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm Kang Sang Bae.

471
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:37,289
Oh, I see. The book runner...

472
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,130
In mergers and acquisitions,

473
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,399
it is our job to assess the companies that...

474
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,699
Forget it. Just think of us...

475
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,700
like your real estate agent when you move.

476
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,308
First off, we've reviewed everything,

477
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:52,740
and two companies grabbed our attention.

478
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,910
The first one is...

479
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Chamok Construction.

480
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,578
As a construction company,

481
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,450
their specialty is civil engineering.

482
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:02,489
They recently participated in the construction of the Nanji Bridge,

483
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,788
and they've expanded into the Middle East too.

484
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,019
But in the Middle East,

485
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,829
they thought apartment complexes were the fast-growing market.

486
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:10,890
Naturally, they tried building apartment complexes,

487
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,200
but...

488
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:13,529
it didn't go too well.

489
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,868
Civil engineering and apartment complexes are very different.

490
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,939
Of course, they're different. But the company's CEO...

491
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,239
seems very determined.

492
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,598
(Chamok Construction)

493
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,068
(CEO Cha Myung Hwan)

494
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,569
These fools at Sanin.

495
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,109
They must be very desperate now.

496
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,079
How could they think of selling Construction?

497
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,950
I think the group is struggling financially now.

498
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,519
Then ask for a big discount.

499
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,490
Sir, we'd have to bid,

500
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,959
and it's too good an opportunity to pass up. How about...

501
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,430
Yes, sir. I'll see if I can lower the price.

502
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,358
I'm almost certain that Chamok will place a bid.

503
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,868
They have to launch an apartment complex project right away,

504
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,900
so the process will be pretty easy.

505
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,399
Good.

506
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,008
But don't you think the CEO of Chamok...

507
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,410
and the CEO of Sanin Construction look alike?

508
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,808
I think he looks more like you.

509
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:02,809
I will sue you,

510
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
for real.

511
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,079
Next is Bium D and I.

512
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,519
It's a real estate firm.

513
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,088
It led the development of Songdo International City,

514
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,788
so the company has a lot of cash at the moment.

515
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:13,859
With that, they're thinking,

516
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,959
"Should we get into construction now?"

517
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,328
I think that's their situation now.

518
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,359
Recently,

519
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,329
they tried doing an M and A deal with a construction company.

520
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,970
Which one?

521
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,670
This is off the record. Ibu Construction.

522
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,740
Why did the deal fall through?

523
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Off the record.

524
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:39,249
Things got a little too heated during the negotiation process.

525
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,079
As you know, the construction industry is a bit...

526
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,919
How should I put this? It's a bit macho.

527
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,788
Many people in Bium studied overseas,

528
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,390
so I think they had a culture clash.

529
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,429
That's why the deal fell through,

530
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,788
so I'm sure Bium still wants to expand into construction.

531
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,829
And they have money.

532
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,528
We should buy it. Sanin has a good cash flow...

533
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,629
and a great brand value.

534
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,038
But we can't really use their brand.

535
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,268
If we change the company name,

536
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,239
the brand value will be affected.

537
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,470
But if we want to participate in the Yongsan Project,

538
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,980
we need a construction company.

539
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,119
But what's the CEO of Sanin Construction like?

540
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,089
Most construction companies are similar.

541
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,019
That's why I hate construction.

542
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,359
But we should do this.

543
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,970
Yes, we should.

544
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,338
(Name: Ji Yeon U)

545
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,470
This one looks good too.

546
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,140
Then what are our risks?

547
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,879
Sanin Construction's risks. As you probably know already,

548
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,479
the biggest one is the redevelopment of Choongryeol Apartments.

549
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,749
The truth is, it's kind of tricky to calculate this risk,

550
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,278
but the company has already spent...

551
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,190
They've spent 880 million dollars so far.

552
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,490
Even just from the pictures, it looks so dangerous.

553
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,258
Can you find out if there's a way to move ahead with it...

554
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,328
without the residents' consent?

555
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:59,059
Yes, I'll look into it.

556
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,358
The biggest challenge in redevelopment projects...

557
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,869
is obtaining residents' consent.

558
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,798
We need an elderly lady who lives there to sign the consent form.

559
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,170
I have no idea what her story is.

560
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
I'll meet her and talk to her.

(M and A Team)

562
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,779
Can you take this off?

563
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,289
- The elevator is here. - Pardon?

564
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,549
Okay.

565
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,118
Sure, I'll take it off. You should get going.

566
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,119
All right.

567
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,490
(M and A Team)

568
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,430
Right.

569
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,759
For a sign for the M and A Team,

570
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,529
this looks too shabby.

571
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,400

573
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,890
Well done.

574
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,890
Thank you for the great game.

575
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,769
When did you get here? You should've told me.

576
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:14,568
This is your favorite time of day.

577
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,740
I shouldn't interfere.

578
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,940
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Give me a minute.

579
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,740
Okay.

580
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,509
I learned a lot from you today.

581
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,119
My goodness. You learned from me?

582
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,920
I learned a lot from you.

583
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,849
One more soju, please.

584
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,619
The chairman said to sell it for ten billion dollars.

585
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,189
Does it mean he doesn't want to sell it?

586
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,190
Or...

587
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,000
could there be another reason? I'm just curious.

588
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,529
Well...

589
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,829
What do you think?

590
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm not sure.

591
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
I just think...

592
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:53,140
selling Construction would be the most sensible thing to do.

593
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,180
Of course, you'd say that.

594
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,750
Then you didn't come to see me...

595
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,450
because you wanted to know what the chairman was really thinking.

596
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,490
Hello.

597
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,460
We're ready to order.

598
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,160
Please convince the chairman.

599
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,539
So, you think Sanin Construction is worth seven billion dollars?

600
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:22,909
Yes.

601
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,809
I believe it'll be valued at around 6.5 billion,

602
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,079
but I think I can up it to seven billion.

603
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,680
I will try to convince him.

604
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,549
But he said "two digits" in front of everyone,

605
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,990
so seven billion won't cut it.

606
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Right.

607
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,289
But I don't think he was saying he wouldn't sell it.

608
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,730
You see, he started out as a construction site manager,

609
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,470
so he's very attached to that company.

610
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,609
He knows that keeping Construction would put the group in jeopardy,

611
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,140
but the idea of selling it makes him sad.

612
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,549
So, he wants to hold onto the card that he could use to reverse it.

613
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,950
Because he knows no one would buy it for ten billion dollars.

614
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,280
Exactly.

615
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,590
I'm not trying to pressure you,

616
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,659
but he wants to look at the price and decide.

617
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,429
Is he...

618
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,469
just attached to Sanin Construction?

619
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,599
Or the construction industry itself?

620
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,469
To earn money through hard physical work that makes you sweat.

621
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,949
I thought you went to visit the cemetery.

622
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,690
Were you out collecting cardboard?

623
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:49,659
They look heavy. How did you carry them here?

624
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
It'd be much easier if there were an elevator here.

625
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,269
I never said I wanted an elevator.

626
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:00,769
Pardon?

627
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,840
If you're here to talk about the redevelopment, leave now!

628
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,340
And don't come back!

629
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,280
No, that's not why I'm here.

630
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,010
My goodness!

631
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,980
What are you doing?

632
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,590
- I'm really sorry. - These are so valuable.

633
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,289
You punk. You're just like those thugs they hired to kick us out!

634
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,559
Hey, leave it!

635
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,789
- Go. Leave! - But...

636
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,130
You must've been flustered.

637
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,630
She rarely gets angry like that.

638
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,670
- It was my fault. - No, please don't worry.

639
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,239
Did you also come here to convince her?

640
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,250
Yes.

641
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,649
Is she getting ready for a memorial ceremony?

642
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,920
That's what those bowls were for.

643
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Were they?

644
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,230
Hey!

645
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Hey, you.

646
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,769
We should've gotten something nicer.

647
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,440
Nothing tastes better than this in Sejong.

648
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,849
- Hey, I hear Mr. Yoon is back. - Yes.

649
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,980
About apartment redevelopment projects.

650
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,920
I hear they're launching...

651
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,819
a fast-track procedure to allow them to proceed without resident consent.

652
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,860
Is it true?

653
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,489
No comment.

654
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,388
Have you no conscience?

655
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,960
Did you buy me a sandwich to ask me this?

656
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,599
"No comment?" That means it's true.

657
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,499
Can't they do it sooner if they're going to do it anyway?

658
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,940
This place looked so dangerous.

659
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,408
(Choongryeol Apartments)

660
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:48,409
This place?

661
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:56,920
This project...

662
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,960
It'll be taken care of soon. It does look dangerous.

663
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,589
Yes, no joke!

664
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,389
Should I submit the paperwork for a reassessment right away?

665
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,429
Look at you. You were quite smart when you were a prosecutor.

666
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,829
You're acting like a fool now that you're an attorney.

667
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,639
The government wants to relax the redevelopment regulations now.

668
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,969
Why do you think they're doing that?

669
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,439
"We will increase the supply of housing through redevelopment..."

670
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,510
"to bring down housing prices." That's what they're doing.

671
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,349
Increasing the supply. Who doesn't know that?

672
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:26,448
Right. If the government relaxes such regulations,

673
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,419
it must produce some results.

674
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,349
But they haven't even passed the bill yet.

675
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,460
You think a mere civil servant can do this before that?

676
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,690
Right, so you can't help me before that.

677
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,959
The redevelopment should take place after they pass the bill...

678
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,230
for it to count as its result.

679
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,929
That's right, you fool.

680
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,038
I knew all about it too.

681
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,340
Then why did you come here?

682
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,440
To have a sandwich.

683
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,940
- Stop. - What?

684
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,679
I said, stop.

685
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,150
- You fool. - Stop!

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,750

Let's dig in.

00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:20,059
Hey, you need to take action and show them you won't sit idly by.

701
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,030
Only then will he get scared and hand over something.

702
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,699
It's not like someone will help you if you sit idly by.

703

You're right.

704
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:30,469
But he won't report me for this, right?

Hey, whatever you do,

706
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,349
he can't report you, ever.

Trust me.

Hi. Good...

Didn't I tell you to take this down?

00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,059
What?

716
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,529
I thought you meant it looked out of style...

717
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,730
and had it replaced.

00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,269
How much can I expect?

735
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,070
The market forecasts...

736
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,400
seven billion dollars.

737
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,670
See that?

738
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,579
Then I won't sell it.

739
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:25,349
Right.

740
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,250
(Bidding Box)

741
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:35,619
(Sanin Construction Auction Room)

742
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,699
Which company do you hope will win the bid, Mr. Yoon?

743
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,269
One who will pay the most.

744
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,809
Chamok must be after it more, no?

745
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,679
Civil engineering alone is lacking...

746
00:42:57,849 --> 00:42:59,279
momentum.

747
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,649
Workers of Sanin Construction will find it easy...

748
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,289
to adjust to Chamok.

749
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,750
That's the best scenario.

750
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,960
Is it fun?

751
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:10,389
This?

752
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,530
Yes.

753
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,369
Good grief. We're expecting a guest today,

754
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,940
but Jin Soo looks extremely gloomy.

755
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

756
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,079
How about we have him on guard duty?

757
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,750
Shall we?

758
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,210
"Guard duty?"

759
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:33,920
Jin Soo.

760
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,719
Have some coffee at the coffee shop in the lobby.

761
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,199
(Bium D and I)

762
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,880
Ms. Kwak. People from Bium D and I are here.

763
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,178
The CEO herself is here...

764
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,320
at the coffee shop.

765
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:13,289
I see. Chamok hasn't arrived yet, right?

766
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
No.

767
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,199
Keep drinking your coffee.

768
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,530
What?

769
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,630
Okay.

(Chamok Construction CFO Introduction)

771
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:36,650
Hi.

772
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,679
You're from Sanin, yes?

773
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,849
What? Well...

774
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,690
No, I'm not.

775
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,849
We've done our research as well.

776
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,760
Billions of dollars are on the line.

777
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,889
Memorizing the M and A Team's faces is a must.

778
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,860
I see.

779
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,699
We're in your care.

780
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,230
No, we...

781
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,768
Our team manager wishes Chamok would take over.

782
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,539
Gosh, thank you.

783
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,469
Then how much will it be?

784
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,110
Sorry?

785
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,738
There's not much time left.

786
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,309
Just be frank with us.

787
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,909
How much do you predict?

788
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,779
The market evaluated it for 6.5 billion dollars.

789
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,448
Around eight billion dollars.

790
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,489
Eight...

791
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,789
Come on.

792
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,719
What a crook.

793
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,190
Let's talk man to man.

794
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
How much is it?

795
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,969
It's an auction. I can't disclose something like that.

796
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,139
(Bid Proposal)

797
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,780
(Bid Proposal)

798
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,219
Excuse me first.

799
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:53,219
I must go and submit this.

800
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:56,760
All right. Thank you.

801
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,960
The redevelopment issue is a favorable factor.

802
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,300
Isn't eight billion also possible?

803
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,869
But there's a risk with Choongryeol Apartments.

804
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,150
It won't be a problem if that settles.

805
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:22,219
The government is unlikely to approve...

806
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,719
until the bill passes.

807
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,760
I also paid the elderly woman a visit.

808
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,590
But I only got scolded.

809
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,429
The elderly woman must be scary.

810
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,070
That's not it.

811
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,239
I dropped the sacrificial food.

812
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,139
Helping her out got me scolded.

813
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,710
Yes, Jin Soo?

814
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,710
All right.

815
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,849
The CEO of Bium is heading up here.

816
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,690
What a relief.

817
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,219
I'm leaving for the day first.

818
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,650
Is it Team Manager Yoon Joo No?

819
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,159
Hi. You must be CEO Ji Yeon U.

820
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,329
Yes.

821
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,659
Sanin Construction is quite popular.

822
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:44,170
Yes, and it's all thanks to you.

823
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,670
I'd like to buy it...

824
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,670
at a cheap price.

825
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:51,210
But we must sell it at a high price.

826
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,510
By the way, why are you selling Construction?

827
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,078
Isn't Construction Sanin's cash flow?

828
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,079
Yes, it is.

829
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,919
It's Sanin's engine.

830
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
Exactly.

831
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,388
So why are you selling the profit center?

832
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:10,328
I'll answer that if you bid for the highest price...

833
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:11,389
and win the auction.

834
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,130
We have yet to write the price on our bid proposal.

835
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,199
Seven billion dollars.

836
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,269
Will that do?

837
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,480
It's not impossible.

838
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,449
Ms. Ji.

839
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,590
I heard you tried to take over a construction company before.

840
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,989
Yes, but it didn't work out.

841
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:43,360
Why didn't it back then?

842
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,960
Back then...

843
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,629
I must've written a low price.

844
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,269
What was the difference?

845
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,099
From the price you wanted.

846
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,909
It was quite big. About one billion dollars.

847
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,110
Wouldn't it be bad for Bium to lose Sanin Construction?

848
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,849
It's rare for a construction company to be up for auction.

849
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,550
The government will soon amend the redevelopment law.

850
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:11,889
If so,

851
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,158
you might have to consider...

852
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,590
selling Construction.

853
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,929
So,

854
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,059
how much?

855
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,300
Sanin Construction...

856
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,069
is much more valuable than the company...

857
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,599
you couldn't buy.

858
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,099
That's why...

859
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,309
I hope you'll buy it.

860
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,349
Truthfully,

861
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,980
I didn't like the CEO of that company.

862
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,750
What about yours?

863
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,489
Is your CEO likable?

864
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,159
No. He's worse.

865
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,869
- How honest of you. - Yes.

866
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,038
But the company...

867
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,539
will do you good, Ms. Ji.

868
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,510
How so? You said the CEO wasn't nice.

869
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:06,940
If you take over,

870
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,110
my job will go as far as transforming the company...

871
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,250
to your liking.

872
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,650
And so, we ask that you factor that...

873
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:18,989
into the price.

874
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:56,360
(Bid Proposal, 7.5 billion dollars)

875
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
Wait.

876
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,449
Bid with this one.

877
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,789
How did you know?

878
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,589
On the documents, the contract is under the grandfather's name.

879
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,719
But he has passed away.

880
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,928
But the two weren't legally married,

881
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,559
which I found strange.

882
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,429
Legally, the grandmother has no rights to it.

883
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,070
I doubt you didn't know about it.

884
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:15,639
My apologies.

885
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,408
When we first met,

886
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,010
you visited his grave. Yes?

887
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:20,309
Yes.

888
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,940
How did you know that?

889
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,980
There was dirt on your shoes.

890
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,349
Was that all it took to notice that?

891
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,559
You already knew the grandmother wouldn't be at her place.

892
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,730
Did the grandmother oppose the redevelopment to protect...

893
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,769
the grandfather's grave?

894
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,369
Yes.

895
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,170
When Grandfather was alive,

896
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,780
Grandmother wanted to move.

897
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,079
But Grandfather was against it.

898
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,420
Opposition rallies...

899
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,489
led to physical confrontations.

900
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,320
That was how Grandfather passed away.

901
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,389
Were you there when it happened?

902
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,199
I was.

903
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,070
Did the physical altercations escalate to the point of fatalities?

904
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,269
You see...

905
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,110
The stories vary.

906
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,909
But Grandfather was already poor in health.

907
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,079
Hence why...

908
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,250
no compensation was given.

909
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:37,619
I see.

910
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:39,820
Apparently, Grandfather was against...

911
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,119
the redevelopment...

912
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,329
as he wanted to receive a great sum of money for Grandmother.

913
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,099
- But... - You found out...

914
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,699
the two weren't legally married.

915
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,699
Correct.

916
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:58,610
And you didn't report it.

917
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,610
If I do,

918
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,949
Grandmother would be kicked out.

919
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,719
They're legally strangers.

920
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,570
When Grandmother passes away,

921
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,670
will she want to be rested next to him?

922
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,369
Yes.

923
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:31,369
That's what she says every day.

924
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:41,849
Shall we wrap it up now?

925
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:44,889
We seem done.

926
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,260
Okay.

927
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,130
I'm nervous.

928
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,960
I have a hunch. Seven billion dollars.

929
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Come on.

930
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,349
Chamok?

931
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,980
Yes.

932
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:19,550
(Bid Proposal, 6.9 billion dollars)

933
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,989
- How much? - It's six...

934
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,630
point nine billion dollars.

935
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,230
That is still a great price.

936
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,170
It's...

937
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,670
a little bit short.

938
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,570
Bium D and I...

939
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,909
What? What is it?

940
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:44,079
Is it really seven billion dollars?

941
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,380
Seven...

942
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:48,780
point 9,999 billion dollars.

943
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,840
Please excuse me.

944
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:10,739
Yes, Min Jeong?

945
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,539
Great.

946
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,250
Got it.

947
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,530
Director Lee.

948
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,659
It's a little over 7.9 billion dollars.

949
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,329
Good job.

950
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,829
It'd be great if the chairman learned how to play go.

951
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,739
For two months, Bium has the exclusive right...

952
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,539
to request data from us.

953
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
We must provide the requested data,

954
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,079
and if there are no notable issues with it,

955
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,550
Bium must pay 7.999 billion dollars...

956
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,050
under the contract.

957
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,050
What if there's a notable issue?

958
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:32,449
- Can they cut the price? - Yes.

959
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,159
If both parties have a compelling reason,

960
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,888
the price can change.

961
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:40,199
(Sanin)

962
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,230
You will now answer all my questions, yes?

963
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,369
I won't lie.

964
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:47,099
Okay.

965
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,739
How old are you, Mr. Yoon?

966
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:54,980
That is not relevant to the contract.

967
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:58,780
That until the very end?

968
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,719
We'd like a board meeting first.

969
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,559
Let's do that.

970
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:10,159
(Sanin Construction)

971
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,170
Sanin Construction.

972
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,440
How do you see the future of it?

973
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,269
It’s the best.

974
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,179
Apartment brands are like a social class in Korea.

975
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:31,710
Sanin Construction is at the top.

976
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,849
No matter how bad the recession gets, luxury items sell better.

977
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,289
Likewise, Sanin Construction will continue to do well.

978
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:40,619
I can assure you of it.

979
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,659
But once we take over, we won't use the name Sanin.

980
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,360
Won't that depreciate the brand value?

981
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,659
What?

982
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,769
I made Sanin Construction number one.

983
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:54,840
I have confidence in Bium too.

984
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,269
I see.

985
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,179
(No insight)

986
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,880
There isn't much land left in Seoul to build apartments.

987
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,280
And the population is decreasing in the provinces.

988
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,880
What's your opinion on this?

989
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,250
Haven't you heard of reconstruction?

990
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,218
To proceed with reconstructions...

991
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,059
You don't have to disclose such information.

992
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,900
Redevelopment details are quite confidential.

993
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,460
I see.

994
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,800
But we'll soon find out, won't we?

995
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,730
Yes.

996
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,069
By the way, you've gotten much stronger.

997
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,070
What?

998
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,610
Is that so?

999
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:35,079
But I don't think so.

1000
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,079
But we didn't take a single break coming up here.

1001
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,320
Come sit.

1002
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
You're right.

1003
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:47,219
- Gosh. - Good grief.

1004
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,929
If you've caught your breath,

1005
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,159
tell me what it's about.

1006
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,170
What?

1007
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,400
You asked to go hiking together for the first time.

1008
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:03,500
That means you've got something to tell me.

1009
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,179
You see...

1010
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,010
Sell Sanin Construction?

1011
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,889
Yes.

1012
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,260
I...

1013
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,130
started off with building apartments.

1014
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,400
Back then,

1015
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,570
I worked my butt off.

1016
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,539
But thinking of selling it...

1017
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,210
makes me wonder what I've done wrong.

1018
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:47,550
Goodness. I can't get a wink of sleep.

1019
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,650
You didn't do anything wrong, Chairman Song.

1020
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,130
How much did they bid for?

1021
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:01,829
One hundred thousand...

1022
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,199
short of eight billion dollars.

1023
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:05,599
Ask for more.

1024
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,840
Even if it can't go over ten,

1025
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,909
it should be over nine billion dollars.

1026
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,539
We'll tell them to keep trying until the last moment.

1027
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,409
Yes.

1028
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,550
Get them to pay more.

1029
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,420
Hello.

1030
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:30,119
I'm Lee Hun Min, the CEO of Sanin Construction.

1031
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,489
I see.

1032
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,559
What brings you here?

1033
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,570
We'll be seeing each other a lot from now on.

1034
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,768
I've come to introduce myself...

1035
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:44,210
in anticipation of our future partnership.

1036
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,110
This is one of the projects from Sanin Construction...

1037
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,659
You've reached the M and A Team of Sanin Group.

1038
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,130
Yes, Mr. CFO.

1039
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:11,969
I see.

1040
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:15,139
Okay.

1041
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:21,839
Yes. I understand. Then...

1042
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,479
as for the deadline,

1043
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,079
I'll call you back after I report it to Mr. Yoon.

1044
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,150
Bye.

1045
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,888
That was CFO of Bium D and I on the phone.

1046
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:36,360
He wants to learn about future redevelopment projects.

1047
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,630
We already handed over the files.

1048
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:39,888
Right. But he wants more information about them.

1049
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,199
So he requested a meeting.

1050
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,199
This has to do with Choongryeol Apartments, right?

1051
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,530
I'm not sure.

1052
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,030
Mr. Yoon.

1053
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,199
We have a bit of a problem.

1054
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,159
The contract looks precise.

1055
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,489
And so is your reputation, Mr. Yoon. I know we can trust you.

1056
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
But...

1057
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:15,500
we do have some concerns.

1058
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,369
Sure. What are your concerns?

1059
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,170
We're concerned about the progress of redevelopment projects.

1060
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,768
Redevelopment projects have a complicated approval process...

1061
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,738
and usually take a long time.

1062
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:29,239
We know that better than anyone.

1063
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,949
We're in real estate.

1064
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:32,610
Right.

1065
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,218
There are attempts from the government,

1066
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,549
trying to ease redevelopment regulations.

1067
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,819
There are attempts,

1068
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,089
but it hasn't happened yet.

1069
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,389
Right. But it will happen.

1070
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:46,030
Can you guarantee it?

1071
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,760
A 100-percent guarantee?

1072
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,329
Not 100 percent.

1073
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:53,529
For Sanin Construction, the redevelopment project...

1074
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,369
of Choongryeol Apartments is the hardest case.

1075
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,110
That's why I wanted this meeting.

1076
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:02,079
On paper, it seemed the project could launch anytime.

1077
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,349
But it might not have been the case in real life.

1078
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:11,888
It will be difficult to start immediately...

1079
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,089
as there's an issue with the consent of residents.

1080
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,320
That is why we believe it is more realistic to wait...

1081
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,959
until the regulations are eased.

1082
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,030
Then...

1083
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,960
give us a discount.

1084
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,828
We have to take the risk that the government...

1085
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:25,329
may not ease the regulations.

1086
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:30,539
How much are you thinking?

1087
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,869
We're thinking 440 million dollars.

1088
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,909
And interest will be added to that.

1089
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:37,809
That is too much.

1090
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,619
What's the amount that's already been executed?

1091
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,320
It's 880 million dollars.

1092
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,348
The chance of the redevelopment project getting approved...

1093
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:45,849
is 50-50?

1094
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,219
It's much higher than 50 percent.

1095
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,489
Half of 880 million dollars is 440 million dollars.

1096
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,800
If we add 20 percent of that for the risk we have to take...

1097
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
How much is that?

1098
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,670
It's 528 million dollars.

1099
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,010
Then will the final price be around 7.4 billion dollars?

1100
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,280
I mean, the purchase price.

1101
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:09,940
It's 7.4719 billion dollars, to be precise.

1102
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,880
So you evaluated the price of the risk...

1103
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,320
as 528 million dollars, correct?

1104
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,219
Yes.

1105
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:20,960
I see. I understand.

1106
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,059
That was easy.

1107
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,529
Then I'll understand that you agreed to reducing the price...

1108
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,099
by 530 million dollars...

1109
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:33,769
and get going.

1110
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:37,239
Ms. Ji.

1111
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:40,570
What if we were to eliminate this risk?

1112
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:44,050
Will you pay an additional 530 million dollars?

1113
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,510
No.

1114
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,250
The redevelopment project getting approved was the default.

1115
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,819
But we don't know when that will happen,

1116
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,118
so I asked to lower the price.

1117
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,158
Then you agree that the project will be approved...

1118
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,288
at some point, correct?

1119
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,289
Yes,

1120
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,460
I do.

1121
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,530
The problem is that we don't know when it will happen.

1122
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,969
I am simply stating that Sanin should bear the interest...

1123
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,969
on the expenses already incurred,

1124
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,670
the costs for the relevant personnel,

1125
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,309
and the cost of uncertainty...

1126
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,539
regarding government regulations.

1127
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:14,980
I see. I understand now.

1128
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,250
So the risk isn't about the project not going through.

1129
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,780
The problem is how fast the project will be approved.

1130
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,380
Is that correct?

1131
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,250
Yes. That's correct.

1132
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,760
But will clarifying that change anything?

1133
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,800
Why are you smiling at me?

1134
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,099
A professional agency...

1135
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,610
will make it look exactly like this photo.

1136
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,150
Right here.

1137
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:56,980
This is...

1138
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,090
your husband's hometown, isn't it?

1139
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,090
It is.

1140
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,329
That's where we met too.

1141
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:05,659
I know that.

1142
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,599
That's how we found this place.

1143
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,769
As you can see in the photo,

1144
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:14,170
there's enough space. Later...

1145
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,880
Once I'm gone,

1146
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,150
can I be buried next to him?

1147
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,380
I'll see to it myself...

1148
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,250
Ma'am.

1149
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:34,559
You trust me, don't you?

1150
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,090
You want me to trust you again?

1151
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,729
If we were to get the project...

1152
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,530
approved before the acquisition is finalized,

1153
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:47,269
will you recognize our performance worthy of 530 million dollars...

1154
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:48,969
which you deemed the price of the risk?

1155
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,109
That was already included...

1156
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,170
I will...

1157
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:56,280
recognize it as so.

1158
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,179
But by when will you get the approval?

1159
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:04,150
I plan to finish my due diligence by today.

1160
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,800
By today.

1161
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:20,398
We now have consent from 75 percent of the residents.

1162
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,939
Then did you get me to agree to this deal...

1163
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,470
after getting their consent?

1164
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:25,739
No.

1165
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,510
We got the last consent form just now.

1166
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,439
The vice president tried his best.

1167
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:46,560
Mr. Yoon.

1168
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,869
You're not going to make us pay the whole amount, right?

1169
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,800
The entire 528 million dollars.

1170
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,439
It was 530 million dollars.

1171
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,939
I'm investing my own money to acquire the company.

1172
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,810
But aren't you just an employee?

1173
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,209
Why are you making it tough on me?

1174
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,880
I have to save our company.

1175
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:09,979
Ms. Ji.

1176
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,119
You asked me why we were selling Sanin Construction the other day.

1177
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:18,430
Yes. I did. And?

1178
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:20,289
I believe we must sell...

1179
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,029
the best bit for Sanin Group to survive.

1180
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,630
That is why...

1181
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,699
you're walking away with the best part.

1182
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,970
So...

1183
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,750
will you make us pay the entire amount?

1184
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,920
Could I talk to Ms. Ji in private for a moment?

1185
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:46,520
He's been trying.

1186
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,630
But it seems he can't get it up to nine billion dollars.

1187
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,800
So it's at 8.5 billion dollars?

1188
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Yes.

1189
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,470
I guess that's the figure they're trying to finalize.

1190
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:04,939
I see.

1191
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,310
You know,

1192
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,180
Sanin Construction was our first baby.

1193
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,189
I hope our first baby has a good future with them.

1194
01:10:20,689 --> 01:10:21,689
Right?

1195
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:22,689
Mr. Yoon.

1196
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,930
You won't make us pay 8.5299 billion dollars,

1197
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,800
will you?

1198
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,399
Buy a burial lot, and we'll give you a 29.9-million-dollar discount.

1199
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:36,399
It will work in your favor as well.

1200
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,869
What do you mean?

1201
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,739
A burial lot?

1202
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:43,978
Bium D and I acquired Sanin Construction.

1203
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:46,310
It was the biggest acquisition of the year.

1204
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:48,249
Through this acquisition, Bium D and I...

1205
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:51,220
plans to dive into apartment construction with full force.

1206
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,389
We also have one more story about Bium D and I.

1207
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:55,819
Yes, it's a touching story.

1208
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:58,158
The redevelopment project managed by Sanin Construction...

1209
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,358
hit a wall.

1210
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:02,000
Bium D and I sorted it out while acquiring the company.

1211
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,729
What was the problem?

1212
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:07,430
There was a grave on the hill behind the apartment.

1213
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,898
The resident was an old lady.

1214
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,970
It was her husband's grave.

1215
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,368
It was illegal, wasn't it?

1216
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,510
Yes. They weren't legally married.

1217
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,148
Her right in the redevelopment project...

1218
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,579
could have been revoked too.

1219
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,078
The land belonged to Sanin Construction.

1220
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:24,250
It now belongs to Bium D and I.

1221
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:25,719
Then what happened?

1222
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,148
However, Bium D and I...

1223
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,659
moved her husband's grave to his hometown.

1224
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,788
They also acknowledged her right in the redevelopment project.

1225
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,630
That's how their project moved forward.

1226
01:11:35,329 --> 01:11:38,000
Mergers and acquisitions are known as wars without weapons.

1227
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:40,328
That's a heartwarming story from a battlefield.

1228
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,500
Yes. It's my first time encountering...

1229
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,810
such a touching story while presenting news on economy.

1230
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,409
Let's watch an interview with the CEO of Bium D and I.

1231
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,778
The motto of our company, Bium D and I,

1232
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,850
is to create a place for people...

1233
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,419
where they can be happy,

1234
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,419
rather than just building fancy apartments.

1235
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,849
(CEO Ji Yeon U)

1236
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,249
We will strive to become...

1237
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,589
a construction company...

1238
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,089
that builds shelters for people...

1239
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,560
and leads our housing environment into a better future.

1240
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:16,170
I haven't been here in ages. Now, it brings back old memories.

1241
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:18,970
Be a bit more patient.

1242
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,579
I'll be there soon.

1243
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,449
You know what?

1244
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:29,649
To get you a nice spot like this,

1245
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,890
I had to go through a lot.

1246
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,260
So when we meet again,

1247
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,029
you'd better adore me.

1248
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,619
Thank you.

1249
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,519
We thank you for joining us to celebrate...

1250
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,589
the closing of the acquisition...

1251
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,189
between Sanin Construction and Bium D and I.

1252
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,399
I'm especially curious to hear...

1253
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,299
from Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo...

1254
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,600
as he put so much effort into this contract.

1255
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,699
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

1258
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,680
Thank you.

1259
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,818
Up until now, Sanin Construction has been...

1260
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:41,289
the best construction company in Korea.

1261
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:45,430
Now, I have no doubt that it will be the best in the world.

1262
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:47,059
And...

1263
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,060
Yes. Thank you.

1264
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,000
As I had complete faith in that,

1265
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,399
I was able to successfully lead this acquisition.

1266
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:57,439
- He was against it. - Right.

1267
01:13:57,869 --> 01:14:01,709
Someone else made a huge contribution to the acquisition.

1268
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,909
But I shamelessly gave my speech first.

1269
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,309
I'm not usually this shameless.

1270
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,310

Thank you for selling us a great company.

1278
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,210
We'll work hard to grow it into a better company.

1279
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,050
Please give her a round of applause.

1280
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,079
Thank you.

1281
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:46,719
- Let's enjoy some refreshments... - This isn't right.

1282
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,019
- as you freely mingle... - He did all the work.

1283
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,288
- around the room. - What's that expression?

1284
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:51,118
- You know what I mean, right? - Please enjoy...

1285
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,329
- your time. - Let's just enjoy some good food.

1286
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:54,659
Okay.

1287
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,039
Mr. Yoon.

1288
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,239
I believe you're incredible.

1289
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:07,939
And the extra 500 million dollars in the end...

1290
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,350
How did you manage that?

1291
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,050
I was lucky.

1292
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,720
Sorry?

1293
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,720
I thought you just played smart.

1294
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:21,390
Negotiation doesn't go well just because you're smart.

1295
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,060
It's luck.

1296
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,140
There's my torturer.

1297
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,939
Congratulations, Ms. Ji.

1298
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,939
Best of luck to your venture with the apartment construction.

1299
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:43,109
Thanks.

1300
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,710
If you decide to leave Sanin Group,

1301
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:48,649
join us.

1302
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:51,989
We'll see.

1303
01:15:58,829 --> 01:15:59,829
Mr. Lee.

1304
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,899
I should introduce you to the CEO of my construction company.

1305
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,159
Right here.

1306
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:05,930
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1307
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:07,569
Hello.

1308
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:09,539
So you're the CEO now.

1309
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:13,670
I heard you recommended me.

1310
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:15,739
I did?

1311
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:24,789
It's the chairman.

1312
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,020
Hey.

1313
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,358
My gosh. Nice to meet you.

1314
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:35,430
- Hello. - Yes.

1315
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,229
Sanin Construction...

1316
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:42,039
was the one I cherished the most.

1317
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:43,340
Please take good care of it.

1318
01:16:43,539 --> 01:16:44,738
Yes, sir.

1319
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:46,609
I'll grow it the best I can too.

1320
01:16:46,909 --> 01:16:47,939
Good luck.

1321
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:50,510
- I'll let you guys talk. - Okay.

1322
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,050
Hey.

1323
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:57,720
All right then.

1324
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,750
Good work.

1325
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:01,289
Please don't mention it.

1326
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,760
I heard you were quite attached to Sanin Construction.

1327
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,999
Right. That's why I told him...

1328
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,398
we needed to get at least ten billion dollars.

1329
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:10,459
But good grief.

1330
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,100
Director Lee kept on pushing me to take the deal.

1331
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:15,399
I see.

1332
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,369
Thank you for approving the acquisition.

1333
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Sure.

1334
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,079
Then is this all?

1335
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,140
We need more money.

1336
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,479
Well, that can't be much. Right?

1337
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,949
It's about 2.5 billion dollars.

1338
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:45,899
Then...

1339
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:49,939
what else...

1340
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:52,439
are you going to sell?

1341
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,840
This time,

1342
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:56,680
I'll buy.

1343
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:01,850
Look.

1344
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:04,719
You sold off Sanin Construction.

1345
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,850
Now,

1346
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:08,020
you want to buy something else?

1347
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:10,159
Yes.

1348
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,289
I will.

1349
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:24,170
Mr. Yoon will buy this time.

1350
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:27,340
- Which company? - A gaming company.

1351
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,640
A gaming company?

1352
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,210
That will be fun at least, right?

1353
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,710
Yes. Totally.

1354
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:38,989
Jin Soo.

1355
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:41,689
Eat a lot.

1356
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,189
No. I wasn't much help.

1357
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,689
You did well. You did a nice job standing guard.

1358
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:49,229
Right.

1359
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:52,329
I was lucky.

1360
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,270
What?

1361
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,239
Working hard doesn't mean it will get me results.

1362
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:57,970
It was luck.

1363
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,369
What's he talking about?

1364
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:19,590
My goodness. So I heard you scored a big one.

1365
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,800
Yes, I closed the deal today.

1366
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:23,659
That's impressive.

1367
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,470
Did you really sell it for 8.5 billion dollars?

1368
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:28,770
I hear things are going well for Samoel Fund too.

1369
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:31,640
Gosh, we mostly make profits for other people.

1370
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,340
Actually,

1371
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:37,439
there was something I wanted to discuss in person.

1372
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,350
About what?

1373
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:42,220
Yoon Joo No.

1374
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:43,979
I see.

1375
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,720
Let's talk more in person.

1376
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:49,090
What favor?

1377
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,619
Jumbo Pharmaceuticals.

1378
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,390
That's...

1379
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,329
Just forget about it.

1380
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,600
Isn't that what the deceased wanted?

1381
01:19:59,029 --> 01:20:00,329
Let's put it behind us and move on.

1382
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:02,239
I want to,

1383
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,670
but I'm struggling with it.

1384
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:08,640
What do you need?

1385
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:12,609
A strategy.

1386
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:25,289
(The Art of Negotiation)

1387
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:58,630
Director Lee wanted to do this a long time ago.

1388
01:20:58,689 --> 01:20:59,960
Isn't it too late?

1389
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,000
This is the right time and the last window.

1390
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:03,800
You think the distribution sector is a joke?

1391
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:06,369
You want to make Delivery King a reality?

1392
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,699
My gosh, that's hilarious.

1393
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,970
It will be a revolution of the distribution sector.

1394
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,809
If we make a platform with it, I have to shut down the game, right?

1395
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:13,810
I won't sell it to you.

1396
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:15,779
This will be the end of Yoon Joo No.

1397
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,909
Did you share this?

1398
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,180
Yes.

1399
01:21:19,181 --> 01:21:20,609
I hope it doesn't fail like it did before.

1400
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,648
Ten million dollars.

1401
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:25,619
Do Han Chul and Yoon Joo No are both con artists.

1402
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,220
We should take it this time. So this was Yoon Joo No's idea?

1403
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:30,060
He'd do anything to get what he wants.
