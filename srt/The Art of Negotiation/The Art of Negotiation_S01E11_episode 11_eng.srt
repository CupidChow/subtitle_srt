♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

11

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,530
Oh Wun, one moment.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,240
I'm off to school.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,420
Could you wait just a bit?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,150
It's okay. I'm not hungry. I'll just be going.

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,490
Just wait one moment, please?

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,600
If you don't take this, we'll have leftovers.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,330
There's nobody to eat it.

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,120
 Hello? 

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,390
Hello? Is this Oh Wun?

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,930
Oh Wun...

22
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,930
Could you put Anna on the line?

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,740
 Yes, Ju No. 

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,820
How did you know it was me?

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,510
 You always call at this hour. 

26
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,190
I guess so.

27
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,240
Oh Wun still doesn't speak to me.

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,350
 At least she picks up your calls. 

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,420
That's a relief.

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,320
 That is a relief. 

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,010
 You didn't call yourself daddy, right? 

32
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,200
No, I didn't.

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,820
 Okay. How's work? 

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,270
It's going well.

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm almost done.

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,670
 Is it going how you wanted it to? 

37
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,150
Yes.

38
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,400
You don't have to worry.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,790
 Okay. 

40
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,940
 Still, be careful. 

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,160
Okay.

42
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,450
   

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,800
 So Yun Ju Seok was M&amp;A Team Leader Yun Ju No's older brother? 

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,350
 But they discovered he bought Jumbo's stocks, 

45
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,920
 and he was investigated by prosecutors? 

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,170
 Yes. And Mr. Yun was handling Jumbo Pharma. 

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,910
 But why did they just let him go? 

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,040
 His older brother died. 

49
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,910
 Oh, right. He committed suicide, right? 

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,680
 Yun Ju No's life is full of misfortunes. 

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
  ­ 

52
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,600
Now, it's his turn.

53
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,670
There's also this.

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,470
   

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,810
   

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,220
   

57
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,620
This was Mr. Yun's report

58
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,850
when investing in Jumbo Pharma.

59
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,820
Gosh, was this also submitted as a complaint?

60
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,630
No, I got it from the Strategic Planning Office.

61
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,820
Not from the M&amp;A Team Office?

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,990
That's right.

63
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,990
We didn't find much there.

64
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,460
During the Jumbo case, Mr. Ha was

65
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,170
the head of M&amp;A Team,

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,520
and Mr. Yun reported directly to him.

67
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,300
Yes.

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,060
That's why.

69
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,500
I didn't know Yun Ju No was such a bad guy.

70
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,690
Gosh, seriously.

71
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,980
To think I said we should bring him to our side...

72
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,150
Our?

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,980
Pardon?

74
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,290
Weren't you trying to switch sides?

75
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,350
Mr. Ha, why are you saying this?

76
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,360
You said I should get along better with Mr. Yun!

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,640
Yes.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,570
No. When did I say that?

79
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,700
I said, "How about you get along better with Mr. Yun?"

80
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,360
Forget it.

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,290
No, no. You shouldn't misunderstand me.

82
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,470
Mr. Ha, I was really only asking you

83
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,890
for permission to bring Yun Ju No

84
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,800
to our side. I wasn't...

85
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,180
What did you think I meant?

86
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,830
Gosh, forget it.

87
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,310
I mean, you still don't believe me.

88
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,390
Gosh, seriously.

89
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,390
What must I do to make you believe me?

90
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,650
Should I go and grab Mr. Yun by the collar?

91
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,080
Or should I get on my knees here?

92
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,290
Forget it! Just forget it.

93
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,740
Let's just drink and forget about it.

94
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,040
Mr. Ha, this isn't something to just forget about.

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,710
Just clink glasses with me. Then I'll believe you.

96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,890
I told you so many times to watch out for Mr. Yun.

97
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,420
I know.

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,140
When I saw the complaint, I was so shocked.

99
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,940
Complaint?

100
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,010
Oh, I guess I didn't tell you yet.

101
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,260
A complaint came in anonymously to the Audit Office.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
   

103
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,830
What's going on?

104
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,360
Isn't this illegal?

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,990
No.

106
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,980
A company has

107
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,130
its own law called the Articles of Incorporation.

108
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,200
Still, the laptop and documents are Mr. Yun's.

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,410
They can't just take it.

110
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,940
They all belong to the company.

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,520
If a corruption issue arises in a company,

112
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,590
they can confiscate it.

113
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,770
   

114
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,850
   

115
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,950
Jumbo?

116
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,060
It should've gone to Yun Ju No,

117
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,690
but it went to the Audit Office instead.

118
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,000
Gosh, this jerk.

119
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,460
He came back to hide this.

120
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,960
Oh, that's why...

121
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,740
What's wrong?

122
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,670
This is an audit implementation notice.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,970
What's the reason for it?

124
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,860
For stock trading using undisclosed information.

125
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,630
   

126
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,130
   

127
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,550
They're saying...

128
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,970
I was involved in a scheme.

129
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,350
Pardon?

130
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,070
Mr. Yun,

131
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,100
i-it's not true, right?

132
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,180
But this is clearer evidence

133
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,480
than fingerprints on a murder weapon.

134
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Gosh, this guy.

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,280
He wasn't like this in the past.

136
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,150
When he used to work under you, Mr. Ha?

137
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,170
Indeed.

138
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,900
When you start handling big money,

139
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,480
you become desensitized. I get that.

140
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,460
I guess so.

141
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,910
There are many temptations when you work in M&amp;A, right?

142
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,620
There are.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,490
Did you experience it, too, Mr. Ha?

144
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,520
Of course I did.

145
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,750
I experienced it one time.

146
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,070
It was so long ago that I don't remember it well.

147
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,470
 A man who wanted an investment came to my house. 

148
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,190
 - To your house? 
 - Yes. 

149
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,430
 Well, not into my home but in front of my place. 

150
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,360
 Still, I guess he must've been quite desperate. 

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,210
 I think so. 

152
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,460
   

153
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,500
   

154
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,100
   

155
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,980
We're currently preparing for Phase 3,

156
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,790
but we're a bit desperate for funds.

157
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm 99% sure Phase 3 will pass.

158
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,280
You don't have to worry about that.

159
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,630
Once this drug is released, it will change the world.

160
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,230
It could even win a Nobel Prize.

161
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,740
A Nobel Prize? Yeah, right.

162
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,950
So how much do you need in total?

163
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,480
Pardon?

164
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,380
Well...

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,480
we need around 10 billion won.

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,910
Come on, you can't talk about it like that.

167
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,540
Pardon?

168
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,890
100 or 200 million won isn't pocket change.

169
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,610
If it's 10 billion, just say so. What's with "Around 10 billion"?

170
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,590
We need 10 billion won.

171
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,240
Really?

172
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,490
Do you really need exactly 10 billion won?

173
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,460
You crunched the numbers, and it came out to exactly 10 billion?

174
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,800
Well, actually...

175
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,850
it's about 8.7 billion...

176
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,570
No, it's 8.7 billion won.

177
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,580
See? Even if you lie, that's how you should say it.

178
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,280
If you say 10 billion, who would believe that?

179
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,850
Even 8.7 billion is a bit vague.

180
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,650
You should've said something precise like 8.725 billion won, even if you're scamming.

181
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,370
No, Director. This isn't a scam.

182
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,300
It's just that R&amp;D costs are very unpredictable, to be honest.

183
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,420
It'd be nice if experiments succeeded on the first try, but that's not the case.

184
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,000
I can't guarantee how many times we'll have to repeat the trials.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,570
Therefore, the more contingency funds we have, the better...

186
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,390
Come on, listen to this guy.

187
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,190
You say what investors hate hearing the most.

188
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,520
So you're telling me to invest when you don't know when this will work, right?

189
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,140
No, no.

190
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,360
It will work. We're almost there.

191
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,630
And we're going to get government funding.

192
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,420
Once that comes through, it's a done deal.

193
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,640
Nobody can compete with a government-funded project.

194
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,110
The others will all drop out.

195
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,650
But to get the government funds, we need Phase 3 results.

196
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,490
That's the only reason we're in a rush.

197
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,400
It's not that this won't work.

198
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm just rushing because I'm worried someone else might catch up to our research.

199
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,050
Director,

200
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,530
we can make it work with 8.7 billion won.

201
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,680
The amount isn't what's important.

202
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,850
What we care about is certainty.

203
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,510
Look, look. This, right here.

204
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,490
You can't make an Investor Relations document like this either.

205
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,180
It needs to have storytelling.

206
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,570
Investor Relations?

207
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,090
This document here.

208
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,700
- Oh, I see. 
 - Look at this.

209
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,130
Who cares how many papers this researcher published?

210
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,750
How many people would even understand this?

211
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,580
I see.

212
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,360
A pitch needs to have drama.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,020
Drama! You know?

214
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,030
- Do you get what I'm saying? 
 - Pardon?

215
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,030
O-Oh, yes, yes.

216
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,120
Gosh, and your attitude as well...

217
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,710
You need to, you know, come off confident.

218
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,780
Director, it's true I'm not good at those things.

219
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,260
But I'm confident in our company's skills.

220
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,900
- If you invest 8.7 billion won— 
 - CEO.

221
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,010
You don't know what my annual salary is, do you?

222
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,070
- Pardon? 
 - Do you?

223
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,470
I don't know.

224
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,990
Everyone thinks a large corporation executive earns a lot.

225
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,050
But it's not that much.

226
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,300
You probably earn much more than me.

227
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,330
No, no, that's not true.

228
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,860
What do you mean it's not?

229
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,260
Honestly, I envy you.

230
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,070
It's your company, right?

231
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,450
You have a shot at making it big.

232
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,380
It's not mine. It also belongs to my employees—

233
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,370
Oh, please.

234
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,140
How much of the company's shares do you own?

235
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,610
About 50%...

236
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,390
See!

237
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,950
It is yours.

238
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,310
Gosh, I'm jealous, so jealous.

239
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,470
You have no idea how tough it'll be on me

240
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,340
if I invest in you, do you?

241
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,080
It must be really tough, right?

242
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,070
A person shouldn't have to go through this.

243
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,170
It's not like I'm asking for money for myself,

244
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,270
but I have to convince those idiots,

245
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,800
and bow my head to stubborn jerks.

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,030
While taking them out for meals with my own money.

247
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,880
Let's say I manage to land the investment after all that.

248
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,600
But then I have to report this to the chairman.

249
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
Do you know what that means?

250
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,690
It means I'm taking responsibility. I'm essentially vouching for you.

251
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,620
Why the hell should I do that?

252
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,460
Whether I invest or not, my salary stays the same.

253
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
If you were in my shoes, wouldn't you feel the same?

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,860
It'd be easier not to do it.

255
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,000
And what if I do invest and it fails?

256
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,090
The company would tell me to take the blame for it.

257
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,710
You understand what I'm saying, right?

258
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,880
But, Director, this will really work.

259
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,070
It absolutely will not fail.

260
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,560
Also, this drug is...

261
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,770
very beneficial for kids with developmental disorders.

262
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,280
What I'm saying is,

263
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,220
if it works, it'll only benefit you greatly.

264
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,960
But if it fails, I will only get fired.

265
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,210
In this situation, you think I'd want to help someone else out?

266
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,890
Honestly?

267
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,160
I see...

268
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,490
I'll give you 500 million won.

269
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,730
You have a doctorate, I see.

270
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,570
Oh, yes.

271
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,620
Go Byung Soo, Ph.D.

272
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,490
Yes.

273
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,710
You're photogenic.

274
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,350
Oh, thank you.

275
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,160
But I guess...

276
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,650
you only spent time experimenting in the lab.

277
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,890
You're terrible at business.

278
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,790
Pardon?

279
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,890
Just because I said I don't earn much,

280
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,710
did you think you could sway me for some money?

281
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,570
Oh, n-n-no...

282
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,740
Do you take me for a beggar?

283
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,760
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,510
Just go.

285
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll pretend this didn't happen.

286
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,690
Gosh, that jerk.

287
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,020
He's so clueless.

288
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,930
How will he do any business like that?

289
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,430
 Maybe he got scared after I scolded him. 

290
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,370
 He never called me again ever since. 

291
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,460
I would've been scared as well.

292
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,020
Still, it was 500 million won. Weren't you tempted?

293
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,390
Aigoo, maybe I should've been tempted then.

294
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,800
If so, I'd have gone to the U.S. after making a lot of money.

295
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,380
I see.

296
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,660
But, Mr. Jo, are you suspecting me right now?

297
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,230
Gosh, of course not.

298
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,240
Since you were part of the M&amp;A Team back then,

299
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,780
the Audit Team needs to interview you,

300
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,630
but I told them not to do it.

301
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll say you did the interview with me just now.

302
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,270
That's why I asked you to meet me.

303
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,900
Mr. Yun and his team members will be questioned thoroughly by the Audit Team.

304
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,710
Thanks.

305
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,980
But Yun Ju No won't be easy.

306
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,940
He's exceptional in that regard.

307
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,140
Still, the evidence is very solid.

308
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,210
Who sent this complaint?

309
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm not sure. For something like this...

310
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,930
Me?

311
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,010
Gosh, it's not me.

312
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,060
   

313
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,420
   

314
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,690
Mr. Yun, i-it's not true, right?

315
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,140
I told you, it's not true.

316
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,020
- Mr. Yun. 
 - Jin Su.

317
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,750
Illegal use of insider info? It is true, I suppose.

318
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,800
Have you heard of Jumbo Pharma?

319
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,600
Have you heard of Jumbo?

320
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,570
No, I haven't.

321
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,960
Jumbo.

322
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,160
It's a company that makes drugs to treat ADHD.

323
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,480
- ADHD? 
 - Yes.

324
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,290
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

325
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,160
Everyone uses drugs made in the U.S.

326
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,880
They're the first to make it in South Korea.

327
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,960
The price is half that of the American drug.

328
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,690
It was a major hit.

329
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,670
They're now developing a drug to treat developmental disorders.

330
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,360
By developmental disorders, do you mean autism?

331
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,530
Yes, but nowadays, you can't call it autism.

332
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,210
You call it the autism spectrum.

333
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,390
Oh, I see.

334
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,770
The autism spectrum may vary with symptoms,

335
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,410
but it doesn't affect just the individual.

336
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,080
The whole family has to be involved.

337
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,070
I see.

338
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,430
There were rumors of a drug being made for it,

339
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,530
but they're the only one who made progress.

340
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,180
- Jumbo Pharma? 
 - Yes.

341
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,440
They've already reached Phase 3.

342
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,020
But I guess they're running short on funds these days.

343
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,470
You know, developing a new drug costs a lot of money.

344
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,780
And it's a race against time.

345
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,030
Whoever develops it first and gets the patent wins everything.

346
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,930
How long does a drug patent last again?

347
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,590
It's 20 years.

348
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,140
Exactly.

349
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,540
For 20 years, they can dominate the market.

350
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,150
That's huge.

351
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,520
Plus, they'll likely be selected as a national project.

352
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,740
- Is that certain? 
 - Of course.

353
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,230
I have some inside sources on that.

354
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,370
That's why they're rushing Phase 3.

355
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,210
Once Jumbo gets selected as a national project, others will all give up.

356
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,110
All right. Should I do an investment review?

357
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,930
No, no. Let's move quickly on this.

358
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,860
I can't just make the investment.

359
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,040
I've decided to acquire the CEO's shares.

360
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,090
8 billion in new shares and 4 billion in old shares.

361
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,090
The old shares too?

362
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,690
I just told him to hand them over.

363
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,720
What do you think?

364
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,150
There's no reason for us not to, right?

365
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,580
Yes. If it's as you've described,

366
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,470
it's an attractive offer.

367
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,090
- However— 
 - Okay.

368
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,650
I'll lock down the exclusive negotiation agreement first.

369
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,370
Want to join me in meeting him?

370
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,010
Okay. What's the schedule?

371
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,600
Today.

372
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,150
- Today? 
 - Yes, that's right.

373
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,470
It's about time he arrived...

374
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,520
Aigoo, he came just on time.

375
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,440
- Oh, welcome! Please come in. 
 - Hello, Director.

376
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,690
- You're here together, I see. 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

377
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,840
This is our Team Leader.

378
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,120
He's got the real power here.

379
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,430
Oh, I see.

380
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,040
Nice to meet you.

381
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,670
I'm Go Byeong Su of Jumbo Pharma.

382
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,110
He's got a PhD.

383
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,500
Hello. I'm Yun Ju No.

384
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,780
Nice to meet you.

385
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,120
Mr. Yun.

386
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,370
This is the exclusive negotiation agreement.

387
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,790
Okay, Attorney.

388
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,240
Are there any issues?

389
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,190
No, it seems perfectly fine on paper.

390
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,120
How about the Investor Relations documents?

391
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,370
They seem fine.

392
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,960
Yes. I saw that you fixed it well.

393
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,480
It's thanks to you, Director.

394
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,110
No, no. This is to benefit all of us.

395
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,670
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

396
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,850
We were just talking about how the CEO ended up developing this drug.

397
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,680
Oh, yes.

398
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,640
Actually,

399
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,020
the reason I decided to develop this drug

400
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,410
is because my child has autism.

401
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,980
Autism Spectrum Disorder?

402
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,380
Yes.

403
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,310
As a dad who develops drugs for a living...

404
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:49,130
shouldn't I make one to treat my own child?

405
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,040
I see.

406
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,510
Yes.

407
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,510
I've truly poured my entire life into this.

408
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,160
So how much do you need?

409
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,290
12.154 billion won.

410
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,560
Yes, it was quite a precise number.

411
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,410
Is it because the remaining steps are also precise?

412
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,940
Of course. They're quite precise.

413
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,020
The process of developing a new drug would be full of unknowns.

414
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,630
I didn't know it could be so precise.

415
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,800
Oh, about that...

416
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes, because we're in the final stage now.

417
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,650
   

418
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,140
But...

419
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,740
just because I mentioned my child has autism,

420
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,760
please don't feel pressured.

421
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,310
Aren't you desperate?

422
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,580
Pardon?

423
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,910
You've practically dedicated your life to this drug.

424
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,880
So you have to succeed, don't you?

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,150
You absolutely need the funds.

426
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,600
It's not like that.

427
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,140
There were many who wanted to invest in us.

428
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,570
It doesn't have to be Sanin.

429
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,020
Is there a reason why you came to us first despite that?

430
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,020
P-Pardon?

431
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,260
When it comes to drugs,

432
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,450
you bust your ass developing it,

433
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,810
then other guys make something similar and sell it.

434
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,670
- Right? 
 - Oh, yes.

435
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,190
Exactly.

436
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,050
It would be best to work with a big corporation like us to prevent that.

437
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,440
They wouldn't be able to do that for fear of Sanin.

438
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,750
Yes, I thought if I worked with Sanin,

439
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,860
no one would dare release a copycat drug.

440
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,930
Right.

441
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,430
Not that they would,

442
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,800
but if they were to do so, we won't sit still!

443
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,950
So don't worry.

444
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,880
Let's go ahead and sign the negotiation agreement first.

445
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,010
But this means...

446
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,120
I can only negotiate with Sanin, right?

447
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,030
I spent all my time in the lab,

448
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,160
so I don't know anything about this.

449
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,290
Yes. It gives us exclusive negotiating rights for one month.

450
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,490
And in return, we'll pay a deposit of 100 million won—

451
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,520
But I already agreed to meet with another company that asked to meet.

452
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,170
I feel like I should meet with them at least...

453
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,700
Then it's best we don't sign the contract today.

454
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,300
Gosh, seriously.

455
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,690
As expected of a CEO, you're good at negotiating.

456
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,370
All right. Then how about you give us a week?

457
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,070
But we'll only pay a 50 million won deposit.

458
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,540
Not 100 million won?

459
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,740
That's right.

460
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,090
We're taking on the risk of making a decision in just a week.

461
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,010
No, Director.

462
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,910
If it's a week, I think a deposit will be difficult.

463
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,210
- Really? 
 - Yes.

464
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,150
Even the one month we requested is short.

465
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,700
But it'd be impossible to do due diligence in one week.

466
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,300
We can't give you a deposit without due diligence.

467
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,560
We can just do it quickly.

468
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,050
At least, hurry with the document due diligence.

469
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,480
- Still... 
 - Come on.

470
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,220
The CEO doesn't look like someone who'd lie.

471
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,490
Then...

472
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,260
give Sanin exclusive negotiating rights,

473
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,490
and we'll pay a 50 million won deposit.

474
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,670
Oh, okay. Let's do so.

475
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,220
 And? 

476
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,530
Did you decide to do so?

477
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,880
Still, that doesn't make it stock manipulation.

478
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,720
Did you also manipulate the stock prices?

479
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,560
Let's continue this conversation next time.

480
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,570
You two will probably also get interviewed.

481
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,060
You just have to tell them what you know.

482
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,140
I'll be going home.

483
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,640
 See? 

484
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,460
 I told you he's not trustworthy. 

485
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,930
I'm sorry.

486
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,300
Hey, why are you speaking like that?

487
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,190
It's not like anyone's listening.

488
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,300
Then...

489
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,150
what now?

490
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,490
A disciplinary committee will probably convene.

491
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,010
He may provide an explanation there.

492
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,050
Aigoo.

493
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,570
Tell me honestly.

494
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,290
Do you...

495
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,770
trust him?

496
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,300
Well?

497
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Yes?

498
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,530
Mr. Ha and Mr. Jo are here.

499
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,200
Come in.

500
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,780
Take a seat.

501
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,340
Attorney.

502
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,730
I'm saying this for Mr. Yun's sake.

503
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,920
Don't think about making a rebuttal. Just admit it.

504
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,800
Let's resolve this politically and wrap it up with a resignation.

505
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,610
You know how it is with the disciplinary committee.

506
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,550
Yes.

507
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,660
I know the disciplinary committee is where you get punished.

508
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,350
Exactly.

509
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,010
People think it's like a trial, but it's not.

510
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,710
So, Attorney, please try to convince him.

511
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,930
Okay, I'll try talking to him.

512
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,300
The evidence we have...

513
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,720
I can't give you the details,

514
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,780
but it's concrete.

515
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,090
How concrete?

516
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,330
One hundred percent.

517
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,700
Then...

518
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,060
you're saying Yun Ju No is clearly guilty, right?

519
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes.

520
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,350
Then have him arrested.

521
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,320
But, Chairman, Sanin's situation isn't too good.

522
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,860
If this gets out publicly,

523
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,570
it won't be good for anyone.

524
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,210
Chairman, may I say something?

525
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,750
Go ahead.

526
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,290
No matter what, the disciplinary committee must be held.

527
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,670
If we don't, even after receiving a complaint,

528
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,190
it could cause bigger problems later.

529
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,260
Then?

530
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,950
First, we'll have Yun Ju No terminated.

531
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,890
Then, Sanin will file a lawsuit later.

532
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,300
That's the cleanest way.

533
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,550
Asking Yun Ju No, as an individual no longer part of Sanin, to compensate for the damages.

534
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,760
Okay, then do that.

535
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,440
Well, then, Chairman,

536
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,370
who should chair the disciplinary committee?

537
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,460
Why are you asking me that?

538
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,930
Am I the one who decides that?

539
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,670
Okay. We'll take care of it ourselves.

540
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,200
 Gosh, all because of Yun Ju No, damn it. 

541
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,100
 You can chair the disciplinary committee, Mr. Ha, 

542
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,190
and include me, the Audit Team Leader, and the Legal Team Leader.

543
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,470
Let me be a part of it, too.

544
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,500
How could you say that in this situation?

545
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,910
Mr. Lee, Mr. Ha and I will take care of it.

546
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,890
Having the Audit Team Leader and the Legal Team Leader is enough.

547
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,220
How many members are in a disciplinary committee?

548
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,610
It must be no more than five.

549
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,590
Then let me be a part of it, too.

550
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,670
Everyone knows your relationship with Mr. Yun.

551
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,710
People might get the wrong idea.

552
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,760
Are you okay with that?

553
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,880
In that case,

554
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,680
everyone knows about your relationship with him, too.

555
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,030
So let's both be on the committee

556
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,700
and make sure no one misunderstands, regardless of the outcome.

557
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,320
Sure, let's do that.

558
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,140
Hello?

559
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,210
Yes, okay. Let's meet there.

560
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,590
Okay.

561
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,430
I'll take a coffee break.

562
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,540
Please take care of the inside.

563
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,530
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

564
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,320
Here.

565
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,880
I have to go back quickly. Just one moment.

566
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,120
Okay.

567
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,730
I'll take this to go.

568
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,850
I'll tell you what I know.

569
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,260
This time, Mr. Yun won't escape.

570
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,940
The complaint contains concrete evidence.

571
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,030
But it may just be resolved with a resignation.

572
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,620
Since the company's struggling right now,

573
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,000
he doesn't want any rumors to spread.

574
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
The chairman?

575
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,370
But after resigning...

576
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,100
Never mind.

577
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,180
Anyway, that's all I know.

578
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,440
Thanks for your time.

579
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,250
Thanks for the coffee.

580
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,130
You're like this again.

581
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,830
Why?

582
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,910
Do you feel sorry for your Team Leader?

583
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,810
It's not that I feel sorry for him.

584
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,090
Seonbae, you told me before

585
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,100
that my Team Leader is a complicated person.

586
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,310
Did I say that?

587
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,410
Yes.

588
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,130
He'd do whatever he wanted while acting otherwise.

589
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,230
Oh, right.

590
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,120
See? I was right.

591
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,800
We don't know that yet.

592
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,010
Then why do you look like that?

593
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,730
You think I'm right, too.

594
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,680
Hey, you think a disciplinary committee is held for fun?

595
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,220
That doesn't happen unless there's concrete evidence.

596
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,960
Do you think the executives are idle?

597
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,790
So you found all the members, right?

598
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,650
Yes.

599
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,310
But they refuse to show Dr. Go's face.

600
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,450
It means they don't trust me.

601
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,240
You even went to prison for stock manipulation.

602
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,470
They can't trust you?

603
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,140
I didn't go to prison!

604
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,310
I was held in detention and got out on probation!

605
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,720
How can we make them trust us?

606
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,820
They trust nothing but money.

607
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,920
If I was going to pay to call them out, I'd have done so already.

608
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,800
Let's think of a way.

609
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,740
I don't have much time.

610
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,540
You think that's easy?

611
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,340
Mr. Yun.

612
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,330
Jin Su.

613
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,480
What is it?

614
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,760
Mr. Yun, can't you tell me the rest of the story?

615
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,880
What story?

616
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,490
About Jumbo Pharma.

617
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,160
You're not involved in the stock manipulation, right?

618
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,540
The attorney and manager both refuse to tell me.

619
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,160
What do you consider as being involved, Jin Su?

620
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,530
Mr. Yun.

621
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,560
Are you okay?

622
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,850
What?

623
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,840
You seem serious.

624
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,500
It's nothing.

625
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,540
Do you know autism?

626
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,390
What?

627
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,030
Did you know you can't call it autism?

628
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,200
You need to call it the autism spectrum.

629
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,860
I suppose that would avoid stereotyping since the symptoms vary.

630
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,670
- Did you know that already? 
 - Yes.

631
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,370
You know everything, Honey.

632
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,390
But couldn't you use "autism" as a diagnosing term?

633
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,880
I don't think so.

634
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,860
I saw on a drama recently that it's called the autism spectrum.

635
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,290
What's all this about?

636
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,660
What?

637
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,840
Are you acquiring a pharmaceutical company?

638
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,800
You asked me first!

639
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,890
Can't I take a look at it? I'm so disappointed.

640
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,590
I-It's not like that.

641
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,710
I know what you're thinking.

642
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,620
I understand.

643
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,020
You don't have to say more.

644
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,610
 Yes, Mr. Yun. 

645
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,430
I'm sorry for calling you on a weekend morning.

646
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,810
 Are you sorry for calling on a weekend or in the morning? 

647
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,510
F-For both.

648
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,320
 I see. What's the matter? 

649
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,970
Please take another look at Jumbo Pharma.

650
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,440
 Okay. 

651
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,460
 There is an accident-prone zone up ahead. 

652
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,700
 Are you going somewhere? 

653
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,400
 It sounds like you're in a car. 

654
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,010
Jun No.

655
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,040
Jun No.

656
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,500
   

657
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,420
 Are you on your way to Jumbo? 

658
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,370
Yes.

659
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,490
 Did you go to do due diligence? 

660
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,120
 You should've taken me with you. 

661
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,660
I think the U.S. first developed drugs for ADHD.

662
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,160
Won't there be a patent issue in that case?

663
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,700
 I know. Americans are very strict about patents. 

664
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,360
 I feel like Jumbo circumvented the patent. 

665
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,060
 Should I look into what they did exactly? 

666
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,160
Yes. Please let me know as soon as you find out.

667
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,840
   

668
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,830
Yes.

669
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,960
 Mr. Yun, I looked into what you asked me to. 

670
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,090
 After they released ADHD drugs, their sales indeed increased greatly. 

671
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:55,160
 But their profits actually turned negative. 

672
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,700
Their sales went up, but their profits decreased?

673
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,520
Please check where their spending increased.

674
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,770
They may have increased spending in R&amp;D.

675
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:12,040
 Well, I thought the same, but there was no public disclosure about that. 

676
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,080
I'm still looking for other possible reasons,

677
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,990
but I think it might take some time.

678
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,640
Please contact me as soon as you find out.

679
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,010
Also, check if it's connected to a U.S. pharmaceutical.

680
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,430
 Okay. 

681
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,390
Methylphenidate modified release formulation...

682
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,660
This was six years ago.

683
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,020
This is a bit strange.

684
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,760
Yes, Mr. Yun.

685
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,510
There is a problem, after all.

686
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:10,780
 The ADHD drug was developed by Revyon, a U.S. pharmaceutical company. 

687
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,340
The length of the patent is 20 years.

688
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,190
The 20-year period ended two years ago.

689
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,480
They could've filed for an extension, but they didn't.

690
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,250
 Supposedly, it was for public interest. 

691
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,850
So the patent ended two years ago, right?

692
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,480
If it's two years ago...

693
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,240
 Yes, it coincides with when Jumbo released its new drug. 

694
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,360
So around the time the ADHD drug's patent ended,

695
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,000
Jumbo released a copycat drug, right?

696
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,770
It's not for certain, but it appears so.

697
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:46,250
Developing a new drug costs a fortune.

698
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,940
There's no reason to develop a drug with an expiring patent.

699
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,230
The ingredients are the same as those in Revyon, too.

700
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,050
Then it's not patent infringement.

701
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,200
 Yes, but since they promoted it as a new drug, they did lie. 

702
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,390
 The question is why they told such lies... 

703
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,820
 There is something here. 

704
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,450
Not sure yet...

705
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,340
 But seeing how they have a lab, they must have the ability to manufacture copycat. 

706
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,530
 I hope that's the case. 

707
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,970
 Mr. Yun, did you go to the lab instead of the HQ? 

708
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,750
I came to the address on the homepage.

709
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,650
But it doesn't appear to be a lab.

710
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,050
 Why? 

711
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,670
Never mind a research lab.

712
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,540
It shouldn't even be used as a warehouse.

713
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:59,500
Is the drug released by Revyon called Contra?

714
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,490
 Yes, that's right. 

715
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:06,190
They're not capable of even copying the drug here.

716
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:10,960
They just changed the packaging and sold it.

717
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,210
 Gosh, these jerks. 

718
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,970
Attorney, I'll call you back later.

719
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,660
Okay.

720
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,810
   

721
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,470
Methylphenidate...

722
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,870
Yes, Min Jeong.

723
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,870
 Yes, Mr. Yun. After looking into it, 

724
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,750
 as Jumbo's sales increased, 

725
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,260
 their imports from Revyon also increased. 

726
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,060
 It's something called methylphenidate. 

727
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,100
 It's an ADHD drug. 

728
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,690
Yes, it seems they imported that drug

729
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,700
and just resold it with Jumbo's packaging.

730
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,290
 They sold it for cheaper than what they paid Revyon. 

731
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,400
 People who bought the ADHD drugs were probably happy, 

732
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,690
 but why would they run a business at a loss? 

733
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,310
To run a scam.

734
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,850
 But Mr. Yun, where are you right now? 

735
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,350
I'm at Jumbo's factory.

736
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,050
 Pardon? 

737
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,990
 Isn't that dangerous? 

738
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,330
No one's here, so it's okay.

739
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,100
 You should get out of there. 

740
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,910
Okay. I'll call you back later.

741
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,470
 Okay. 

742
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,550
 Ju No. 

743
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,760
Yes.

744
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,360
Brother-in-law.

745
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,170
- Oh, Sister-in-law. 
 - Please come in.

746
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,320
Where's Ju No?

747
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,190
He left, saying he had important business to tend to.

748
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,930
What important business?

749
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,340
Probably his work.

750
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,880
Since Ju No says it's important.

751
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,930
Gosh, he should just fix his doorbell.

752
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,220
It's broken.

753
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,750
Yes.

754
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,220
What important business does he have?

755
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,870
It seems like he's starting a new project.

756
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,860
That's usually when he's the busiest.

757
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,180
After he's done, he'll take a break.

758
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,030
What is he working on these days?

759
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,850
I hear he's investing in a pharmaceutical company.

760
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,260
But he doesn't tell me the details either.

761
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,180
Gosh, that guy's personality.

762
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,280
He's different from me. He's got no warmth.

763
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,170
I know, right?

764
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,520
Should I contact him?

765
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,370
Oh, no. I just dropped by while passing by.

766
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,610
Eat before you go.

767
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,640
No, I don't want to bother you. It's okay.

768
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,770
No, it's not a bother at all.

769
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,540
No, Oh Woon will be waiting. I should go.

770
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,630
Eat before you go.

771
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:00,810
I'm really fine, though.

772
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,680
 Yes, Mr. Yun. 

773
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,690
I've got something to tell you.

774
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,650
-  What is it?  
 - It's about Jumbo Pharma.

775
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,650
 I'm sorry, Director. There was so much traffic... 

776
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,510
Sit, sit.

777
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,010
 Yes, go on. 

778
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,280
I placed the due diligence report on your desk.

779
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,600
 Did you call me to tell me that? 

780
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,890
Yes, since you told me to do it quickly.

781
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,480
I thought you'd want to know.

782
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,170
Aigoo, you didn't have to.

783
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,330
Have I ever interfered with your work?

784
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,990
Take care of it as you will.

785
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,560
 Okay. Then I'll hang up now. 

786
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,280
Okay.

787
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,280
Why? Who was it?

788
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,890
It's nothing. It was one of my subordinates.

789
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,100
It'd be weird if he knew we were together.

790
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,360
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were on a call.

791
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,570
No, no, it's fine.

792
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,110
Here.

793
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,380
But...

794
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,680
it's not like our company is a bad one.

795
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,850
It's not like investing in it is bad.

796
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,650
Still, it'd be weird for us to be together.

797
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,560
It's not like I'll tell anyone that I'm splitting

798
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,400
the money with you, Director.

799
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,330
Gosh, seriously.

800
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,850
I'm only getting 50% of the money

801
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,830
beyond the 8 billion you need to make the drug.

802
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:54,200
Yes, I won't tell anyone about that.

803
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,900
It kind of sounds like you're threatening me.

804
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,000
No, no. I'm not.

805
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,580
No way!

806
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,500
I was just so grateful to you, Director,

807
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,770
so I asked to see you to make you an offer.

808
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,550
What offer?

809
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:19,140
Even if I receive the full 12 billion through this,

810
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,590
you'll only get 2 billion won.

811
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,490
I thought maybe I could give you some of our shares.

812
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,880
What do you mean?

813
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,500
Actually, like I told you last time,

814
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,480
I can't predict how much the research costs will be.

815
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,270
So I have to save up some money as the CEO.

816
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:47,490
So I've been buying and selling stocks.

817
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,120
In doing so,

818
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,270
I realized I might be able to

819
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,890
influence the market price.

820
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,370
Are you saying you're manipulating stock prices?

821
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,240
Gosh, it's not really manipulation.

822
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,720
Well, something like that.

823
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,307
I'll multiply it tenfold.

824
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:19,230
Are you interested?

825
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,670
Did something happen at work?

826
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,710
What are you thinking about so deeply?

827
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,720
What?

828
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,480
No, it's nothing.

829
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,460
Thank you for the meal.

830
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,670
Enjoy.

831
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,580
Eat up, too, my second daughter.

832
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,620
Here you go.

833
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,180
Eat up.

834
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,410
Someone I know

835
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,710
said that you were a complicated person.

836
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,830
Is that so?

837
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,110
What do you think, Jin Su?

838
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,420
Honestly,

839
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,940
he said you were a bad person

840
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,840
who thinks of others as purely bad,

841
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,880
and think of yourself as good in a complicated way.

842
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,870
And that makes you even worse.

843
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,670
That makes sense.

844
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,280
 But... 

845
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,010
 I think... 

846
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,930
 you believe you're bad in a complicated way. 

847
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,540
 And... 

848
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,110
 I don't know if that's better or worse. 

849
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,430
 We will now open. 

850
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,220
  the Sanin Group disciplinary committee. 

851
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,190
 Today's agenda consists of two disciplinary matters 

852
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,280
 concerning M&amp;A Team Leader Yun Ju No. 

853
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,830
 The first item is about the internal information leak. 

854
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,820
 The second item is about... 

855
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,930
 illegal trading using undisclosed information. 

856
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,540
Director, here are the disciplinary files.

857
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,100
- Okay, let's go. 
 - Yes.

858
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,130
Mr. Yun.

859
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,610
It's not bad to just accept the termination.

860
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,290
That's my opinion as well.

861
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,260
The company won't want any noise around this.

862
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,580
Yes.

863
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,610
 We will deliberate on the disciplinary action 

864
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,960
 concerning M&amp;A Team Leader Yun Ju No. 

865
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,740
 If the members have any questions, feel free to ask. 

866
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,020
Three years ago,

867
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,990
you were responsible for the investment

868
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,440
in the pharmaceutical company, Jumbo, correct?

869
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,480
Yes.

870
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,190
At the time, you evaluated it as a good company.

871
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,070
Is my memory correct?

872
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,280
Yes, I remember it.

873
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,010
At the time,

874
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,800
you'd have known that Sanin's investment in Jumbo

875
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,980
would lead to Jumbo's stock price skyrocketing.

876
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,150
That's right.

877
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,880
So...

878
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,950
have you ever disclosed that info to anyone else?

879
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,240
Have you ever shown this to anyone else?

880
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,430
Is this the place that he's investing in these days?

881
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,940
Pardon?

882
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:08,490
Oh, Ju No really hates that...

883
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,140
Oh, okay, I won't look at it.

884
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,740
I'm sorry, Brother-in-law.

885
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,630
Ju No is just so sensitive about stuff like this.

886
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,690
No, it's okay. I know his personality is...

887
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,820
I got it. It's okay.

888
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,550
Oh Wun, daddy's coming right now.

889
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,610
Dinner? I didn't eat yet.

890
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,250
Auntie packed tasty food for us.

891
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,260
Let's eat it together at home.

892
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,660
Yes, I'm on my way.

893
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,540
Okay.

894
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,990
   

895
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,050
   

896
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,960
   

897
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,410
Wow.

898
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,430
Did Auntie make this for us?

899
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,120
Yes.

900
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,640
Go ahead and eat.

901
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,730
What about you, Daddy?

902
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,680
Yes, you go ahead.

903
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,560
   

904
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,650
   

905
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,710
Manager Yun.

906
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,740
You've got a consultation for a new business loan.

907
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,970
Oh, okay. Thank you.

908
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,610
To apply for a loan,

909
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,500
there are some documents we need to verify.

910
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,240
First, we would need the income certificate.

911
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,100
   

912
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,140
   

913
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,510
You're Team Leader Yun Ju No's brother, right?

914
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,020
Yes. How did you know?

915
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,820
Actually, we've decided to

916
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,470
receive investment from Sanin.

917
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,180
And?

918
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,480
I wanted to thank Mr. Yun,

919
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,690
but he's just so strict, you know?

920
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,390
Well, he's...

921
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,910
kind of like that.

922
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,530
Yes.

923
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,450
Once an article says we're getting the investment,

924
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:20,130
our stock price will jump several times.

925
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,600
It's a situation we're so grateful for,

926
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,210
but Mr. Yun isn't getting anything.

927
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:32,600
So I thought this was a bit wrong.

928
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:47,750
This is 100 million won in cash.

929
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,540
Pardon?

930
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,830
In the past, people did stuff like this a lot

931
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,360
for taking loans from banks.

932
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,930
No, no. If I take this, I'll be in big trouble.

933
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,300
These days, there's no such thing.

934
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,940
Still, I feel bad about it.

935
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,200
My stocks will probably go up tenfold.

936
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,170
This is nothing compared to that.

937
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,490
No, it's okay. If you're done talking,

938
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,780
I'll take my leave first.

939
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,240
   

940
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,380
Daddy.

941
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,740
- Yes? 
 - I'm all ready now.

942
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,040
Let's hurry and go.

943
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,190
Okay.

944
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:49,840
   

945
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,390
   

946
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,660
I'll ask again.

947
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,670
Did your brother, Yun Ju Seok,

948
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:03,220
know that Sanin was investing in Jumbo?

949
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,620
Yes.

950
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,720
He knew.

951
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:16,230
So you're admitting to leaking inside info then.

952
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,880
Do you know how much he bought?

953
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,090
 How much did you buy? 

954
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,380
 100 million won. 

955
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,340
 Wh-Where did you get that money? 

956
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,310
 I borrowed it from the bank. 

957
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,150
 Hyeong... 

958
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,050
 Why did you do... 

959
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,830
 something you don't usually do? 

960
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,870
 Ju No. 

961
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,640
 Help me out. 

962
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,470
 You're investing in Jumbo, right? 

963
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,730
 How do you know that? 

964
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,720
 Well? 

965
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,780
 I asked how you know that, Hyeong. 

966
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,910
 Sanin isn't investing in that company. 

967
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,560
 That company is a scam! 

968
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,130
 Don't lie. 

969
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,820
 If Sanin invested in it, shouldn't its stocks go up? 

970
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,480
 But... 

971
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,010
 why is it falling? 

972
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,740
 Ju No. 

973
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,350
 Save me this once. 

974
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,990
 If you don't, I'm dead. 

975
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,600
 Please? 

976
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,660
Mr. Yun Ju No.

977
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,680
At the time,

978
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,330
he held about 100 million won in Jumbo stocks.

979
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,680
And you were aware of this, Mr. Yun.

980
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,860
We can settle the first issue like this, right?

981
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,490
I believe everyone here understands that

982
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,350
this matter is highly sensitive.

983
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,130
For the first issue alone,

984
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,370
Mr. Yun should not only be dismissed

985
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,730
but also face additional legal action.

986
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,920
However, given that Mr. Yun's contribution to Sanin

987
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,090
and one of the parties involved has passed away,

988
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,210
I think the disciplinary hearing

989
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,280
should conclude with his dismissal.

990
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,540
You agree, right?

991
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,970
I can't agree to that.

992
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,370
What?

993
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,300
Mr. Yun, the company is showing you leniency here.

994
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,140
Yes.

995
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,480
But I still cannot agree

996
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,500
to being dismissed.

997
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:23,670
Can I speak with Mr. Yun for a moment?

998
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,280
No.

999
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,090
Please continue.

1000
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,770
All right, let's continue.

1001
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,070
He must not know what was reported in the complaint.

1002
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,070
Let's move on to the second issue.

1003
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,450
It's the punishment for

1004
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,160
illegal trading using undisclosed info.

1005
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,580
All right, this is...

1006
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:53,600
a notice to exercise shareholder rights sent to Yun Ju No,

1007
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,750
who held 50,000 shares of Jumbo.

1008
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:05,010
The notice was issued in 2022,

1009
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,880
so at the time, you were holding these shares, right?

1010
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,140
Wow.

1011
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,820
50,000 shares...

1012
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:19,250
This must've been over 1 billion at one point, right?

1013
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,340
It's 1 billion won.

1014
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,370
All right.

1015
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,270
Mr. Yun,

1016
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:38,860
you also admit that you hold Jumbo's stocks, right?

1017
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,800
Yes, I admit it.

1018
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,100
I tried to show you leniency.

1019
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,730
But you rejected it.

1030

 Is it going according to your plan? 

1031
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,090
 Maybe this is a suicide mission... 

1032
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,350
 The devil is in the details. 

1033
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,240
 The reason I came back here 

1034
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,760
 is because I want to know the truth. 

1035
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,640
 By crashing the stock price? 

1036
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,080
 He wants to take us down with him. 

1037
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,610
 We need to strike first. 

1038
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,950
 I hear you're still running schemes. 

1039
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,660
 I've got ammunition. 

1040
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:33,320
 When a person talks a lot, 

1041
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,560
 they're bound to make a mistake.

 something a person should do?

01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,730
 Mr. Ha! 

1045
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,570
 You're fired, you got that?
