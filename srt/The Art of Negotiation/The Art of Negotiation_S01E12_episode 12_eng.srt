00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,240
   

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,650
   

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,900
   

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,950
   

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,390
   

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,850
   

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,250
♫  'Cause money takes the heart, money takes the heart  ♫

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,970
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,900
   

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,430
 - You've eaten here before, right? 
 - No. 

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,180
 Really? 

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,930
 ­I don't think so. 

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,780
 ­You can tell by just looking. 

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,880
Manager.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,950
Hey!

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,610
How have you been?

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,200
Well...

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,700
Do you still work at your company?

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,850
Well, yes.

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,110
What was your company's name again?

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,090
It's GoGo.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,170
Oh, right. GoGo.

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,510
Let's step aside for a moment.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,530
- Yes, or maybe... 
 - Order one boiled pork for me.

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,580
What kind of company name is GoGo?

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,010
It sounds like a nightclub.

29
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,230
You shouldn't be in Yeouido, no?

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,280
Nearly everyone in this neighborhood is a scammer.

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,200
My rap sheet is on the cleaner side.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,480
Still, you got caught, Hyeong.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,970
I know.

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,470
I shouldn't get caught like you.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,690
I hear you still run schemes.

36
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,840
Gosh, you must be out of your mind.

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,290
Who told you that?

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,830
So you're not denying it.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,340
Hey.

40
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,930
I've got ammunition.

41
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,430
How about you do one with me?

42
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,760
Gosh, this guy.

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,100
You haven't come to your senses yet.

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,400
I've earned too much money to come to my senses.

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,860
How much do you have?

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,070
Well...

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,050
I've got a bit.

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,430
   

49
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,710
All right,

50
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,710
Mr. Yun.

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,380
You also admit that you hold Jumbo's stocks, right?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
Yes, I admit it.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,820
I tried to show you leniency,

54
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,390
but you rejected it.

55
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,050
Perhaps you did it without knowing what this is.

56
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,160
I know very well what that is.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm sure you have a lot of other evidence.

58
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,030
Hey, Mr. Yun.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,890
You should stop now.

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,780
This is...

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,740
proof that Yun Ju No was personally involved in

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,610
Jumbo's stock manipulation.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,020
The amount that Yun Ju No held was ten times his brother's.

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,730
With this amount, he's more than just involved.

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,150
He's the main culprit. The mastermind behind it.

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,160
Mr. Ha.

67
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,400
No, Disciplinary Chair.

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,050
- To jump to conclusions like that— 
 - Then what?

69
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,150
Do we turn this over to the Financial Supervisory Service?

70
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,280
Or to the prosecution?

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,950
Should we have them judge this?

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,460
So now isn't the time to maintain your pride.

73
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,760
At times like this, you should concede.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,220
We're doing this for your benefit.

75
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm also just answering the questions.

76
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,710
Let's continue.

77
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,640
We're not here to argue whether you're guilty or not.

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,870
We're here to decide the level of your punishment.

79
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,540
Accept your punishment

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,010
and see an attorney afterward if you feel injustice.

81
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's take a short break before continuing.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,510
Why bother taking a break?

83
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,440
Let's just decide and get this over with.

84
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,850
Let's take a short break.

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,990
Well, okay then. Let's get some coffee.

86
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,920
Why is he being like that?

87
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,080
It appears he's lost his mind.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Is that so?

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,610
Yes, they're usually like that.

90
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,530
But Yun Ju No usually isn't like that.

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,330
Everyone in his position is like that.

92
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,360
They all want to be believed,

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,000
ask for the truth to be uncovered,

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,650
and say they're unfairly accused

95
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,440
while collapsing in tears.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,350
I was fooled more than once.

97
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,000
But when we question them with the evidence,

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,470
they all break down. Every single one.

99
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,430
I've never seen one not do so.

100
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,430
Then shouldn't he plead or something?

101
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,760
He probably wants to.

102
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,000
He probably wants to kneel and beg.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,400
But you know how much pride Yun Ju No has.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,240
He doesn't know how to bend.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,710
Guys like him end up breaking in one go.

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,470
Yes, I know.

107
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,580
Is it going according to your plan?

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,350
Not really.

109
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,530
Then it may be good to just admit it.

110
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,320
This will be wrapped up with just your termination.

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,360
Just as I'd told you when I first returned to Korea,

112
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,220
I've got nothing more to lose.

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,500
So the current discipline I'm facing

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,850
means nothing to me.

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,220
How could it mean nothing?

116
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,110
You have no idea what would happen.

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,260
Will I end up going to prison?

118
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,060
That's why

119
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,050
you're telling me to end this with my termination.

120
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,510
If this ends with my termination, as you've said,

121
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,380
what about after that?

122
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,430
Can't Sanin Group file a civil lawsuit against me?

123
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,890
And the compensation amount will be considerable.

124
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,560
Still, why make a self-defeating move?

125
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,110
If you hold out like this,

126
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,120
it won't end with your firing.

127
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,350
And they'll be emotionally charged when they sue you.

128
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,230
How does that benefit you at all?

129
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,340
The reason I came back here was because

130
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,910
I wanted to know the truth about my brother.

131
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,660
That's why I'm also only telling the truth.

132
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,500
So as long as you can find out the truth,

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,520
you don't care if you go to prison or get sued?

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,990
Yes.

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,320
- Coffee. 
 - Okay.

136
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,400
- In my opinion... 
 - Yes?

137
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,890
Yun Ju No knows our company situation.

138
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,660
Maybe this is a suicide mission.

139
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,790
By suicide mission...

140
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,670
He'll say Sanin is a stock-manipulating company

141
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,650
to everyone and bring it down.

142
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,570
By crashing our stock price?

143
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,830
He wants to take us down with him.

144
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,830
How will he deal with the consequences?

145
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,250
Come on.

146
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,660
Does a cornered rat think about consequences?

147
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,190
Yes.

148
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,570
No, later, later.

149
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,430
Then...

150
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,570
we need to strike first.

151
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,370
How?

152
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,200
We'll tell everyone first

153
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,370
that Yun Ju No is a stock manipulator.

154
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,190
That's not an option right now.

155
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,670
That's exactly what Yun Ju No wants right now.

156
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,250
No.

157
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,900
"The corporate raider Yun Ju No"

158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,700
"tried to manipulate the stocks, and Sanin stopped him."

159
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,800
We can put out a story like that.

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,880
We'll frame it as Sanin is a company

161
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,290
with the ability to self-correct.

162
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,440
How will we persuade the chairman?

163
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,980
We shouldn't have to.

164
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,830
The article would be released without our knowledge.

165
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,880
So

166
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,510
Sanin's current struggles are Yun Ju No's fault

167
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,160
and things will get better after firing him?

168
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,330
Pardon?

169
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,590
Well, yes. We can take that angle.

170
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,310
That sounds pretty good.

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,350
But for a reporter to write a convincing article,

172
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,000
there needs to be a believable story.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
- Having facts would be even better. 
 - That's true.

174
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,430
Do you think Yun Ju No will spill it?

175
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,610
When a person talks too much,

176
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,580
they're bound to make a mistake.

177
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,870
Mr. Yun.

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,590
Do you have anything you want us to do?

179
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,060
No, I don't.

180
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,300
Someone will come to see me.

181
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,910
Then please let me know.

182
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,220
Who?

183
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,380
Excuse us.

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,180
Mr. Yun, did you get to take a break?

185
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,390
After hearing what you said earlier,

186
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,060
I just got curious.

187
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,610
How is a scheme run?

188
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,290
Could you give us an explanation?

189
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,690
   

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,990
Stock manipulation is often called a scheme.

191
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm sure you can't do that alone.

192
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,780
Yes. A scheme requires several members.

193
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,950
Among the members, there's the Main Player

194
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,240
who sets up everything and profits the most.

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,090
Then...

196
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,340
 there's the Puppet to hide the Main Player. 

197
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,620
Starting from the oldest,

198
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,700
you wanted the jujube tea, right?

199
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,880
Safe...

200
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
- Driving. 
 -  The Funder who provides the funds 

201
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
-  for the stock manipulation.  
 - Tea for me.

202
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,960
- Please give it to the Madam first. 
 - Oh, okay, Madam.

203
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,270
Let's be humble.

204
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,860
 Then the Artist who influences the stock charts. 

205
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,750
I'll draw up the charts.

206
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,290
 And... 

207
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,860
This is...

208
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,460
 ­Right. 

209
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,220
Oh, I am Jang Won Seok.

210
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,550
I used to work in the securities industry in Yeouido,

211
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,100
and I'm a freelancer now.

212
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,400
Are we on a blind date? Why share your name?

213
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,710
Oh, I see.

214
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,060
He used to be a technician,

215
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,830
but he got caught and got his hand cut off.

216
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,760
But you're trying again?

217
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,390
Yes.

218
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,880
I reattached my hand and came.

219
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,850
He should. What better business is there than this?

220
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,960
Exactly.

221
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,430
At my age, it's not like I can be a delivery man.

222
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,860
In any case, our work is based on trust.

223
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,500
You know that, right?

224
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,440
- That's why it's hard. 
 - Right.

225
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,820
No matter how tough or lonely it gets,

226
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,080
let's trust the team by our side,

227
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,670
depend on each other,

228
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,020
and push through until the end.

229
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,790
 These people don't trust each other from the start 

230
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,650
 since they're a group of scammers. 

231
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,170
 So they don't tell each other their names. 

232
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,530
 And they often don't know what they look like. 

233
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,270
 As a result, 

234
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,940
 an existing member must 

235
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,780
 invite you to enter this family. 

236
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,790
I don't think he knows he's been played.

237
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,450
That's why he came back again.

238
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,850
Our Main Player must've driven so well

239
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,280
that he doesn't know he's been hit and run.

240
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,810
Hey.

241
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,200
Okay, then.

242
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,590
I invited everyone to the group chat.

243
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,900
Let's become rich and never see each other again.

244
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,190
- Let's do that. 
 - Let's do so.

245
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,800
It was nice to meet you. Goodbye.

246
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,000
 Especially the designer and major shareholder, 

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,560
 the Main Player, doesn't show his face often. 

248
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,980
Yes, Doctor. We just finished the meeting.

249
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,140
Yes. I'll tell you when I get there. 
    

250
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,640
Yes, I'll get back now.

251
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,990
So is the Doctor the Main Player?

252
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,310
Why would you be curious about that, Hyeong?

253
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,860
I mean, the Main Player didn't show up today.

254
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,120
But he's listed here. Isn't it him?

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,340
Just let it be.

256
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,930
Why do you care who the Main Player is?

257
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,200
Gosh, this jerk.

258
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,500
Hey, I'm spending 1 billion won of my money.

259
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,570
I should at least know how the scheme will go.

260
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,600
Listen carefully.

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,090
I'll explain it only once.

262
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,240
There's a company called Seonoh Technology.

263
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,500
What kind of company is it?

264
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,590
I don't know. Who cares?

265
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,080
Probably some company that deals with technology.

266
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,310
When the members gather,

267
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,330
they choose a company to run the scheme.

268
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,410
Usually, one with a market cap of 100 billion won.

269
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,880
Why?

270
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,340
They should use a big company to earn big.

271
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,600
Also not be very noticeable.

272
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,070
They can't move their market price as they please.

273
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,190
If they want to move a value of 10 billion won,

274
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,390
one valued at around 100 billion won is appropriate.

275
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,150
Their market cap is around 100 billion won.

276
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,920
Then we'd need about 10 billion in funds.

277
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,410
You said you'd provide 1 billion, right?

278
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,950
Yes, 1 billion won.

279
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,580
That would make exactly 10 billion.

280
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,880
Their stock price moves between 1,200 and 1,300 won.

281
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,700
We'll bring that price down to below 1,000 won.

282
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,740
You can buy the stocks then.

283
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh, okay.

284
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Don't buy whenever you feel like it.

285
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,360
I'll tell you when based on the order.

286
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,190
Just keep the chatroom notifications on.

287
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,130
Okay.

288
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,530
They raise and drop the stock price little by little

289
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,250
and accumulate shares among themselves.

290
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,800
When the regular investors are starting to jump in,

291
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,570
they sometimes drop the price.

292
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,460
Shaking off the ants.

293
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,560
Yes.

294
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,750
To get the regular investors to sell their shares

295
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,810
so the players can buy them up.

296
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,130
Once they've accumulated enough,

297
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,710
they start buying and selling among themselves

298
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,710
to raise the price.

299
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,270
Since only the players are trading at that point,

300
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,920
they agree on the exact quantity

301
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,280
and timing of the trades.

302
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,110
This is called collusive trading.

303
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,120
Usually, the trades happen around lunchtime.

304
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,920
Why is that?

305
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,770
Because trading volume is low

306
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,230
and monitoring is more relaxed at that time.

307
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,980
Even the Financial Supervisory Service has to eat lunch.

308
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,930
The devil is in the details.

309
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,010
Once we've accumulated enough shares,

310
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,480
I'll launch it.

311
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm thinking up to 5,000 won.

312
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,970
All the way to 5,000 won?

313
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,930
I'll have to release some articles and do something.

314
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,720
Spread some rumors, too.

315
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,070
I know a few YouTubers, too.

316
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,190
I heard that finance YouTubers are effective lately.

317
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,750
That's great. Nice.

318
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,050
So what's the order then?

319
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,040
The order of our drinks earlier is the order.

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,110
I see. Then I'm last?

321
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,900
What, did you think you'd be first?

322
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,020
Once the stock price skyrockets,

323
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,360
the players sell their shares in the agreed order,

324
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,880
slowly and without drawing attention.

325
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,530
If they sell this way,

326
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,540
the price won't drop right away.

327
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,260
Due to regular investors who jumped in after hearing the rumors,

328
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,130
it sometimes even goes up.

329
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,030
So the stock chart of a pumped stock often shows

330
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,500
two big spikes, like the humps on a camel's back.

331
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,350
Jumbo was a failed scheme,

332
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,130
so it wasn't able to produce such a graph.

333
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,100
I barely made anything last time

334
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,610
because the scheme failed.

335
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,670
This time, I'm trying to make a real masterpiece.

336
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,000
Hyeong, do you know...

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,780
how hard I've been working?

338
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,630
Yes, I know you're working hard. You sure are.

339
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,130
So don't worry, and just wait, Hyeong.

340
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,940
Okay.

341
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,300
Let's not see each other for a while.

342
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,730
Okay, all right. See you.

343
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,270
Why did it fail?

344
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,280
Because someone broke the agreement

345
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,790
and sold their shares early.

346
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,140
It's betrayal upon betrayal.

347
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,120
In that world,

348
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,350
betrayal is considered a skill.

349
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,770
When a stock manipulation scheme fails,

350
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,770
a large volume hits the market all at once,

351
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,160
so the stock price crashes.

352
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,520
By the time regular investors realize it,

353
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,920
it's already too late.

354
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,130
If it hits the lower limit,

355
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,390
they can't even sell, even if they want to.

356
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,200
How do you know this?

357
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,100
I think I got caught up in one.

358
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,130
No proof though.

359
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,070
So?

360
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,090
What was your role, Mr. Yun?

361
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,830
The designer?

362
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,660
Dr. Go Byeong Su had designed and led

363
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,120
Jumbo Pharma's stock manipulation.

364
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,220
He also held the largest amount of shares.

365
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,100
Really?

366
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,160
What happened to him?

367
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,820
Did he go to prison?

368
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,380
As you know, the scheme failed.

369
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,270
That made it difficult to secure solid evidence

370
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,600
against the players involved.

371
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,650
Let's say what you've said is true.

372
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,870
Then don't you want to catch

373
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,190
that Doctor?

374
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,320
We should catch him.

375
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,290
That bastard's putting rubber gloves on me

376
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,580
to make me "wash the dishes" again.

377
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,410
That jerk...

378
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,270
We talked. I think it'll work.

379
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,790
Where did that bastard go?

380
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
 All-Floor Access­ 

381
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,200
   

382
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,680
Okay.

383
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,350
What brings you here?

384
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,220
Pardon?

385
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,450
If you're a visitor, please sign in.

386
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,610
Oh, okay.

387
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,510
You should get revenge.

388
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,800
Your brother died because of him.

389
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,240
Were you unable to catch him yet?

390
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,820
Yes.

391
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,350
Not yet.

392
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,410
Not yet?

393
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,840
Mr. Yun will be okay, right?

394
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm not sure.

395
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,270
He wants to handle the disciplinary matters alone.

396
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,690
Why?

397
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,050
We could also face discipline trying to help him.

398
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,620
Do you know who's supposed to come by?

399
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,960
   

400
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,390
Hey, Delivery Guy!

401
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,730
Take these upstairs!

402
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,120
You can't just leave them here!

403
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,490
Oh, okay.

404
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,450
You should take them upstairs.

405
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,310
Thank you.

406
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,250
Thank you.

407
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,670

Yes.

439
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,130

Not to hide evidence of your stock manipulation?

442
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,700
I didn't manipulate any stock.

443
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,420
So I have nothing to hide.

444
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,040
Pardon?

445
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
The way you explained earlier,

446
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,000
you seemed to know in such detail.

447
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,820
You don't have to

448
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,940
manipulate stocks to know what I explained earlier.

449
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,380
Mr. Yun.

450
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,540
Let's admit what you need to and move on.

451
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,510
Dragging this out won't help you.

452
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,260
Even so, I can't admit to something I didn't do.

453
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,090
All right, fine.

454
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,310
Let's go over everything one by one.

455
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,270
First, this report.

456
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,540
That report was written before I went on-site.

457
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,770
After the due diligence, I reported to you again

458
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,440
that we shouldn't invest in Jumbo.

459
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,300
Well, I suppose you did do that.

460
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,010
   

461
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,530
   

462
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,840
   

463
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,570
   

464
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,590
 Mr. Ha, the ants are falling off nicely. 

465
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,740
 I think we can shoot today. 

466
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,110
 But I haven't bought everything yet. 

467
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,400
 I'll give you 25,000 of my shares. 

468
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,440
 It'll be at 12:10 p.m. Same as last time. 

469
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,360
 Okay. 

470
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,910
Mr. Ha seems to be involved, too, right?

471
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,200
He seemed different this time.

472
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,640
That is true.

473
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,280
 12:10 p.m. 20,000 won. 

474
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,150
 You can go with 25,000 shares. 

475
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,520
 Okay. 

476
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
   

477
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,350
   

478
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,810
 You got it, right? 

479
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,000
 I'll be stepping on the gas today. 

480
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,440
 Please put on your seat belts. 

481
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,960
Yes?

482
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,330
Mr. Ha, I have something to tell you.

483
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,270
Yes, what is it?

484
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,430
We mustn't invest in Jumbo Pharma.

485
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,500
Why not?

486
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,180
Jumbo Pharma's Ultra Focus

487
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,540
wasn't developed internally.

488
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,720
They seem to be selling imported drugs from the U.S.

489
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,940
Gosh, w-what do you mean?

490
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,850
After Jumbo released their drug Ultra Focus,

491
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,750
their sales increased,

492
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,090
but their net profit is in the negative.

493
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,930
I mean, maybe the new drug development

494
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,670
is using up a lot of money.

495
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,310
Jumbo Pharma...

496
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,330
didn't even have a proper lab at their HQ.

497
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,900
They don't have the ability or

498
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,160
equipment to make copycat drugs.

499
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,150
You went there?

500
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,650
Yes.

501
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,810
I'll look into it a bit,

502
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,220
so just wait.

503
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,900
The earlier due diligence report was

504
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,230
- based on documents only— 
 - I got it.

505
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,760
Since it was based on only the documents,

506
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,970
it's different from the actual situation.

507
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,820
- If you look at the new report— 
 - I got it.

508
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,300
You guys, go and get lunch.

509
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,090
 He seemed flustered. 

510
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,240
And his ego was bruised, too.

511
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,080
He'll withdraw the investment, right?

512
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,670
That's what you hope for, right?

513
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,590
   

514
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,160
 But what if he's already received a rebate? 

515
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,290
 Then he's already in the same boat with them. 

516
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,820
 Pulling out the investment might be difficult, right? 

517
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,740
 Oh, that's true. 

518
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,750
 If he already received a bribe, 

519
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,800
 Jumbo being a scam would be a burden for him as well. 

520
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,210
 Right. If he backs out of the investment, 

521
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,350
 Jumbo might threaten to expose everything. 

522
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,340
   

523
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,240
   

524
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,190
Damn it...

525
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,240
One shouldn't get involved in something like this.

526
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,950
He's not the only one who'd lose out either.

527
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,100
Yes...

528
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,870
What about those already involved?

529
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,490
I'll be back after making a quick phone call.

530
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

531
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,190
   

532
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,000
   

533
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,320
What is it?

534
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,210
Hyeong.

535
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,520
You sold them, right?

536
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,190
 What do you mean? 

537
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,990
The Jumbo stocks.

538
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,800
Did you sell them?

539
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,780
 I did. How many times do I have to tell you? 

540
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,370
Hyeong.

541
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,520
Didn't you sell them yet?

542
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,740
I mean,

543
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,830
it's supposed to rise again.

544
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,310
 Who told you that? 

545
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,610
I looked into it, too.

546
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,600
It will peak twice before crashing.

547
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,460
Like the humps on a camel's back.

548
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,440
 Don't believe that. 

549
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,510
 Hurry up and sell them. 

550
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,910
   

551
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,410
I sold them.

552
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,220
 You mean it, right? 

553
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,430
 You really sold them, right? 

554
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,030
I sold them, I sold them, I sold them!

555
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,280
You don't believe me?

556
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,120
I just lost my entire year's salary!

557
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,900
 All right. 

558
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,830
- How can I help you? 
 - Hi.

559
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,250
I want to apply for a business loan.

560
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,790
They told me to bring the seal certificate again.

561
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,330
But CEO, this can't be more than three months old.

562
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,830
That's why I got a new one.

563
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,800
Oh, then I'll process it for you.

564
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,430
- The amount is 1 billion won, right? 
 - Yes.

565
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,070
When will it be deposited?

566
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,540
It will be deposited right away

567
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,520
since it's already been processed.

568
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,100
Okay.

569
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,140
- Have a nice day. 
 - Thanks.

570
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,930
   

571
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,510
Oh, CEO.

572
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,590
Yes?

573
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,610
Just one moment.

574
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,100
Come to think of it,

575
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,800
we're a bit backed up on our reviews. It'll...

576
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,610
It'll take about a week.

577
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,740
Is there a chance it could fail in the review?

578
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,560
No, it'll definitely go through.

579
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,120
It's just going to take some time.

580
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,240
A week?

581
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,920
Yes. Exactly one week.

582
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,360
Let's just break even.

583
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,480
With 1 billion, even if it goes up by just 4%,

584
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,790
I'll break even...

585
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,000
Please, please.

586
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,950
Gosh, it went up.

587
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,030
Just a bit more.

588
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,110
   

589
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,180
These bastards think I'm an easy target?

590
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,140
   

591
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,340
   

592
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,260
Should I?

593
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,280
Shit...

594
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,900
What do others say?

595
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,790
Wait for now. It's on the rise.

596
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,310
Shit, should I buy it?

597
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,670
Buy or not?

598
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,870
Buy or not? Should I or not?

599
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,930
   

600
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,840
   

601
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,550
   

602
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,620
   

603
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,360
   

604
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,960
   

605
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,230
 Did you sell the shares, Mr. Ha? 

606
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,680
 What are you talking about? It wasn't me. 

607
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,610
Clean up the dirty dishes,

608
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,440
you scamming bastards.

609
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,470
   

610
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,050
   

611
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,760
   

612
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,490
What's this?

613
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,120
Someone bought it?

614
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,450
It rose to 20,900 won...

615
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,100
Someone bought my shares.

616
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,220
So?

617
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,610
Are you suspecting me?

618
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,290
Yes.

619
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,600
Mr. Yun.

620
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,830
We're here to discuss your disciplinary action.

621
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,780
No, that's all right.

622
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,260
Let's get everything out in the open.

623
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,940
All right.

624
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,460
Your brother had 100 million worth of Jumbo stocks,

625
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,650
based on the information you gave him.

626
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,850
You admit that, right?

627
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,130
Yes.

628
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,610
But you had ten times that amount.

629
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,200
Yet, you say I manipulated the stock price?

630
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,190
Not you?

631
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,670
Moreover,

632
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,700
you even submitted a report saying

633
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,270
we should invest in Jumbo.

634
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,760
As I mentioned, I reported again, saying

635
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,880
we shouldn't invest in Jumbo.

636
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,930
All right.

637
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,150
Let's assume you told me not to invest in Jumbo.

638
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,110
But wouldn't that make it a perfect crime for you?

639
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,040
The stock price doesn't rise only if we invest.

640
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,140
As long as rumors spread that we are investing,

641
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,230
the price will go up.

642
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,650
At that point, you could sell and exit.

643
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,650
Thus,

644
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,380
you said we shouldn't buy Jumbo

645
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,580
so you can make an alibi.

646
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,560
What do you think? Am I wrong?

647
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,620
I suppose that could've happened.

648
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,350
However,

649
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,520
that didn't happen.

650
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,830
What?

651
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,460
What do you mean by that?

652
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,420
My brother couldn't sell his stocks and exit.

653
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,740
That's why the evidence is still left.

654
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,670
I see.

655
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,750
He didn't sell the stocks?

656
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,230
So he's innocent since he didn't profit from it?

657
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,300
Hey, Mr. Yun.

658
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,030
Do you really not know

659
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,210
or are you pretending not to know?

660
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,650
The fact that you held those stocks

661
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,110
makes you a criminal!

662
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,850
That's not what Mr. Yun is saying.

663
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,850
Yes, please explain. What? What is it?

664
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,130
What is he talking about?

665
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,450
Mr. Yun is talking about his brother.

666
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,180
That he couldn't sell the stocks...

667
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,810
and passed away.

668
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,840
Even that!

669
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,340
You keep blaming your

670
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,850
dead brother and trying to escape!

671
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,010
Is shifting the blame on the deceased

672
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,530
something a person should do?

673
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,440
Mr. Ha!

674
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,380
All right.

675
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,890
Okay.

676
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,330
Then explain this.

677
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,980
Why did you hold Jumbo stocks?

678
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,040
50,000 shares, at that?

679
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,830
Those...

680
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,570
weren't mine.

681
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,700
What?

682
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,750
Come on, Mr. Yun.

683
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,670
Even so...

684
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,990
It's a notice to attend the shareholders' meeting

685
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,200
because you have 50,000 shares.

686
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,690
If you deny this,

687
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,740
we won't be able to talk anymore.

688
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,930
You have to admit this.

689
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,680
I'm saying this because I feel sorry for you.

690
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,720
The Gold Line is at an adult's

691
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,250
eye level, which is best.

692
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,840
That will be 7 million won.

693
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,240
If you go above that, it's 6 million won,

694
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,510
but most people choose the Gold Line.

695
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,610
Otherwise, it's hard to look at your eye level.

696
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,930
   

697
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,420
Many people go for the upper ones as well.

698
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,590
I'll choose that one.

699
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,230
By chance, are you a Buddhist?

700
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,510
If you are, we have a special event for Buddhists.

701
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,170
It's okay.

702
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,890
Oh, well..

703
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,780
for those who committed suicide...

704
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,370
Buddha believes

705
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,910
the sins of people living in the same world

706
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,610
cannot be overlooked. So—

707
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,350
We're not Buddhists.

708
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh, I see.

709
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,900
I heard his brother died in his place.

710
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,920
Gosh, stop with such nonsense!

711
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,720
The higher-ups at Sanin came.

712
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,470
That's what they said.

713
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,110
What did they say?

714
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,520
I heard he did stocks with Ju No.

715
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,380
So that's why?

716
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,210
What is it?

717
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,930
Well, when the employee here

718
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,600
said she feels bad for his brother

719
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,510
and wanted to pray for him, he refused,

720
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,450
saying he's not a Buddhist.

721
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,050
That's really messed up.

722
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,150
She's become an orphan now.

723
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,010
   

724
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,230
Aigoo, she doesn't even have a mom.

725
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,390
Who would raise her now?

726
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,490
Isn't your child around her age, Brother-in-law?

727
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,460
It'd be easier and better if you raised her as well.

728
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,510
You think it's easy to raise someone else's child?

729
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,570
You shouldn't say that, even in jest.

730
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,350
Hey, you're going through a lot.

731
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,110
No, I'm fine.

732
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:29,530
 ­To die is to have that one piece of cloud disappear 

733
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,920
Oh Wun.

734
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:50,460
Let's live together now.

735
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,440
So from now on, call me Daddy,

736
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,220
okay?

737
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,950
Mr. Yun.

738
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,700
 ­Oh. 

739
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,200
Yes?

740
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,410
Well, I looked into what you asked about.

741
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,770
The inheritance?

742
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,320
Yes.

743
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,540
The amount your brother embezzled

744
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,760
before he died was 1 billion won.

745
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,080
And he doesn't have much wealth.

746
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,960
So if you end up inheriting,

747
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,110
you'll also inherit the compensation responsibility.

748
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,900
Thus, you'll face more debt than anything. So...

749
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,190
Will it be passed on to Oh Wun?

750
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,580
Yes.

751
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,800
The first in line would be your niece,

752
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,370
but she's still a minor.

753
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:10,690
So as the second in line, you'd have to handle it.

754
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,740
So both Yun Oh Wun and you should give up on it.

755
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,330
No.

756
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,500
I'll accept the inheritance.

757
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,340
Then

758
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,110
you'll need to pay off the debt in his place.

759
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,480
Yes.

760
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,810
What I inherited includes

761
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,350
not only the 1 billion to be repaid to the bank,

762
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,830
but also 50,000 shares of Jumbo stock.

763
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,790
So...

764
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,610
the 50,000 shares on that shareholder meeting invite

765
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,360
for Jumbo Pharma

766
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,730
wasn't originally mine,

767
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,480
but my brother's, which I inherited.

768
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,330
Is that true?

769
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,840
You inherited his debt?

770
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,500
One billion won, at that?

771
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,930
- Do you have proof? 
 - That's not what's important!

772
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,290
Just from what's been revealed so far,

773
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,000
you illegally used insider information,

774
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,880
did proxy trading,

775
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,300
and direct stock manipulation...

776
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,370
- Right? 
 - Reputation damage for the company

777
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,740
and breach of trust could apply as well.

778
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,060
So you're fired.

779
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,990
You got that?

780
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,640
I request the opportunity to explain myself.

781
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,960
We don't need to hear it.

782
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,010
Write your resignation and get lost.

783
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,780
Are you saying that officially?

784
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,680
Well, it's not official.

785
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,720
   

786
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:49,610
Then could you give me some time to think?

787
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,950
How much time do you need?

788
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,360
About two hours.

789
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,520
Will two hours be enough?

790
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,040
Yes.

791
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,670
All right.

792
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,470
Then get some fresh air for two hours.

793
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,320
It's already time for lunch.

794
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,960
Let's all come back after lunch.

795
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,150
We'll suspend the session for now.

796
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,660
Do you think it's true?

797
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,110
That he inherited his brother's debt?

798
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,600
Mr. Lee.

799
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,290
Is it true?

800
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,190
I'm not sure.

801
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,480
How could you give Yun Ju No time

802
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,750
because he asked for it?

803
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,260
And Mr. Jo! What, w-were you that hungry?

804
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,260
It's not like that, Mr. Ha.

805
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,020
If we punish him without a chance

806
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,630
to explain himself, it can become a problem later on.

807
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,440
What problem?

808
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,420
If you look at the procedure,

809
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,750
it says a chance to explain oneself should be given.

810
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,390
If we punish him without doing so,

811
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,740
he could argue in court

812
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,740
that we didn't follow the procedure.

813
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,400
Could he use that to nullify the punishment later?

814
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,420
If it's someone like Mr. Yun, he may be able to.

815
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,810
Oh, that's it.

816
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,900
What could he possibly do in two hours?

817
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,210
In my opinion,

818
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,310
Yun Ju No's only escape was to say

819
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,390
we didn't follow the procedure.

820
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,990
So he played his last card available?

821
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,620
Yes. It's not that I catered to Mr. Yun.

822
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,620
I just didn't want to give him a way out, Mr. Ha.

823
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,510
Okay, then, what's left now?

824
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,210
In two hours, you can punish him right away.

825
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,050
Okay.

826
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,660
Okay.

827
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,710
This jerk...

828
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,610
Look what he bought to wear after making money.

829
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,630
Gosh, my legs.

830
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,460
   

831
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,100
Damn it.

832
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,440
I don't know anymore.

833
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,240
I'll end up in prison again.

834
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,110
- Mr. Yun. 
 - How did the hearing go?

835
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,180
Did they decide?

836
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,540
Not yet.

837
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,020
By chance, did anyone come to see me?

838
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,070
No, no one.

839
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,500
Yes.

840
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,510
 Hey, I found Dr. Go's laptop. 

841
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,070
 But it's locked with a password. 

842
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,140
Did you unlock the password?

843
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,790
 No, of course not. 

844
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,160
You said you found it.

845
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,130
I said I found the laptop.

846
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,600
I couldn't open it because I don't know the password.

847
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,720
I'll just bring the entire laptop to you.

848
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,520
 Okay. Come here for now. 

849
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,130
Okay.

850
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,040
By chance,

851
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,390
do you know how to unlock a laptop password?

852
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,770
No.

853
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,400
Do we need to hack into it?

854
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,690
Do you know how to hack?

855
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,630
Me?

856
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,190
Couldn't CEO Cha Ho Jin unlock the password?

857
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,150
Cha Cha Games?

858
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,910
Oh, no, no!

859
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,000
Yes, what is it?

860
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,420
 Hey, why isn't CEO Cha not picking up his phone? 

861
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,480
Oh, he's busy...

862
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,970
pivoting.

863
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,400
 We have an urgent request for him. 

864
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,330
Right now?

865
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,470
Okay, we'll be there.

866
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,140
CEO.

867
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,470
Stop playing basketball.

868
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,020
We need to go to Sanin right now.

869
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,630
Where?

870
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,180
Sanin?

871
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,770
This is my seonbae.

872
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,760
Here.

873
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,000
- Did you get caught? 
 - No.

874
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,740
But he'll find out soon. His laptop disappeared.

875
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,770
But what do we do about the password?

876
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,530
I'm not sure.

877
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,130
I think I'll need to head back in.

878
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,760
Okay. We'll contact you when we unlock the password.

879
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,430
Thank you.

880
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,550
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

881
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,360
- Goodbye. 
 - Oh, okay.

882
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,580
I fulfilled all I had to do.

883
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,500
Yes. Great work.

884
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,510
I'll call you.

885
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,070
Don't call me.

886
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,960
Take care of yourself.

887
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,820
We'll end the break and reconvene.

888
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,410
Though it was brief,

889
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,540
may we assume it was enough time for you

890
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,480
to prepare an explanation, Mr. Yun?

891
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,900
Yes.

892
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,630
Go ahead.

893
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,810
My brother learned of

894
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,530
Sanin's Jumbo investment plan from me,

895
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,200
and he bought and sold Jumbo stock worth 100 million.

896
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,180
In the process, he suffered a great loss,

897
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,860
and to recover that,

898
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,470
I suspect he illegally used 1 billion in bank funds

899
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,800
to buy 50,000 shares again.

900
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,440
So...

901
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,760
you have nothing to do with those 50,000 shares?

902
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,430
You didn't know?

903
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,970
I didn't realize my brother had so many shares

904
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,360
until I went through the inheritance process.

905
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,000
We've already heard that.

906
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,380
- If there's nothing new— 
 - However,

907
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,920
I suspect that with that amount of shares,

908
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,080
it might've been from the players in the scheme.

909
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,480
The timing of when my brother

910
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,640
traded 1 billion won worth of Jumbo shares

911
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,090
was during collusive trading.

912
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,150
When shares were exchanged only among the players.

913
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,630
So what are you saying?

914
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,940
Are you saying your brother was a scheme member?

915
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,200
No.

916
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,040
Someone among the players betrayed

917
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,920
and sold 50,000 of their shares,

918
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,290
and I wonder if my brother

919
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,490
happened to buy them.

920
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:07,130
Gosh, that sounds like too much of a coincidence.

921
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,630
I can understand why you might think that.

922
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,410
- So— 
 - So,

923
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,720
you keep saying you suspect me.

924
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,640
Mr. Lee, you remember, right?

925
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,310
I said we must not buy Jumbo.

926
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,280
Yes.

927
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,840
Who bought up my shares?

928
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,900
   

929
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,450
That jerk...

930
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,910
Mr. Lee, we need to release an article quickly.

931
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,390
What's the matter?

932
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,040
Sanin may end up

933
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,100
being involved in stock manipulation.

934
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,330
So we need to release an article now and say

935
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,000
we're not involved, and we're not investing.

936
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,510
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

937
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,870
We need to release an article quickly.

938
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:36,710
So

939
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,250
I'm the one who stopped that.

940
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,710
You remember it, right?

941
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,310
Yes.

942
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,530
Yes. Thanks to me,

943
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,340
Sanin avoided what could've been a big problem.

944
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,080
If I was involved in it,

945
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,520
would I have said we must not buy Jumbo?

946
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,580
Just as you suspected me,

947
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,590
isn't it possible that you were trying to

948
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,800
create an alibi?

949
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,840
What?

950
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,960
So

951
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,000
do you have proof of that?

952
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,440
We've got so much evidence against you,

953
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,730
but do you have even

954
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,270
one piece of evidence against me?

955
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,650
- Hello. 
 - You made it.

956
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,680
- Hello. 
 - What password do you need to unlock?

957
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,260
It's this.

958
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,680
It's the laptop of a stock manipulation suspect.

959
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,750
A file on this laptop can prove Mr. Yun's innocence.

960
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,370
Since you're an expert in this field, CEO Cha...

961
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,880
And you've done hacking as well.

962
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,330
I was the victim of hacking. I never did it.

963
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,110
Right, you were the victim.

964
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,190
Also...

965
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:49,050
hacking like this is only in the movies.

966
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:52,460
I can't do it like that. It'd take way too long too.

967
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,770
No, CEO Cha.

968
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,410
 ­Oh, 

969
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,660
Is this urgent?

970
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,260
Yes.

971
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,280
Do you have a screwdriver?

972
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,940
A s-screwdriver? Oh, yes. H-Here.

973
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,410
I have evidence.

974
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,930
As I explained, the players don't trust each other.

975
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,470
They record the amounts of money exchanged,

976
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,200
the dates, and transaction details.

977
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,900
This includes phone calls and even text messages.

978
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,650
They keep a record of their crimes?

979
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,380
Yes.

980
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,510
Since they don't want to die alone.

981
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,240
Just like how people used to give slush funds to

982
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,560
politicians and write in their ledgers.

983
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,190
Yes.

984
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,670
That's why they leave a record of all the evidence.

985
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,910
So?

986
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,560
Where is that evidence?

987
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,970
Do Han Cheol did this to me, too.

988
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,760
DC.

989
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,040
I know already.

990
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,650
Could you lend me your laptop?

991
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:37,620
Oh, okay.

992
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,560
   

993
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,480
This can work like this?

994
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,370
- What were you looking for? 
 - Ha Tae Su.

995
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,480
   

996
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,120
 Did my name appear 

997
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,690
in their files or something?

998
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,320
I'm sorry. I have something to give to Mr. Yun.

999
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,500
What is it?

1000
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,900
   

1001
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,070
This is the record of Mr. Ha

1002
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,090
using insider info to trade Jumbo shares.

1003
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,100
From April 26th to April 29th of 2021,

1004
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:45,110
he bought a total of 25,000 shares over four days.

1005
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,210
On May 3rd at 12:10 p.m.,

1006
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,670
he bought an additional 25,000 shares,

1007
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:53,500
bringing the total to 50,000 shares,

1008
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,970
valued at 1 billion won at that time.

1009
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,700
Then 27 minutes later, at 12:37 p.m.,

1010
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,790
he sold all his shares.

1011
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,830
Wait, it's not like that.

1012
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,170
T-This is manipulated.

1013
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,100
I'm really innocent!

1014
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,550
Gosh, I...

1015
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:34,110
I-I feel so falsely accused that I want to cry.

1016
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,090
And this is the transaction record

1017
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,860
of my brother, Yun Ju Seok.

1018
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,330
On April 29th of 2021 at 9:10 a.m.,

1019
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,640
he purchased 100 million won worth of shares,

1020
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,760
and sold everything four days later.

1021
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,270
However,

1022
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,430
he bought 50,000 shares again 30 minutes later.

1023
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:04,430
At that time, the value was 1 billion won.

1024
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,340
This was...

1025
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,560
just one minute after Mr. Ha sold

1026
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,760
all 50,000 of his shares.

1027
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,830
So

1028
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,830
the shares that Mr. Ha dumped

1029
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,920
were purchased by my brother, Yun Ju Seok.

1030
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:23,370
That night, Sanin released an article saying

1031
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,990
they won't invest in Jumbo.

1032
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:27,200
The next day, Jumbo's stock

1033
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,420
crashed when the market opened,

1034
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,600
continually hitting the lower limit price after that.

1035
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,120
And my brother...

1036
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:39,040
never managed to sell the stocks and exit.

1037
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,010
So?

1038
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:47,260
Are you saying your brother's death is my fault?

1039
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't think that.

1058
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,800
Because of me...

1059
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,700
Because of me, Hyeong...

1060
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,590
No...

1061
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,900
Don't say that.

1062
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,550
No...

1063
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,310
It's my fault...

1064
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,140
 However... 

1065
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,940
I just wanted to know the truth.

1066
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,910
And I just found out what the truth is.

1067
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,820
According to this record,

1068
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,840
Mr. Ha participated in stock manipulation.

1069
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,840
After hearing my report on Jumbo,

1070
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,910
he sold all his stocks secretly

1071
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,590
to escape from the players.

1072
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,100
Then, my brother

1073
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,340
received those stocks.

1074
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,450
I just held them for a short while and sold them.

1075
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:07,700
I didn't make any money from it!

1076
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,750
Mr. Ha, you probably did make money,

1077
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,620
though not as much as planned.

1078
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,700
Even if that's not the case,

1079
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,650
simply having held Jumbo stock makes you guilty,

1080
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,540
just as you told me today.

1081
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,420
Bring that here.

1082
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:32,430
You should come over here, Mr. Ha.

1083
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,260
The seat for the person under disciplinary review...

1084
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:37,870
is over here.

1085
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,530
You jerk! Come here!

1086
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,540
- Mr. Ha. Mr. Ha. 
 - Move! Hey, Yun Ju No!

1087
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,520
- Move! Hey, you jerk! 
 - Wait, Mr. Ha.

1088
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,560
I helped make Sanin what it is today, you jerk!

1089
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,320
Move. Move! I said, move, you jerks!

1090
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,350
You jerks were in diapers

1091
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,050
when I entered this company!

1092
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,290
Hey, you're using force? Stop it!

1093
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,130
Hey! Hey, Yun Ju No!

1094
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,400
Hey, move! Hey!

1095
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,430
Then

1096
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:22,130
it was really Mr. Ha who did it?

1097
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:29,450
Mr. Yun did leak the info to his brother,

1098
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,760
but it doesn't seem to be intentional—

1099
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,150
But his brother died.

1100
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:41,250
We can't really say anything about that, can we?

1101
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,550
Then...

1102
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,790
what about Mr. Ha?

 Mr. Ha did a lot of work. 

1113
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,310
 Construction was his work, 

1114
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:31,820
 and he brought in funds. He went through a lot. 

1115
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,620
 How old is Mr. Ha again? 

1116
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:38,670
 I believe he's still a bit away from turning 60. 

1117
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,020
 Then he's still young. 

1118
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,980
 I guess he's worked a bit too much. 

1119
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,230
 He's gotten so worn out. 

1120

 Hey, at Yun Ju No's disciplinary hearing, 

1147
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,250
 Mr. Ha was fired. 

1148
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,740
 Really? Mr. Ha was fired? 

1149
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,580
 Yes, he came in late at night to pick up his stuff. 

1150
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,330
 I heard he didn't even get severance. 

1151
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:33,670
 Wow, the number two guy was taken down in one blow. 

1152
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,810
 What if Mr. Ha sues the company 

1153
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:38,700
 for something like unfair dismissal? 

1154
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,740
 There's no such thing for an executive. 

1155
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,620
 He was probably fired for a good reason. 

1156
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:47,290
 But Yun Ju No really is amazing. 

1157
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,380
 Maybe he's really the chairman's son. 

1158
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:51,090
 Gosh, I told you he's not. 

1159
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,350
 Does he resemble the chairman? 

1160
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:56,190
 The chairman's son is in the U.S. 

1161
01:15:56,190 --> 01:16:01,220
 Hey, I thought Mr. Yun came from Hawaii. 

1162
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,900
 That's the U.S. 

1163
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,660
 Huh? Is that right? 

1164
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:09,890
♫    ♫

1165
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,060
   

1166
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,530
I'll take 10,000 won worth.

1167
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,840
- Automatic ones? 
 - Yes.

1168
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,090
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

1169
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,500
- Have a good day. 
 - Bye.

1170
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,400
Hey, I had a dream

1171
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,220
where stars turned into numbers and fell on me.

1172
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,000
That's amazing, right?

1173
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,040
What if I hit the jackpot this time?

1174
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,870
How long will you believe in stuff like this?

1175
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:13,060
I'll do it until I win.

1176
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,820
It will happen.

1177
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,590
What will you do if you win?

1178
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,600
I'll buy a house.

1179
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,120
- An apartment? 
 - No.

1180
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,000
I'll buy a house with a big yard.

1181
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,630
Like the ones in the movies. With a basement too.

1182
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,000
I've got a plan for everything.

1183
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,440
You, me, your wife, and Oh Wun.

1184
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,130
Let's all live together there.

1185
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:41,230
I don't want to.

1186
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:44,280
Listen to you. Then hand that over.

1187
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,100
You said you don't want to. Give it back.

1188
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,780
You said you had a good dream.

1189
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,890
 You said you don't want to. You're not interested! 

1190
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,470
Hey.

1191
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:46,350
I thought you'd buy me beef to thank me.

1192
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,000
- Please give us beef sandwiches. 
 - Okay.

1193
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,470
That's beef.

1194
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,340
Is it really beef?

1195
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,140
Yes, it is.

1196
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,300
Hey.

1197
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:16,900
Why did you trust me?

1198
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,270
I didn't trust you.

1199
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:24,470
Yet you asked me to do such a thing?

1200
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:28,790
I just felt like you had quite a few grievances.

1201
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,200
I can't complain about falling while stealing.

1202
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:40,720
Why didn't you file for bankruptcy, Hyeong?

1203
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,390
Aren't you an expert in that field?

1204
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,000
You did that to pay off the debt, right?

1205
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,940
Who says that?

1206
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:55,650
Aren't you delivering water to pay off the debt?

1207
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,070
But how much of it did you pay off?

1208
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,490
I haven't paid off much of it yet.

1209
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:08,320
I should work hard since I'm not making a dent in it.

1210
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,270
What about you?

1211
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:13,110
How much of your brother's debt did you pay off?

1212
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,050
Well,

1213
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,330
I happen to make pretty good money.

1214
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,420
You're so annoying.

1215
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,440
What is this?

1216
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,660
Who ordered bottled water

1217
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,700
when we have a water dispenser.

1218
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,120
Did you order it, Doctor?

1219
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,150
Didn't you order it?

1220
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,940
- Who... 
 - You're Lee Seung Su, right?

1221
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,910
Why?

1222
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,420
We came from Gangnam Police Station.

1223
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,150
Lee Seung Su is currently in the restroom—

1224
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,890
- No, no. Wait. It's not me. 
 - Let's go together.

1225
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:03,370
No, wait, wait. No.

1226
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,670
Are you arresting me without evidence?

1227
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,590
   

1228
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,050
   

1229
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:30,630
Who sent this?

1230
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:33,550
I don't know.

1231
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,920
Jin Su, good morning.

1232
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,300
- Good morning, Attorney. 
 - Hello.

1233
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,860
Ms. Kwak, we run to you here.

1234
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,070
Yes, Jin Su.

1235
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,030
 The elevator doors are closing. 

1236
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,060
You're here?

1237
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,860
Did you stay up all night here?

1238
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,940
No, I just came in a bit early.

1239
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,920
You should rest a bit.

1240
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,310
I'll rest once this job is done.

1241
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,090
Should we hold a quick meeting?

1242
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,120
Okay.

1243
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,910
This is the business plan report

1244
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,690
for next year, as requested by PPF.

1245
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:19,190
It includes how we plan to repay the remaining debt

1246
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:24,850
and what business direction Sanin intends to take.

1247
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,940
We did borrow money from PPF,

1248
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,670
but can they really demand something like this?

1249
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,920
We borrowed 3 trillion won, so they can.

1250
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,480
The interest rate is 9%, right?

1251
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,460
Yes. If it gets re-fixed, the conversion price

1252
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,590
gets a 30% discount.

1253
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:40,970
In that case, the majority shareholder will change.

1254
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,400
Yes.

1255
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:46,180
I guess today's briefing will be crucial.

1256
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,630
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

1257
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,290
Come here and help me.

1258
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:59,120
But I'm part of the M&amp;A Team.

1259
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,770
Gosh, that low-level intern!

1260
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:02,870
Hey! Where are you going?

1261
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,240
Help me.

1262
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,920
Come here.

1263
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,260
Jin Su, take a look.

1264
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,400
Just make sure...

1265
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,950
there are set like this, okay?

1266
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,500
Hey, you know, last time...

1267
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,910
about Yun Ju No...

1268
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,580
About Mr. Yun...

1269
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,420
well,

1270
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,770
him being the chairman's son...

1271
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:40,930
Who did you hear that from?

1272
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,250
I'm not sure.

1273
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,830
I think I just happened to hear it in passing.

1274
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:48,640
Why? Wasn't he supposed to be his son-in-law?

1275
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,310
Is that right?

1276
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:54,300
There's a rumor going around the company...

1277
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,230
Yun Ju No took down Mr. Ha.

1278
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,440
A team leader took down a managing director.

1279
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,840
He took down the number two guy.

1280
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,360
It's not that Mr. Yun took him down.

1281
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,210
Mr. Ha was ousted because of corruption.

1282
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:12,590
Hey. Still, you think that's possible in a company?

1283
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,790
So what?

1284
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:17,380
So people are wondering if Yun Ju No,

1285
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:24,410
I mean, Mr. Yun might be the chairman's son.

1286
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,870
Did you just laugh at me?

1287
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:31,500
That makes no sense, though.

1288
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,440
They have different last names.

1289
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,280
Hey, he could be an illegitimate son!

1290
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,030
No, he's not.

1291
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,150
Really?

1292
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,900
Oh, then, what about that?

1293
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,860
Mr. Yun Ju No's...

1294
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:53,700
nickname Baeksa means "white thread."

1295
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,020
Because his hair is white.

1296
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,140
Is that true?

1297
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,990
Yes, let's just say that it is.

1298
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:02,770
This jerk. Feels like you're looking down on me.

1299
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,900
You can feel that?

1300
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,260
You get over here.

1301
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,700
Acting all cocky

1302
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,300
believing your team leader has your back?

1303
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,720
Hello.

1304
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,900
Hello.

1305
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

1306
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,430
Jin Su, should we set up the PPT?

1307
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:22,940
Okay.

 Okay. 

1316
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:08,820
Then you're saying I need to sit in as well?

01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,920
Team Leader Yun Ju No.

1323
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:51,620
When is the chairman coming?

1324
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:56,440
It'd be good if he arrived before PPF.

1325
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,780
Who does the PPF think they are that

1326
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,380
they're asking the chairman to come?

1327
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,400
The fund guys throwing their weight around isn't new.

1328
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,970
They were curious about our business plan.

1329
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:11,990
And our loan maturity is approaching.

1330
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,200
If we can't extend the loan,

1331
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,680
that'll be a big problem.

1332
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,150
It will be a big problem, indeed.

1333
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:20,780
Wouldn't it mean we'd lose the company?

1334
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,150
You prepared well for this, right?

1335
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,620
Yes.

1336
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,660
The chairman is coming.

1337
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:44,000
Take a seat.

1338
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:54,860
So I heard they asked to see me.

1339
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:58,270
Part of the reason they're coming is to greet you.

1340
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:01,770
It'd be good if you exchanged pleasantries with them.

1341
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:06,480
The PPF has arrived.

1342
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:16,960
Aigoo, hello, Chairman.

1343
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,810
Aigoo, CEO David. Thanks to you, I'm doing well.

1344
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:25,720
- Please take a seat. 
 - Okay.

1345
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,330
   

1346
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,990
Then should we get started?

1347
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,680
All right, let's start.

1348
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,350
Wait. One of our directors hasn't arrived yet.

1349
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,400
Let's start a bit later.

1350
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,380
I was wondering why you came alone today.

1351
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,660
Pardon?

1352
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:49,850
Oh, it's not like that.

1353
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,790
We hired one more director.

1354
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:53,580
Oh, is that so?

1355
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,790
So I came to introduce him to you all.

1356
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:58,480
He'll be here soon.

1357
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,880
- Hey. 
 - There he is.

1358
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,710
Aigoo.

1359
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,330
Hello, Chairman.

1360
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:09,840
Hurry up and take a seat.

1361
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,560
All right, let me introduce myself.

1362
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:25,340
 ­  

1363
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,530
Mr. Ha.

1364
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:35,970
Yes?

1365
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,290
Is this where you ended up going?

1366
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,380
Yes, I'm a director of PPF now.

1367
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,640
It's a small field, isn't it?

1368
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,520
I wasn't originally in charge of this,

1369
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,270
but they handed it over to me.

1370
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:57,720
Since I know Sanin the best

1371
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,760
and have a deep affection for it.

1372
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,580
Long time no see.

1373
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:04,780
Yes.

1374
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,320
Then I'll present next year's business plan.

1375
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,550
Come on.

1376
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,810
What would a team leader know...

1377
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,870
to dare talk about the future of the company?

1378
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,750
In front of the chairman.

1379
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:25,690
The chairman has incredible insights.

1380
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:29,120
I've learned a lot from him.

1381
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,820
So how about you show us how it's done, chairman?

1382
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,960
♫  Money takes the heart  ♫

1383
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,070
You want me to do it?

1384
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:40,720
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

1385
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,240
Why? You don't want to?

1386
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,580
♫  For all your calculations  ♫

1387
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:11,090
Okay. Well, I mean, in that case...

1388
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:16,500
♫  There'll be no consolation  ♫

1389
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:21,200
Then I'll present Sanin Group's 2025 business plan.

1390
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,100
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

1391
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,900
   

1392
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,630
♫  All that glitter is cold  ♫

1393
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:35,600
♫  You know you're gonna lose it someday  ♫

1394
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,890
♫  Signs, crimes  ♫

1395
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:40,420
♫  There's no shine to that gold  ♫

1396
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,620
♫  When money takes your heart away  ♫

1397
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:47,560
♫  It takes your heart away  ♫

1398
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:58,020
♫  On the road to the road above you  ♫

1399
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:01,460
   

1400
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:04,630
♫  Measure each move you make  ♫

1401
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:09,300
♫  Hold on to the ones who love you  ♫

1402
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,200
♫  Don't let money take your heart  ♫

01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,770
♫  Money take your heart  ♫

1404
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:17,350
♫  Money take your heart away  ♫

1405
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:19,490
♫  Take your heart away  ♫

1406
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:21,490
♫  Feed your greed  ♫

1407

1413
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,560
   

1414
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:59,700
Dr. Park, you can prepare blue clothes for the baby.

1415
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:02,600
Is it a son?

1416
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,670
The father is happy, too, right?

1417
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,630
Yes.

1418
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,910
Thanks for the beef.

1419
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,460
Sure.

1420
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,610
Well, my part is done now, right?

1421
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,990
No.

1422
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,700
You've got to earn your keep.

1423
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:53,660
