12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,470
Then please let me know tomorrow

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,050
how I can save my Dado Resort.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,990
CEO.

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,950
We are considering selling Dado Resort.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,520
So?

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,960
I wondered if you knew about that.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,570
Yes.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,200
But it's fine.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,220
Because...

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,920
I'm not going to sell Dado Resort.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,450
I see.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,050
Everyone,

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,830
good night!

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,160
What's this tension?

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,700
She's smiling, but it's scary.

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,110
   

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,900
It will be 360,000 won.

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,380
Okay.

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,970
- Thank you. 
 - Okay, thank you.

31
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,100
So is the food to your liking?

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,500
Yes, it's good.

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,030
How about you, Director?

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,300
But, Mr. Ha,

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,760
I heard you have something to say.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,940
What other request would Sanin make of PPF?

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,800
We were thinking of getting an additional loan.

38
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,170
And I thought...

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,140
you'd apologize for screwing up the last deal.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,650
Oh, that?

41
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,960
Didn't I apologize for that?

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm sorry. Gosh...

43
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,520
That could happen.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,230
It's not like we lost any money anyway.

45
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,580
If you'd think that, I'd appreciate it.

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,800
Honestly, if a scheme

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,880
profits you once out of three tries,

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,040
you did pretty well.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,810
A hit every three at-bats makes you an ace.

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,070
So, how much?

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,840
Oh, well, it's not that much.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,670
About 55 billion?

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,580
That amount shouldn't be a problem.

54
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,780
What are the conditions?

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,550
The interest should be at least double digits.

56
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,140
Since I feel bad about what happened last time,

57
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,880
we'll give you 10% interest.

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,450
With Sanin's stocks as collateral.

59
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,440
What do you think?

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,270
But Mr. Ha...

61
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,630
Yes?

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,370
You know that Sanin already owes us 3 trillion, right?

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,030
Of course, I know.

64
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,320
But adding 55 billion on top of that

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,910
wouldn't change much, right?

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,800
It would.

67
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,530
Someone who already borrowed 3 trillion won

68
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,230
asks to borrow 55 billion more?

69
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,140
So Sanin doesn't have 55 billion won?

70
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,020
Then could they repay the 3 trillion won?

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,080
That thought came to my mind.

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,130
What do you take our Sanin for?

73
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,940
We can't help but feel uneasy about it, Mr. Ha.

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,450
Okay, okay, okay. I understand.

75
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,540
I forgot to give you an explanation.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,220
So what happened was...

77
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,600
Why do all the chairmen want to own a resort?

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,610
Resort?

79
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,150
Yes.

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,110
I guess our chairman found a resort he liked.

81
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,760
But he must've been in such a rush,

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,710
thinking someone else might buy it first,

83
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,680
that he got a loan with his stocks as collateral.

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,940
With Sanin's stocks?

85
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,320
Yes! Goodness.

86
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,430
And he just told us about it

87
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,800
when the deadline is less than a month away.

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,890
Who handled getting the loan? Mr. Yun?

89
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,250
Gosh, Mr. Yun lacks the experience to do that.

90
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,040
I think he ordered the Secretariat to handle it.

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,880
But what do the secretaries know?

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,070
When I looked at the contract,

93
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,580
- they signed a contract a fool wouldn't sign. 
 - Goodness.

94
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,040
He should've had you handle it, Mr. Ha.

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,890
The chairman was probably embarrassed about it.

96
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,770
Since he was trying to buy a resort

97
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,570
when his company is hanging between life and death.

98
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,620
Which resort?

99
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,730
I don't know which one either.

100
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,140
In any case, that's why he got the loan.

101
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,010
It has nothing to do with the company.

102
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,290
Well, then...

103
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,900
let's set it at 15%.

104
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,210
Fifteen percent...

105
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,360
I mean, I think it's reasonable,

106
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,450
but our chairman is so stingy.

107
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,260
I'll have to get to the office and see how things are.

108
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,280
If it's not possible, don't push yourself.

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm not saying it's not possible, CEO. Geez.

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,570
- You know that I like PPF. 
 - Gosh...

111
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,940
We like Sanin a lot, too.

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,900
Go and pay for the meal. We can't let him pay.

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,850
Gosh, come on!

114
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,000
I already paid, CEO.

115
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,830
All right, okay.

116
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,980
I'll go back and make sure to set the rate you want.

117
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,390
I can't do whatever I want at Sanin just yet.

118
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,240
Please understand.

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,750
Then will it benefit us if you become the CEO?

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,030
Of course!

121
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,170
I'll promise you that here right now.

122
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,330
Honestly, our chairman won't last much longer.

123
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,400
His judgment is also getting clouded.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,080
Oh, is that so?

125
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,870
That's why...

126
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,890
That's why he'd buy a resort

127
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,420
when the company is in this state.

128
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,500
Will this be okay without the chairman's approval?

129
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,760
Of course not.

130
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,260
But since we're here,

131
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,460
shouldn't we do due diligence?

132
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes. CEO Song Ji Oh is also curious about it.

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,870
What do you think after taking a look around?

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
There's a clear concept,

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,950
and it has a great interior, amenities, and view.

136
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,320
It's got everything.

137
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,560
The problem is...

138
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,500
 ever since CEO Song Ji Oh took over, 

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,340
 it hasn't been able to make a profit. 

140
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,310
 Changing the resort to fit her tastes is the reason. 

141
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,390
 A hotel needs to 

142
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,780
 satisfy certain conditions, 

143
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,790
 but because it tried to suit her tastes, 

144
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,330
 it couldn't do so. 

145
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,080
 I think that's why it's called a resort. 

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,990
 They say it's because the concept is "healing," 

147
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,740
 but having no commercial areas 

148
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,680
 or entertainment nearby is also a negative factor. 

149
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,670
We should also review the contract

150
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,680
to see if the fees need any adjustments.

151
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,920
For the interior design,

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,620
the flooring consists of irregular stones,

153
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,330
and most of the interior is made of wood,

154
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,780
which requires frequent maintenance and repairs.

155
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,370
That must add to the costs as well.

156
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,530
- Yes. 
 - Honestly,

157
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,970
this place isn't for making money.

158
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,870
It's a second-generation chaebol's hobby.

159
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,960
- Really? 
 - Yes.

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Chaebols each have a hotel or resort

161
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,660
like it's a luxury handbag

162
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,620
and decorate it in their own style,

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,990
acting like it's something amazing and unique.

164
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,670
So the problem is her management skills?

165
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes.

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,270
 Not only that, but the Room 123 that the CEO uses 

167
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,260
 has never been rented out. 

168
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,830
 In reality, 

169
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,310
 it's basically her personal luxury hobby. 

170
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,060
Will anyone want to buy this place?

171
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,730
Someone has been interested in buying this place.

172
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,310
Who?

173
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,610
Dolphin Hotel.

174
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,830
It's a hotel five minutes from here.

175
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,610
They want to acquire Dado Resort

176
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,440
and run it as their brand's premium resort.

177
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
What about the price?

178
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,170
Mr. Kang oversaw the negotiation as the underwriter,

179
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,630
and the offer then was 50 billion won.

180
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,140
Then couldn't you

181
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,650
negotiate it for 55 billion, Mr. Yun?

182
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,580
Do you think Mr. Yun is a scammer?

183
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,510
We should get at least 60 billion won.

184
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,680
But the problem is...

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,600
someone broke that deal unilaterally.

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,380
Who did?

187
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,060
CEO Song Ji Oh.

188
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:10,930
In the end, the main issue comes down to convincing CEO Song Ji Oh.

189
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,650
 Welcome. 

190
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,560
Mr. Ha.

191
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,420
Aigoo, Chief Secretary Park.

192
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,750
Take a seat.

193
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,560
What brings you to my neighborhood?

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,330
What do you mean? I was passing by and I stopped by because I thought of you.

195
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,350
- Why? You don't like it? 
 - Oh, no, no.

196
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,290
Thank you.

197
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,630
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

198
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,490
Thank you.

199
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,160
Just hold your glass. Don't drink it yet.

200
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,150
We should clink glasses, though.

201
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,880
Actually, I'm a bit disappointed, Chief Secretary Park.

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Pardon?

203
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,300
No, no, not because you didn't drink.

204
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,090
I'm not a boomer like that.

205
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,250
I'm not a good drinker.

206
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,910
Gosh, I told you that's not what this is about.

207
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,240
Then what is this about...

208
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,420
I mean, if the chairman was facing such an issue, you should consult me, you know.

209
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,420
I am Sanin's CFO, after all.

210
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,480
The chairman said it was top secret.

211
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,360
It's not even top secret anymore.

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,270
Tell me about it.

213
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,820
Pardon?

214
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,870
You know the chairman put Yun Ju No and me together on this, right?

215
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,880
Honestly, do you think we're on the same level?

216
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,600
Yun Ju No is below you, right?

217
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,490
Yes, well, the only thing I can tell you is...

218
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,490
Yes? What is it?

219
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,780
We need the 55 billion won quickly.

220
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,020
Is he not selling the resort?

221
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,770
No, that will never happen.

222
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,370
That 55 billion won loan needs to be paid in a month...

223
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,730
It's not that easy to borrow money.

224
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,210
There aren't many places that'd lend money even with high interest.

225
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,940
Yes, that's true.

226
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,520
Does the chairman also know it's a difficult task?

227
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,070
The Secretariat heard an earful because of that.

228
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,000
Then the chairman will accept it to an extent.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,260
If you resolve this situation, you will be of great help to the chairman.

230
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,770
- My car is over there. 
 - Thank you for the meal, Mr. Ha.

231
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,210
No, no. Let's eat something more expensive next time.

232
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,070
Okay. Should I call a taxi for you?

233
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,410
No, no. I already called a designated driver.

234
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,840
Okay, then.

235
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,460
See you.

236
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,370
 Yes, Mr. Ha. 

237
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,090
Aigoo, CEO David.

238
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,820
You know the 55 billion loan you promised to give us?

239
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,380
 The loan we'd give at the interest rate of 15%? 

240
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,130
Yes, 15%.

241
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,630
I'll do that for you.

242
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,800
 Oh, I see. 

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,140
 Did the chairman give his approval? 

244
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,310
I'll need to get that from him.

245
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,770
But how about this?

246
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,260
Have the PPF propose an interest rate of 18%.

247
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,530
That will make things easier for me.

248
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,250
 Oh, I see. 

249
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,430
 I understand what you're saying. Let's do that. 

250
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,750
It'd be great if I could decide things in one go,

251
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,900
but I don't have that kind of power yet.

252
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,960
 I guess so. 

253
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,280
 I hope you become the CEO soon. 

254
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,730
No, no.

255
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,900
Anyway, please send me a proposal like that.

256
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,090
 Okay. 

257
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,690
Okay, thank you.

258
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,070
Boss, you called for a designated driver, right?

259
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,420
Anyone can be a boss these days.

260
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,060
 It wasn't you? 

261
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,880
If this happens all the time, shouldn't she be admitted?

262
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,010
I know, right?

263
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,080
Excuse me.

264
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,550
Thank you.

265
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,070
Good morning, Ms. Kwak.

266
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes, good morning.

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,140
Here is the menu.

268
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,450
Thank you.

269
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,030
I see you woke up.

270
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,710
The attorney woke me up, saying we need to eat breakfast.

271
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,610
Hey, you need to eat breakfast. It's free.

272
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,830
Last night's dinner, we only had a tiny little bit.

273
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,350
I don't know why the lunch course meal was so small.

274
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,770
I'm starving.

275
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,030
Oh, right.

276
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,450
Is Mr. Yun not having breakfast?

277
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,700
Mr. Yun, aren't you going to eat?

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,230
Oh, yes.

279
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,380
I heard the morning view is great on that hill.

280
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,090
By chance...

281
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,250
You're not asking me to come with you, right?

282
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,060
Of course not. Enjoy your breakfast.

283
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,480
Okay.

284
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,110
Yes, this is Dado Resort Manager Lee Seung Su.

285
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,660
I have something to report.

286
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,060
Yes, Manager. What—

287
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,200
 I think Sanin employees are here. 

288
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,870
Pardon?

289
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,820
Who?

290
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,490
 I don't know who they are, 

291
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,650
 but you won't forget him if you see him once. 

292
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,160
If you say you will sell Dado Resort, that'd be good for us.

293
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,050
But...

294
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,580
do you mean it?

295
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,540
Did the CEO there really say she'll sell?

296
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,030
We're persuading her.

297
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,030
Come on.

298
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,020
Then let's talk after you persuade her.

299
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,660
We think Dolphin is the perfect candidate to acquire Dado Resort.

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,990
If the most ideal buyer has no interest, we have no reason to persuade her either.

301
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,630
So we came to ask about Dolphin's interest level.

302
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,350
I told you we'd be happy to.

303
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,020
But...

304
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,160
if you change your mind at the last minute, like last time,

305
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,300
that'd make me look bad.

306
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,100
Let me apologize for that on her behalf.

307
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,070
Let me explain why the last negotiation fell through.

308
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,760
It had nothing to do with you, CEO.

309
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,780
It was a personal issue with our Dado Resort CEO.

310
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,840
Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.

311
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,130
Then could I take it that you still have interest

312
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,630
in acquiring Dado Resort, CEO?

313
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,690
Dado Resort has value just from its symbolic status as the best in Jeju.

314
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,640
So what if it does?

315
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,500
It's not profitable.

316
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,700
It's losing money, right?

317
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,700
That's why it's an opportunity for Dolphin.

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,230
How is buying an unprofitable company an opportunity?

319
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,450
Because Dado Resort is running at a loss, it's being sold at a low price.

320
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,520
If you don't acquire it, Sanin Group will take over its operations directly.

321
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,300
In that case, turning a profit is only a matter of time.

322
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,620
The group will launch a large-scale PR

323
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,200
and sign an MOU to give discounts to Sanin employees.

324
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,220
- An MOU? 
 - Yes.

325
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,790
If a promotion of offering accommodation discounts to all Sanin employees,

326
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,510
the revenue will more than double.

327
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,420
If so, Dado Resort will never be sold at its current price.

328
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,600
You know better than anyone how to run a resort.

329
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,220
Dado's financial losses shouldn't be a problem for you, right?

330
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,290
Well, I mean...

331
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,370
If I run it, I'll do a good job.

332
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,510
Exactly.

333
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,660
That's why I said this is an opportunity for you.

334
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,090
So... how much is it?

335
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,690
How much are you willing to pay?

336
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,320
I've already told you before.

337
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,920
Fifty billion won is my maximum.

338
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,810
We also need to persuade the resort CEO.

339
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,750
Restarting negotiations

340
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,050
which fell through at the previous price

341
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,730
doesn't give us enough justification.

342
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,770
Fifty-five billion won?

343
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,610
We're looking at a minimum of 60 billion won.

344
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,610
Then...

345
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,080
about that promotional MOU

346
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,220
with the Sanin Group you mentioned earlier,

347
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,660
do that for our hotel as well.

348
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,210
If Sanin employees use our resort,

349
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,750
they get a discount.

350
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,110
But Sanin will cover half of the discount.

351
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,390
Could I discuss this with my team for a moment?

352
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,970
Sure, go ahead.

353
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,300
I think 60 billion won

354
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,550
will be enough to cover the discounts.

355
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,780
I think the MOU will require reviewing.

356
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,980
This is also a good hotel.

357
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,110
If we give Sanin employees a discount here,

358
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,730
they'd be happy, too.

359
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,090
But...

360
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,040
do you really think Sanin will

361
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,320
actually take over operations?

362
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,470
That is unknown.

363
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,750
Do you think...

364
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,100
Sanin is feeling us out when they'll actually run it?

365
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,450
I think so.

366
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,990
To sell it at a high price or break the deal.

367
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,510
Now that I think about it, it's so annoying!

368
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,560
So...

369
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,210
did you come to a conclusion?

370
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,780
Yes.

371
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,550
- Chairman. 
 - Hey.

372
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,040
Take a seat.

373
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,190
- So tell me. 
 - PPF agreed to give us a loan.

374
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,720
Aigoo.

375
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,420
They'll send the money right away

376
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,410
if you sign the contract.

377
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,100
Great work.

378
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,070
What are the conditions?

379
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,870
About that...

380
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,550
It's to be paid over three years

381
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,630
with an interest rate of 18%.

382
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,860
Eighteen percent?

383
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,430
Do you think that makes sense?

384
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,720
I know.

385
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
That's why I told them that's ridiculous.

386
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,830
Lower it.

387
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes.

388
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,430
But, Chairman,

389
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,880
we already owe them 3 trillion won, so...

390
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,620
Mr. Ha.

391
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,050
Did we borrow from them for free?

392
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,630
We pay them interest every month.

393
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,740
Tell them to lower the rate.

394
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,260
Yes, Chairman.

395
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,010
Then, I'll try to lower it to 15%.

396
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,500
Fifteen percent?

397
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,380
Are you serious right now!

398
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you take me for an idiot?

399
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,070
No, Sir.

400
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,240
Are you saying it's possible or not?

401
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,990
It's possible, Chairman.

402
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,280
Yes, it's possible.

403
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,250
Wow, look at this view.

404
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,370
Mr. Ha.

405
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,710
Yes, Chairman.

406
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,240
Is this your first time in here?

407
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,730
Pardon?

408
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,090
You showed me around once before, Chairman.

409
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,820
You probably don't remember since it's been a while.

410
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,360
I see.

411
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,710
Not many people know about this place.

412
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,950
I see.

413
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,450
Come by here often.

414
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,170
It's boring to listen to it by myself.

415
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,800
Yes, Chairman.

416
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,470
- You can go now. 
 - Okay.

417
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,490
All right.

418
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,680
♫    ♫

419
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,670
♫    ♫

420
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,360
Chairman.

421
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,010
They're negotiating the sale of the Jejudo resort.

422
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,850
Have you lost your mind, jerk?

423
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,200
Why are they doing that?

424
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,480
Tell them to come back right now!

425
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,040
With their resignations!

426
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,010
- Tell them to come directly to me. 
 - Okay.

427
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,600
♫    ♫

428
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,150
This jerk. He really is a nutjob.

429
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,680
How dares he try—

430
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,670
Chairman!

431
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,150
Secretary Choi!

432
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,100
But, Mr. Yun,

433
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,850
we thought about it, too.

434
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,680
I really like people from Sanin.

435
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,110
But...

436
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,270
you broke it off after all this last time, too.

437
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,200
I became a bit of a laughingstock.

438
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,270
You won't face such humiliation again.

439
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,320
That's why...

440
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,660
we should discuss this again

441
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,020
once you bring the signed MOU.

442
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,850
All right. Let's discuss this again next time.

443
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,700
It's not easy.

444
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,600
Since they experienced a break in trust last time.

445
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Can't we just lower

446
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,480
the asking price to 55 billion instead?

447
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,100
No, that'd be the end of this deal.

448
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,520
Why?

449
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,570
We've already lost their trust.

450
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,340
If we lower the asking price for no good reason,

451
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,040
we'd lose whatever trust remains.

452
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,360
It'd look like we tried to scam them by selling

453
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,740
a 55 billion asset for 60 billion.

454
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,330
Unless there's a valid reason for the discount.

455
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,120
Oh, I see.

456
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,450
The MOU will likely be the key factor than the price.

457
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,900
Yes, I think so.

458
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,220
Yes, Mr. Lee.

459
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,910
 The chairman collapsed. 

460
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,780
 It seems the chairman found out you went to Jeju. 

461
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,350
Is the chairman okay?

462
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,880
 Come back immediately. 

463
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,790
Okay, I understand.

464
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,510
What is it?

465
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,480
Was it a call from the company?

466
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,570
It looks like we'll have to submit our resignations.

467
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,910
Pardon?

468
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,790
   

469
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
   

470
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,390
How did he find out we came here?

471
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,150
There probably was

472
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,850
an employee in contact with the Secretariat at Dado.

473
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,110
 Come home tomorrow. 

474
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,040
 We've got something to discuss. 

475
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,860
 I can't. I'm on a business trip. 

476
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,880
 Do you really need your car? 

477
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,360
Then do we have to go straight back to Seoul?

478
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,740
I think that would be best.

479
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,200
I'll just submit my resignation and wrap this up,

480
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,300
so don't worry too much.

481
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,030
We already paid for tonight's stay.

482
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,360
Can't we go back tomorrow?

483
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,310
I know, right?

484
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,810
This is a really expensive place.

485
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,180
It's the weekend anyway.

486
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,040
The company can't legally tell you to come or go.

487
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,030
That's true. Legally, that's true.

488
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,150
Right, Mr. Yun?

489
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,530
Okay, let's do that.

490
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,400
- Did you bring it? 
 - Yes.

491
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,820
Chairman, could I come in for a moment?

492
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,590
Yes.

493
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,470
This is your gown.

494
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,630
Forget it.

495
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,310
And...

496
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,360
tell them I'm leaving the hospital.

497
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,230
I'm not even sick.

498
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,360
The test results haven't come out yet.

499
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,310
Why not leave after hearing from the doctor?

500
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,250
All right.

501
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,000
- Hey, you. 
 - Yes?

502
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,870
- You know how I collapsed? 
 - Yes?

503
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,060
Make sure nobody finds out.

504
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,520
Yes, I've made sure of that.

505
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,240
All right.

506
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,010
 You should've just emailed it. 

507
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,820
 You personally brought the contract. 

508
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,280
 Yes, because I had something to discuss. 

509
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,880
What is it?

510
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,310
You wrote that the interest rate is 10%.

511
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,390
We agreed on 15%.

512
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,240
Take a seat for a moment.

513
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,580
We're dealing with a situation right now.

514
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,120
Our chairman collapsed.

515
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,490
- Pardon? 
 - It's not anything serious.

516
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,110
He was taken to the hospital

517
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,860
and has stabilized since.

518
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,990
So?

519
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,950
I mean, the chairman collapsed.

520
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,660
I couldn't tell him about raising

521
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,160
the interest rate.

522
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,860
Please understand.

523
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,840
Should we give you some more time?

524
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,540
I'll be honest.

525
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,090
The chairman said he'd never agree to

526
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,950
15% before he collapsed.

527
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,890
Are you saying he collapsed because of that?

528
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,400
No, no. That's not it.

529
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,490
He collapsed because of Yun Ju No.

530
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,280
That Yun Ju No secretly went down to Jejudo

531
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,720
to sell the resort without the chairman's approval.

532
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,200
The chairman explicitly said no.

533
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,580
What the hell is he thinking?

534
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,720
So did he sell it?

535
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,080
No!

536
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,350
The chairman gave that resort to his daughter.

537
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,890
But since he tried to sell it,

538
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,260
the chairman was so furious that he collapsed.

539
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,080
Geez.

540
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,450
But Mr. Ha,

541
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,970
we'll need to discuss this by ourselves.

542
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,230
Oh, yes.

543
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,380
Please give us a moment.

544
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,090
That's probably not a lie, right?

545
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,930
No.

546
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,670
You know how obvious it is when he lies.

547
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,730
Selling the resort to repay is off the table now.

548
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,840
The only option left is to borrow the money…

549
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,720
Well, basically,

550
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,930
we're the only one Sanin can rely on.

551
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,340
That's true,

552
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,170
but if people hear the chairman's health is bad,

553
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,820
Sanin's stock will take a hit.

554
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,310
 This thing... 

555
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,140
I fixed it,

556
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,020
but you'll need to replace it soon.

557
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,940
Take a beverage from here and leave.

558
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,340
Let's not do the contract.

559
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,600
Why not?

560
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,760
It could be risky since the Chairman collapsed.

561
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,500
That could be an opportunity for us.

562
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,120
How so?

563
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,270
Sorry for making you wait.

564
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,950
Give us...

565
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,310
some more stocks.

566
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,730
Pardon?

567
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,380
I mean,

568
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,060
with the chairman collapsing,

569
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,630
we feel uneasy about it.

570
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,070
If he happens to pass away,

571
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,730
we don't know what will happen to Sanin either.

572
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,260
So how much...

573
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,030
Double.

574
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,120
Gosh, that's too much!

575
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,990
Sanin is a huge group.

576
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,140
It won't go under!

577
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,050
We're actually asking for the shares.

578
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,530
We're just suggesting increasing the collateral.

579
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,900
As you say, if Sanin is solid,

580
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,230
there's no reason to reject this proposal.

581
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,170
Besides, we're doing this to help you out, Mr. Ha.

582
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,200
If you don't want it,

583
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,550
you don't have to accept our offer.

584
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,430
No, I'll take it.

585
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,460
But it's 10%, right?

586
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,360
The ceiling is pretty high.

587
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,470
 I know you're not going to like this, but… 

588
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,080
 there's the option of Sanin acquiring the resort. 

589
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,430
 And the chairman 

590
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,480
 can pay off his debt with that money. 

591
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,120
That's using Sanin's money

592
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,480
to pay the chairman's personal debt.

593
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,370
 But still, Sanin would be getting the resort. 

594
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,150
Since he had already gifted it to his daughter,

595
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,590
that'd become more of an issue.

596
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,360
It could be considered a breach of trust

597
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,080
or even illegal gifting.

598
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,170
 I'm not saying this because I don't know that. 

599
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,670
 We need to do at least that 

600
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,690
 if you are to survive this. 

601
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,820
I understand your point, Mr. Lee,

602
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,860
but I believe this was the chairman's

603
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,280
preferred method from the start.

604
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,020
That's why

605
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,480
I intentionally said we should sell the resort.

606
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,250
 I see. 

607
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,460
 Then hand in your resignation. 

608
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,230
Yes?

609
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,890
 Are you ignoring your mom's calls now? 

610
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,930
I was working.

611
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,350
 It's the weekend. What work? 

612
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,180
 Are you lying to me now? 

613
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,490
I'm not lying.

614
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,510
I'm on a business trip.

615
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,320
 Whatever. Do you really need the car? 

616
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
No.

617
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,590
I don't need it so take it.

618
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,500
 You're saying you'll give it to Sang Hoon, right? 

619
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,400
Yes.

620
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,370
I don't need the car anymore.

621
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,910
I don't have to go to work anymore.

622
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,500
I'll quit my job.

623
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,630
 Is this because I asked to use your car? 

624
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,270
No.

625
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,310
I got fired.

626
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,500
 That's why. 

627
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,790
So take the car.

628
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,920
 Aigoo, goodness. 

629
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,920
 Are you happy to upset me all the time? 

630
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,520
Mom.

631
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,360
How do you want me to live?

632
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,660
 I want you to live well! 

633
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,540
 Do you think I want you to struggle? 

634
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,750
 Just keep working at your job! 

635
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,000
I told you I got fired—

636
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,620
S-Sorry!

637
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,950
I-I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

638
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,240
Are you all right?

639
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes.

640
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,970
Min Jeong.

641
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,290
Min Jeong, you can have this.

642
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,170
You ruined your clothes because of me.

643
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,230
No, that's all right.

644
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,740
I think it'd look better on you, CEO.

645
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,110
Gosh, don't be like that.

646
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't think I can wear this anyway.

647
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,250
Wear this in my place, please?

648
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,730
No,

649
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,740
that's all right.

650
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,370
Then, let's have some tea together.

651
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,430
You probably hate me, Min Jeong.

652
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,010
Right?

653
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,800
No, I don't.

654
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,310
Didn't you get fired because of me?

655
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,620
No, it was a matter of our team.

656
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,860
It's not your fault, CEO.

657
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,630
Please call me Ji Oh instead of CEO.

658
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,590
You called me Ji Oh yesterday.

659
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,110
Okay.

660
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,610
I guess you won't call my name ever again.

661
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,240
Min Jeong, you seem like the type of person

662
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:26,290
who doesn't say no but also doesn't say yes.

663
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,710
I'm the type of person who says yes

664
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,020
when everyone else says yes.

665
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,900
There's no one who can say no to you, right?

666
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,520
That's not true.

667
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,010
My dad always says no to me.

668
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,870
That's why I never got to live the way I wanted.

669
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:55,440
It seems like you're living the way you want now.

670
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,060
Is that right?

671
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:06,760
The only time I got what I wanted was choosing to live here.

672
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:13,680
Not just anyone can live like you, CEO.

673
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,900
Is that so?

674
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,500
Yes.

675
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,090
You may not understand the lives of ordinary people...

676
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,150
It's just that... you're always so cheerful.

677
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,710
So I... envy that.

678
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,160
You're right.

679
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,280
I like cheerful things.

680
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,600
It means there's hope.

681
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,340
Do you need hope, too, CEO?

682
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,230
You already have so much.

683
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,070
Do I?

684
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,710
Yes.

685
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,870
You have so much.

686
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:15,120
Not just anyone can live in a place like this forever.

687
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,080
That's true.

688
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,110
One can't live in a place like this forever.

689
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,350
I'll be going now.

690
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,980
Pardon?

691
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,280
Stay a bit longer.

692
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,540
I'll tell you a secret.

693
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,810
See?

694
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,670
You can't say no but can't say yes either.

695
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,230
Min Jeong, are you really leaving?

696
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,140
Can't you go after finishing this tea?

697
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:02,510
CEO, there are people in this world who have no hope.

698
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,030
Pardon?

699
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,870
- Please give it to me. 
 - No, it's okay.

700
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,100
Are you leaving?

701
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,890
N-No, don't leave!

702
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,230
You're leaving? You said you'll tell me my Dado's health check-up report.

703
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,040
Do you know how much I waited for it?

704
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,740
CEO, we've given up on selling Dado Resort.

705
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,760
So you don't need to worry about it.

706
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,890
Then you no longer care about my Dado's health?

707
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:30,080
Here is our proposed business strategy for upgrading Dado Resort.

708
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,230
First, our team's evaluation of Dado Resort was very positive.

709
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,130
Most criteria on the list received top ratings.

710
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:48,400
One person said it was the best accommodation they'd been to.

711
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,930
Perhaps Min Jeong?

712
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,030
No.

713
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,820
As for the negatives...

714
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,760
"Course meals are delicious but the portions are too small."

715
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,270
I don't think you need to care about this one.

716
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,170
The guest rooms received excellent reviews.

717
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,720
Wow!

718
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,340
However, the problem is that it's not generating profit.

719
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,300
That's okay.

720
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,940
I just want the people at Dado Resort to be happy.

721
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,680
That's enough for me.

722
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
Money isn't an issue.

723
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,080
But...

724
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,940
If the resort continues to run at a loss, we might have to shut it down.

725
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,110
We can shut it down when that time comes.

726
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,140
Then, will you fire the employees?

727
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,890
Pardon?

728
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,850
You said you wanted the people at Dado Resort to be happy.

729
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,100
Do those people include the employees as well?

730
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,450
Pardon?

731
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,740
Then what should I do?

732
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,930
You could entrust it to a professional manager.

733
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,620
I can't do that...

734
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:04,920
How could I hand over my precious Dado to someone else?

735
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,780
Sanin Group, or rather, the chairman, could help you.

736
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,560
That's right.

737
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,230
I'm sorry.

738
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,760
No, it's okay.

739
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,260
So that's the end of my Dado's health check-up?

740
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,630
But CEO...

741
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,320
Are you okay?

742
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,810
Why?

743
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,270
Do I seem a bit off?

744
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,290
Yes.

745
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,960
Chairman, how are you?

746
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,530
Gosh, should the doctor ask the patient that?

747
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,740
I don't think there's much to worry about.

748
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,020
Still, I think it'd be good to reduce stress.

749
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,110
Stress… In the old days, they used to call it 'hwa-byung.'

750
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,590
They say there's no medicine for it.

751
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,600
Your collapse seems to be a vasovagal syncope, Chairman.

752
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,630
When you're stressed, blood vessels expand—

753
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,190
Forget it, that's enough.

754
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,930
You're basically saying I'm old.

755
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,210
No, Chairman.

756
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,920
Your body functioned just fine.

757
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,720
When you collapsed, there was a lack of blood flow to the brain,

758
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,610
so your body tried to send blood to the brain by laying you down.

759
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,230
Your body responded to survive.

760
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,520
So I collapsed so I could stay alive.

761
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,320
Yes, it's an instinct.

762
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,450
I'll take your blood pressure now.

763
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,880
All right.

764
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,960
It's human instinct to stay alive,

765
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,740
so why is my daughter doing the opposite?

766
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,670
Do I seem a bit off?

767
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,350
Yes.

768
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,150
I was wondering if you may be a bit ill.

769
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,570
Why?

770
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,440
Was that the book you were reading when I first met you?

771
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,540
   

772
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,960
Turns out the author wrote it while battling cancer.

773
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:54,890
So you're saying I have cancer?

774
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,580
No...

775
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,940
Look, Mr. Yun.

776
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:04,100
An ambulance came to the resort early yesterday morning.

777
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,530
How did you know?

778
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,360
I tend to stay up late, so I happened to see it.

779
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,320
The next day, you didn't have breakfast

780
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,490
and you didn't go up the hill either.

781
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,120
So I wondered if that ambulance

782
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,740
might have taken you, CEO.

783
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,640
Your deduction skills are amazing.

784
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,600
Your deduction was good, but...

785
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,180
there's no concrete proof.

786
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,910
Isn't that patch on your arm pain relief medication?

787
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,750
I guess I have no choice but to admit it.

788
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,810
You're right.

789
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,090
I have cancer.

790
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,840
But...

791
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,020
I got surgery.

792
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,910
That's a relief.

793
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,340
Though it ended up returning.

794
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,350
What should I do about my daughter?

795
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,240
Though it's difficult for her,

796
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,210
she must undergo another surgery.

797
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,410
If she doesn't,

798
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,130
she'll just be neglecting it.

799
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,160
What can I do when she absolutely refuses to do so?

800
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,970
It's not like I'm cutting open my own belly.

801
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,690
It's about cutting open her stomach.

802
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,450
Is she continuing to stay in Jejudo?

803
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,520
Yes.

804
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,020
She says she'll stay there

805
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,480
until she dies. Shit...

806
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,280
When did you get here?

807
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,500
Well, a bit earlier.

808
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,480
Did you hear everything?

809
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,280
I wasn't trying to hear it.

810
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,910
I see.

811
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,950
That resort...

812
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,960
She said to sell it when she dies.

813
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,460
She said her cancer had returned,

814
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,350
but she doesn't want any more surgeries.

815
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,740
She said she'll stay there until she dies.

816
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,340
What a terrible child...

817
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,570
I had no idea...

818
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,780
I'm sorry.

819
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,600
Why would you be sorry?

820
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,920
It's about my daughter anyway.

821
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,950
That's why I can't sell Dado.

822
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,800
Because I made up my mind to die here.

823
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,770
The doctor told me that

824
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,560
I was just unfortunate.

825
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,930
Basically, I'm just unlucky.

826
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,840
But my dad is quite rich, right?

827
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,680
That'd make me lucky so it's pretty much even.

828
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,760
I got surgery with that mentality.

829
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,670
But then my cancer returned.

830
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,050
Then wouldn't that make me unlucky?

831
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,870
Right?

832
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,750
So I thought I shouldn't leave death to luck.

833
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,550
After going around to different places,

834
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,250
I found Dado.

835
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,930
I got so lucky.

836
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:24,310
Shouldn't you undergo another surgery?

837
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,540
Even with a surgery,

838
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,560
there's only a half chance I'll survive.

839
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,140
And even if I do survive,

840
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,700
they don't know how long I'll live.

841
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,160
What if you don't get another surgery?

842
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,100
Why?

843
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,500
Do you want me to get surgery, Min Jeong?

844
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,730
As expected, you can't say no,

845
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,500
but also won't say yes, Min Jeong.

846
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,150
You've never gotten cancer surgery, right?

847
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,680
It's really painful.

848
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,190
You think it'd be better to die.

849
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:07,130
But even if the surgery goes well,

850
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,920
they say I won't be able to live like I am now.

851
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,460
If I don't get the surgery,

852
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,040
I'd probably die.

853
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,190
Still, if I live happily

854
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,070
in a place like this before I die,

855
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,720
wouldn't I die a happy death?

856
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,000
Min Jeong, you think I should get the surgery.

857
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,480
What about you, Mr. Yun?

858
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,250
Should I bet on something with

859
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,510
less than 50% chance?

860
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,250
I don't know.

861
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,990
This isn't the answer I was expecting.

862
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,910
However,

863
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:53,880
you do seem happy living here, CEO.

864
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,510
That's a novel reply.

865
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,130
Okay. That's great.

866
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,710
That's the end of today's report.

867
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,040
CEO.

868
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,770
I've made a lot of mistakes with you.

869
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,800
No, you didn't know, Min Jeong.

870
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,560
Even so,

871
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,740
I didn't consider that you might have

872
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,180
your own circumstances.

873
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,360
I'm sorry.

874
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,260
Then as an apology,

875
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,090
could you accept the dress from last night?

876
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,500
Pardon?

877
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,060
Yes or no?

878
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,420
It's a yes.

879
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,680
What a shame.

880
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,640
I was having fun for the first time in a while.

881
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,640
We also enjoyed our time here.

882
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:11,740
But is my dad in a bad situation?

883
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,880
This resort was given to me, his only daughter,

884
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,940
but you came to try to sell it, Mr. Yun.

885
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,240
I don't think you're a bad person.

886
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,190
I was wondering if my dad is in a serious situation.

887
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,220
It's fine now,

888
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,720
but it will become a problem later.

889
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,010
You sound just like the doctor.

890
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,590
Then we'll be going.

891
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,780
CEO.

892
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,920
Thank you for everything.

893
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,890
I left the dress in the room.

894
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,500
I thought about it,

895
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,970
and I think it suits you more than me.

896
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,930
If you say so,

897
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,170
there's nothing I can do.

898
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,380
Have a safe trip back.

899
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,930
We're going to submit our resignation,

900
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,440
but it doesn't seem like a big deal.

901
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,600
Yes.

902
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,460
It makes me wonder what's really important.

903
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,990
I wonder how CEO Ji Oh must feel.

904
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,380
I never imagined

905
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,650
she was ill because she was always so cheerful.

906
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,740
 Min Jeong. 

907
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,190
 This isn't anything special. 

908
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,910
 I bought it at the market. 

909
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,130
 I got it on my way back from the hospital yesterday. 

910
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,270
 But I think I missed the season. 

911
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,120
 I'll probably have to wear it next year... 

912
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,250
 but I'm not sure if I'll still be alive then. 

913
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,350
 I'm not confident I will. 

914
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,910
 Okay. 

915
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,920
 Thank you. 

916
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:41,500
 You don't look at me with a sad expression. 

917
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,370
 That's why I like you, Min Jeong. 

918
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:51,230
 But I was a bit annoying, right? 

919
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,900
 Not at all. 

920
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,820
Is that why she was so cheerful?

921
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,530
Honestly, I couldn't get used to it at first.

922
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,870
Me, too.

923
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,370
Actually, I wondered if she was manic.

924
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,570
I guess she tried to smile all the more

925
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,590
because life was so tough for her.

926
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,520
You're probably right.

927
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,850
She said...

928
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:20,190
she didn't like people looking at her with sadness.

929
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,350
If people look at me with sadness,

930
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,750
it means there's no hope for me.

931
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:31,030
I think I'd feel the same way.

932
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,460
You're in good health, right, Chairman?

933
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,210
Yes.

934
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,400
So...

935
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,000
they want double the collateral?

936
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,030
Yes. But the collateral, as the term implies,

937
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,200
is temporarily entrusted and then returned,

938
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,850
so you don't need to worry too much.

939
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,310
Yes?

940
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,520
Chairman, it's Team Leader Yun Ju No.

941
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,440
Did you bring your resignation letter?

942
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,020
Yes.

943
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,060
You know what you did wrong, right?

944
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,200
I do.

945
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,390
You can leave now.

946
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,560
Was she doing all right?

947
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,080
Yes. She was doing well.

948
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,190
So what did you do there?

949
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,920
Let me get that.

950
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,720
Get me my phone.

951
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,270
Hey.

952
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,120
 Hey, Dad. 

953
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,760
Yes,

954
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,480
it's me. What's up?

955
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,510
 The resort... 

956
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,570
 Sell it. 

957
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,370
You want me to sell it?

958
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,190
 You were going to sell it when I die. 

959
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,800
 But... 

960
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,490
 just sell it now. 

961
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,560
Ji Oh, well...

962
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,050
I'm sorry about that.

963
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,270
I won't sell it, ever.

964
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,010
 No... 

965
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,170
 It's not like that. 

966
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,490
 I'm saying you should really sell it. 

967
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,540
Oh, right!

968
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,340
The dress!

969
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,920
Hey, you could do that a bit later, right?

970
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,760
Yes, CEO.

971
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,710
 CEO, our team wants to make 

972
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,530
 another proposal to you. 

973
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,710
 We'll make that proposal through a contract. 

974
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,610
 Whatever you decide to do, 

975
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:43,210
 we will support your decision. 

976
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:49,410
 However, this dress suits you better, CEO. 

977
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,240
 We will visit again next year 

978
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,390
 to see you wearing this dress. Thank you. 

979
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,470
 P.S. 

980
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:02,410
 CEO, you don't have a talent for resort management. 

981
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,410
 I'm sorry. 

982
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,900
 You really want me to sell it? 

983
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,250
Yeah.

984
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,990
I guess I don't have a talent for management.

985
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,330
 Who told you that? 

986
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,320
A friend.

987
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,540
Oh, also,

988
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,810
I'll...

989
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:41,080
get surgery.

990
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,180
Are you going to get surgery?

991
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,240
 Yes. 

992
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,350
 I'm going to do it... 

993
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,330
 The surgery. 

994
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,270
I'll be able to do that well, right?

995
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,700
The surgery...

996
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,890
It will go well, right?

997
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,950
Yes.

998
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,930
The surgery will go well. Don't worry.

999
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,900
 Sell it. 

1000
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,930
 Okay, Dad? 

1001
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,620
All right.

1002
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,240
Ji Oh.

1003
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,340
Thanks.

1004
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,060
Not me.

1005
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,770
Please tell those people you sent

1006
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,060
that I'm really grateful.

1007
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,800
All right.

1008
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,940
 Keep the contract exactly 

1009
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,660
 the way those people you sent wrote up. 

1010
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,520
 Okay? 

1011
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,500
 You can't change any of it, okay? 

1012
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,340
Okay.

1013
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:08,880
Dad...

1014
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,250
Never mind.

1015
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,170
Thanks.

1016
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,670
Thanks...

1017
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,300
All right.

1018
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,470
Okay...

1019
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,670
What's going on here?

1020
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,710
There is a special provision in the contract

1021
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,410
that we gave to CEO Song Ji Oh.

1022
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,510
 "Special provision." 

1023
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,570
 "Room 123 of Dado Resort" 

1024
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,210
 "will be permanently" 

1025
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,790
 "leased to Song Ji Oh free of charge." 

1026
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,030
If everyone says yes,

1027
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,890
I say yes, too!

1028
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,670
 "However," 

1029
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,010
 "if Song Ji Oh passes away," 

1030
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:51,740
 "this condition will become null and void." 

1031
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,540
It won't become void.

1032
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,440
Because I won't die!

1033
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,070
 It seems CEO Song Ji Oh 

1034
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:15,320
accepted our proposal.

1035
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,010
Yes...

1036
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,740
Chairman, Chairman! Chairman!

1037
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,860
Hey, Secretary! The chairman collapsed!

1038
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,640
It's fine!

1039
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,780
I didn't get enough blood to my brain.

1040
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,170
That's why I sat down.

1041
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,860
Pardon?

1042
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,940
Are you okay, Chairman?

1043
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,980
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. You guys can stop.

1044
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,900
I sat down to stay alive.

1045
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,010
I'm fine. You can go now.

1046
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:46,360
I'm fine.

1047
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
You should sit down.

1048
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:59,720
Aigoo.

1049
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:10,000
Well, I'm quite indebted to you.

1050
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,140
 This is Dolphin. 

1051
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,490
Yes, CEO.

1052
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,770
 I wanted to check with you 

1053
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:16,030
 the second special provision. 

1054
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,520
Please give me a second.

1055
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:21,930
The special provision of a permanent lease

1056
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,230
means the promotion between Sanin and Dolphin

1057
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:27,460
will continue as long as she's alive.

1058
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:30,130
 Oh, okay. 

1059
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,410
 Sounds great. 

1060
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,470
 I should send nourishing food 

1061
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,900
 to Dado's CEO to keep her healthy. 

1062
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,500
Okay, thank you.

1063
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,290
How am I going to...

1064
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,230
repay this debt?

1065
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,780
You...

1066
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,860
Do you want to try being an executive?

 There's a golf course in Chungbuk. 

1077
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,100
 Try selling that. 

1078
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,060
 The work atmosphere feels too heated lately. 

1079
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,090
 We don't know whose head will roll. 

1080
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,330
 These jerks are scheming. 

1081
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,610
 Is the purpose of the acquisition 

1082
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,500
 to operate the golf course? 

1083
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,100
 The company trying to acquire Greenview CC 

1084
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,670
 asks a change in CEO. 

1085
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,900
 If the CEO is being fired for doing well, 

1086
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,540
 isn't that unfair? 

1087
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,080
 Mr. Yun. 

1088
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,950
 It's not easy to become an executive. 

1089
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:20,040
 Two days ago, 100 million won was withdrawn, 

1090
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,000
 but there's no record of how it was used. 

1091
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,490
 I'm almost there as well. 

1092
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,730
 I'll become an executive.
