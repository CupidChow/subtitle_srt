00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,920
I hear Yoon Joo No is coming.

10
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,419
That's crazy. Says who?

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,849
He's not even in Korea.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,789
Exactly. He's on his way.

13
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,829
Then a storm is coming.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,499
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,539
we will soon arrive at Incheon International Airport.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,309
We're experiencing turbulence due to unstable weather,

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,340
so please fasten your seat belts.

(Creating value, Sanin Group)

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,420
The infamous Yoon Joo No is coming?

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,879
Exactly. Yoon Joo No, the legendary M and A expert.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,689
A few subsidiaries could be liquidated.

22
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,619
Don't let it be ours.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,319
I still have a mortgage to pay.

24
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,389
If I lose my job,

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,959
I won't be able to pay my credit card bill.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,829
No wonder a sudden board meeting was called today.

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,969
Tell me about it.

28
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,268
I've never seen the higher-ups that flustered before.

29
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,969
- Sir. - Hey.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,469
Did you hear the news?

31
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:43,840
Unbelievable.

32
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,238
Not all M and A transactions...

33
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,480
result in liquidation.

34
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,809
Yoon Joo No could be coming here...

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,750
to have us acquire another company.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,489
Hey, don't you see the news?

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,119
Rumor has it that we're going under,

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,189
so why would we buy anything?

39
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,188
Yoon Joo No is coming to give us the ax.

40
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,259
Hence the mayhem.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,929
Thank you for flying with us.

42
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,459

(Episode 1: The kick-off)

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,629
Who's coming that has everyone fussing?

45
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,800
His name is Yoon Joo No,

46
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,870
an M and A expert.

47
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,539
He...

48
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,710
Do you even know what M and A is?

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,509
Isn't it the act of buying, selling, and merging companies?

50
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,150
What did I even expect from a mere intern?

51
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,120
Sure.

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,490
Those who don't know better...

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
could think like you.

54
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,030
Hey, let me school you on this.

55
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,229
M and A...

56
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,569
isn't just buying and selling.

57
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,270
M and A is about...

58
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,439
who dies and who lives.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,210
Why you...

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,879
Hey.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,849
What's a corporate body?

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,050
A legal entity, right?

63
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,889
M and A...

64
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,059
either combines corporations or eliminates one.

65
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
Now,

66
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:41,830
let's say an entity was eliminated.

67
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,430
Isn't that murder?

68
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,400
- How is that murder? - You brat.

69
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,830
What happens when a company is sold?

70
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,269
Its employees will lose their jobs.

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,509
And then what? They won't get paid.

72
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,840
Then what about their families?

73
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,340
They'll starve, right?

74
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,479
That actually leads to people dying.

75
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,150
Layoffs are the same as murder.

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,580
Don't you get that?

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,590
I guess, but...

78
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:08,990
On top of that,

79
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,419
that guy Yoon Joo No...

80
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,090
Hey.

81
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,959
Do you know what people call him?

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,870
What?

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,069
The White Snake.

84
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,339
- The White Snake? - Yes, the White Snake.

85
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,470
- A snake that is white. - What?

86
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,509
While moving soundlessly,

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,750
he swallows companies whole leaving no trace behind.

88
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,379
Why the White Snake though?

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,948
Mamushi or viper could've been a better choice.

90
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,149
It's to describe his cold-blooded nature.

91
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,790
Hey.

92
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,959
Why does anyone go through with an M and A?

93
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,560
Money. That's why they do it.

94
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,499
M and A is about selling companies...

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,398
worth 10 million dollars at 100 million...

96
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,339
and acquiring those worth 10 million dollars at 100,000.

97
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,670
Would an expert in that field...

98
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,068
even bat an eye...

99
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,208
when hundreds or even thousands of pencil pushers like us...

100
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,480
lose our jobs?

101
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,310
He wouldn't.

102
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,579
That's why...

103
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
M and A experts...

104
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,990
are psychopaths.

105
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,790
Hence the nickname the White Snake.

106
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,389
In summary,

107
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,259
Yoon Joo No coming to the main office means...

108
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,899
that it's already begun.

109
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,730
What has?

110
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,370
Sir.

111
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,110
There will be blood once Yoon Joo No arrives.

112
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,579
Exactly.

113
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,579
We need a contingency plan.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
As if.

115
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,980
He worked under me for ten years.

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Why should I be worried about his presence?

117
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,120
I thought...

118
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,420
it could've been Director Lee's idea to bring in Yoon Joo No.

119
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,828
Director Lee constantly mentions retirement,

120
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,430
but who knows what he's thinking?

121
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,999
What if Director Lee is bringing Yoon Joo No in...

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,939
to use as his sword?

123
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,139
(Vacant)

124
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,420
Sanin head office, please.

125
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,458
(Lee Dong Joon)

126
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,730
Director, I'm at the airport.

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Come in.

128
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,170
- Director. - Hey.

129
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,138
You should've gone ahead rather than coming all the way here.

130
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,709
- It was on our way anyway. - Oh, please.

131
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,319
Now you know.

132
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,620
Now you know what Yoon Joo No being here means.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,360
Hello, sir.

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,959
As the volatility of the global financial market increases,

135
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,430
the stability of the financial industry decreases.

136
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,869
To this, financial authorities have decided...

137
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,500
to call for risk management...

138
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,999
and have recommended banks...

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,299
to maintain the BIS capital adequacy ratio...

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,509
at 13 percent.

141
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,980
However, that of Hanbit Bank, which is Sanin's main bank,

142
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,639
is currently at 12 percent.

143
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,850
For that reason,

144
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,610
the bank has given word that it'll not be extending...

145
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,079
the maturity.

146
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,949
Darn banks. They beg us to take out a loan,

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,290
but now they want it back.

148
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,360
Moreover, the debt ratio of our Sanin Group...

149
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,930
is at 428 percent which is somewhat higher...

150
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,300
than the average debt ratio of the ten top major companies...

151
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,829
which sits at 250 percent.

152
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:17,268
That was already reported via documents,

153
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,800
so cut to the chase.

154
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,040
Samoel Fund has openly required us...

155
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,240
to decrease our debt ratio...

156
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,209
which has led to many financial newspapers...

157
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,078
reporting our critical situation.

158
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,149
Some are even...

159
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,508
mentioning the possibility of a bankruptcy.

160
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,779
He told you to cut to the chase. Are you deaf?

161
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,590
We're to pay back the loan which is how much?

162
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Right.

163
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,029
It's 11 billion dollars.

164
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,570
And the deadline?

165
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,769
The loan will mature at the end of next year's first quarter,

166
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,340
but we must wrap it up by the end of this year.

167
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Are you kidding me?

168
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,669
Eleven billion dollars isn't chump change.

169
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,109
The bank isn't the boss of us.

170
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,080
Every company operates on debt.

171
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,750
At the end of last quarter,

172
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,278
the chairman promised to lower...

173
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,720
Sanin's debt ratio to 200 percent,

174
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,690
which resulted in our stock price to stabilize...

175
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,159
and increase 11 percent that day.

176
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,829
It has maintained an upward trend since then...

177
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,899
and is at 40 percent higher than its lowest price.

178
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,070
But the stock price will plummet...

179
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,230
if we can't keep that promise?

180
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,399
Yes.

181
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,600
That's why we must pay back the loan.

182
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,840
You must work at Sanin.

183
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,080
That's a fine company you work for.

184
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,419
The best apartment complexes are built by Sanin.

185
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,620
Check that out.

186
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,960
Those were all built by Sanin.

187
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,969
(Report on Samoel Fund's convertible bonds)

188
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,970
Other than the bank loan,

189
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,539
we also have convertible bonds held by Samoel Fund.

190
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,299
That's right.

191
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,369
Samoel Fund bought convertible bonds...

192
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,110
at the amount of three billion dollars.

193
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,980
And when does that mature?

194
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,009
In the first half of next year.

195
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,379
They overlap.

196
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,720
- We can extend that. - Yes, sir.

197
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,389
What are the terms of the put option?

198
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,788
If the stock price falls below 100 dollars,

199
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,360
which is the conversion price,

200
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,659
Samoel has the right to refix the latter...

201
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,759
or request the repayment of the principal.

202
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,099
What you mean is that...

203
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,259
if our stock price falls below 100 dollars,

204
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,169
- Samoel can claim all our shares? - Yes, sir.

205
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,398
Should Samoel convert the bonds,

206
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,470
it will become...

207
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,710
our largest shareholder.

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Unbelievable.

209
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,949
The chairman will collapse at the news.

210
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,549
What a mess.

211
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,819
However, the stock price is currently stable...

212
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,279
at 150 dollars.

213
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,049
Unless we're met with a crisis,

214
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,558
I doubt there will be any trouble.

215
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,690
I'm glad to hear that.

216
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,330
- What? - He's glad?

217
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,730
Unbelievable.

218
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,258
What should we do, then?

219
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,629
We're to pay back 11 billion dollars...

220
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,500
and maintain our stock price.

221
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Yes, sir.

222
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,470
- At all costs. - Yes.

223
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,268
He's saying it like he wasn't the one...

224
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,508
who put us in this mess.

225
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,639
As you know, that's his specialty.

226
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,178
Unbelievable.

227
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,110
How did we get to this state?

228
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:20,220
As if that's the issue right now.

229
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,149
Tell me about it.

230
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,429
The press will probably be all over us.

231
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,490
Most definitely.

232
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,860
Now that the administration is entering its second half,

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
it'll need an excuse for mismanagement of economy.

234
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,329
If we make ourselves visible,

235
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,840
any support will go out the window.

236
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,399
Not having any support is one thing.

237
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,070
To make an example out of us,

238
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,940
we'll be beaten to a pulp.

239
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,980
Then Sanin might even cease to exist.

240
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,980
That is why the chairman gave the order...

241
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,089
to do our best as if our company's fate...

242
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,090
depended on it.

243
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,190
Director Lee, don't you have anything to say?

244
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,200
Right.

245
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,840
That is why...

246
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,240
Yoon Joo No will be here.

247
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,940
By the way, what do you do?

248
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,909
I was wondering what your role was at Sanin.

249
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,279
You wouldn't take your eyes off those documents.

250
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,389
I buy and sell things.

251
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,960
You must be in sales.

252
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:36,929
What?

253
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,769
From what I remember, he's one with issues.

254
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,999
What would our employees think...

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,570
if we brought in someone like that again?

256
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,840
Exactly.

257
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,870
He must be shameless to come back here...

258
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,039
when he caused trouble and took off.

259
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,139
Director Ha,

260
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,949
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

261
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,110
What am I wrong about?

262
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,279
Correct me if I don't know the whole story.

263
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,019
Still, since he agreed to come here,

264
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,388
we should hear him out and...

265
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,659
Did you invite him here?

266
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,830
No, the chairman did.

267
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,500
Each member of the board...

268
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,439
must have their own opinion.

269
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,210
Why don't we get some coffee?

270
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,580
My head's throbbing as is.

271
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:29,909
- Let's go get coffee. - Sure.

272
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Hurry.

273
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,159
- We don't want to wait in line. - Right.

274
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,509
- By the way, - Yes?

275
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,980
The members of the board seem to hate Yoon Joo No.

276
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,620
Would you be a fan of his?

277
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,019
Especially for Director Ha,

278
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,049
this hits close to home.

279
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,549
How so?

280
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,820
The other executives are worried about losing their jobs,

281
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,059
but Director Ha?

282
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,799
Yoon Joo No used to work for him.

283
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,029
- Really? - Yes.

284
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,099
Before Director Ha became CFO, he was on the M and A Team.

285
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,269
(CFO: Chief financial officer)

286
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,500
I see.

287
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,539
Director Ha has nowhere to go now.

288
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,980
He'll either make CEO or be gone.

289
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,609
However, the chairman is bringing in someone...

290
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,949
who used to work under Director Ha...

291
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,509
to do the latter's work.

292
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,490
Director Ha's life is at stake this time around.

293
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,259
Hold on.

294
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Now, we can go.

295
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,869
Why is the chairman doing this?

296
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,929
Why else?

297
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,139
So that they'd give everything.

298
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,240
Pit one against the other.

299
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,539
The winner stays while the loser gets the boot.

300
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,179
What do you think will happen?

301
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,080
They'll both do whatever it takes.

302
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,019
Neither will want to lose, so they'll go the extra mile...

303
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,679
and then some.

304
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,590
- Here are your beverages. - Right.

305
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,120
Thank you.

306
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,289
Coming through.

307
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,059
Come on.

308
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,610
Still,

309
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,740
Director Ha and Yoon Joo No...

310
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,580
aren't in the same weight class.

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,678
Director Ha ranks second at this company.

312
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,250
That has me curious too.

313
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,619
Does the chairman see Yoon Joo No...

314
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,649
as the future?

315
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,490
Or is he giving Director Ha...

316
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,288
the opportunity to evade responsibility...

317
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,190
by using Yoon Joo No?

318
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,230
As if we'd know how the higher-ups think.

319
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,700
Director Lee is here.

320
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,299
Was it really the chairman who brought Yoon Joo No in?

321
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,769
I don't know.

322
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,980
Director Lee must've whispered in his ear.

323
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,210
I guess.

324
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,750
Director Lee is directly under the chairman.

325
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,980
Maybe there's no particular reason to it.

326
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
Director Ha should now be CEO,

327
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,619
so he could've brought Yoon Joo No in...

328
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,659
to do the grunt work.

329
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,889
- I see you're on the younger side. - Sorry?

330
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,799
You don't seem to know how scary labor can be.

331
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,200
You're still quite young.

332
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:42,009
Either way, a war has begun.

333
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,879
If Director Ha wins, he'll be made CEO.

334
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,409
If not, he'll be fired.

335
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,320
If Yoon Joo No wins... Could he become an executive?

336
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,819
Didn't you say he was a psychopath...

337
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,149
who only chased money?

338
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,119
Would they have him as an executive?

339
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Hey.

340
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,730
- That's more the reason. - What?

341
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,130
His kind is loved by company owners.

342
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,930
They protect your money.

343
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,240
All right.

344
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,980
Hey.

345
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,079
Wait in the conference room.

346
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,369
- Sir, here's some coffee. - Yes, thanks.

347
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,880
Either way, he can't solve this problem.

348
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
That's true.

349
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,079
I mean, the amount is...

350
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,180
Eleven billion dollars is unheard of.

351
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,619
In the midst of all this, we also have to defend our stock price.

352
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,119
So, what will happen if this fails?

353
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:08,960
What do you think?

354
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,160
Yoon Joo No will have to take responsibility for this mess...

355
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,329
and leave the company.

356
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,839
Oh, then naturally,

357
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,140
you'll become CEO.

358
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,150
Fine, Yoon Joo No can come.

359
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,160
Since the decision came from the chairman.

360
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,730
But who will manage him?

361
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,329
He used to work under you,

362
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,598
and since you're the CFO of the group...

363
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,630
Me?

364
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,769
Well, Mr. Yoon has his own opinions about things.

365
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,839
Tell him to set up his own team.

366
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,108
Director Lee, you could help him out if he needs support.

367
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,109
By that,

368
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:01,910
he means he wants...

369
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,880
to clearly identify who's a friend or foe.

370
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,079
- Is that what he's saying? - Yes.

371
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,949
I guess Director Ha is confident.

372
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,018
Then who will join his team?

373
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,960
We'll accept applications.

374
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,759
M and A is popular, you know.

375
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,329
Should we apply?

376
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,098
Do you want to join a game you're bound to lose?

377
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,160
In any case,

378
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,730
what is Mr. Yoon going to sell first when he joins us?

379
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,829
As for what his plans are,

380
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,139
let's have him tell us when he's here.

381
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,799
Do we have to hear it directly from Mr. Yoon?

382
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,039
I am the CFO of Sanin Group.

383
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,210
Right.

384
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,779
Then let's listen to Mr. CFO first.

385
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,058
(Sanin Group)

386
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,528
(Yukchamgoldan)

387
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,369
"Yukchamgoldan."

388
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,308
"Yuk" as in "meat," "cham" as in "to sever,"

389
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,809
"gol" as in "bone," and "dan" as in "to cut."

390
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,609
"Sever my flesh and offer it while cutting your bones."

391
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,649
The group is in jeopardy,

392
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,480
so we can't sit back and do nothing.

393
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,720
We should cut out what is causing a problem.

394
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,789
Let's take a look...

395
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,990
and find out what's flesh and where the bones lie.

396
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,559
Here are the financial statements of Sanin's subsidiaries.

397
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,630
First, Construction.

398
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,598
The numbers kept growing consistently...

399
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,730
until the sales figures went up twofold.

400
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,838
That was right after...

401
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,269
I took over Yonga E and C.

402
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,740
So, Construction is doing so well.

403
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,980
Then why is the group struggling so much?

404
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,279
All right. Look at the other subsidiaries' numbers.

405
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,650
As you can see, most of them are in the black.

406
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,589
Our hotels, entertainment business,

407
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,160
travel agencies, food business. They're all in the black.

408
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,328
Goodness. I sense a bloodbath coming.

409
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,460
Go back to the slide before this.

410
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,959
What's that? Yes, Wind. Bicycles.

411
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,730
That company couldn't even go public. Darn it.

412
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,568
All right. So, what does this mean?

413
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:07,299
Construction has been supporting everything else,

414
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,038
but it has hit its limit,

415
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,209
so it can't go on like this.

416
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,739
So what do you suggest we do?

417
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,849
This tells you...

418
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,349
where the flesh and the bones lie, right?

419
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,920
Then it's time to cut it out.

420
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,349
We'll calculate the sales and the total business profits...

421
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,588
and start selling the worst performers.

422
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:26,960
- What? - Goodness. That's...

423
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,758
Is this a joke?

424
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,930
Is this an audition to select members for an idol group?

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,160
Why? Why can't we do this?

426
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,098
Even kids have to survive in such a competitive environment.

427
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,200
We should work even harder!

428
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Director Ha.

429
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,339
Then how many companies will we sell?

430
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,038
Until we reach 11 billion dollars.

431
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,450
What? Eleven billion?

432
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,719
Are you saying we'll sell everything except for Construction?

433
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,189
But who are you to decide something like this?

434
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,460
This is my job as the CFO of the company.

435
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,619
Don't you see this?

436
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,159
It doesn't matter how much money Construction brings in.

437
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,200
The company has an 11 billion-dollar debt.

438
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,629
If we don't cut off Sanin's arms and legs now,

439
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,068
Sanin will lose its head, thanks to you!

440
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,700
They aren't the only ones who bring in money.

441
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,809
We're profitable too.

442
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,210
Right, Sanin Fashion.

443
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,180
All right, Sanin Fashion.

444
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,419
Total sales, 4.2 billion dollars.

445
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,480
Total profit, 29.8 million dollars. Right?

446
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,919
Why bother running this business?

447
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,419
Isn't it better to keep the money in the bank and collect interest?

448
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,619
Last winter wasn't cold. What were we supposed to do?

449
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,358
You see, fashion is significantly affected by weather...

450
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,429
You should've known those things and prepared for it.

451
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,500
Don't you watch the news?

452
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,828
Despite all the talks about global warming,

453
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,569
you made so many puffer jackets.

454
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,499
You couldn't sell them even at 50 percent off.

455
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
Aren't they all marked as unsold inventory now?

456
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,569
Ms. Min.

457
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:54,240
It requires a skill to predict consumer needs.

458
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,779
All right, next.

459
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,279
Sanin Hotel. Goodness.

460
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,019
You said you'd hit the jackpot after the pandemic.

461
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,858
You call this "jackpot?"

462
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:09,660
Well, honestly...

463
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,630
We need China's help.

464
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,028
What can I do? I can't control the current political situation.

465
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,069
Right, exactly.

466
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,269
If you can't find a way to control the situation,

467
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,740
you should just give up.

468
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,880
Well...

469
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,108
Mr. Yoon may have his own opinion about this, so...

470
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,250
Mr. Yoon?

471
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,220
Do I have to wait for Mr. Yoon?

472
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,900
I apologize for keeping you all waiting.

473
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,359
Hello, I'm Yoon Joo No.

474
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,730
Thank you for coming.

475
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,170
Do you know about the situation?

476
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,369
I've checked all the reports you sent.

477
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,369
And?

478
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,210
What do you think?

479
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,179
I'll submit a report once I'm done reviewing everything.

480
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,309
"Review?"

481
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,910
Oh, right.

482
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,220
I understand that the situation may require a big sacrifice.

483
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,319
However...

484
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,160
What is this? Why does everyone look so tense?

485
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,430
Hey, you're here.

486
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,099
Sit.

487
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,450
Are you confident?

488
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,390
Yes, sir.

489
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,619
All right. Then what can I do to help you?

490
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,689
I need to put together a team that I like.

491
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,359
All right. You can set up your own team.

492
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,000
Go for it.

493
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,869
Well, how about some of you here?

494
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,970
Any volunteers?

495
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,269
Goodness.

496
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,339
Why? You've all done some thinking,

497
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,609
and you don't think this team will do well?

498
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,190
- I'm off. - Yes, sir.

499
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,930
Then please excuse me. I have to go and set up my team now.

500
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,970
Oh, the one who had his hand up earlier.

501
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,339
Yes.

502
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,079
Come to the office by 5pm for your interview.

503
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
We'll talk then.

504
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,140
(Sanin Group)

505
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,890
Have you lost your mind?

506
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,920
You're doomed now.

507
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,329
Well, he seemed nicer than I thought.

508
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,630
- Everyone said he was competent. - Why, you...

509
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,970
You don't even understand the basics of working in a company.

510
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,139
Hey, for people like us,

511
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,509
it's always best not to be noticed.

512
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,239
If this goes well, I could get a permanent position.

513
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,480
That's... Hey, why would you...

514
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,449
Hey, you shouldn't say that.

515
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,279
You don't understand a thing about politics.

516
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,250
Hey, can a mere team manager win against the CFO?

517
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,960
Yoon Joo No is bound to fail.

518
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:03,589
They're just dumping it on him. It's over.

519
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
You fool.

520
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,099
But what if Mr. Yoon solves this problem?

521
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,930
You said yourself that he was a competent guy.

522
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,569
Competent? That's not important.

523
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,839
Hey, do you think 11 billion dollars is a joke?

524
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,479
You'll never touch that kind of money...

525
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,980
even after working 100,000 years if you make 100,000 dollars a year.

526
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:25,518
Let's say there's a monkey that saves 100,000 dollars every year.

527
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,048
Even if that monkey evolves into a human,

528
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,519
it wouldn't have 11 billion dollars.

529
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,390
- Hey. - What?

530
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,660
You're so good at math.

531
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,900
You punk.

532
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,399
You could never read the room back in school,

533
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,670
and you haven't changed at all.

534
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,910
And you were so good at pulling sly petty tricks back in school.

535
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,210
- You haven't changed either. - You little...

536
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Hey, you...

537
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,480
You can smile now, but you really are in trouble.

538
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,920
(Reserved)

539
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,509
(We welcome all visitors.)

540
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,980
This way, please.

541
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,890
Min Jeong, the uniform looks so good on you.

542
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,490
Thank you.

543
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,059
Min Jeong.

544
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,358
Did you use to work at the head office too?

545
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,500
What do you mean?

546
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,269
I mean, were you always this cold to everyone at the head office too?

547
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,240
Or do you look down on us because you used to...

548
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,839
work at the head office?

549
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:56,809
Min Jeong.

550
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,039
Do you think you'll go back to the head office?

551
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,480
You need my support here.

552
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,450
Only then can you have a bright future ahead of you.

553
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,119
You know what I'm saying, right?

554
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,390
Min Jeong, they're here for a consultation.

555
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,089
Okay.

556
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,460
- Hello. - Hello.

557
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,900
Is this one popular?

558
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,970
Well...

559
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,769
Honey. Of course, she'd say they're all popular.

560
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,640
She works for this company.

561
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,479
If we tally up your points, you have 42 points in total,

562
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,140
so you're right at the cutline.

563
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
As for the 84m² units, there are 5 in total.

564
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,980
So far, 2,380 people have applied for it.

565
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,890
The competition ratio is a little over 43 to 1.

566
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,118
I believe the number of applicants is going to triple.

567
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,490
Let's say it quadruples. Then it'll be 173 to 1.

568
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,900
See? She's just saying what she memorized.

569
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Right?

570
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:56,730
Do the math, and you'll know I'm right.

571
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,029
One moment.

572
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,039
Forty-three. She said if it were to quadruple...

573
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,309
Honey.

574
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,940
You get 172 when you multiply 43 by 4.

575
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:10,250
But she said 173.

576
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,819
I said it was a little over 43 to 1.

577
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,389
The exact number is 43.272727...

578
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,518
It's a non-terminating decimal that goes on forever.

579
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,959
That multiplied by 4 equals 173.090909...

580
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,929
Again, a non-terminating decimal.

581
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,799
So, 173 is the correct answer.

582
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,599
Your brain works like a computer.

583
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,670
Not really.

584
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,500
Anyway, the math is correct.

585
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,619
If you're pregnant now...

586
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,789
How did you know? I am pregnant.

587
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,299
What? Honey, you're pregnant?

588
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,269
Mr. Yoon?

589
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,940
Mr. Yoon, how did you get here?

590
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,140
- I cabbed here. - Pardon?

591
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,440
No, I mean...

592
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,440
Did you get demoted?

593
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:16,710
Not exactly, but something like that.

594
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,220
Can you work with me?

595
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,519
Your consultation.

596
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,130
- Yeon Su. - Yes?

597
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,798
If you're pregnant, you have more than one child,

598
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,900
so go for something else.

599
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,529
I wouldn't go for this unit if I were you.

600
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,180
When did you get transferred here?

601
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,690
A little after you left.

602
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,430
It was Director Ha's decision, right?

603
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,099
But I enjoyed the work there.

604
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,169
Why didn't you get another job?

605
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,539
You must've received many offers.

606
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,539
Offers? No, none.

607
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,950
I'm relieved to hear that.

608
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,250
Yes.

609
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,819
By the way, where in Suwon are we headed now?

610
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,160
Haerang Law Office.

611
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,200
Attorney Oh Soon Young?

612
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,339
- Uncle. - Yes?

613
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:46,839
Can't we order sweet and sour pork?

614
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,839
No, we cannot.

615
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,869
We had no work this month.

616
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,380
That's your fault, not mine.

617
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,539
You little...

618
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,420
Thank you.

619
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh, here.

620
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,759
Listen, Mr. Attorney.

621
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,930
About the thing I mentioned last time...

622
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,828
But we didn't order this.

623
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:12,999
Just try it.

624
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,129
It's the best-selling dish here.

625
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,130
Thank you.

626
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:20,739
You know, I told you that the realtor...

627
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,140
had been badmouthing me.

628
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,980
I'm just wondering if I can sue him for defamation.

629
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,680
That was the realtor?

630
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,379
What did he say about you?

631
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,649
That jerk said I used some weird meat here.

632
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,279
He kept lying to people about it.

633
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,750
Do you know how hard it is to catch pigeons?

634
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,220
Well, the thing is...

635
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,230
There's defamation by publicly alleging facts.

636
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,399
Then there's defamation by publicly alleging false facts.

637
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,829
- Which one is it? - What does that mean?

638
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,869
What kind of meat do you use?

639
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,069
Pigeon.

640
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:00,809
Just kidding.

641
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,680
I was joking!

642
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,779
We only use the top-grade pork.

643
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,989
Right.

644
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,360
Then it's true that he spread false information about you.

645
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,988
You two should just reconcile.

646
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,760
The realtor told me...

647
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,929
that you made fun of him for being bald.

648
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,599
Well, he is bald. It's not like I lied.

649
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:26,440
I said he's bald because he is.

650
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,969
Even when he wears his wig, it's so obvious.

651
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,908
How's that considered defamation?

652
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,539
Well, that is considered...

653
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,610
defamation by publicly alleging facts.

654
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,479
It can cause emotional distress,

655
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,880
so it tends to be punished more harshly these days.

656
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,218
There used to be more emphasis on physical harm,

657
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,419
but emotional wellbeing is equally important these days.

658
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,889
Whatever, I don't care. I'm just going to sue him.

659
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,460
Just settle things between you two.

660
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,698
The realtor said his adopted son was an attorney...

661
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,269
and threatened me.

662
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,199
Do people still adopt children these days?

663
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,110
In any case, I'm going to sue him.

664
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,139
We charge 50 dollars for a written complaint.

665
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,879
Just make peace. You'll regret it later if you don't.

666
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,178
No. I've made up my mind.

667
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,988
I'm going to the police station today.

668
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:16,989
I will sue him.

669
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,989
Listen.

670
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:23,630
Attornies are like hunting dogs. Okay?

671
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,499
That's why I'm telling you to bite down on that real estate guy.

672
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,968
I'll give you the money, okay?

673
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,868
If I bite down on that real estate owner,

674
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:33,339
it won't end there.

675
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,698
He'll hire an attorney.

676
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,869
And what will happen if we go into a lawsuit?

677
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,309
You will win for sure, won't you?

678
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,109
Have all of those scumbags come at me!

679
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,149
Of course, I will win.

680
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,780
But attornies don't fight each other.

681
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,718
His hunting dog will bite you down,

682
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,749
while I bite the real estate owner down.

683
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,419
It's the two of you who will have the hardest time.

684
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,658
The attornies will simply earn money behind their desk.

685
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,928
Gosh, so what?

686
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,098
Just make peace.

687
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,500
Good grief. Hence why...

688
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,599
you have no money for sweet and sour pork.

689
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,839
Really, what a huge scaredy-cat for a guy...

690
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,209
as big as a thug.

691
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,940
It's not that I'm scared.

692
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:13,679
And what thug?

693
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,610
I'm the cute type, you know?

694
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,499
(Green Tree Real Estate)

695
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Son!

696
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,630
Have a cup of coffee.

697
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,328
Stop calling me son.

698
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,170
We don't have that big of an age gap.

699
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Must we be blood-related for me to call you son?

700
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,110
I call you that because I adore you.

701
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,809
Others are scared by your unfriendly impression,

702
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,739
but I find you absolutely cute.

703
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Come in.

704
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:56,449
I'm going ahead.

705
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,419
The one talking behind your back...

706
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,089
is the Chinese restaurant owner, right?

707
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,259
Did that guy badmouth about me even to you?

708
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,829
No. An attorney just finds out everything.

709
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,500
What now? We'll sue him, yes?

710
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,639
Just make peace with each other.

711
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,939
Didn't you start rumors that he used pigeon meat for the dumplings?

712
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,909
Me? No. I never did that.

713
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,210
But you said so to me.

714
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,309
Is that so?

715
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,050
So what?

716
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,879
That guy started it...

717
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,189
by insulting my looks first.

718
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,219
Here's the thing.

719
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,218
It's easy to prove that...

720
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:37,130
the Chinese restaurant sales dropped due to that rumor.

721
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:39,559
All that is needed is the account book.

722
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,599
But...

723
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,499
your emotional damage...

724
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,199
is hard to prove.

725
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,969
It's not like we can see the damage by opening your heart.

726
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,940
That's exactly what I mean.

727
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,279
Do you have any idea how hurt I was by it?

728
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,309
I know.

729
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,479
So just call your broken heart...

730
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
and the Chinese restaurant's drop in sales even.

731
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,849
What nonsense are you spouting?

732
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,949
You can't possibly say that if you realize how distressed I am.

733
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,759
Ever since...

734
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,460
that jerk said I was bald,

735
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,989
wearing this wig makes me embarrassed.

736
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,230
But not wearing it does the same.

737
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,929
I feel naked even when I'm wearing it.

738
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,969
And when I'm not, I feel like it's on me.

739
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,710
I'm more upset at you...

740
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,679
for not understanding how I feel.

741
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,309
Well, right...

742
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:34,480
Think about it...

743
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,289
and make peace.

744
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,519
You...

745
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:42,729
(Haerang Law Office)

746
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,189
You have a guest.

747
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,559
What? A guest?

748
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,829
Attorney Oh.

749
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,929
Let's work on a project together.

750
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,238
You see,

751
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,969
I had the most fun working with you, Mr. Yoon, and Min Jeong.

752
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,779
Fighting isn't my forte.

753
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,280
M and A is perfect for me.

754
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,819
You look fit for the MMA.

755
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,480
But M and A must be your calling.

756
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,059
By the way,

757
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,960
haven't I become cute since we last saw each other?

758
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,599
Many neighbors said I looked adorable.

759
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,070
At this rate, I can't work with you on this team.

760
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,079
Does that mean it'll be just the two of us, Mr. Yoon?

761
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,380
I guess.

762
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,050
Oh, there's one more person.

763
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,518
(M and A Team)

764
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,328
Are you okay with how it turned out?

765
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,889
Well, I'm just here for an interview.

766
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,630
It'll be fine. This is what people usually want.

767
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:57,869
It's quite old-fashioned.

768
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,750
Are you waiting?

769
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,589
Why are you coming inside?

770
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,489
To get a cup of coffee.

771
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,428
You drink coffee like it's water.

772
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:24,429
Hey.

773
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,400
Coffee flows in a company worker's blood vessel.

774
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,860
Haven't you heard that?

775
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,139
Good grief. The M and A Team?

776
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,500
I feel bad for you.

777
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,940
- Why? - Jin Soo.

778
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:41,079
Come with me. I'll teach you.

779
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,579
What a hotshot team looks like.

780
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,690
Why that floor?

781
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,960
Right.

782
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,590
I'm indeed taking a mere intern...

783
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,260
to a sacred place.

784
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,969
Jin Soo. This is the highest floor.

785
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,340
There's another floor above us, no?

786
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,269
That's the chairman's office.

787
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,510
To the civilians, this is the highest floor.

788
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Here.

789
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,219
On the left is Senior Managing Director Ha.

790
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,219
On the right is Junior Managing Director Lee.

791
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,639
Hey. Jin Soo.

792
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:43,110
Just look at this.

793
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,170
We have class, don't we?

794
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,249
Really, Jin Soo. You see...

795
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,380
Work with me,

796
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,579
and you get to drink high-end coffee.

797
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,589
But if you work in that hopeless team...

798
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,489
in that corner,

799
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,260
you'll always drink instant coffee. Got it?

800
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,500
What do you think?

801
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:10,599
Will you join me?

802
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,369
Are you recruiting me?

803
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,110
Depends on how you do.

804
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:23,250
But I heard Mr. Yoon was the heir.

805
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,050
Really?

806
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,219
I thought I was the heir.

807
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:28,920
No, listen.

808
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:31,889
The chairman refused second-generation management, right?

809
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,389
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

810
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,429
That only made office politics worse.

811
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,059
You see...

812
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,800
The chairman has a daughter he's been hiding.

813
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:46,400
He's going to have her marry Mr. Yoon.

814
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,000
That's why he said no to second-generation management.

815
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,309
Who told you that?

816
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,980
I just overheard it.

817
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,039
- Is that so? - Yes.

818
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,309
Team Manager Yoon Joo No...

819
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,019
Is the chairman fine with him?

820
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:04,119
He's already married.

821
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,690
Sorry?

822
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,019
Mr. Yoon is taken, punk.

823
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,590
He's married.

824
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,400
By the way, did you come alone?

825
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:22,769
Yes.

826
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,170
You should've come together.

827
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,679
Are you returning to Korea for good this time?

828
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,449
Who knows?

829
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,760
Is it up to this project?

830
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,129
Once this project is over,

831
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,530
I'll likely be fired.

832
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,460
Whether it succeeds...

833
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,599
or not.

834
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,199
Anyway, if Yoon Joo No...

835
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:57,210
fails this project, he'll go down with it.

836
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,309
If he succeeds,

837
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,639
he'll lose favor with Number Two and go down.

838
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,949
- Do you mean Director Ha? - Yes.

839
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,320
Rather than getting on the bad side of the future CEO,

840
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,849
it's better to fail.

841
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:12,019
The company is politics and playing favorites.

842
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,030
It's a historically unchanging truth.

843
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,030
Jin Soo.

844
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,559
Did Yi Sun Sin die because he was bad at fighting?

845
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:25,329
No matter how talented you are, if you can't do politics, you die.

846
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,900
The minute you work for him,

847
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,840
you'll end up like Yoon Joo No.

848
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:31,940
You...

849
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,110
better think about how to fail that interview.

850
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:39,209
(M and A Team)

851
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,219
Come in.

852
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,489
Hi. I'm Intern Choi Jin Soo.

853
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:49,559
Is there a reason you applied for the M and A Team?

854
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,029
Yes.

855
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,689
I believe it was my chance...

856
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,460
to learn from you, Mr. Yoon.

857
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,499
Right now, our team must raise 11 billion dollars,

858
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,400
while maintaining the stock price in the 100-dollar range.

859
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,769
You're aware of it, yes?

860
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,610
We were in the same meeting earlier.

861
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,010
Yes.

862
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:08,980
How was an intern in that meeting?

863
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,480
I was setting up the refreshments...

864
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,750
when the meeting suddenly started. I missed my chance to leave.

865
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,750
How much is our company's market capitalization?

866
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,989
It should be about 19 billion dollars.

867
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,690
And after we repay the 11 billion dollars we must secure?

868
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,659
- The market capitalization? - Yes.

869
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,400
It's hard to tell.

870
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,259
How come?

871
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,530
Shouldn't it go up once we repay that money?

872
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,840
That's already reflected in the current stock price.

873
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,039
Does that mean it'll continue to be 19 billion dollars?

874
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,340
No. There will be a change.

875
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,710
But that'll depend on Mr. Yoon.

876
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,519
You were even the president of the stock investment club.

877
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,690
I'm Manager Yang Hyun A from the HR Team.

878
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,448
I'm texting you as you were offline...

879
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,719
in the internal messenger.

880
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,018
Provide your team member list,

881
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,619
and I'll process the position transfers.

882
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,889
Thank you.

883
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,329
Did you earn?

884
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,230
- No. - Manager Kwak Min Jeong.

885
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,529
Did you lose?

886
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,070
- Attorney Oh Soon Young. - No.

887
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,300
Why is it a no to both?

888
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,670
I don't know as I haven't realized my return yet.

889
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,170
What's your price-earnings ratio?

890
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,679
It's 700 percent.

891
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,210
Goodness.

892
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,409
I was simply lucky.

893
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,690
Which team do you have in mind if you don't pass ours?

894
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:26,989
Sorry?

895
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,130
Well...

896
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,269
Actually, someone asked me to join their team.

897
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:39,670
Already? Who was it?

898
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,570
It may not be smart of me to say it,

899
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:42,939
but he was from the HR Team.

900
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,039
The HR Team is a top-rated department.

901
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,539
They must've liked you, Jin Soo.

902
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:49,339
No wonder.

903
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,510
They're the first to recognize a person of talent.

904
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,579
No, but I still prefer the M and A Team.

905
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,250
Does the HR Team have a job opening?

906
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,119
Did you say the HR Team?

907
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:02,219
The department that made the offer.

908
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
Yes.

909
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,360
Our HR Team?

910
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,230
No, we don't.

911
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,679
Are the two mentioned above the only M and A Team members?

912
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
Yes.

913
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,920
Last question. Will this project succeed?

914
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,230
No.

915
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:42,099
Then why did you apply to this team?

916
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:45,030
To be honest,

917
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,769
I heard rumors about you, Mr. Yoon.

918
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,909
In the process of this project failing,

919
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,980
I feel like you'll do everything you can.

920
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,039
There will be plenty to learn from it.

921
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,960
The project may succeed.

922
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,230
Yes, of course.

923
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:15,960
Let's see how it'll go.

924
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:19,070
Did I pass?

925
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,269
I'm Kwak Min Jeong, in charge of finance.

926
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,570
I see.

927
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,210
I'm Oh Soon Young, specializing in corporate law.

928
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,110
I do this and that.

929
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,550
Including Intern Choi Jin Soo,

930
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,789
it's three members.

931
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,360
May I ask a question, Mr. Yoon?

932
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,960
Yes, go ahead.

933
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:44,989
Are you...

934
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,860
married?

935
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,199
I am.

936
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,300
I see.

937
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,679
Good grief.

938
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,949
Your physical stamina is shocking.

939
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,579
To accomplish big things, you must have good physical strength. No?

940
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,619
I haven't been able to work out lately.

941
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:15,360
But I'm naturally strong, Chairman Song.

942
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:17,230
It doesn't seem like it.

943
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,360
No, Chairman Song.

944
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,259
I'll become fit in no time.

945
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,500
Good. That's to be expected to achieve great things.

946
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,500
When it comes to work,

947
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,239
it's all about physical strength.

948
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,710
Would you like a cup of tea?

949
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,179
Sure.

950
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,750
Gosh.

951
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,320
Is that from our company?

952
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,888
Yes.

953
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:48,860
It's a tumbler from Bareun Life.

954
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,328
Being eco-friendly is the trend.

955
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,928
Many youngsters buy it.

956
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:55,800
Making that will destroy the environment more,

957
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,630
but youngsters prefer that?

958
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,469
You're right about that.

959
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:02,599
It won't sell for long.

960
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:06,440
Make ones that are cheap and pretty.

961
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,639
Understood.

962
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:16,920
I have a long way to go to catch up with your insights.

963
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,360
Thanks for the tea.

964
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,500
- Director Ha. - Yes, Chairman Song?

965
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
If...

966
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,599
you plan to climb higher,

967
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,579
you must use your people well.

968
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,039
There's no need for you to do it all.

969
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,250
Order people around. All right?

970
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,650
Yes. I'll bear that in mind, Chairman Song.

971
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,050
Hey.

972
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,819
What about lunch, Chairman Song?

973
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,119
I already made a reservation.

974
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,789
Let's have it next time. I'm not hungry.

975
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Understood.

976
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,769
Saving...

977
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,099
the company is the top priority.

978
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,739
Sorry?

979
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:13,610
Oh, yes. I'll be sure to remember it.

980
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,780
Where's your car?

981
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,780
I parked it over there.

982
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,150
Go home. I'm leaving first.

983
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,820
Let's go.

984
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,119
Goodness.

985
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,929
Turn the side mirror. I want to see the rear.

986
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,110
All right. Keep going.

987
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,880
Shall I drive you home?

988
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,880
I'm going to the Folk Flea Market today.

989
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,549
Are you free?

990
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,449
No, let's go to Cheonggye River.

991
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,590
Why does he suddenly want to see us?

992
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,860
Is he trying to pull rank again?

993
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,130
Here he comes.

994
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:12,499
- Director Ha. - Hi.

995
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,869
- Welcome. - Did you go hiking?

996
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,340
Yes, with the chairman.

997
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,510
What? Just the two of you?

998
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,610
Yes, we often hike together.

999
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,750
You must've had a little chat.

1000
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,119
He always repeats himself.

1001
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,190
"Take care of the company. You must do well."

1002
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,619
But he was quite assertive today.

1003
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
It made me think...

1004
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,610
if I should come to terms with it.

1005
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,969
Given the chairman's age,

1006
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:55,340
I'm worried that it might jeopardize the company.

1007
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,879
Gosh, yes. You're right. By the way, did the chairman say...

1008
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,718
anything about Yoon Joo No?

1009
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,949
That was probably implied when he told me that.

1010
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:06,488
That's all part of running the company.

1011
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:07,489
Right.

1012
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,789
Thank you.

1013
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:18,429
Sir.

1014
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,869
Please allow me to buy you a drink today.

1015
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,969
Let me make a reservation right away.

1016
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,738
This place serves excellent food.

1017
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:27,939
No, let's take a rain check.

1018
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,280
- I had some food with the chairman. - I see.

1019
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,859
I wonder what's going to happen to Director Lee.

1020
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,960
He'll have to leave soon, right?

1021
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,570
- Probably. - Yes.

1022
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,829
That sounds about right. Let's go.

1023
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,538
Sir, how much is this?

1024
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:57,409
- Would you like to buy that? - Yes.

1025
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,639
You seem to know a thing or two about nacre. It's 500 dollars.

1026
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,010
That's expensive.

1027
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,280
That's a reasonable price for nacre.

1028
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,690
It does nothing for me as I don't have that much money.

1029
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:14,619
How much do you have?

1030
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,329
Well, perhaps about 400 dollars.

1031
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,760
- Fine. - Thank you.

1032
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,429
Hey, stop that.

1033
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,039
Why do you want to waste money on this useless thing?

1034
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:28,800
He told me this was made of nacre.

1035
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:30,908
Gosh, I don't care what it's made of.

1036
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,610
Why would you want to buy a used table from a stranger?

1037
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:34,909
Let's go and have some noodles.

1038
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:36,679
- But that's... - Just go.

1039
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,110
Come on.

1040
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,118
Why do you want to buy that old thing?

1041
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,119
But it was...

1042
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,589
Darn it. That rotten jerk.

1043
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,659
He bombed my sale.

1044
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:54,329
- Here. - Thanks.

1045
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,999
Our childhood palate never seems to change.

1046
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,070
Never.

1047
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,369
That's why things like this turn into memories.

1048
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,900
You're right.

1049
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,269
Why do you want to quit?

1050
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,440
That again?

1051
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,348
You and I have so many memories together.

1052
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:15,380
You're hurting my feelings.

1053
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,989
I just thought that it was time to hang up my boots.

1054
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,260
I seem to become more ambitious with time.

1055
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,359
There's a saying that the older a bag gets,

1056
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,829
the more things it can hold.

1057
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:28,900
You have everything. How could you want more?

1058
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,800
Well, I just want my people. That's all.

1059
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,340
Time takes them away from me one at a time.

1060
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:38,408
There's nothing I can do when death takes them away.

1061
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:40,209
But having a living one running away from me...

1062
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,280
doesn't feel good. Okay?

1063
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,650
You have so many followers. Why would you say that?

1064
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:47,518
That's their attempt...

1065
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,819
at taking over the company because I said I wouldn't let my son...

1066
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,820
inherit the company.

1067
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:52,119
Naturally, how could I trust their intention?

1068
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,159
That's why...

1069
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,260
I rely on you a lot.

1070
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
I'm sorry.

1071
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:08,269
But you're not interested in letting Director Ha take over?

1072
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,239
Well,

1073
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,239
I need more time to observe.

1074
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,510
By the way,

1075
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,480
about Yoon Joo No...

1076
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,550
I agreed to bringing him back as it was your last request.

1077
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:27,590
But I don't trust him.

1078
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,130
You can't leave me until he finishes...

1079
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,429
his job.

1080
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:40,299
I just want to take a break. That's all.

1081
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,940
What if he messes up again?

1082
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,809
If that happens,

1083
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,710
you'll have to take responsibility.

1084
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:48,280
Here's the thing.

1085
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,750
I trust you, not him. Did you get that?

1086
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,789
I got it.

1087
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:00,219
But...

1088
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:03,259
Yoon Joo No isn't what you think.

1089
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,260
Whatever. I've heard enough about him.

1090
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,658
My gosh, you poor thing.

1091
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,968
You're still naive at your old age.

1092
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,030
How will you survive without me?

1093
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,999
You were about to buy the old nacre table from a stranger.

1094
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,909
Good grief. Unbelievable.

1095
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,539
Let's just enjoy our noodles. Okay?

1096
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,210
I have a question.

1097
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:58,449
Yes, sir.

1098
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,949
Do you have another reason for coming back to Korea?

1099
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,920
I know that you brought me back to Korea,

1100
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:09,989
so I could rescue Sanin Group from the crisis.

1101
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,599
I simply asked if you had another reason for coming back.

1102
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Yes.

1103
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,869
If you are taking on this project with that mindset,

1104
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:24,110
then don't.

1105
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,079
Joo No.

1106
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,809
If you handle this project with that mindset,

1107
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,519
both the project and you will be ruined.

1108
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:02,909
(The late Yoon Joo Seok)

1109
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,179
I can't be...

1110
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,949
any more ruined than I already am.

1111
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,929
(Sanin)

1112
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,599
- You're here. - Everyone's here early.

1113
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:30,710
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

1114
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,110
I didn't. I got some sleep.

1115
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,139
Let's hear it.

1116
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,420
(Sanin Group's Total Sales)

1117
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:48,888
It's true that the construction subsidiary...

1118
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,829
is indeed supporting the rest of the subsidiaries.

1119
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,460
But the problem is that even Construction...

1120
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,799
is seeing declining profit margins as the easing of regulations...

1121
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,999
for redevelopment projects is being delayed.

1122
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,299
But if the laws change regarding the construction sector,

1123
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,839
there could be momentum,

1124
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,510
so profit margins could go up again.

1125
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:06,808
So if we sell all the subsidiaries...

1126
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,178
excluding Construction,

1127
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,609
the market value would be around seven billion dollars.

1128
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,650
If we can sell off the rest and make seven billion dollars,

1129
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,679
is there a chance for us to raise that to 11 billion dollars?

1130
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:18,420
It won't be easy,

1131
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,119
but it's not impossible.

1132
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,388
It's not impossible if we get a good price on the sale?

1133
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:24,429
Right.

1134
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,928
But the problem is that overall, their sales...

1135
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:30,869
aren't so high.

1136
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,070
Why is that?

1137
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:35,069
They failed to establish a presence in the online market.

1138
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,440
That seems to be the main cause.

1139
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,408
Sanin's leading companies...

1140
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:40,909
make most of their profits from the stores.

1141
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,078
But our competitors began switching over...

1142
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,308
to the DTC model a decade ago.

1143
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,519
As of now, the online market share is much larger for them.

1144
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,650
But in comparison, our presence...

1145
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,919
in the online market is minimal.

1146
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Our fashion subsidiary is the only one.

1147
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,488
Well, to be honest, it's a relief...

1148
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,828
the company didn't go under given the minimal online presence.

1149
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:59,460
Everyone shops on their phones these days.

1150
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,130
But...

1151
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,429
why won't they do it?

1152
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,868
We can now easily shop on our phones...

1153
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,199
and receive our packages by next morning.

1154
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,138
Honestly, I'm a bit shocked that they still sell their products...

1155
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,570
only at the offline stores.

1156
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,440
And that Sanin still has no presence in the online market.

1157
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,550
You must have been quite shocked.

1158
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,980
Sanin doesn't even do ads.

1159
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:22,880
- No ads? - That's right.

1160
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,589
As for Sanin Group,

1161
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,558
there's a series of subsidiaries under the head office.

1162
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,618
With this kind of structure,

1163
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,530
the chairman's opinion is extremely important.

1164
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,599
Even so, shouldn't someone tell him this isn't good for the company?

1165
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,099
- Someone should. - Who?

1166
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:44,739
(Sanin Group)

1167
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,578
Hello.

1168
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,739
I'm Team Manager Yoon Joo No of M and A Team.

1169
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,309
I will begin by presenting my analysis of the company.

1170
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,189
Let me first tell you the name...

1171
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,090
of the project that aims to raise 11 billion dollars.

1172
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:01,960
Let's come up with the name of the project.

1173
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,730
Gosh, this is the most important one.

1174
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,960
Naming is the hardest part.

1175
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,869
Since we have to take on an impossible mission...

1176
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:12,429
This is a nice one.

1177
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,539
Project Mission Impossible.

1178
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,170
- Too long. - Too long.

1179
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:18,210
Any ideas, Min Jeong?

1180
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,980
I believe this project will be a huge momentum for Sanin.

1181
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:25,808
Project Momentum.

1182
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,780
Project Momentum.

1183
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,319
That doesn't roll off the tongue nicely.

1184
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,050
We're in the M and A Team.

1185
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,518
Jin Soo has a way...

1186
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:35,389
of presenting the obvious as a new idea. Right?

1187
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,929
M and A, Mission Impossible, and Momentum.

1188
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:42,960
It all begins with an M.

1189
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,300
The name of the project is...

1190
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,440
Project M.

1191
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:52,170
I was able to thoroughly review the company report you submitted.

1192
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:53,879
Thanks to your cooperation,

1193
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,480
my team and I were able to complete our due diligence.

1194
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,309
Now, let us look at the presentation we put together based on that.

1195
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:02,578
As you can see, most of the profit margins...

1196
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:03,750
aren't satisfactory,

1197
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:05,319
but since you also included growth strategies for this year...

1198
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,489
along with the report,

1199
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,960
I have reviewed them together.

1200
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,819
Construction made up...

1201
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,260
for nearly half of last quarter's revenues again.

1202
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,360
Yes. That's right.

1203
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:17,670
However, unfortunately, the group is struggling overall,

1204
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:20,869
so the sale of some businesses has become inevitable.

1205
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:24,869
Well, we're all aware of that. Don't stall, and just announce it.

1206
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,209
All right then.

1207
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,309
I will now announce the business we plan to sell off.

1208
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,849
If we sell off all the subsidiaries excluding Sanin Construction,

1209
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,480
we might be able to come up with 11 billion dollars?

1210
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,150
Right. But it won't be easy.

1211
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:38,988
Don't you think not entering the online market...

1212
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,690
could give us a new possibility?

1213
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,030
There's an expression for that.

1214
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,360
The unscratched lottery ticket.

1215
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,158
Not entering the online market could make it...

1216
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,699
an unscratched lottery ticket.

1217
01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:52,730
We could get 30 percent more with that new possibility.

1218
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,900
No.

1219
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,538
As it will be a latecomer,

1220
01:03:56,539 --> 01:03:58,070
marketing the company will cost a fortune.

1221
01:03:58,269 --> 01:03:59,309
That won't do.

1222
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,409
So the construction regulations can change, right?

1223
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,078
The government policies are favorable...

1224
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,510
to the construction sector.

1225
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,908
- The reason being? - As the election is coming up,

1226
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,320
it's likely that they will try to prevent an economic slowdown.

1227
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,718
If that happens, it will be good news...

1228
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:12,948
for companies like Sanin Construction...

1229
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,389
that have secured businesses in prime areas.

1230
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:19,130
Sanin Construction is indeed the core of the company.

1231
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:21,730
Right.

1232
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,329
Then it leaves me with no choice.

1233
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,000
We've gone over all the subsidiaries in the group...

1234
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:30,969
and reached the following conclusion.

1235
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,479
(Sanin Construction)

1236
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,510
We will sell off...

1237
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:37,210
Sanin Construction.

1238
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,150
Have you gone mad?

1239
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,989
- With this strategy... - Hey.

1240
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,348
Sanin Construction is supporting the entire group.

1241
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,860
If you sell that off, we'll all go bankrupt.

1242
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,289
You won't go bankrupt even if we sell Sanin Construction.

1243
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:51,889
(Sanin Construction)

1244
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,460
It will come close,

1245
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:55,759
but the group won't go bankrupt even if we sell Sanin Construction.

1246
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,760
Yoon Joo No.

1247
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,500
Be quiet. You must have lost your mind.

1248
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:03,038
Why don't we hear him out?

1249
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,369
Hear him out? For what? He's spewing nonsense.

1250
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:08,840
You...

1251
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,110
You're targeting me, aren't you?

1252
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,448
You're not here to save the company. You're trying to bring me down.

1253
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:15,550
Am I right or not?

1254
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,419
Everyone here knows that Sanin Group can't survive...

1255
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,650
without Sanin Construction.

1256
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:22,989
As you said,

1257
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,959
the whole market knows that Sanin Construction is carrying...

1258
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,329
Sanin Group.

1259
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,428
That's why the moment we announce...

1260
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:30,969
that we'll sell everything but the core part of the company,

1261
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:32,900
Sanin Group...

1262
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:34,969
will go down.

1263
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,599
What?

1264
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:39,610
If we sell everything but Sanin Construction,

1265
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,078
everyone will think that we're selling companies...

1266
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,980
that aren't profitable and keeping the ones that are.

1267
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:48,050
In other words, we'll be dumping them, not selling.

1268
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,250
If that happens, we can't get a fair price...

1269
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,090
because no one pays a good price for discarded products.

1270
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,559
With that direction, we can't even get seven billion dollars.

1271
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,300
Then this project...

1272
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,800
will fail.

1273
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:07,769
There will be a huge backlash.

1274
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,170
Right.

1275
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,638
Director Ha won't let anything happen to Sanin Construction.

1276
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:13,670
That's true.

1277
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,880
But what is the right decision for Sanin Group?

1278
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,009
Right.

1279
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,949
I will follow your lead too.

1280
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:22,650
Let's go with that then.

1281
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,250
What about you, Jin Soo?

1282
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:27,860
I do think you're right about this.

1283
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,119
But will the stock price hold up?

1284
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:33,429
Without Sanin Construction, Sanin Group will be nothing.

1285
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:37,929
But Sanin Group won't get delisted.

1286
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:41,300
All right. We have to buy some time first.

1287
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,710
Even so,

1288
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:49,039
the value of Sanin Construction is slightly over six billion dollars.

1289
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,510
There's news of easing regulations in the construction sector.

1290
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:53,380
We should be able to get up to seven billion dollars.

1291
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,179
So listen. We need to come up with 11 billion dollars.

1292
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,389
What about the rest?

1293
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,989
I don't have a solution that can fix Sanin Group's problems at once.

1294
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,889
Once we sell Sanin Construction and secure seven billion dollars,

1295
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,559
- we can look for... - You.

1296
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:08,460
Didn't you say you agreed with me?

1297
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,800
How could you stab me in the back?

1298
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:12,900
Yes.

1299
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,570
I entirely agree with your opinion.

1300
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,210
"Yukchamgoldan."

1301
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:21,639
"Offer my flesh to secure my bones."

1302
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:24,039
I also believe in that direction.

1303
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:25,980
But...

1304
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,150
the flesh offered by Sanin Group...

1305
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,349
must be Sanin Construction.

1306
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,289
Hey, you jerk!

1307
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,500
My gosh, sir.

1308
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:46,099
Sit down.

1309
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:50,099
Sit.

1310
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:57,849
So? How are things going?

1311
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,980
Well,

1312
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,719
we will sell Sanin Construction.

1313
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,460
At how much?

1314
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:12,828
At the current market price,

1315
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,360
we could get up to seven billion dollars.

1316
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,470
Nonsense. We should at least get two digits.

1317
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,399
Sorry?

1318
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,869
Sanin Construction was my first project.

1319
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,210
That being said,

1320
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:30,979
it should get its worth.

1321
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Sir.

1322
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,318
Receiving three billion dollars more than its market price...

1323
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:42,390
What's wrong?

1324
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,529
Can't you do it?

1325
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,170
Tell me.

1326
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:06,779
(The Art of Negotiation)

1327
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,779
I believe we must sell...

1328
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,979
the best bit for Sanin Group to survive.

1329
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,948
The moment he said he'd sell Sanin Construction,

1330
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:44,619
it was over for him.

1331
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,420
We can't pay you ten billion dollars. Never.

1332
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,688
Then I'm not selling.

1333
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,960
He has no idea he's digging his own grave.

1334
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:52,089
He's working so hard at preparing his own burial spot.

1335
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,198
I thought you were the negotiation expert.

1336
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:55,729
Show us what you can do.

1337
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:57,260
That lunatic.

1338
01:09:57,829 --> 01:09:59,569
M and A is a fight of contracts.

1339
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,739
We will lose the war if we let our emotions run wild.

1340
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,069
What's the CEO like?

1341
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,640
What are you guys? Thugs?

1342
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,840
He's worse.

1343
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,239
I'd like to buy it at a cheap price.

1344
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:11,750
We have to sell it at a high price.

1345
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,179
(We will forever remember our dazzling colleague, )

1346
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,520
(the late Lee Yoon Hee.)
