12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,830
What's going on?

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,860
Two days ago, 100 million was withdrawn

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,630
but no record of how it was used.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,920
In cash?

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,560
Yes.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,120
CEO Lee has the bank transaction authority, right?

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,260
Yes, and there is one more person...

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,940
Maybe there's another reason for it.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,670
It could've been a mistake.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,650
We don't know who withdrew the money either.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,080
 ­  

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,940
Unni!

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,430
Unni, you didn't go anywhere on your day off?

25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,030
Are you out for lunch?

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,260
Yes, I'm tired of cafeteria food.

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,530
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

28
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,220
Okay.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,130
See you... Watch out for cars...

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll meet with Bon Ju first.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,220
Oh, hello.

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm sorry, but is Jeong Bon Ju here?

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,150
Bon Ju...

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,230
Oh, Bon Ju took the day off today.

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,710
But I did see her at the bank.

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,700
The bank? By chance, which bank was it?

37
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,330
CEO.

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,840
Yes, what is it?

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,370
Looks like you're going somewhere.

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,440
Yes, why?

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,270
I have something to tell you.

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,210
Do you have a brief moment?

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,370
I need to get going right now.

44
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,980
What is this about?

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,190
I want to make a withdrawal.

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,360
How much?

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,530
The full amount.

48
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,940
- Jeong Bon Ju? 
 - Yes.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,460
You want to withdraw all this in cash?

50
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,010
Yes.

51
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,150
Why? Can't I?

52
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,370
No. Just a moment.

53
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,150
Pardon?

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,460
Mr. Yun, isn't this too much?

55
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,820
You've already conducted due diligence and now this?

56
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,890
Do you know how hard I worked for Greenview?

57
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,360
Are you suspecting me right now?

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,720
I understand how you may feel,

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,410
but you have the bank transaction authority.

60
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,720
So how much is missing?

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,250
One hundred million won.

62
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,980
What?

63
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,910
One hundred million won?

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,860
   

65
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,710
   

66
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,490
If there was embezzlement,

67
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,770
we should report this to the Audit Team first.

68
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,880
After the Audit Team assesses the situation,

69
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,190
they'll decide whether to press charges or not.

70
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,770
Let's find Jeong Bon Ju first.

71
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,030
Since it's not certain yet.

72
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,930
If you're doing this because of me—

73
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,660
The sale of Greenview Golf Course is our priority.

74
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,230
Then we must fill the 100 million won gap first.

75
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,840
What if we find Ms. Jeong and get the 100 million back?

76
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,380
Will that make this a non-issue?

77
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,580
This can't become a non-issue.

78
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,200
I see.

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Then I'll meet my friends and get back.

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,750
You know, right?

81
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,160
The news spread everywhere.

82
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,050
Everyone was so shocked.

83
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,770
We need to find Bon Ju quickly and return the money.

84
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,520
If she doesn't, she'll be in big trouble.

85
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,030
Will she go to prison?

86
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,500
The punishment for embezzlement is more harsh lately,

87
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,450
so she may.

88
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,230
But we... we really don't know.

89
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,680
You know Bon Ju doesn't tell us those things.

90
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,000
Jeong Hwa.

91
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,870
You don't know either?

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,830
No.

93
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,990
If you find her quickly, I can help her.

94
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,240
Call me.

95
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,180
I'll call you right away if I hear anything about Bon Ju.

96
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,590
All right.

97
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,340
See you.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
- Don't skip meals. 
 - Okay.

99
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,830
Yes, Jeong Hwa?

100
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,390
 Did you return to Seoul? 

101
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,300
No. I'm at the terminal right now.

102
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,150
 I just wanted to wish you a safe trip back. 

103
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,280
 By chance, do you want to see Mun Jin? 

104
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,660
Mun Jin? Why?

105
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,280
 I was just wondering. 

106
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,490
 Since Mun Jin was closest to Bon Ju. 

107
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,700
You said Mun Jin is taking a break, right?

108
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,380
 Yes. 

109
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,970
Is Mun Jin at home?

110
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,300
 She's probably at the hospital right now. 

111
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,510
Mun Jin.

112
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,780
Sun Yeong?

113
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,270
Your arm is okay, right?

114
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,500
Yes. I'll be fine after one more surgery tomorrow.

115
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,090
How did you get hurt?

116
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,800
While working.

117
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,020
Bon Ju told me you were working as a caddie.

118
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,450
Bon Ju? You met Bon Ju?

119
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,500
Yes. We had a drink together. It's been a while.

120
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,170
It reminded me of the old days.

121
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,950
I guess it was for you.

122
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,290
It's been a while since you were here last, huh?

123
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,770
Yes.

124
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,040
When did you last see Bon Ju?

125
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,210
Yesterday.

126
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,100
- Yesterday? 
 - Yes.

127
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,340
She comes by often.

128
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,400
Maybe because she feels bad.

129
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,460
It's not like it was her fault that I got hurt.

130
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,490
I got hurt because the cart was tipped over.

131
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,000
- A golf cart? 
 - Yes.

132
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,590
But it tipped over with the customers in the cart.

133
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,930
They were also pretty injured.

134
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,050
How badly were they hurt?

135
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,600
Well...

136
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,070
they didn't break any bones like I did,

137
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,900
but they got a bad wound on their face.

138
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,340
I even got sued.

139
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,100
Really?

140
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,880
Did you come to a settlement?

141
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,660
Yes, they said they'll let it go.

142
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,320
I see.

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,680
Bon Ju took care of it for me.

144
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
That's so Bon Ju.

145
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,470
She's so cool.

146
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,820
She introduced me to the caddie job.

147
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,810
She said I can make good money if I do a good job.

148
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,840
I see. That's how you ended up doing this work.

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes.

150
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,920
At first, I turned her down.

151
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,550
Since Bon Ju brought me in,

152
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,440
it'd make her look bad if I didn't do a good job.

153
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,430
But she said she already paid the money.

154
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,740
What money?

155
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,100
To become a caddie,

156
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,260
you have to pay 300,000 won before training

157
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,860
for a deposit.

158
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,510
Bon Ju paid that for me.

159
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,360
Even after that,

160
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,430
she said the accident was partly her fault.

161
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,100
But when Bon Ju went and begged for forgiveness,

162
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,040
that person who demanded 100 million won

163
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,330
decided to just settle.

164
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,680
- Bon Ju told you that? 
 - Yes.

165
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,720
But that's a lie.

166
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,730
Bon Ju didn't beg for forgiveness.

167
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,330
She probably caused a scene.

168
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,870
You know what kind of girl Bon Ju is.

169
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,670
I do.

170
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,430
 Bon Ju always seems confident 

171
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,270
 and indifferent to others' opinions, 

172
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,140
 but she's so cautious 

173
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,950
 when it comes to inconveniencing others. 

174
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,760
 She's generous with others' flaws 

175
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,180
 but overly harsh with her own. 

176
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,040
Excuse me.

177
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm Jeong Bon Ju of Greenview CC.

178
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,400
How can I meet with the M&amp;A Team Leader?

179
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,800
- Who did you say you were? 
 - Jeong Bon Ju.

180
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,790
Yes?

181
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes, got it.

182
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,990
Jeong Bon Ju is in the lobby right now.

183
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,700
Hello.

184
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,550
Get going now.

185
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh, well, you know...

186
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,800
- To be honest, Mun Jin... 
 - Yes?

187
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
Honestly...

188
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,110
- Just a moment. 
 - Okay.

189
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,300
Yes, Jin Su?

190
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,500
 Attorney, Ms. Jeong is in our office right now. 

191
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
If you return the 100 million won,

192
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,770
the company is considering wrapping this up with your termination.

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,900
I don't have it. I spent it all.

194
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,960
You used that as settlement money, right?

195
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,290
Yes.

196
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,040
I managed to settle it well.

197
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,940
So I will...

198
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,140
just receive punishment.

199
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,140
Bon Ju.

200
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,690
For embezzlement,

201
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,660
it's 4 to 16 months in prison for under 100 million.

202
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,800
Between 100 to 499 million won,

203
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,390
the prison sentence is 1 to 3 years.

204
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,430
Then I guess I'll be in prison for about a year.

205
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,140
For a salary of 100 million won, that's not bad.

206
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,710
Are you doing this because of Mun Jin?

207
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,880
The lawsuit isn't worth going through.

208
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,520
I'd rather go to prison for a year.

209
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,810
   

210
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,060
   

211
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,950
Then we'll process this as embezzlement.

212
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,790
But...

213
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,370
Yes?

214
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,820
how many years will it be for 1 billion won?

215
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,330
What?

216
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,410
How long the sentence is for embezzling 1 billion?

217
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,040
Yes.

218
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,590
Did you...

219
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,580
embezzle 1 billion won?

220
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,700
No, not me.

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,490
What's this?

222
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,430
Damn it.

223
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,370
What's this about?

224
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,920
Do you have a moment?

225
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,440
Well, I have to go...

226
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,930
on a business trip right now.

227
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,440
Let's talk next time.

228
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,710
Are you going to the U.S.?

229
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,150
Yes.

230
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,590
To acquire the flower delivery business?

231
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,200
Am I right?

232
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,820
Excuse us. Could we ask you something?

233
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,970
By chance, have you received caddie training?

234
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,340
Caddie training? We all did.

235
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,700
You have to in order to work here.

236
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,640
I heard you need to pay for the training. Is it true?

237
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,410
Yes, a deposit of 300,000 won.

238
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,430
Pardon? A deposit?

239
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,760
That's money held by a bank as reserves or for negotiable instruments.

240
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,870
Why would caddies pay a deposit?

241
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,690
I heard you required a deposit.

242
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,640
As for that...

243
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Do you know how often caddies quit?

244
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,870
Probably 90% quit after receiving the training.

245
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,400
After the golf course feeds and trains them,

246
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,110
if they run away saying they can't be caddies,

247
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,760
the company would be paying for such losses.

248
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,260
So I collect 300,000 won per person

249
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,140
and return it when they leave for another job.

250
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,510
So did you return it to them?

251
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,540
He said he'd return it, but...

252
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,860
Would people running away get that money?

253
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,740
They'd sneak out.

254
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,500
Well, they give training and feed us, so we call it even.

255
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,860
Hey, he won't give it back even if you asked for it.

256
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,460
I've never seen a caddie get that money back.

257
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,320
But there wasn't a deposit a long time ago.

258
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,140
When did they start collecting the money?

259
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,430
That? After the Scrooge came.

260
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,240
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek.

261
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,300
That's not a Scrooge. More a thug, isn't it?

262
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,680
He called him a thug.

263
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,040
Then how did you pay the 300,000 won?

264
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,210
What do you mean by how?

265
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,140
Did you pay the company,

266
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,590
or was it deducted from your paycheck?

267
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,300
We had to bring it in cash on the first training day.

268
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,380
That's all being held in an account.

269
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,830
It wasn't listed in the assets.

270
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,830
I guess it was a hidden account.

271
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,140
I mean, since it's money to be returned,

272
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,310
it'd complicate the financial statements—

273
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,900
You managed it separately.

274
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,160
That's embezzlement.

275
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,350
No, it's not.

276
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,280
The money is still there.

277
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,600
Jeong Bon Ju tried to pay Park Mun Jin's settlement with it.

278
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,190
She even got consent from all the current caddies.

279
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,960
But Unni, didn't we agree to donate that?

280
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,020
I signed a consent form.

281
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,150
So did I. I thought that's why they're here.

282
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,030
Sign? Who did?

283
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,930
Bon Ju said we should help Mun Jin with that money.

284
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,360
So you all signed a consent form?

285
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,470
We did.

286
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,430
We all knew it was unfair for Mun Jin.

287
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,260
But why do you ask? Did that money disappear?

288
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,880
That money should still be there.

289
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,580
Jeong Bon Ju felt bad about Park Mun Jin's accident.

290
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,820
She got hurt herself but had to pay a settlement on top of it.

291
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,260
Bon Ju believed the company should cover the settlement.

292
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,400
So she asked you, but you refused.

293
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,750
The accident occurred because of her bad driving.

294
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,270
Why should the company be held responsible?

295
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,070
It was an old cart that tipped over,

296
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,600
so the company is partly responsible for that.

297
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,190
Bon Ju wanted to withdraw 100 million won from the

298
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,850
caddie deposit to pay Mun Jin's settlement.

299
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,140
But she learned that the account was empty

300
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,930
and the entire amount was transferred on October 11th.

301
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,480
The amount was around 1 billion won.

302
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,960
The same amount he requested for severance, right?

303
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes.

304
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,160
You and I met at the Seoul Station on October 11th.

305
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,440
You asked for a 1 billion won severance package that day.

306
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
But I guess you didn't think you'd get it.

307
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,780
Do you have proof?

308
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,060
No, we don't.

309
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,300
We only have circumstantial evidence.

310
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,120
But...

311
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,720
to check the transfer details,

312
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,940
you have to go to the police station or meet the prosecution right away.

313
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,260
What would you like to do?

314
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,580
I was going to use it briefly and put it back.

315
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,190
That's also embezzlement.

316
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,130
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,600
Unni.

318
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,030
I don't think you did anything wrong.

319
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,230
No, I did do wrong.

320
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,350
It was the Scrooge who did wrong.

321
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,970
   

322
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,750
I guess CEO Lee Hyeong Taek remembered the deposit

323
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,440
when he found out the golf course was being sold.

324
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
Since no one knew about the money,

325
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,280
"Boy, I'm going to take this."

326
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,600
That's what he thought, right?

327
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,900
Yes, looking at the withdrawal date,

328
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,520
he likely decided to do so during the due diligence.

329
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,640
I thought that the CEO really tried hard to save the golf course.

330
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,190
But I didn't expect this.

331
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,050
He did make an effort. But the direction he took

332
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,180
focused only on cutting costs,

333
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,460
so it likely led to various issues.

334
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,220
Even when the carts broke down, he didn't fix them.

335
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,080
He seems like a typical "bean counter."

336
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,750
"Bean counter"?

337
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,800
Yes, bean. As in bean.

338
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,590
Bean counter, as in one who counts beans.

339
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,470
We describe people in finance or accounting who focus only on

340
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,850
reducing costs without paying attention to

341
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,400
the actual products or services to improve financial statements.

342
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,510
But why is that like counting beans?

343
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,240
Basically, if you bought beans,

344
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,000
you should think about how to make good tofu.

345
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,040
But instead, you're just counting each bean one by one.

346
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,450
That's what it means.

347
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,000
What about the beans?

348
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,090
It's nothing, Mom.

349
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,840
Aigoo. How are beans nothing?

350
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,010
Our tofu is made only from domestic beans.

351
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,550
We pick out all the spoiled ones and only use the best ones to make it!

352
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,360
All right, everyone clap.

353
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,450
Thank you. I'll enjoy the food.

354
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,400
All right, enjoy.

355
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,580
Thank you.

356
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,250
Okay.

357
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,920
- We can eat now, right? 
 - Thank you for the meal. Yes.

358
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,530
Let's eat.

359
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,010
You collected 300,000 won from caddies over four and a half years.

360
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,930
And that money is around 1 billion won.

361
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,870
You collected quite a bit.

362
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,070
But you managed that money outside of a company account?

363
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,360
I did that because that money needed to be returned.

364
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,530
You've already mentioned that several times.

365
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,250
So the embezzled amount is roughly 1 billion won, right?

366
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,110
No.

367
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,970
What do you mean, no?

368
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,060
The embezzled amount isn't 1 billion won?

369
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,920
I didn't embezzle any money!

370
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,310
We've no choice but to let the police handle this if you continue this.

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,940
Do you still deny it?

372
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,300
Please call in an attorney.

373
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,540
Lee Hyeong Taek, this is the Audit Office.

374
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,900
Do you think this is the police station?

375
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,720
And you'll need to call your own attorney.

376
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,300
Yes.

377
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,100
Mr. Yun, you're here?

378
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,140
   

379
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,410
Take a seat. Take a seat.

380
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,570
I have a favor to ask of you.

381
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,740
See? I knew you'd have questions when you become an executive.

382
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,330
We're in the middle of selling Greenview CC.

383
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,620
Yes, I know.

384
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
The chairman told you to sell it, right?

385
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,040
Yes.

386
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,410
But we discovered embezzlement while doing due diligence.

387
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,680
I see. So?

388
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,390
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek embezzled 1 billion won

389
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,520
and Manager Jeong Bon Ju embezzled 100 million won.

390
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,470
It's an absolute mess.

391
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,200
They had...

392
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,570
a bit of a situation.

393
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,110
You can call your attorney at the police station.

394
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,460
Turn him over to the police.

395
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,570
All right.

396
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,900
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

397
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,520
Team Leader, an attorney is asking to see you.

398
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,160
- An attorney? 
 - Yes, it's the M&amp;A Team's attorney.

399
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,970
   

400
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,200
This is a letter of opinion on Jeong Bon Ju.

401
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,270
The writers are Team Leader Yun Ju No and Attorney Oh Sun Young.

402
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,980
Yes, and HR Director Jo Beom Su signed off on it.

403
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,560
But why did the M&amp;A Team write this?

404
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,030
Because this took place during the M&amp;A.

405
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,010
Oh, I see.

406
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,930
We can just wrap it up with a termination, right?

407
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,770
Yes.

408
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,900
Okay, I understand.

409
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,080
Oh, wait, what about CEO Lee Hyeong Taek?

410
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,130
He should be behind bars.

411
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,290
And get the 1 billion won back.

412
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,890
We'll get the 1 billion won back

413
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,310
and use 100 million won as settlement money.

414
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,850
But he keeps saying he didn't do it.

415
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,240
Is Yun Ju No doing a good job?

416
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,540
He probably is.

417
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,260
And he should.

418
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,310
Why do you say that? Are you worried about something?

419
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,210
I'm worried that Mr. Ha may be hurt.

420
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,540
Aigoo, come on!

421
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,410
Mr. Ha should be feeling great right now.

422
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,760
Hey, turn on the music I like.

423
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,210
Okay.

424
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,150
If you do e-commerce and Mr. Ha does his part,

425
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,250
won't our Sanin do much better?

426
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,080
- Take a seat. Let's listen to this music. 
 - Okay.

427
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,820
Take a seat.

428
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,510
   

429
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,390
Aigoo, what makes you call me, Mr. Yun?

430
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,650
What is it you want to say to me?

431
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,140
Okay, let's do that.

432
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,890
Yun Ju No, that jerk.

433
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,010
He says he'll buy me drinks.

434
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,590
You have a history with Mr. Yun, right?

435
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,420
History?

436
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,560
What history?

437
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,310
I was just

438
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,120
the Construction CEO when I was at Sanin,

439
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,260
so I know his face.

440
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,700
Yun Ju No was the one who sold Construction.

441
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,250
Don't you have negative feelings toward him?

442
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,400
It's not pleasant, obviously.

443
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,900
But...

444
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,880
what are you trying to get at?

445
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,670
Well, I mean,

446
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,720
if you happen to know how the deal will end,

447
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,210
maybe you could give me a heads-up.

448
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,840
It's not like this deal must go through for me.

449
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,280
Building trust with you is what's important.

450
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,180
So

451
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,600
are you worried I'll have Yun Ju No run in circles

452
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,320
then back out of the deal?

453
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,350
Mr. Choi,

454
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,030
how much retainer did you get for this?

455
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,990
Pardon?

456
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,690
You think I'd pay that money just to run him in circles?

457
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,560
Don't come out. Just do your job.

458
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,900
Okay.

459
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,050
Get back safely, CEO.

460
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,630
Will the price drop a lot with embezzlement?

461
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,540
The embezzled amount can be reflected in the valuation,

462
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,230
but it raises concerns about the company's integrity.

463
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,900
CEO Lee Hun Min would use this to negotiate a steep discount.

464
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,830
And he'll likely sue all the employees involved.

465
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,480
That's why Mr. Yun went to meet CEO Lee Hun Min, right?

466
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,080
Wow, to think you'd call me first, Mr. Yun.

467
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,460
I've been here before and it was pretty good.

468
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I thought I should come here to be entertained as well.

469
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,490
You'll buy, right, Mr. Yun?

470
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,330
Of course. Enjoy your meal.

471
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,580
I asked to see you today to ask for your understanding.

472
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,690
During our internal due diligence,

473
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,370
we discovered embezzlement at Greenview CC.

474
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,970
How much?

475
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,280
The CEO embezzled 1 billion won

476
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,750
and the Financial Manager embezzled 100 million won,

477
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,900
for a total of 1.1 billion won.

478
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,070
That's not that much.

479
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,650
Please take care of the matter, Mr. Yun.

480
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,550
Yes, thank you for understanding.

481
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,420
We'll recover the embezzled funds

482
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,440
and handle all involved employees with disciplinary dismissal.

483
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,810
Mr. Yun, you're good at your job,

484
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,520
but you lack awareness.

485
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,280
What do you mean?

486
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,130
How can I work with those who committed embezzlement!

487
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,210
I want them all gone.

488
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,930
Are you talking about laying them off?

489
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,730
Yes. All of them.

490
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,060
Is something wrong?

491
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,120
CEO Lee Hun Min wants

492
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,920
all the golf course employees fired.

493
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,490
I thought it was too easy for a test.

494
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,430
What is it?

495
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,030
Director Ha Tae Su and CEO Lee Hun Min are here.

496
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,290
Okay, have them come in.

497
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,740
Aigoo.

498
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,360
Take a seat.

499
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,780
 What the chairman wants to know 

500
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,640
is not whether you can sell the golf course or not,

501
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,600
but your loyalty.

502
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,920
Through a layoff?

503
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,550
Yes.

504
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,930
He wants to know if you can fire all the employees for him.

505
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,670
Hey, so...

506
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,390
do you think you can handle it?

507
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,700
Yes, if you entrust me with it,

508
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,740
I'll grow it over the next five years.

509
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,720
Gosh, his response is so firm and direct.

510
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,050
This guy was bold even when building apartments.

511
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,340
So...

512
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,200
how's the land over there?

513
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,490
It's excellent, Chairman.

514
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,010
It's close to the interchange,

515
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,530
so transportation is convenient.

516
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,680
Plus, there's a new city developing nearby.

517
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,550
As expected, Chairman, your foresight is incredible.

518
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,920
I was amazed when I saw it.

519
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,110
Really?

520
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,380
Enough of that.

521
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,970
Let's go hiking sometime

522
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,820
and spend some time talking among us.

523
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,260
Yes, sir.

524
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,640
Even so,

525
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,620
the fact that CEO Lee stepped forward as the buyer

526
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,880
suggests the chairman has a separate intention.

527
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,570
What do you mean?

528
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,430
It seems...

529
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,410
the chairman wants to build apartments again.

530
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,640
His intention to acquire GreenView was clear

531
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,750
but he demanded all employees be laid off.

532
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,940
So he wants to build apartments on the golf course site?

533
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,280
Yes.

534
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,030
I think that's why

535
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,010
the chairman called in CEO Lee Hun Min.

536
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,480
The chairman was pretty sad

537
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,600
about selling Sanin Construction.

538
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,110
He probably thinks he can grow it quickly if he starts again.

539
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,820
What is your opinion?

540
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,770
Even if there is potential in construction,

541
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,430
Sanin shouldn't enter the industry again.

542
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,520
When Sanin Construction was sold,

543
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,300
we agreed not to engage in the same business.

544
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,500
That agreement lasts for five years,

545
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,290
but generally, the unspoken rule is not to enter the industry again.

546
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,280
 Despite this, if Sanin still chooses to re-enter construction, 

547
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,330
 we would be breaking the law. 

548
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,020
 Even if we try to do it discreetly, 

549
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,710
 the market will eventually find out. 

550
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,150
I'll be going, Mr. Ha.

551
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,390
Okay, great work.

552
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,130
 So... 

553
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:58,370
 doing that discreetly is Mr. Ha's job 

554
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,140
 and Mr. Ha is using Lee Hun Min to do so. 

555
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,560
I'm coming back.

556
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,570
The bastards who were happy when I left,

557
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,380
tell them to brace themselves.

558
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,180
But even if we ask the chairman,

559
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,310
if he denies it,

560
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,640
there's no way to press him on it.

561
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,330
So there's no way to stop it, no?

562
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,140
There's no way for us to stop it.

563
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,420
 This deal... 

564
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,620
 isn't just about you becoming an executive or not. 

565
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,190
 Won't your future relationship with the chairman matter more? 

566
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,800
 So... 

567
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,380
 wouldn't it be better for you to accept it this time? 

568
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,280
 I say this because I don't think 

569
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,200
 you want to be an executive just for the position. 

570
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,050
Mr. Yun.

571
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,790
Hello, Director.

572
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,090
I signed off on what M&amp;A Team requested.

573
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,280
You mean regarding Jeong Bon Ju.

574
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

575
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,890
If you need anything else, let me know.

576
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,380
Okay, thank you for your consideration.

577
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,990
You don't have anything?

578
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,880
I saw CEO Lee Hun Min drop by the HQ.

579
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
Yes,

580
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,080
CEO Lee Hun Min is the buyer for Greenview CC.

581
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,350
I see.

582
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,090
So? Will he buy it?

583
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,660
CEO Lee Hun Min requested all the employees

584
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,510
to be fired as the acquisition condition.

585
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,630
Shall we talk for a bit in my office?

586
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,400
Daebak.

587
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,820
Laying off employees isn't that difficult.

588
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,790
There was also corruption at the company.

589
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,950
Yes.

590
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,560
The two employees involved are to be dismissed.

591
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,850
No, no. That's not all.

592
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,740
Lee Hyeong Taek says

593
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,050
he has an accomplice in the Golf Dept.

594
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,010
- An accomplice? 
 - Yes.

595
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,800
But what's the Golf Dept.?

596
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,330
You'd know it well since you did due diligence.

597
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,760
They're responsible for supporting customers so they can have a good round of golf.

598
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,220
It also handles the management of caddies,

599
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,710
so he seems to say the deposits were diverted there.

600
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,590
Yes, that's what he was saying.

601
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,680
But what he said is plausible.

602
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,380
The company is being sold, but the CEO embezzled 1 billion won?

603
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,210
Then the employees under him would feel unsettled, too.

604
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,130
They're the only ones who know about the deposits.

605
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:15,240
Do you also believe there might be an accomplice?

606
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,750
What do you think, Mr. Yun?

607
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,350
I think it's possible.

608
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,790
Okay.

609
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,080
If we let go of a few people that way

610
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,380
and send the rest to training and give them packages, it'll be over quickly.

611
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,820
It's not like there are many people.

612
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,780
Why? Do you want HR to handle it?

613
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,970
No. The M&amp;A Team will handle it.

614
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,000
Looks like you'll be successful, Mr. Yun.

615
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,610
- Hello. 
 - You're back.

616
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,100
Yes.

617
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,880
Let's have a quick meeting.

618
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,640
Let's do it.

619
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,950
CEO Lee Hun Min asked for all the employees to be laid off.

620
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,480
Will you do it?

621
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,540
Isn't that breaking his promise?

622
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,640
CEO Lee Hun Min didn't promise retaining employees in writing, so he could request that.

623
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,730
Also, CEO Lee Hun Min can justify by saying there was employee corruption.

624
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:31,240
Still, if they're not involved in the embezzlement, it won't be easy.

625
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:37,680
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek already claimed the Golf Department diverted a lot of money.

626
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,050
Do you think he's telling the truth?

627
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,610
We'll need to check.

628
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,750
Han Gil Su of the Golf Department?

629
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,310
Yes.

630
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,860
Why did you ask to see me?

631
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,910
You know that the CEO Lee Hyeong Taek embezzled funds, right?

632
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,000
Yes.

633
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But CEO Lee says he didn't do it

634
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,180
and claims someone at the Golf Dept. did it.

635
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,730
That's why you're here, Oh Jeong Min.

636
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:49,020
I definitely didn't do it.

637
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,520
He said I also embezzled money?

638
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,720
He didn't say it was you specifically, but someone at the Golf Dept.

639
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,180
That's why Oh Jeong Min is also being interviewed right now in the next room.

640
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,880
Oh, I see.

641
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,580
In any case, it wasn't me.

642
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,960
If it's not you, are you saying it was Han Gil Su?

643
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,150
When we look at the account transaction history,

644
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:23,760
money has been slowly withdrawn over time.

645
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,930
Oh, this? We returned it to the caddies.

646
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,250
I hear Jeong Bon Ju contacted all the caddies

647
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,580
including all the ones who had left the company.

648
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,020
You know Park Mun Jin, right?

649
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,690
To use it for her settlement money.

650
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,060
- And? 
 - If they'd gotten their 300,000 won back,

651
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,090
would they have signed, consenting to its use as a settlement?

652
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,820
The caddies could be lying, saying they didn't get it even though they did.

653
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:56,500
That is possible, but if this is different from what she says next door...

654
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,360
We didn't even use a lot.

655
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,540
We just used 300,000 won at a time for stuff like staff dinners.

656
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,120
But Team Leader Han suggested we spend it.

657
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,760
You do admit to using it, right?

658
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,190
Did Assistant Manager Oh Jeong Min say...

659
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,790
I made her do it?

660
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,320
 Well, you are her superior. 

661
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,030
But she knew it all, too!

662
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,770
How could she say that after spending it together!

663
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,910
So the CEO embezzled 1 billion won, right?

664
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,990
Yes, that's right!

665
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,000
Hey, I hear you're pretty busy nowadays.

666
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,300
HR is also very exhausting, now that I've tried it.

667
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,680
Right.

668
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,160
Among HR tasks, layoffs are the hardest.

669
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,470
And it's a full-scale layoff at that.

670
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:29,130
Our director was very happy because your team leader volunteered to handle it instead.

671
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,230
Thanks to him, he's got it easy.

672
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,180
- I'll be going. 
 - What?

673
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,960
Let's have them both be terminated.

674
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,600
Okay.

675
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,300
But this doesn't feel right.

676
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,330
What do you mean?

677
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:07,310
It's not right to fire everyone just because of this, no?

678
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,510
Who said we'll fire everyone?

679
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,540
Jin Su, is that what you were thinking?

680
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,190
Weren't we firing everyone?

681
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,400
We can't fire employees who've done nothing wrong.

682
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,650
At least, that's how it should appear to others.

683
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,660
Especially to HR.

684
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,370
I see.

685
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,320
I've taken action on it.

686
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,280
The M&amp;A Team seems to be working late every night.

687
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,730
You know how layoffs are really tough.

688
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,360
Yun Ju No is going to rise up a lot.

689
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,700
He won't just stop at being an executive.

690
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,200
 But... 

691
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,300
if CEO Lee Hun Min terminates all employees,

692
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,000
he can't operate the golf course.

693
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,310
Why is he making such an unreasonable demand?

694
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,220
About that...

695
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,910
It seems the chairman

696
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,520
wants to go back into construction.

697
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,000
He can't do that.

698
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,500
A 5-year restriction is on entering the same industry.

699
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,800
Yes. That's why I suspect he's using Lee Hun Min

700
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,200
to build it up and then acquire it back from him.

701
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,500
And CEO Lee Hun Min is demanding a full layoff...

702
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,750
I suspect he wants to build apartments on the site.

703
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,600
What are you going to do about this?

704
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,100
Shouldn't we tell the chairman

705
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,000
that this mustn't be done?

706
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,200
It's not like he is openly doing this,

707
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,900
nor are we certain of this.

708
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,100
Yet, you want to tell him, "Sir, you can't do this"?

709
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
What do we do?

710
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,320
I don't think we have any way to handle this.

711
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,960
So I'm thinking of

712
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,460
meeting someone who had the

713
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,290
upper hand on the chairman.

714
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,830
Does such a person exist?

715
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,100
It's been a while, Team Leader Yun Ju No.

716
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes, CEO. It's been a while.

717
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,800
Are you still working at Sanin?

718
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,900
I told you you should work with me.

719
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,370
I'm still working there for now, thank to you.

720
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,430
I'm not saying "thanks to you," just to be polite.

721
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,000
Because you acquired

722
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,200
Sanin Construction at a good value

723
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,300
Sanin had the chance to overcome its crisis.

724
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,210
Thank you.

725
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,200
After I bought that,

726
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,920
people were saying I paid too much.

727
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,990
I should've negotiated a lower price back then.

728
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,700
I think it was a reasonable price.

729
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,550
However,

730
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,380
the price we sold for

731
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,000
includes the condition that

732
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,800
Sanin won't engage in construction.

733
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
Of course. I paid so much to acquire it, after all.

734
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,800
You can't immediately appear as a competitor.

735
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,150
Yes. That's why I asked to meet with you today.

736
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:35,990
Why? Is the chairman trying to do it secretly?

737
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,700
I'm not sure,

738
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,990
but I think that could be the case.

739
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,350
But...

740
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,300
why are you telling me that?

741
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,300
Aren't you part of Sanin?

742
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,150
Since you bought Construction at a good value,

743
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,140
I believe this is also part of my job.

744
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,090
Providing after-service since I paid a lot for it?

745
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:12,020
I should since you bought it for full price.

746
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:20,290
So what do I need to do?

747
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,890
Do you like hiking?

748
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,330
Nice weather, isn't it?

749
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,310
Oh, Chairman Song!

750
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,800
Aigoo.

751
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,550
- CEO Ji. 
 - Yes.

752
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,900
Did you come from a hike?

753
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,700
We're starting construction on an apartment

754
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,470
and I wanted to get good energy.

755
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,130
CEO Lee?

756
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,790
Oh, yes.

757
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,430
What is this?

758
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,680
What do you mean?

759
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,460
I mean, you all are together...

760
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,630
Well, we all like to go hiking, so yes...

761
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,300
I see that's what this is.

762
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,350
I thought you were doing something behind my back.

763
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,100
Oh, this is our legal advisor.

764
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,600
I'm Choi Yong Seok.

765
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,200
I've heard a lot about you,

766
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,000
Sanin Group Chairman Song Jae Sik.

767
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Nice to meet you.

768
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,930
I'm Managing Director Ha Tae Soo.

769
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,390
I'm Lee Hun Min.

770
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,700
What do you do?

771
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,400
I'm not doing much right now.

772
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,350
And you're an attorney, right?

773
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,800
I'm from the 27th class.

774
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,500
How about you?

775
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,900
The 38th class, Seonbaenim.

776
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,200
Oh, you're a sonbae to Sun Young, I see.

777
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,720
CEO Ji, then we'll get going.

778
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,300
Oh, yes, yes. Okay.

779
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,170
- Let's meet again, Chairman. 
 - Oh, yes.

780
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,880
Or maybe not?

781
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,650
It won't be good if we meet again, right?

782
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,820
Let's go.

783
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,800
Let's forget it.

784
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,400
Pardon?

785
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,110
Call the car. Let's go.

786
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,800
Did you meet the chairman?

787
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,800
 Yes. 

788
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,500
 Mt. Bukhan had a great view. 

789
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,770
Thank you for doing this.

790
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,990
Oh, but wouldn't the chairman know?

791
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,800
That Mr. Yun was behind this?

792
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,200
Yes.

793
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,030
That...

794
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,850
Mr. Yun is a tattletale.

795
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,620
Come on...

796
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,400
No way.

797
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,500
It's not like it's certain I did it.

798
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,580
Would he ask me?

799
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,900
I suppose it could be true.

800
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,270
Chairman, it's such a waste to just stop here.

801
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,140
Since you have already started,

802
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,260
how about you keep going with it?

803
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,750
That woman has a lot of money, right?

804
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,200
Pardon?

805
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,400
Oh, CEO Ji Yeon Wu?

806
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,800
Yes, she does have considerable financial power.

807
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
That's what I thought.

808
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,260
That attorney we met seemed pretty expensive, too.

809
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,460
But...

810
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,300
if we go through with the construction,

811
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,700
what if she says we broke the contract

812
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,700
and demands us to pay back the money,

813
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,710
then what will happen to us?

814
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,910
Yes?

815
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,710
Chairman, Team Leader Yun Ju No is here.

816
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,450
Come in.

817
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,940
Hi.

818
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,850
Let me report to you about the

819
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,890
sale of Greenview golf course.

820
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,360
Go ahead.

821
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,360
In the midst of the sale,

822
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,100
we discovered embezzlement issues

823
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,800
and terminated all those who were involved.

824
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,220
However, CEO Lee Hun Min, the buyer...

825
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,900
The buyer is CEO Lee Hun Min.

826
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,000
Not too long ago, he transferred to a fund

827
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,920
and is negotiating as this project's rep.

828
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:19,190
CEO Lee asked for the termination of all employees.

829
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,890
To proceed with this deal,

830
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,530
we need to terminate the remaining employees.

831
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,600
You can take care of stuff like that.

832
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,000
Why would you report that to the chairman?

833
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,500
The chairman seems to have

834
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,900
deep affection for Sanin employees.

835
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,000
However, since the sale of Greenview CC

836
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,500
is an important matter,

837
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,140
I wanted to ask for your opinion, Chairman.

838
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,670
Cancel the sale.

839
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,060
Okay.

840
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,160
Thank you for making such a good decision.

841
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,700
Then I'll take my leave.

842
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,060
But...

843
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,300
Yes?

844
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,280
you know...

845
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,150
You're not fit to be an executive.

846
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,550
Leave.

847
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,450
Okay.

848
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:43,190
Hey, when I heard Bon Ju embezzled funds...

849
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,800
I was like, embezzling, as in siphon money?

850
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,010
And Bon Ju did that?

851
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,410
About that...

852
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:52,510
I tried to use that money

853
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,440
after getting consent from the caddies,

854
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,980
but Lee Hyeong Taek stole it. So...

855
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,870
Even so! Did you think you won't get caught?

856
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,260
She knew she'd get caught.

857
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,350
That's why she transferred it to her account

858
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,770
and turned herself in right away.

859
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,680
Then you should've just sued the CEO instead!

860
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,860
How could you just take that money?

861
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,430
Then the deadline would've passed without settling.

862
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,040
Lee Hyeong Taek is a piece of trash.

863
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,930
Do you know how stingy he was

864
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,930
trying to reduce costs at work?

865
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,200
Then he siphoned all that money. He's trash.

866
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,430
That jerk's a piece of trash.

867
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:30,440
So did we get the 1 billion won back from him?

868
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,000
Yes and the settlement was paid with that money.

869
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,130
Thanks, Sun Young.

870
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,890
What? For what?

871
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,530
Just...

872
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,640
for being our friend.

873
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,670
It was good to see you guys again, too.

874
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,100
Here you go.

875
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,870
Eat up!

876
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,620
Thank you. Thank you.

877
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,840
You're the best, Ma'am.

878
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,070
But...

879
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,880
it feels weird eating tofu after embezzling...

880
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,870
Gosh, seriously!

881
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,160
- Chew, chew, chew! 
 - Chew well.

882
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,880
Okay.

883
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,970
Cheers. Cheers.

884
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,160
I heard you didn't become an executive.

885
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,970
Yes. It turned out that way.

886
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,770
Ju No,

887
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,370
we don't have time.

888
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,270
Let's give up.

889
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:37,870
No. Just start.

890
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,030
They say you should strike while the iron is hot.

891
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,580
Team Leader.

892
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,770
Please take a look at this.

893
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,530
What is it?

894
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,480
   

895
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:15,670
   

896
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,810
Who sent this?

897
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,270
So...

898
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:25,800
we still have over 2 trillion left to pay off.

899
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,700
It's 2.5 trillion won.

900
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,470
He'll probably sell this time, right?

901
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,760
Or will he buy?

902
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,670
Can't Mr. Yun just get those funds from somewhere?

903
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,570
We're from the Audit Team.

904
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,130
We'll be seizing the evidence.

905
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,960
This is Team Leader Yun Ju No's desk, right?

906
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,040
What are you doing right now?

907
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,030
- What are you doing? Stop! 
 - Wait!

908
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,560
Wait, move aside.

909
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,170
I mean, legally speaking—

911
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,240
Sanin Group's Operating Regulations,

912
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,750
this is to secure evidence for

913
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,010
M&amp;A Team Leader Yun Ju No's

914
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,040
illegal use of inside information and transactions.

915
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,070
What's wrong?

916
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,070
This is an audit implementation notice.

917
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,590
What's the reason for it?

918
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,200
For stock trading using undisclosed information.

919
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,040
   

920
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,430
   

921
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:11,920
They're saying...

922
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,740
I was involved in a scheme.

01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,780
 This came saying this is the profit. 

935
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,240
 There are many temptations when you do M&amp;A. 

936
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,020
 Are you suspecting me right now? 

937
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,180
 Mr. Yun, i-it's not true, right? 

938

 You're Team Leader Yun Ju No's brother, right?

 The evidence is so clear.

 Do you trust him? 

944

 How far do you think is related to this? 

945
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,580
 You also admit that 

946
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,280
 you hold Jumbo's stocks, right? 

947
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,970
 Yes.
