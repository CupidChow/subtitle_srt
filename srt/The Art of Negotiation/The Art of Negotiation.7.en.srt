The suspect Yoon Joo Seok...

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,220
is your biological brother, right?

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,620
You're a piece of work.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,690
Dozing off in front of a prosecutor?

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,370
Someone so young...

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,700
Young? You are young, right?

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,980
Come on. Aren't you on the younger side...

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,040
to be doing this?

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,110
You have some nerve.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,580
What is it do you think I did?

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,619
With the information you obtained...

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,160
as an M and A advisor,

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,690
we think you purchased stocks from the company you'd be acquiring.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
Are we clear on that?

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,730
Are you admitting the charges? Okay.

25
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,370
No.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,940
No, I'm clear on what I'm being accused of.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,669
That wasn't an admission of guilt.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
Come on.

29
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,340
So that's how it's going to be?

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,880
Mr. Yoon,

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,020
this is how much I was able to find about you.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,180
Do you see that?

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,250
All those files are related to you.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,220
Insider trading,

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,390

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,330
and professional negligence.

37
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,560
My gosh.

38
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,130
Honestly, how much did you make?

39
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,130
I only ask out of curiosity.

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,099
I say this again, but I...

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,240
Was it nice to earn a lot of money?

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,610
Was it?

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,310
Over 1,000 people...

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,380
lost all their savings regarding this matter.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,290
They went bankrupt,

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,190
families were wrecked,

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
and some even took their own lives.

48
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,270
How does it feel...

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,700
to think about them?

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,410
I feel for them.

51
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,770
You feel bad?

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Is that it?

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,480
I understand how I can be suspected of insider trading.

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,480
- However... - I see.

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,449
You're guilty of suspicious actions,

56
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,150
but, however, you're innocent.

57
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,760
You're telling me to present definitive evidence,

58
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,790
aren't you?

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,930
That's not what I meant.

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,100
Judging by your statement,

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,940
you seem to have circumstantial evidence...

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,910
but none that are definitive.

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,080
Am I right?

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,850
You punk. Now I definitely know what you think of prosecutors.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000

regarding the charges of Mr. Yoon's insider trading...

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,460
and illegal trading under a different name.

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,730

73

Our suspect died.

(Episode 7: Classified)

Hey, Mom.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,809
Are you just waking up?

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,920
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

79
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,990
I only have to be at the office by nine.

80
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,850
Currently,

81
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,420
it's only 6am.

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,890
You have it lucky.

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,399
I have to be up at 4am, cook breakfast,

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
and be at the orchard before sunrise.

85
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,669
Why did you call?

86
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,840
You have a car, right?

87
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,670
My car? Why do you ask?

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,710
You can lend it to Sang Hoon.

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,940
Why would Sang Hoon use my car?

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,409
Being a family means we share things.

91
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,750
It's for whoever needs it.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
Exactly. But why does he need a car?

93
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,659
He looks good in everything being the handsome young man he is,

94
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,930
and people approach him to ask where he bought the items.

95
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,730
Telling them that will only do others good.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,359
Besides, Sang Hoon can sell the clothes himself.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,899
You don't even need an actual store these days...

98
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,100
but can make money selling things online.

99
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,299
To do so, he needs to meet various people,

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,610
so of course he needs a car.

101
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,680
Is he going to run an online shopping platform?

102
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,440
Exactly.

103
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,609
Can you tell your coworkers to buy some things?

104
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,820
Brag about your little brother too.

105
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,380
I don't have any friends at work.

106
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,220
Also,

107
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,620
not everyone can run an online shopping platform.

108
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,320
He's not just some nobody.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,529
Your one and only brother is trying hard to get something going.

110
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,700
Don't you feel bad for him?

111
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,659
Why should I?

112
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,269
(Parking)

113
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,370
Do you even know how much money he borrowed from me?

114
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,800
If he needs a car, tell him to buy one himself.

115
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,340
You think living alone in the city makes you superior.

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,609
If only you knew how troubled your brother is...

117
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,180
over the fact he can't find a job.

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,780
My gosh, this is heartbreaking.

119
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,990
I need my car for work, so I'll hang up.

120
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,850
My gosh.

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,630
- What's with the suitcase? - Oh, this?

122
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm coming straight to work from Gimpo Airport...

123
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,330
and might die of exhaustion.

124
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,500
- Were you on vacation? - No, a business trip.

125
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,370
What business trip?

126
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,540
Just so you know, secretaries can't answer that.

127
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,379
We must pretend not to have heard, have seen,

128
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,780
or know anything.

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Here you go.

130
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,690
Thanks.

131
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,520
Anyway, why are you at the office so early?

132
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,090
You're probably aware that my team has its secrets too.

133
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,630
Of course.

134
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,600
How's the work as a secretary? Doable?

135
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Well,

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,800
we're just a bunch of glorified servants.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
I'll enjoy these.

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,770
- Have a good one. - Sure.

(Chairman Song Jae Sik)

140
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,860
Are you back from Jeju?

141
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,460
- Yes, sir. - What did she say?

142
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Good work.

143
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,529
This confirms that Chairman Song took out a loan...

144
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,430
of 50 million dollars with Sanin's stocks as collateral.

145
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,870
Make sure this is kept between us.

146
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,430
Of course.

147
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,770
I wonder why the chairman took out a loan of 50 million dollars.

148
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,039
His own stocks were put up as collateral...

149
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,609
which means it was for something urgent.

150
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,210
Wouldn't the chairman have that kind of money though?

151
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,050
What?

152
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,280
Oh, I mean,

153
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,179
fifty million dollars is a lot of money,

154
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,520
but he's the chairman of a major company.

155
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,119
Even a chairman of a major company...

156
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,020
would rarely have 50 million dollars lying around in cash.

157
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,630
Besides, Chairman Song...

158
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,130
values the power of control and ownership...

159
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,130
which is why his assets are mostly in stocks.

160
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,269
Yet, he took out a loan with the stocks as collateral.

161
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,270
Something doesn't add up.

162
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,040
On what could he have spent that money?

163
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,899
- Mr. Chairman. - Morning.

164
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,300
- Good morning. - Good morning.

Nice. Talk about perfect timing.

Enjoy.

177
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,370
Anyway, the chairman...

178
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,380
must be in a tight spot.

179
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,680
He is. The interest rate is ten percent.

180
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,080
I'd gladly lend him that money.

181
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,690
Do you have 50 million dollars?

182
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,520
Of course not.

183
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,690
Then eat this.

184
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
It's tasty.

Forget the tea. I won't be in there long.

187
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,900
Sure.

188
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm here to brief you, sir.

189
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,310
Sure. Come in.

190
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,700
Was there any word from Jeju?

191
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,370
It was rejected, sir.

192
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,070
- Is that all? - I apologize.

193
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,080
- You. - Yes, sir.

194
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,310
Call Director Ha in.

195
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,050
- Yes, sir. - And Director Lee.

196
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,710
Understood, sir.

197
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,960
He's summoning Director Ha and Director Lee.

198
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,390
Sure.

199
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,990
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

200
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,430
Of course. Understood.

201
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,440
What is it?

202
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,310
He called Mr. Yoon Joo No in as well.

203
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,380
I can't believe he's playing with the big guns now.

204
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,979
- Yes? - Director Ha,

205
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,950
the chairman asked for you.

206
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,420
What? When?

207
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,750
He wants you in his office right away.

208
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,719
Sure. I got it.

209
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,990
(Director Ha Tae Soo)

210
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,890
Wait. How is his mood today?

211
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,720
It's pleasant, sir.

212
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,530
Could this be about what I was informed of yesterday?

213
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,300
That must be the case.

214
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,900
Have you reviewed the contract?

215
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,240
- Yes, I did. - Good.

216
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,180
I believe the chairman took out a loan a while back,

217
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,550
using his shares as collateral.

218
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,280
He has to pay back the loan,

219
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,020
and he wishes to sell his shares to pay it back.

220
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,850
You mean, he wants to sell his Sanin shares?

221
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,890
Yes, he wants to do it to pay back the loan.

222
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,930
He can't.

223
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,929
The market suspects...

224
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,200
that Sanin might not be capable of paying its debt at the moment.

225
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,369
So, if the chairman sells his Sanin shares now...

226
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,040
The stock price will drop.

227
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,570
Correct.

228
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,510
Then Samoel might go ahead and exercise the option.

229
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,580
If that happens,

230
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,710
Sanin will end up in Samoel's hands.

231
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,300
By the way,

232
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,300
why do you think he needed 50 million dollars in cash?

233
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,330
I'm not sure.

234
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,670
So, you don't know where he spent the money either, right?

235
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,910
He's a man with strong pride.

236
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,180
I think he was stressed out about it all by himself.

237
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,050
I'm the only one who knows about this.

238
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,480
Now, the two of us are the only ones who know.

239
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,350
Right.

240
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,460
Come in.

241
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,220
Thanks.

242
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,230
Well...

243
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,600
There's nothing to worry about, sir.

244
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,170
It's not a huge amount.

245
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,400
Even so, there should be many ways to pay it back.

246
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,410
Director Ha, what do you think we should do?

247
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,910
We should choose a solution that can benefit Mr. Chairman the most.

248
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,550
What might that solution be?

249
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Well...

250
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,450
Sir, the current interest rate...

251
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,890
is ten percent, which is pretty high.

252
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,060
I suggest you switch to a different loan product.

253
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,860
That will be difficult.

254
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,570
Why?

255
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,770
The loan maturity date is only a month away.

256
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,970
It's too tight.

257
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:29,510
That's exactly why we should do it as quickly as possible.

258
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,439
If the loan application gets rejected,

259
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
or if we miss the maturity date, we'll have a big problem.

260
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,579
A big problem? Why?

261
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,480
It's not like I borrowed the money for free.

262
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I've been told that you used your shares as collateral.

263
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,020
That's right. So, they can take my shares.

264
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,450
You...

265
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
don't want that.

266
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,619
Why not?

267
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,290
Why can't he pay it back using his shares?

268
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,860
They're considered the chairman's personal asset.

269
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,229
At the moment, the market suspects that Sanin...

270
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,430
might not be able to pay back the 11 billion dollars.

271
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,870
If Sanin fails to pay it back, it'll go bankrupt.

272
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,669
So, what would the market think if the company owner sold his shares...

273
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,870
in this situation?

274
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,739
"The chairman who knows the company's situation the best..."

275
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,050
"is escaping first." Everyone would think that.

276
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,810
I see.

277
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,650
You mean, people might think I'm doing it to run away or something?

278
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,790
Yes.

279
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,290
Goodness. Let them think whatever they want.

280
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,790
If you sell your Sanin shares now,

281
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,900
other shareholders will also sell theirs.

282
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,630
Then Sanin's stock price could plummet.

283
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Look.

284
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:32,700
It's not like a small drop in our stock price will kill someone.

285
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,940
Even so,

286
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,340
you cannot sell your shares.

287
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,350
What?

288
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,419
When insiders or majority shareholders are selling...

289
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,290
more than one percent of the stock or five million dollars,

290
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,589
they have to publicly announce it at least a month before.

291
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,459
However, we only have 29 days left now,

292
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,490
so he can't sell his shares even if he wants to.

293
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,899
Don't you just have to give a five-day notice?

294
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,470
No, the law has changed.

295
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,369
Insiders kept selling stocks at their peak and exiting,

296
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,600
so to prevent that.

297
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,170
He missed the timing.

298
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,710
The 50 million dollars must be paid back in cash.

299
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,780
It's 55 million, including the interest.

300
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,080
All of it must be paid back in cash.

301
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,980
I have no cash. My shares are all I have.

302
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,050
Well, sir.

303
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,150
Why would you need cash, sir?

304
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,119
If it's not paid back in cash now,

305
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,760
it'll cause a big problem down the road.

306
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,900
Are you sure about that?

307
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,760
Yes, sir.

308
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,930
The bank notified you to pay it back when you still have 29 days left,

309
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,770
which means the bank is probably aware of it too.

310
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,410
So, you should pay it back in cash now.

311
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,210
Right.

312
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,910
So, he should borrow money and pay it back as soon as possible.

313
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,610
Will we sit idly by because we don't have time?

314
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,780
Let's call everyone we can think of, be it a bank or a fund company.

315
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,050
You said it must be paid back in cash.

316
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,750
What if rumors spread?

317
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
What?

318
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,760
"Sanin is running around to borrow 50 million dollars."

319
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,700
What if such a rumor spreads in the market?

320
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,759
"Sanin doesn't even have 50 million dollars."

321
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,470
If rumors like that start going around...

322
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,400
It'd be better to just sell the shares, then.

323
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,040
Hey, you heard that we couldn't do that.

324
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,510
Then what? What do we do?

325
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,350
May I ask you where you spent the 50 million dollars?

326
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,890
Such arrogance!

327
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,020
Do you have to know that?

328
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,130
It's not like that.

329
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,300
I think he's just trying to come up with some ideas, sir.

330
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,180
I bought a resort.

331
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,010
It looked nice.

332
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,520
I wanted to use it when I needed a break.

333
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,060
I see.

334
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,290
Of course, sir.

335
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Every chairman owns a resort.

336
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,560
Of course, you should own one too.

337
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,160
You made a good purchase.

338
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,570
Are we good now?

339
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,200
Yes, sir.

340
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,540
Then may I see the purchase contract for the resort?

341
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,220
Why do you need that?

342
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,890
What would you think about selling that resort?

343
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,830
Joo No.

344
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,930
Yes, sir.

345
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,569
You see, the companies you're trying to sell now.

346
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,900
They're all like my children.

347
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
You know that, right?

348
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,270
- Yes, sir. - And you...

349
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,680
really can't stand my children that much?

350
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,050
Is that it?

351
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,749
It's okay for you to sell some of them,

352
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,920
but some are strictly off-limits.

353
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,930
Yes, sir.

354
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,140
Director Ha, do you suggest I borrow more money?

355
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,910
Yes. That should take care of the problem, sir.

356
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,079
Mr. Yoon isn't experienced enough yet,

357
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,250
so he doesn't really know how the market works.

358
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,680
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

359
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,320
And you, Mr. Yoon?

360
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,490
I'll go through it again and submit another report.

361
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,730
All right.

362
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,899
Whether you decide to borrow more or sell it, you two figure it out.

363
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,930
Pardon me?

364
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,870
- You mean, Mr. Yoon and me? - Why?

365
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,540
You don't want to?

366
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,080
It's not that, sir.

367
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,610
I will work on it.

368
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,610
Yes. Understood, sir.

369
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,390
All right, then. You can go.

370
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,820
Get up and go.

371
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,500
- Director Ha. - Yes, sir.

372
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,670
Finish this before you go. It's expensive.

373
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,870
Yes, sir.

374
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,220
It would've been better to tell you about it in private later on.

375
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,690
I made a hasty judgment.

376
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,960
No, don't say that.

377
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,560
We have less than a month left. We should hurry.

378
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,160
Anyway,

379
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,870
I guess he wants this to be a competition.

380
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,770
Will you be all right?

381
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,900
It doesn't matter.

382
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,180
This could be a good opportunity for you, but...

383
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,620
Opportunities always bring crises.

384
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,020
Yes.

385
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,760
About the resort Chairman Song bought.

386
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,260
You don't know where it is, do you?

387
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,030
I don't know of any resort he frequents.

388
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
Director Ha didn't seem to know about it either.

389
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,140
- Right? - Yes.

390
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,240
Hey.

391
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,210
- Did the meeting go well? - Yes.

392
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,750
Have you been to that resort?

393
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,150
Pardon? What do you mean?

394
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Chairman Song said he bought a resort because it was really nice.

395
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,490
Oh, did he?

396
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,360
I know nothing about it.

397
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Thank you.

398
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,670
For what?

399
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,630
Nothing.

400
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,570
The chief secretary must know about it.

401
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,740
Yes. But even if he knows, he can't talk about it.

402
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,580
There's no way the secretary's office handled the purchase.

403
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,150
They probably did it through a broker.

404
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,180
Probably, but I'm sure they can't talk about it either.

405
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,750
They must've had to sign a confidentiality agreement.

406
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,560
Right.

407
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,690
Anyway...

408
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,760
You're not actually planning to sell the resort, are you?

409
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,800
Is there another way?

410
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,080
All right. I understand.

411
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,950
I'll meet with the chairman again.

412
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Hey, Director Ha.

413
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,290
Yes, sir.

414
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,950
Do you think he's right?

415
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
He talked as though we were in deep trouble.

416
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,090
Mr. Yoon?

417
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,530
I can't say he doesn't have a point,

418
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,630
but it's all an excuse.

419
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,570
Excuse?

420
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,230
Yes.

421
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,240
He's practically an outcast in the industry,

422
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,769
which means there's no way...

423
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,740
he can borrow that kind of money in a month.

424
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,610
That's why he's saying that.

425
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,880
So?

426
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,420
Are you confident?

427
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,860
Yes, sir.

428
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,990
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

429
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,690
There isn't much Yoon Joo No can do.

430
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,560
Besides, he's too inexperienced to handle something like this.

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,740
- Is that right? - Yes.

432
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,410
Oh, boy.

433
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,080
I really am getting old now.

434
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,980
I want to take it easy now.

435
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
Pardon?

436
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,790
Everyone says Jeju Island is nice.

437
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,590
Should I move there?

438
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,330
My goodness. Please don't say that, sir.

439
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,200
Sanin can't operate without you.

440
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,200
You feel that way now because you're tired.

441
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,640
Let me handle the important matters.

442
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,540
Get some rest, and all will be fine.

443
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,410
Can I really do that?

444
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,150
Of course, sir.

445
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,850
Take a short break, and I'll take care of this.

446
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
All right.

447
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,220
- Finish it. - Yes, sir.

448
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
Who do you think will manage to sort it out?

449
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Between Director Ha and Mr. Yoon?

450
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,500
Director Ha.

451
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,240
Really? Why?

452
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,609
Director Ha is very experienced...

453
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,070
and well-connected.

454
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,850
And you are rooting for Mr. Yoon, aren't you?

455
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,920
Why do you think that?

456
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,420
Just because.

457
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,790
Hey.

458
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,030
It's not because he's good-looking.

459
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,730
Then why do you think it'll be him?

460
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,670
Mr. Yoon is kind of crazy.

461
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,710
- Isn't that a bad thing? - No.

462
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,840
I think you need to be a bit crazy to get this sorted out.

463
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,479
I think he'll cause trouble because he's like that.

464
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,610
Hey, watch what you say...

465
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,460
- Hey. - How did it go?

466
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,960
The chairman bought a resort...

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,270
with the 50 million dollars.

468
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,830
Oh, boy.

469
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,770
It won't be easy to turn a profit with a resort.

470
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,310
Rich people don't buy resorts to make money.

471
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,580
Really? How do you know?

472
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,950
That's what I heard.

473
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,820
Then why do they buy it?

474
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,980
It's like...

475
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,190
I guess you could call it an expensive hobby.

476
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,119
It's like when ordinary people like us buy an exotic car.

477
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,190
If an ordinary person buys an exotic car, they'd go bankrupt.

478
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,960
Oh, right.

479
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,060
But there's no way Chairman Song will go bankrupt.

480
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,200
I think he can just sell the resort he bought.

481
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,899
He paid 50 million dollars for it,

482
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,570
so he can sell it for 50 million dollars.

483
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,070
Fifty-five million, with interest.

484
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,980
Right, 55 million dollars.

485
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,680
It'd be helpful to see if it's still worth that much,

486
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,950
but I have no idea which resort it is.

487
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,580
Let's look it up, starting with the ones in the 50 million-dollar range.

488
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,890
There will be many of them.

489
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
I know.

490
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,330
Oh, this is gone. It was good.

491
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,560
Do you want mine?

492
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,899
You gave me this earlier.

493
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Right.

494
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,840
Mr. Yoon, you should try it. It's good.

495
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,210
Where did you get this?

496
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,710
It's from my friend.

497
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Your friend?

498
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,810
Yes, from the secretary's office.

499
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,649
- Is this... - It's called gwajeul.

500
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,050
It's common on Jeju Island.

501
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,790
How do you know these things?

502
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,430
I just...

503
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,660
I had it when I visited Jeju Island a while back.

504
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,970
Thank you.

505
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,570
Really?

506
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,080
Hello, sir.

507
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,410
Hello, Mr. Yoon. How may I help you this time?

508
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,080
I have a question for you.

509
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,150
Well...

510
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,360
About Chairman Song's resort on Jeju Island.

511
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,360
Oh, yes. What was it called? DADO.

512
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes.

513
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
DADO.

514
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,300
What about it?

515
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,839
How much would it go for?

516
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,100
If it were put on the market.

517
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
Are you selling it?

518
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,980
Maybe, if I'm happy with the price.

519
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,880
You didn't sell it last time, even when I adjusted the price.

520
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,880
I feel very bad about that matter.

521
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,620
Director Kang. I'll call you again.

522
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,750
Got it.

523
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Hold on.

524
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,290
What's this?

525
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,660
Something feels off.

526
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,430
How so?

527
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,839
It's like I'm the last to know...

528
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,710
I've been tricked into something.

529
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,240
What could it be?

530
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,280
This must be the place.

531
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,279
(DADO Hotel)

532
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
- Is it? - Yes.

533
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,320
That's the only accommodation with the name DADO on Jeju Island.

534
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,020
I thought resort buildings would be tall.

535
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,960
It's famous for being designed by Itami Joon.

536
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,690
And also for being very difficult to book.

537
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,500
Did you say Itami Joon?

538
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,400
- Yes. - "Itami?"

539
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,199
Is he Japanese?

540
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,469
He was a Korean Japanese who had a love for Korea.

541
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,870
He kept his Korean nationality.

542
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,839
While traveling, he wrote many books...

543
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,079
and left architectures.

544
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,079
The architectures are concentrated on Jeju Island.

545
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,250
Have you been there?

546
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,450
No.

547
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,980
I watched a documentary.

548
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,689
I get why Chairman Song would want it.

549
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,060
Will we...

550
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,420
inspect the place in person?

551
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Should I make the reservations?

552
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,970
- Let's inspect it. - Jeju Island!

553
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,779
- Yes, Director Kang? - I have something...

554
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
to explain to you in person.

555
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,420
It feels like...

556
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,319
I made a mistake.

557
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,390
That's not true, Director Kang.

558
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,120
I understand where you're going.

559
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,820
But don't worry.

560
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,589
No. I still want to meet with you.

561
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,190
I want to inform you about the resort too.

562
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,760
I see. All right.

563
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,999
Head to Jeju Island first.

564
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,830
I'll go after meeting Director Kang.

565
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,170
Understood.

566
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,709
Standard, premium, and suite.

567
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,770
Shall I book the three?

568
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,380
That sounds good since we must make comparisons.

569
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,209
The company won't know about it,

570
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,220
so pay with this card.

571
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,050
All right. I'll do that.

572
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,660
Standard is 700 dollars per night,

573
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,490
premium is 1,500,

574
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,000
and suite is 8,000.

575
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,630
Hold on.

576
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,200
How much was it again?

577
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,670
Jin Soo.

578
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,340
Book the standard.

579
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,170
Oh, all right.

580
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,969
I'll book three standard rooms.

581
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,140
One standard.

582
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,180
Instead, make it 2 nights. It'll be 1,400 dollars.

583
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,780
Add breakfast to it.

584
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,710
After all, we're working on a weekend.

585
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,550
Book two rooms.

586
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,620
No. I'm all right.

587
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,420
Okay. I'll book two rooms.

Mr. David.

592
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,110
Yes, Director Ha.

593
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,650
I'd like to talk to you.

594
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,390
How about a meal together?

595
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,820
A meal with you, Director Ha?

596
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,690
Yes.

597
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,529
Where should we dine?

598
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,530
Well...

599
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Okay.

600
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,540
All right. Sounds good.

601
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,640
I'll make the reservation. Please come over right away.

602
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,040
Understood.

603
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,980
I thought you wouldn't want to go.

604
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,150
True.

605
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,120
There's no reason to have a meal with him.

606
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,920
But?

607
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,960
It's interesting.

608
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,130
What?

609
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,900
The things he does.

610
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,210
(Director Ha Tae Soo)

611
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,740
Darn it.

612
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,180
Goodness.

613
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,750
If only I could also manage someone else's money...

614
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,990
and get a piece of the pie.

615
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,930
We, the secretary's office,

616
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,930
must work like Chairman Song's shadow,

617
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,370
not hide behind him. Did I not tell you that?

618
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,670
You did.

619
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,709
Did you have to make him call over...

620
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,080
Director Ha, Director Lee, and Mr. Yoon?

621
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,580
But, you see,

622
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,620
it was a new task for us.

623
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,350
We simply followed Chairman Song's orders.

624
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,520
Exactly.

625
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,660
That's what hiding behind Chairman Song means.

626
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,000
How is it working if you only follow his orders?

627
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,030
Is that what a secretary does?

628
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,669
You are to read Chairman Song's mind...

629
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,270
and settle things without any trouble.

630
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,970
The secretary's office has become a laughing stock.

631
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,050
Everyone is asking where Chairman Song's resort is.

632
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,980
- My apologies. - My apologies.

633
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,290
From now on,

634
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,020
let's make sure Chairman Song...

635
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,820
doesn't have to revisit...

636
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
past discussions.

637
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,460
- Understood. - Understood.

638
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,900
Get back to work.

639
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,840
Excuse me.

640
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,580
The place may look shabby,

641
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,780
Enjoy.

642
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,150
But it's a must-eat place.

643
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,880
It looks good. I'll enjoy it.

644
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,550
By the way, Director Kang.

645
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,390
Regarding DADO Resort,

646
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,290
I got the information from different routes.

647
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,330
Nobody will think it was leaked from your end.

648
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,230
And I won't mention it either.

649
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,700
Well, you see...

650
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,370
The secretary's office was in charge of it.

651
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,539
I naturally thought you were in charge of it.

652
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,810
But on second thought,

653
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,980
you couldn't have.

654
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,750
What do you mean by that?

655
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,780
Sorry?

656
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,250
I see.

657
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,320
So you had no idea.

658
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,360
Is there a reason I couldn't have done it?

659
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,830
Right.

660
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,900
I made a mistake, didn't I?

661
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,940
Feel free to look around.

662
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,809
Please try it on. I bet you'll look good in it.

663
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,680
Oh, I'm good.

664
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,810
Hold it up to the mirror.

665
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,149
- This? - It's the last piece.

666
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,150
The youngest worker asked me to hold it for her.

667
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,590
But it won't fit her. It's too small.

668
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,920
I think it'll be perfect on you.

669
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,459
Please try it on.

670
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,790
It looks different when it's on you.

671
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,129
My gosh. Because you're cool-toned,

672
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,539
the bright color looks great on you.

673
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,240
Look. Isn't it pretty?

674
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,170
I see.

675
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,239
This one is on sale, right?

676
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,209
Of course. The original price is 320 dollars.

677
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,520
With a 50-percent discount, it's 160 dollars.

678
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,280
Right.

679
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,560
Do you also offer employee discounts?

680
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,660
- Oh, are you a Sanin employee? - Yes.

681
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,699
As the discount rate is higher than the employee discount,

682
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,630
it can't be applied.

683
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,170
But it's much cheaper than the lowest price online.

684
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,570
- I see. - You look amazing in the dress.

685
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,680
Would you like to buy it?

686
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,510
Well...

689
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,230
- You got here before me. - Hi.

690
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,359
- Attorney Oh. - Yes?

691
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,329
You look different in casual clothes.

692
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,430
What? Do I look cool?

693
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,200
No, you just look different.

694
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,670
I'm last.

695
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,240
Hey.

696
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,670
We just came.

697
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,040
Is that so?

698
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,880
Why didn't you wear comfortable clothes? It's a resort.

699
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,010
Should I have done that?

700
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,079
Will our inspection get busted?

701
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,210
That's not it.

702
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,450
You're always in work mode.

703
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,190
But we're heading over to work.

704
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,290
Maybe I should be driving the car.

705
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,030
No. I'll be in charge on Jeju Island.

706
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,070
But I feel at ease when I drive.

707
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,370
Relax. We're all the way in Jeju.

708
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,400
- Welcome. - Welcome.

709
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,269
- Please let me. - I'll do it.

00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,509
Here.

711
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,740
Thank you.

712
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Great.

713
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,340
This is Room 117.

714
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,980
- Room 121 is over here. - Got it.

715
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,120
Thank you. Give me the key.

716
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,080
The key...

717
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,990
- Ms. Kwak. Get some rest. - Okay.

718
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,560
- Ms. Kwak. - Yes?

719
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,190
Here.

720
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,100
Get some rest.

721
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,100
Your room is this way.

722
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,870

723
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,940

What?

732
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,240
Where are you from?

733
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,110
- Seoul. - I see.

734
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,480
How long will you be staying here?

735
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,550
Sorry?

736
00:46:56,551 --> 00:47:00,690
The thing is, I'm here alone.

737
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,720
And I'm bored.

738
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,560
How about we become friends?

739
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,600
"Friends?"

740
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:17,809
Yes?

741
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,180
Ms. Kwak. If you've looked around your room, how about a meal?

742
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,180
All right.

743
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,880
Attorney Oh and I will wait at the restaurant.

744
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,950
Okay. I'll be right there.

745
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,059
See you again, Ms. Neighbor.

746
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,600
Right. Please excuse me.

747
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,110
- Do you need a receipt? - Yes.

748
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,739
Here you go.

749
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,910
- Thank you. - Thank you.

750
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,750
Over there.

751
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,950
Hi. Do you have a reservation?

752
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,420
Well...

753
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey.

754
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,629
- Over there. - Okay. Allow me to lead the way.

755
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,630
Okay.

756
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,000
- You made it. - Yes.

757
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,970
Thank you.

758
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,380
Here's the menu.

759
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,350
It's best to taste various dishes, right?

760
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,150
Yes, let's do that.

761
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,690
Should we order two a la carte...

762
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,259
and one course menu?

763
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,759
Listen. Since I eat quite a lot,

764
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,330
won't an a la carte be too little?

765
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,829
Do you want to order two a la carte?

766
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,970
No.

767
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,200
The course menu can be filling, you know?

768
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,670
Go ahead. You can have the course menu.

769
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,319
Two udon meal sets.

770
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,419
"A Jeju-style course meal crafted with sincerity featuring..."

771
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,419
"rustic yet simple dishes made with ingredients..."

772
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,589
"from pristine waters."

773
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,790
This one, please.

774
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,189
Okay. We'll prepare 2 udon meal sets and 1 DADO course meal.

775
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,460
Great. Thank you.

776
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,560
Thank you.

777
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,930
Here.

778
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,530
Thank you.

779
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,270
How was your room, Ms. Kwak?

780
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,540
It was nice.

781
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,480
Yes, nice.

782
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,250
I found the indoor air to be quite dry.

783
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,450
Aren't hotels always a bit dry?

784
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,350
What?

785
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,320
We meet again, Ms. Neighbor.

786
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,190
Hi.

787
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,660
How do you two know each other?

788
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,260
We're neighbors.

789
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,430
I see.

790
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,429
I see. You guys live in the same neighborhood.

791
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,300
No, she didn't mean it like that.

792
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,670
She's staying in the next room.

793
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,040
- I see. - Okay.

794
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,150
If you don't mind, could I join you guys?

795
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,950
Sure. Please join us.

796
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,460
How long have you been staying here?

797
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Pardon?

798
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,170
Oh, I've been here for a long time. About a year?

799
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,740
So you came to Jeju Island a year ago?

800
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,270
Yes, that too.

801
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,180
You've been staying in this resort for a year?

802
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Yes.

803
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,180
I love this place.

804
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,680
I see. Okay.

805
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,420
Sure.

806
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,820
Here are our noodles.

807
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,590
Oh, my.

808
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,989
- Thank you. - It's hot.

809
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,800
- Okay. - My goodness.

810
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,700
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

811
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,940
Did I upset you?

812
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,510
What?

813
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,939
No, I'm fine.

814
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,380
I'm just craving something spicy today.

815
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,050
Come on. Don't act like you don't know what I mean.

816
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,590
I'm talking about the purchase of my resort.

817
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,560
I understand, sir.

818
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,629
Seriously? Did you just sir me?

819
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,190
You're upsetting me when you talk to me like that.

820
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,300
When it's just you and me,

821
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,800
we're friends.

822
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,140
Don't worry about it.

823
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,070
I'm sure you had your reasons.

824
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,450
Okay.

825
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,080
"The company is fighting an uphill battle to pay off the debt."

826
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,189
"But the chairman who should know better bought a resort..."

827
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,550
"and caused a mess."

828
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,690
Isn't that what people are thinking?

829
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,730
They will honestly think you had your reasons to do so.

830
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,430
- Are you sure? - Yes.

831
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:14,470
Then why aren't you asking me about my reason to buy the resort?

832
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,380
Why did you have to buy it?

833
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,250
So this resort...

834
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,750
It's Ji O's.

835
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,390
Are you saying the chairman isn't the actual owner?

836
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,560
Right. That's it.

837
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,230
Then why did he keep it a secret?

838
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,160
That, I really don't know. I swear.

839
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,500
- I see. - Mr. Yoon.

840
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,900
You must keep everything I told you today a secret.

841
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,010
Don't worry.

842
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,910
She said it was her dying wish.

843
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,150
So I bought it for her.

844
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,720
I see.

845
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,360
I couldn't tell other people about it,

846
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,530
so I couldn't tell you either.

847
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,530
You...

848
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,570
understand my decision, right?

849
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,170
Yes.

850
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,070
So...

851
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,540
is there...

852
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,410
any other way instead of selling the resort?

853
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,810
She won't leave the resort.

854
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,630
Since you let me join you today, it will be my treat.

855
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,500
No.

856
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,430
- Put it on my room. - No.

857
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,730
- Here. - It's already been paid.

858
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,870
Would you like to go for a swim?

859
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,570
Gosh. Well, that was...

860
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,939
Is there a swimming pool here?

861
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,310
No. But there's one in my room.

862
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,080
You must be staying in the suite.

863
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,150
Would you like to come? I can invite you.

864
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,219
- Really? - Yes.

865
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,860
I was curious about the suites here.

866
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,760
Well, if we're not imposing on you...

867
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,260
You're not.

868
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,770
I think she's filthy rich.

869
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,510
The lady?

870
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,439
She paid for our food.

871
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,110
And she's staying in the suite too.

872
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,650
She's been staying there for a year.

873
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,480
Her wealth must be on a different level.

874
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,280
I doubt it.

875
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,149
Rich people don't spend money like that.

876
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,560
Is that so? Then what's her deal?

877
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,960
Maybe, she has some kind of sad story.

878
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,359
- A sad story? - You know, there are people...

879
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,970
who want to spend all of their money before they die,

880
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,640
so they can leave without regret.

881
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
Never mind.

882
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,680
She didn't look like that type.

883
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,300
- Yes, Director Lee. - Hey, Joo No.

884
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,000
It's about the resort.

885
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,270
Yes, I'm listening.

886
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,040
Are you seriously considering to sell it?

887
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,540
I believe we should.

888
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,540
I understand why you want to sell it.

889
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,850
But don't sell it.

890
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,220
The resort doesn't belong to the chairman.

891
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,649
So I said...

892
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,690
I'm aware.

893
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,419
- My gosh. - Hey.

894
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,620
How did you find out?

895
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,960
It turns out someone named Song Ji O is the real owner.

896
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,830
Do you know who that is?

897
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,350
Have you tried this? It's really good.

898
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,890
Thank you.

899
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,500
My name is Kwak Min Jeong.

900
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,000
My name is Song Ji O.

901
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,910
I see.

902
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,240
Thank you for inviting us to your suite.

903
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,040
I should thank you.

904
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,410
You can just call me by my name.

905
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,720
Sure, Ji O.

906
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,490
Mr. Yoon?

907
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,330
Yes, he does look like Mr. Yoon.

908
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,760
Wait, it is him.

909
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,300
Mr. Yoon.

910
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,600
- Did you eat? - Yes.

911
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,170
I hope the meeting went well.

912
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,280
She's the chairman's daughter.

913
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,350
This is...

914
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,350
Hello, CEO Song Ji O.

915
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,820
CEO?

916
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,560
She's a CEO?

917
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,429
I guess she's a CEO of a company.

918
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,060
You are Ms. Song Ji O, the CEO of DADO Resort, right?

919
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,840
Hello.

920
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,810
I'm the owner of DADO Resort. My name is Song Ji O.

921
00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,680
- I should've paid for the meal. - The CEO?

922
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,260
I've known her ever since she was a child.

923
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,430
She was the apple of his eye.

924
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,859
She was his only daughter.

925
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,960
So you can imagine how much he adored her.

926
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,469
But after her mother died,

927
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,570
Ji O must have gone astray for some time.

928
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,310
She lost her mother when she was quite young.

929
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,710
So the chairman couldn't look after her as much as he wanted.

930
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,020
In the end, he sent her abroad.

931
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,949
But she couldn't adjust to the life there either.

932
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,590
She came back to Korea last year.

933
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,400
I thought she was staying with the chairman.

934
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,600
But she was adamant about living on Jeju Island.

935
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,370
So he bought the resort as a present to her.

936
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,780
Trying to take that away from her...

937
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,980
wouldn't give you a chance to survive.

938
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,510
My goodness.

939
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,220
Oh, my.

940
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,720
- You should go home. - Yes, sir.

941
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,780
Yes, sir.

942
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,310
Understood.

943
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,760
Sir, it's me.

944
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,130
Come in.

945
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,810
Did it look like a good place?

946
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,680
Do you mean Jeju Island?

947
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,250
Yes.

948
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,520
Yes. She seemed comfortable.

949
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,520
- Go and get some rest. - Yes, sir.

950
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,530
You must hold an important position in the company.

951
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,900
But how did you know that I was the CEO?

952
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,000
You must be from Sanin, correct?

953
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,510
Yes, Ms. Song.

954
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,510
I'm Yoon Joo No from M and A Team.

955
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,540
That's great.

956
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,950
I need to show off my resort then.

957
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,650
Isn't it a beauty? And it's very private too.

958
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,790
Yes, indeed.

959
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,690
Once you walk this way, you'll see the panoramic view again.

960
01:01:49,448 --> 01:01:50,450
Stunning, isn't it?

961
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,410
Yes.

962
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,250
Seeing the resort in person rather than a photo does it justice.

963
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,150
You bet.

964
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,490
Seeing it in person is much better.

965
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,830
Do you see the oreum over there? Check it out at dawn.

966
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,600
Okay.

967
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,830
By the way, can you get up that early?

968
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:13,370
Probably.

969
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,840
You probably won't go then.

970
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,940
I go there every morning.

971
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,680
No. I'll make sure to visit it tomorrow.

972
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,380
Really?

973
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:24,880
Do you mean it?

974
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,610
Promise me then.

975
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:32,490
Sure.

976
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,830
They're working even on this trip.

977
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,070
You must be a mean boss, Mr. Yoon.

978
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,240
What was the name of your team again?

979
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,410
We're from M and A Team.

980
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,710
M and A Team?

981
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,910
So you buy and sell companies. Is that right?

982
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,520
Yes.

983
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,949
We're conducting due diligence...

984
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,420
in case we have to sell DADO Resort.

985
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,190
Due diligence? What's that?

986
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:14,530
You can think of it as conducting an appraisal on DADO Resort.

987
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,800
Really?

988
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:18,800
I'm curious.

989
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,380
So you guys are here to sell off my resort.

990
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,950
Oh, my. You guys were really in a scary business.

991
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,720
I made sure no one from Sanin would be allowed here.

992
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,490
This all looks Greek to me.

993
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,199
These are the financial statements of DADO Resort.

994
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,700
Financial statements? What are those for?

995
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,339
You can think of them as an indicator...

996
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,510
that reflects the company's financial health.

997
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,680
I see.

998
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,080
It's like the health checkup chart.

999
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,050
That was the perfect analogy.

1000
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,880
It's the health checkup chart of a company. Right?

1001
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,450
Yes. Totally.

1002
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,250
So is DADO Resort healthy?

1003
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,600
The financial health of DADO Resort isn't so good.

1004
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,330
Then what should I do?

1005
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,830
We're looking for a solution.

1006
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,669
If you spare us a moment of your time tomorrow,

1007
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,100
we'll present it to you.

1008
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,670
Sure. I'll look forward to it.

1009
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,440
Then please do tell me about it tomorrow.

1010
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,180
A solution to save DADO Resort.

1011
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,620
Ms. Song.

1012
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,730
Selling DADO Resort is one of the options we're considering.

1013
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,160
And?

1014
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,890
I was wondering if you were aware.

1015
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,060
Yes.

1016
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,970
But that doesn't matter...

1017
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,340
because...

1018
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,840
I won't...

1019
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,910
sell it.

1020
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,950
I see.

1021
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,090
(The Art of Negotiation)

1022
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,090
This place isn't run to make a profit.

1023
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,060
It stands to entertain a chairman's daughter.

1024
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,200
So the problem lies with her operational skills?

1025
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,499
He already borrowed three billion dollars.

1026
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,970
He's asking for 55 million dollars?

1027
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:11,110
Does the chairman also know this isn't an easy thing to do?

1028
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,540
Will anyone want to buy this resort?

1029
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,640
Our minimum price is 60 million dollars.

1030
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,880
Why did they go down there?

1031
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,979
- Sir. - The chairman found out...

1032
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,780
that you went down to Jeju.

1033
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,920
- Did he sell it? - No.

1034
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,120
Did you lose your job because of me?

1035
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,660
We gave up on selling DADO Resort.
