12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,540
You...

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,470
Do you want to try being an executive?

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,740
What? You don't?

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,350
If it's a registered executive, I'll do it.

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,530
So you're asking for the right to vote then.

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,070
Yes.

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,760
I want to become a member of the board of directors.

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,820
You sure are a negotiation expert. You're different.

20
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,450
Do you have hiking boots?

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,700
Is it true that Yun Ju No will

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,550
become an executive?

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,780
Are you sure?

24
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,740
Yun Ju No is going hiking with the chairman.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,280
To Mt. Bukhan?

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,880
Yes, to Mt. Bukhan.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,020
What about Mt. Bukhan?

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,340
You didn't go to Mt. Bukhan

29
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,420
when you became an executive?

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,290
I came here as an executive.

31
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,090
Oh, I see.

32
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,560
You already were one when Mr. Lee brought you over.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
Then you probably don't understand.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,320
So what's the deal with Mt. Bukhan?

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,150
Supposedly, there's a lot of water

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,160
in our Chairman's fortune*. 
  (*saju is a traditional kind of Korean fortune telling based on birth date and time) 

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,830
"There's a lot of water in his fortune"? 
  (*saju is a traditional kind of Korean fortune telling based on birth date and time) 

38
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,310
Yes.

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,600
Since there's a lot of water in the chairman's fortune,

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,260
he needs to get rid of some water

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,950
if he wants to avoid bad luck.

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,210
But he can't do so with wood or soil.

43
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,430
Wood rots when it meets water,

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,760
and the soil gets carried away by water.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,320
Then?

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,900
It needs to be a rock.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,840
That's why he goes to Mt. Bukhan!

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,730
You know how Mt. Bukhan is a rocky mountain.

49
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,270
He needs to go there to receive

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,150
cosmic good luck based on his fortune.

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,330
Not only that, he always takes the same path.

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,660
What about iron?

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,050
Mr. Choi.

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,150
Iron rusts.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,750
A rock is the way to go.

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,580
All right. Let's go.

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,170
♫  You know you're gonna lose it someday  ♫

58
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,870
♫  Signs, crimes, there's no shine to that gold  ♫

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,790
 You've been to the chairman's office, right? 

60
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,230
 There's a big decorative stone at the entrance. 

61
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,840
 That's supposed to stop the water vein. 

62
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,350
Since he always says we need good endurance,

63
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,240
I thought it was a physical conditioning test.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,100
Apart from making people executives,

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,140
he always makes important decisions there.

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,640
You're right.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,810
Yun Ju No, right?

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,140
So did we pay off all our debt?

69
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,610
We still have some left.

70
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,780
Really?

71
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,450
So how much is left?

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,680
It's about 2.5 trillion won.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,850
Really?

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,570
There's not much left then, right?

75
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,530
It's slippery here.

76
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,560
 Yes? 

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,950

80
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,830

♫  You know you're going to lose it someday  ♫

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay, thank you.

84

♫  It takes your heart away  ♫

85
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,050
Doesn't he give you a mission

86
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,640
- before becoming an executive? 
 - Yes.

87
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,770
I wonder what he'll give.

88
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,330
Well...

89
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,070
There's a lot that he could have Yun Ju No do.

90
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,250
For Yun Ju No, his ability isn't the issue.

91
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,810
We're almost there.

92
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,900
Aigoo.

93
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,700
It's nice, right?

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,010
When you grow old, your head starts to hurt.

95
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,250
Do you know why?

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,420
It's because you can see through people.

97
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,820
And it's not like you can show that you know,

98
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,470
but you don't want to pretend not to know either.

99
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,120
It's a headache because I can see through people,

100
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,590
but you're a bit confusing.

101
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,120
There's a golf course in Chungbuk.

102
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,340
Try selling that.

103
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,810
Okay.

104
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,550
All right.

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,210
Chairman.

106
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,000
Why are you guys out here?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,070
Shouldn't you be working?

108
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,140
And you. Aigoo, you were pretty good at hiking.

109
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,540
You don't seem like you would be.

110
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,320
A team leader has never gone straight to an executive like this.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,810
Buy him some food before sending him home.

112
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,540
- I'll go ahead. 
 - Okay, I'll do so.

113
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,740
Let's go.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,110
Hey, what did the chairman say?

115
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,350
He said to sell a golf course in Chungbuk.

116
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,780
A golf course?

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,970
Let's eat another time.

118
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,540
Or you two can eat by yourselves.

119
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,950
Hey!

120
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,000
The chairman didn't ask you to do anything else?

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,430
No, he didn't say much else

122
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,140
apart from selling the golf course.

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,880
I guess the chairman sees you favorably.

124
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,930
Why? Because the test is too easy?

125
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,430
Yes.

126
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,950
   

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,380
Come in.

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,980
- Hey. 
 - Chairman.

129
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,660
All right, come.

130
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,700
- What is it? 
 - I had something to tell you.

131
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,360
Okay, take a seat.

132
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,900
What is it?

133
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,130
Well, it's about Mr. Yun.

134
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,500
He's still young and all.

135
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,250
I don't know if it's okay for him to suddenly get a board vote.

136
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,970
So you've got a problem with that?

137
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,800
No, I'm not saying I have a problem.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,220
I just thought the executives might feel that way.

139
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,790
How about you call for a board meeting?

140
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,300
And if the board of directors says no,

141
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,170
do I have to change my mind?

142
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,390
No, that's not the case.

143
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,180
Mr. Ha.

144
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,220
- Yes. 
 - You shouldn't be worrying about that.

145
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,660
Didn't we sell Construction?

146
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,300
Yes.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,670
I'm thinking of building apartment buildings again.

148
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,280
What are your thoughts?

149
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
Pardon?

150
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,410
Hey, why are you so shocked?

151
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,460
I can build apartment buildings in my sleep.

152
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,150
Oh, yes, well, I don't doubt that.

153
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,150
But we sold Construction off...

154
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,090
Exactly. So I'm saying let's start again.

155
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,620
No, we can't do that.

156
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,710
There's a clause preventing us from entering the same industry.

157
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,480
For how long?

158
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
I'll need to check,

159
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,190
but I believe it's five years.

160
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,050
Aigoo, really?

161
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,510
Make sure you're right about that.

162
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,160
We'll grow it nicely and reacquire it.

163
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,750
Pardon?

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,620
Why? It's not possible?

165
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,670
And who was that again?

166
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,500
Right.

167
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,590
What's that guy doing right now?

168
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,640
Who are you referring to?

169
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,960
You know the guy who looks like this.

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,040
Like this. Yes.

171
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:53,550
 ­  

172
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,830
 Hey, move that quickly! 

173
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,520
 You, too! 

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,520
Hurry, hurry! Hurry up!

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get rid of that quickly!

176
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,280
Hey! Move that!

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,370
 That, that, that, move that quickly! 

178
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,370
 Hey! Hey! Move that quickly! 

179
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,950
What's this?

180
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,800
Wow!

181
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,420
- Hyeongnim! 
 - Wow.

182
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,410
I haven't seen you wearing a hard hat in a long time.

183
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,730
Macho man, Lee Hun Min! You've still got it!

184
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,730
Oh, Hyeongnim!

185
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,280
Oh, this guy. Aigoo...

186
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,740
Hey, you're going through a lot.

187
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,270
How's Greenview CC?

188
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,120
The golf industry isn't doing great these days.

189
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,040
Yes, my friends used to post a lot about playing golf.

190
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,090
But they don't do that anymore.

191
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,640
I think its sales probably dropped significantly.

192
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,580
Mr. Kang thinks so, too.

193
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,020
They're starting to sort the good from the bad.

194
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,970
The financial statements still show they're making a profit.

195
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,620
Compared to other golf courses, Greenview CC is doing quite well.

196
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,930
That's good.

197
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,760
We'll have to do due diligence to know the details.

198
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,900
Mr. Lee, during the last board meeting,

199
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,140
they said to vote on who was to blame.

200
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,840
Maybe it's because I've been so stressed lately,

201
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,050
well, with...

202
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,630
the travel agency and the hotel not doing well, I think...

203
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,010
I made a mistake in my frustration.

204
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,390
No,

206
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,740
I didn't ask to see you about that.

207
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,910
Here you go.

208
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,780
I probably shouldn't have said what I said either.

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,480
No, no. I...

210
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,930
I don't know what came over me.

211
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,240
I must've lost my mind!

212
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,590
Why is that jerk here?

213
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,660
Here. These are Go pieces.

214
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,410
I bought these on my business trip to China.

215
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,900
They must've been expensive.

216
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,870
Mr. Lee, you like playing Go.

217
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,980
These are really pretty.

218
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,010
Okay, thank you.

219
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,520
So I asked to see you

220
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,950
because I had something to tell you.

221
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,590
Oh, yes.

222
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,580
Don't take it the wrong way.

223
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,270
Go ahead and tell me.

224
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,740
It just so happens

225
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,590
we need to sell one of your subsidiaries again.

226
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,850
Pardon?

227
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,600
We are planning to sell that golf course.

228
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
I... I'm really regretting what I did, Mr. Lee!

229
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,350
No, that's why I said not to take it the wrong way.

230
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,830
This is so Mr. Yun can become an executive,

231
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,480
so please help us out.

232
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,810
You really don't have any other motives, right?

233
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,500
Yes. What other motive would I have?

234
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,670
 ­  

235
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,760
Hey, delivery man!

236
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,460
How can you leave this here? Take it upstairs!

237
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,090
I'll move it all upstairs in one go.

238
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,660
Then hurry.

239
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,750
I'm almost done. Almost done.

240
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,970
Gosh, you scared me.

241
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,680
Seonbae.

242
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
Why haven't I heard about what I ordered?

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,490
I told you it's all ready.

244
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,920
It's you who needs to be ready.

245
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,550
I'm almost there, too.

246
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,270
How far have you come?

247
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,900
I'll become an executive.

248
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,300
I see.

249
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,990
Okay.

250
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,880
If you're becoming an executive...

251
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,540
you have no interest in just working there?

252
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,940
No.

253
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,040
I need to go back.

254
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,360
I know.

255
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,270
But...

256
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,060
let's say you join the board of directors and request a re-investigation.

257
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,420
What if they still oppose it?

258
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,090
 Then I'll find out who the culprit is. 

259
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,610
Yes, Mr. Kang.

260
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
 Mr. Yun, about Greenview... 

261
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,600
 Someone is interested in acquiring it. 

262
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,480
Already? That's good.

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,340
 So I'd like to see you tomorrow. Do you have time? 

264
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,900
Yes, of course.

265
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,300
Mr. Yun.

266
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,020
This is Director Choi Seong Il of Dream Securities.

267
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,510
I'm Choi Seong Il.

268
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,950
Hello, I'm Yun Ju No.

269
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,940
I heard a lot about you. I finally get to meet you.

270
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,700
Yes, one of our clients is interested in the golf course business.

271
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,630
I thought Sanin's Greenview golf course was a perfect fit.

272
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,120
And they want to do this on a no-name basis?

273
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Yes, our client is sensitive to rumors.

274
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,790
Is that okay with you?

275
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,090
I have no problem with that.

276
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:08,840
But is running the golf course the reason or for investment?

277
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,800
The client is a fund, but it's not to resell it.

278
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,470
They will manage it directly.

279
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,640
So the current CEO needs to be replaced.

280
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Is replacing only the CEO enough?

281
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,250
Yes. The employees can stay as long as there aren't any issues.

282
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,750
Please don't take all the good employees with you.

283
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,430
All right.

284
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,630
What's the value you have in mind?

285
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,880
Wouldn't 80 billion won be reasonable?

286
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,430
That's too low.

287
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,570
You're open to going higher, right?

288
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,990
Mr. Yun,

289
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,290
everyone knows Sanin is desperate for cash right now.

290
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,640
Also, the golf industry isn't that attractive these days.

291
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,220
We already have a plan to raise the funds.

292
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,730
So we don't really have to sell the golf course.

293
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,140
Eleven trillion won?

294
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,450
There's not much of that left now.

295
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,870
The project is in its final stages too.

296
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,750
Thank you.

297
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,490
I thought you'd heard about Mr. Yun.

298
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,170
Then should I contact you after reviewing it?

299
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,750
Yes. Let's do that.

300
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,210
Thank you for coming today.

301
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,750
Thank you.

302
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,250
- I'll give you a call. 
 - Yes, I'll call you.

303
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,990
I'll call you.

304
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,570
I feel like I'm losing for some reason.

305
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm the one who's buying.

306
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,350
It always feels like that, talking to Mr. Yun.

307
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,190
He's not called White Snake for no reason.

308
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,990
But isn't 80 billion won a bit too low?

309
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,270
Hey, that's a pretty high offer.

310
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,830
Not that you don't have the ammunition?

311
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,370
We've got more than enough ammunition!

312
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,360
Do you want me to just shoot you?

313
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,520
That's good.

314
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,530
But who did you say was the client again?

315
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,690
No-name basis!

316
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,770
Oh, right, right. You said that.

317
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,610
Okay.

318
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,690
What's a no-name basis?

319
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,350
It's exactly as it sounds.

320
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,530
It's called a no-name basis when the buyer isn't disclosed.

321
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,920
Is that legal?

322
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,520
It happens all the time.

323
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,990
When the buyer is a big company

324
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,570
or if the special info regarding the specific company is leaked,

325
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,040
the other side could ask for a higher price.

326
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,610
So they keep their identity a secret to the end?

327
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,820
No.

328
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,960
The buyer should show themselves when we agree to sell.

329
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,630
Mr. Yun, I heard you went to Mt. Bukhan.

330
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,390
Yes.

331
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,620
I guess I'll be seeing you often.

332
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,370
 The doors are closing. 

333
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,200
You'll have a lot of questions once you become an executive.

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,640
Feel free to ask me any time if there's anything you don't know.

335
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
Thank you for saying that.

336
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,830
Or we can grab dinner with Mr. Lee sometime.

337
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,270
Okay.

338
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,330
Let's go.

339
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,400
Attorney Oh hasn't come in yet.

340
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,420
He's probably already there.

341
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,540
A-At the golf course?

342
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,560
Chungbuk is Attorney Oh's hometown.

343
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,530
  ­ 

344
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,470
 - Enjoy your meal. 
 - Thank you. 

345
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,450
Sun Young is perfect.

346
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,810
I know, right? He's handsome, has a good personality, and he's a prosecutor!

347
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm not a prosecutor.

348
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,520
You quit your job as one.

349
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,460
Now, he's an attorney for Sanin.

350
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,800
Exactly.

351
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,470
I heard that pays him more.

352
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,200
Wow, you make a lot of money, too?

353
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,410
Why aren't you getting married, then?

354
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,760
Right? But it's not that I'm not marrying.

355
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,740
He's got high standards, just like his dad.

356
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,590
Aigoo, I guess your mom won't be getting our food money*. 
  (*referring to money gifted in return for eating at the wedding) 

357
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,650
Sun Young, you need to meet a good woman.

358
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,350
Don't be like your dad and just date anyone, okay?

359
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,690
Give me a freaking break.

360
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,240
It's a good thing I had low standards.

361
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,140
If I didn't, my Sun Yeong wouldn't even be in the world!

362
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,530
Aigoo, then I'm grateful to my mom, too.

363
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,140
Not your dad?

364
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,100
I take after my dad.

365
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,190
Look at me.

366
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,280
Oh, you're right, you're right!

367
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,940
Oh Sun Young!

368
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,750
Bon Ju! Bon Ju!

369
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,060
Hey, i-it's been a while!

370
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,140
It's been a while. I heard you became a prosecutor.

371
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,340
- Yes. 
 - He quit.

372
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,460
He's a Sanin attorney now.

373
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,070
Yes, well, thank you.

374
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,540
Oh, yes, sit here, sit, sit.

375
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,870
Yes, being a prosecutor doesn't fit you.

376
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,450
Right?

377
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,200
So how are you doing?

378
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Me? I'm doing all right.

379
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm working at a golf course.

380
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,940
Really? Hey, that's great—

381
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,670
Oh Sun Young!

382
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,830
Oh Class President, it's been so long!

383
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,590
Hey! Hey, it's been so long!

384
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,020
You jerk, how could you not recognize me?

385
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,490
Hey, how could I not remember you?

386
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,540
See? See?

387
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,490
Gosh, how long has it been?

388
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,900
Oh, you heard I was back.

389
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,380
Not at all.

390
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,880
We came to eat and here you were.

391
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,950
Ma'am, three soft tofu stews, please!

392
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,030
Aigoo, eat something more expensive.

393
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,170
I spent my paycheck already.

394
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,420
 Make three delicious soft tofu stews. 

395
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,830
What's this? You didn't come to see me?

396
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,090
I'm hungry. Let's talk after we eat.

397
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,310
I'm starving.

398
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,800
All right, eat up. I hope you get indigestion.

399
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,090
- I'll sue you. 
 - Yes, and I'm an attorney.

400
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,890
Your mom bragged a lot about you coming.

401
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,680
  ­ 

402
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,720
- Really? 
 - You'll drink with us tonight, right?

403
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,500
Sorry. I've got some work to do today.

404
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,300
Let's set a date and grab drinks another time.

405
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,020
- You're out. 
 - Aigoo, thanks a lot.

406
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,850
Yes, Jin Su?

407
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,630
 Yes, Attorney Oh. We're heading down right now. 

408
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,490
 We're almost there. We're starving. 

409
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,630
But right now...

410
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,950
I don't think you should come here right now.

411
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,820
Why not?

412
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,230
 There are quite a few townspeople here. 

413
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,770
Wow, it sure is a famous restaurant. Do we have to wait in line?

414
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,570
 No, it's not about it being a famous restaurant. 

415
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,740
 There are many Greenview employees here. 

416
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,110
 We can't have rumors spread about the company being sold. 

417
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,380
 I'll go out to the main road right now. 

418
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,910
Okay.

419
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,860
Attorney Oh is coming out to the main road.

420
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,940
Mom, I'm leaving.

421
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,950
Where are you going? You should eat the tofu!

422
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,070
- Leaving? 
 - I'm sorry,

423
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,170
but something urgent came up at work.

424
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,330
I need to go.

425
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,720
Let's set a date to grab drinks soon.

426
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,800
- Eat before you go. 
 - But the food came out.

427
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,460
Sorry. It's an urgent matter. I'll call you.

428
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,210
Okay, get back safely.

429
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,300
Mom, I'm sorry.

430
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,460
See you. See you!

431
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,510
Turns out all my close friends work at Greenview.

432
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,730
Since it's your hometown?

433
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,200
Yes, it's not like there are any big companies around here.

434
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,220
Then what happens to your friends when the golf course is sold?

435
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,190
Since the buyer wants to run the golf course, they'll be carried over.

436
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,640
Yes, though the CEO will change.

437
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,240
Only the CEO?

438
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,940
Because Greenview is doing well, there is a potential buyer.

439
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,530
If the CEO is being fired for doing well, isn't that unfair?

440
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,420
That's basically what's happening.

441
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,400
Gosh, then I don't want to be a CEO.

442
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,080
Whoa, I won't make you CEO either.

443
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,290
I don't know what's good about being a CEO.

444
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,900
Just looking at the executives, they're constantly worried about losing their jobs.

445
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,620
They don't seem to be doing any work either.

446
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,930
I suppose.

447
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,000
That's why executives always engage in politics.

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,090
Yes...

449
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,000
I think it's better to just be an employee.

450
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,880
But if you don't become an executive, you'll be fired before that.

451
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,710
If we succeed in this sale, I'll become an executive.

452
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,640
Congratulations, Mr. Yun.

453
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,460
Yes, congratulations.

454
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,270
♫  Congratulations  ♫

455
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,600
♫  Congratulations  ♫

456
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,410
♫  Congratulations on your promotion  ♫

457
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,630
The CEO here will probably get mad, right?

458
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,230
Jin Su.

459
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,700
You won't get offended and curse at him again, right?

460
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,420
Look at me. Let's practice.

461
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,390
This time, I'll hold it in.

462
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,480
Hello, you're Team Leader Yun Ju No, right?

463
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,820
Hello, CEO Lee Hyeong Taek?

464
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,350
I'm Yun Ju No.

465
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,400
Nice to meet you.

466
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,490
Let's head inside.

467
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,790
Let's talk while having some tea inside.

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,130
Strangely enough, the mood doesn't seem to be that bad.

469
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,970
I know, right?

470
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,190
Please come in.

471
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,160
Please take a seat here.

472
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,130
No, you should sit there, CEO.

473
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,340
Aigoo. Aigoo, please take a seat.

474
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,900
Oh, okay.

475
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,940
Please, sit here.

476
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,630
Aigoo...

477
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,030
At first, when I saw the four of you here,

478
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,820
I thought you came to take some swings.

479
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,340
Oh, sorry. We're not customers.

480
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,030
Aigoo, no, no.

481
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't mean I'm disappointed you weren't customers.

482
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,600
Please, take a seat.

483
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,030
Okay.

484
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,090
I received the call from HQ.

485
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,350
You'll be selling our CC?

486
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,490
Yes. It's not confirmed yet.

487
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,110
But Sanin is experiencing financial difficulties.

488
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,030
We've no choice but to proactively sell subsidiaries.

489
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,750
Yes, I understand.

490
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,630
Then will the golf course be shut down?

491
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,430
No, the potential buyer plans to run it.

492
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,890
Thus, the employees will be carried over,

493
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,250
but please keep the sale confidential until it's finalized.

494
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,890
For employees, the news of the company being sold

495
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,620
could cause some agitation.

496
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,720
Yes... I suppose so.

497
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,860
And if you need to let us know anything, you should tell us now.

498
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:52,140
The buyer will conduct a thorough due diligence to assess its value.

499
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,390
If issues are discovered, then it'd be difficult to resolve.

500
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:01,280
Other than the business being slow, there's nothing like that.

501
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,320
Isn't it still doing better than other golf courses?

502
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,470
Well, we tried our best.

503
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,870
But I'm glad...

504
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,720
they'll continue to operate the golf course.

505
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,500
I thought I was going to be fired.

506
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,280
The potential buyer of Greenview CC

507
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,830
asks for a change in CEO.

508
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,820
Is it not possible for me to continue as the CEO?

509
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,270
The buyer has made it a priority condition,

510
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,200
so that'd be difficult.

511
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,740
But we can move you to another Sanin subsidiary,

512
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,750
or help you transition to another company.

513
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,900
There's a chance the sale might not happen, right?

514
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,840
Yes, that's also possible.

515
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,380
Then could I take some time to think about

516
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,230
what I should do in the future?

517
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,620
I also need to discuss this with my wife.

518
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,670
Yes, please take sufficient time to think

519
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,180
and just let us know during the due diligence period.

520
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,540
Then can I assume that

521
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,900
you'll allow us to conduct due diligence?

522
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,340
Well, I have no choice.

523
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,950
Oh, hello.

524
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,360
Hey, Manager Jeong.

525
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,000
She is our Financial Manager.

526
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,210
She manages our resources.

527
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,630
I also have to ask

528
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,180
Ms. Jeong if there's something I don't know.

529
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,350
No, that's not true.

530
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,290
Do you two know each other?

531
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,220
Oh, yes, well...

532
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,190
we're childhood friends.

533
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,810
Actually, I grew up in this neighborhood.

534
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,770
Oh, I see.

535
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,420
Well, have a safe trip back.

536
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,190
Thank you. I'll await your call.

537
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,530
They came from the HQ, right?

538
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,440
Yes, they came to do a fact-finding survey.

539
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,120
Let's head inside.

540
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,500
I feel a bit sorry for the CEO.

541
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,680
I understand how you feel, Jin Su,

542
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,520
but it's better to be straightforward with the truth.

543
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,260
Pardon?

544
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,340
Though you said you felt sorry,

545
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,930
what you actually feel is pity.

546
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,470
Honestly, pity isn't

547
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,790
what we should feel

548
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,250
toward the chief executive of this place.

549
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,960
It's better for him to know exactly what's happening

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,600
to consider his next steps.

551
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,100
That's true, but it seems unfair.

552
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,220
 If CEO Lee Hyeong Taek was a good executive, 

553
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,740
 he'll be evaluated as such. 

554
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,100
 Though we don't know when or how that will happen. 

555
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,170
Then he may never be properly evaluated, right?

556
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,360
That's possible.

557
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,630
What can he do, then?

558
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,970
What would you do if you were in his shoes?

559
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,550
I don't know.

560
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,200
I think I would just keep carrying on as usual.

561
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,560
You are doing that.

562
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,310
Yes.

563
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,580
  ­ 

564
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,170
What brings you here, Director Jo?

565
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,020
I have something to ask you briefly.

566
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,130
Me?

567
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,480
Yes.

568
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,950
Since I'm in HR,

569
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,840
I just need to focus on personnel matters.

570
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,410
Maybe it's because the subsidiary CEOs have different perspectives.

571
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,990
The company atmosphere feels too heated lately.

572
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,630
Everyone's so sensitive.

573
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,830
I see.

574
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,690
The company is in a difficult financial state,

575
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,800
so they must be quite worried.

576
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,230
That's what I mean.

577
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,760
We should help each other more

578
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,960
if the company is struggling.

579
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,640
I mean, well...

580
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,710
I think Mr. Yun may have a rigid personality.

581
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,690
But everything he says is correct.

582
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,070
But it's hard to take Mr. Yun's side

583
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,320
because I don't know whose head will roll.

584
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, Mr. Yun is also just doing his job.

585
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,770
You know our company's situation isn't great.

586
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,150
Of course.

587
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,570
It's a situation

588
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,400
where someone will have to suffer loss.

589
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,090
Since I'm a HR administrator,

590
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,490
I don't have anything to do with M&amp;A.

591
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,490
Oh, of course.

592
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,640
Our situation is...

593
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,790
different from the subsidiary CEOs'.

594
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,790
Though Mr. Yun seems to be a bit stubborn,

595
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,300
he knows how to respect the hierarchy.

596
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,730
Yes.

597
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,420
If he joins the board of directors,

598
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,510
he'll be flexible and do well.

599
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,850
Yes, I think so, too.

600
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,100
You should go home now.

601
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,770
Yes, yes.

602
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,920
Yes, Director.

603
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,520
We want to proceed with the sale of the golf course.

604
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,620
 Then should we sign the MOU first? 

605
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,970
The buyer will also come, right?

606
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,430
 Yes, of course. 

607
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,980
 But he wants to meet at the golf course. 

608
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,540
At Greenview?

609
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,110
 Yes. He's a bit impatient. 

610
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,880
 He wants to see the golf course in person. 

611
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,860
Okay, let's do that.

612
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,190
I'll see you there.

613
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,560
Did you wait long?

614
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,410
No, sir.

615
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,550
We'll sign an MOU for Greenview tomorrow

616
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,700
and start the due diligence.

617
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,810
It's a relief that a buyer appeared quickly.

618
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,110
Yes.

619
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,340
You can just handle the matter.

620
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,080
What else is there for us to talk about?

621
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,700
When this deal is done,

622
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,320
I'll join the board of directors.

623
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,730
I was curious what the current executives

624
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,800
would think.

625
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Are you worried they'll put you through a hazing?

626
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,720
The work that you're doing right now

627
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,470
is cutting out Sanin's wounds.

628
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,190
Since the chairman essentially approved of your work,

629
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,660
this is a big deal among executives.

630
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,040
But it doesn't look like

631
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,860
the situation is disadvantageous for you.

632
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,770
You just keep doing what you've been doing.

633
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,390
Okay.

634
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,130
Hey, Director Jo.

635
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,840
Hello.

636
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,820
Wow, Mr. Jo, you've improved a lot.

637
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,170
But you're good, too, Mr. Ha.

638
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,500
I just swing once in a while to work out.

639
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,280
But I've got some business coming up,

640
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,800
so I wanted to practice.

641
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,020
I see.

642
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,300
If you want to do business, you need to play golf.

643
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,360
You should come out to the field sometime.

644
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,890
Oh, okay.

645
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,410
Come on now.

646
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,060
Your shoulders are tight today.

647
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,340
Oh, yes.

648
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,480
What's up? Is something complicated going on?

649
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,070
Me? No, not really.

650
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,310
In golf, hitting farther doesn't mean you win.

651
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,870
You need to set the right direction.

652
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,630
If you keep the direction consistent,

653
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,750
you'll win.

654
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,320
I see.

655
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,110
I hope you'll be like that, Mr. Jo.

656
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,110
Well...

657
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,180
Mr. Ha, honestly...

658
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,700
Yes, honestly?

659
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,790
How about you get along better with Mr. Yun?

660
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,730
What?

661
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,510
I just thought maybe you could treat him a bit nicer.

662
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,900
You'll be seeing him often from now on.

663
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,900
So that's the direction you've chosen, huh?

664
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,990
Aigoo, it's not that I've chosen that direction.

665
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,110
Honestly, our company doesn't just follow the board's opinion

666
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,270
nor do we hold a lot of shares.

667
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,350
If the chairman says okay, that's how we roll.

668
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,330
Okay.

669
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,510
I didn't realize you were such a romantic, Mr. Jo.

670
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,920
Pardon?

671
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,850
I mean...

672
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,190
Get home safely.

673
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,070
Romantic? Romantic?

674
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,600
Hey, CEO Kim. Are you outside?

675
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,070
 I'm out to have dinner with my family. 

676
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,120
Aigoo, I'm interrupting your family meal.

677
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,540
Oh, no, it's okay.

678
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,040
 I just had something to tell you. 

679
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,570
 Do you have some time later? 

680
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,960
Yes, I do.

681
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,670
 Well, then... 

682
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,890
 Let's meet at the Japanese place we go to often. 

683
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,180
 I'll make a reservation and give you a call. 

684
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,600
 Enjoy your dinner with your family. 

685
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,300
Okay, okay. Let's do that, yes.

686
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,890
I'm sorry to cut you off while you were talking.

687
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,540
I got a call from my family.

688
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,780
Well,

689
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,420
where was I again?

690
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,140
You were saying the game of Go...

691
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,680
That it's fun.

692
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,700
That I should learn.

693
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,790
That was just a meaningless chat.

694
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,350
What I really wanted to say was...

695
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,490
- Yes? 
 - You know how we're preparing to enter into e-commerce?

696
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,100
Yes.

697
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,440
We don't plan to hire external personnel for it.

698
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,730
And I know how well you've run Sanin Mart.

699
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,190
Yes,

700
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,720
I should assist you in handling e-commerce well.

701
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,830
No.

702
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,140
I'm going to retire.

703
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,900
B-But... w-why?

704
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,640
Is that why Mr. Yun is becoming an executive?

705
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,830
No, what I'm saying is that you should do it.

706
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,850
What do you mean? You should do it, Mr. Lee.

707
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,120
I should retire now. I'm getting up there.

708
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,930
Then wh-what about Mr. Yun?

709
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,990
Mr. Yun also doesn't plan to stay here forever.

710
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,320
So transitioning to e-commerce

711
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,230
will become an opportunity for you.

712
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,380
I didn't realize that was your intent.

713
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,290
Honestly,

714
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:15,390
I felt a bit hurt.

715
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,130
I didn't know your bigger picture in mind...

716
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,440
Then can I assume that...

717
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,820
you're okay with e-commerce?

718
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,560
Of course.

719
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,360
E-commerce is ultimately distribution, after all.

720
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,350
- It is distribution. 
 - Oh, yes.

721
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,700
Please pour me a glass, too.

722
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,120
   

723
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,830
You can take the call.

724
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,320
No, it's just my wife telling me to buy something.

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,600
- Hey, stop the car. 
 - Okay.

726
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,990
These jerks are scheming.

727
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,070
Yes, CEO Lee.

728
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,860
I don't think the numbers will line up tomorrow.

729
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,820
Yes. You'll have to bring one more person.

730
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,910
Yes, okay.

731
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,310
Yes, Mr. Choi. We've arrived.

732
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,730
 Oh, yes, Mr. Yun. 

733
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,770
 We've been here for a while already. 

734
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,030
 We're out on the course. 

735
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,070
Then I'll wait for you in the lobby.

736
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,910
 I think it'll take a while. 

737
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,160
 Do you want to come over? 

738
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,980
 I'll send a caddie for you. 

739
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,280
Then let's do the paperwork next time.

740
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,620
 No, our CEO also feels bad 

741
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,790
 and he wants to meet you and sign today. 

742
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,630
Isn't this too much?

743
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,980
Yes.

744
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,710
Even if the buyer has the upper hand,

745
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,730
this is too much.

746
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,370
Let's go.

747
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,520
 The road curves up ahead. 

748
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,150
 Please hold onto the safety bar. 

749
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,380
 Good shot! 

750
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,210
I'm sorry to have you come all the way here.

751
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,790
Let's go.

752
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,010
We can't interrupt his tee shot.

753
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,530
 - Nice!  
 - Let's go.

754
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,250
Aigoo, it's been a while, Mr. Yun.

755
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,030
- Yes. 
 - You've met already, right?

756
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,840
You didn't know?

757
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,940
I'll buy this place.

758
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,500
I see.

759
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,470
We're in your care.

760
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,450
No, I should be saying that.

761
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,780
Let me buy this place for cheap.

762
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,840
How about we stop playing golf now?

763
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,170
Whoa, whoa, no!

764
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,590
I'm winning right now!

765
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,170
Hyeongnim, Mr. Yun will cry if you keep this up!

766
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,400
Don't take this the wrong way.

767
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,920
CEO Lee and I are really close,

768
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,990
so we've met occasionally, even after he left

769
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,010
and played golf together, too.

770
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,160
But he said there was a golf course he wanted to buy

771
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,080
and asked me to come with him

772
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,210
to see if it's all right.

773
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,120
I'm sure you knew we were trying to sell the golf course.

774
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,980
That's why I told you not to take it the wrong way.

775
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,680
I only found out after I arrived, too!

776
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,970
There comes CEO Lee now.

777
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,090
He's got a straightforward personality,

778
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,320
which is better for deals.

779
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,980
If he doesn't listen to you, just tell me.

780
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,760
He'll listen to anything I say.

781
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,870
Then you two should talk. I'll get going.

782
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,130
Leaving? No drinks?

783
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,900
Come on, CEO Lee.

784
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,790
If we drink after exercising, it's all for nothing.

785
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,870
We shouldn't have started at all.

786
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,210
Right?

787
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,080
♫  Welcome to your new life ♫

788
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,800
Mr. Yun,

789
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,920
it's not easy to become an executive.

790
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,100
Got it?

791
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,830
♫  Welcome to your new life ♫

792
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,680
Bye now.

793
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,770
Wow...

794
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,810
My body feels light after exercising.

795
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,120
It feels light.

796
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,590
CEO, is there a reason you asked to deal on a no-name basis?

797
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,440
Yes.

798
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,300
If such info is leaked, I was afraid

799
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,940
someone may manipulate the stock prices.

800
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,620
Yes, I suppose that's possible.

801
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,160
You're certain you want to acquire it?

802
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm certain.

803
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,960
Aren't we signing today?

804
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,990
Yes, that's right.

805
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,940
I'll give it back after reviewing it.

806
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,750
Are you still an intern?

807
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,240
Yes.

808
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,090
This is it, right?

809
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,460
We have to keep the deal confidential

810
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,190
and we can't manipulate the data.

811
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,640
Yes.

812
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,010
I'm sure all of this is properly written.

813
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,650
It's drafted

814
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,770
by the top law firm in Korea, after all.

815
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,900
Why are you reading over it so carefully, Attorney?

816
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,800
- In case I'd scam you? 
 - Pardon?

817
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,250
You can review it and give it to him.

818
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,820
- Okay. 
 - I'll hold onto it for you.

819
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,800
Then let's start the due diligence.

820
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,530
Which class are you from?

821
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,900
I'm from the 42nd class.

822
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,860
I see.

823
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:58,140
I'm Kang Min Ho, 38th class.

824
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,360
I'm Oh Sun Young.

825
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,130
Will you proceed with this deal?

826
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,230
I will. Why shouldn't I?

827
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,100
Let's prepare flawlessly.

828
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,600
Okay.

829
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,850
Ms. Kwak, please review the documents.

830
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:48,840
Yes, I'll check their financial statements in the last 10 years.

831
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,090
Ten years?

832
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,020
Yes, the retention period for

833
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,330
accounting documents is 10 years.

834
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,310
Here's the 2015 financial data.

835
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,560
And this is for 2016.

836
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,820
Okay.

837
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,080
But when will you review all this?

838
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,860
Pretty quickly.

839
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,300
Please handle the fieldwork, Jin Su.

840
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,220
Okay, I'll start right away tomorrow.

841
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,760
Hey, intern, let's eat. Follow me.

842
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,010
No, it's okay.

843
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,720
- Follow me! 
 - Enjoy your meal.

844
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,520
By chance,

845
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,890
what are you doing right now?

846
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,930
Oh, the thing is...

847
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,780
well...

848
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,260
I'm drawing...

849
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,740
Once the due diligence starts, employees will be agitated.

850
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,240
Yes, I'll explain it to them.

851
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,400
Some of them might be your friends.

852
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,420
Will you be okay?

853
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,510
That's why I think it's better if I handle it.

854
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,550
A foreign fund is trying to acquire Greenview CC.

855
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:20,420
CEO Lee Hoon Min is the representative for this acquisition,

856
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,390
and he'll be operating it in the future.

857
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:26,650
As a past Sanin executive, he probably has much affection for it.

858
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,410
He seemed really scary.

859
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,900
Oh, you've already seen him, I see.

860
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,500
Will we all be let go?

861
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,890
Oh, no.

862
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,830
The golf course will continue to operate.

863
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,490
The buyer's condition was for

864
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:39,800
the employees to be retained.

865
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Won't they just fire everyone afterward?

866
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,400
No. If they lay off a large number of employees,

867
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,630
the golf course wouldn't be able to operate.

868
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,560
They wouldn't buy it in the first place.

869
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,830
They're buying it to run it properly.

870
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,260
In fact, Sanin HQ

871
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,660
didn't invest aggressively in Greenview.

872
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,760
With a new buyer,

873
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,820
there will be fresh investments,

874
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,920
and employee benefits will improve as well.

875
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,440
As far as those are concerned,

876
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,960
we'll make sure to include that

877
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,100
in the sales conditions.

878
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,020
Please read the documents in front of you,

879
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,770
and ask me any questions you may have.

880
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,950
How about a drink tonight?

881
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,880
Let's have a drink together. Cheers. Cheers.

882
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,600
Oh, right.

883
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,310
But did you know you're the one

884
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,330
who taught me to drink?

885
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,470
Me?

886
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,540
- Is that so? 
 - Yes!

887
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,770
We secretly drank

888
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,280
the ginseng liquor in the village hall,

889
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,940
and refilled it with water.

890
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,850
Oh, that time!

891
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,230
Yes. I couldn't even drink back then.

892
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,710
I passed out, barely drinking any, and when I woke up,

893
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,640
you were begging for forgiveness.

894
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,180
Right, I even paid for it later.

895
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,790
Everyone was in on it,

896
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,420
but you said you'd take all the blame

897
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,970
and be responsible.

898
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,440
Geez...

899
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,330
Do you know what your nickname was after that?

900
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,860
I don't know.

901
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,580
Bon Ju the Just.

902
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,940
Bon Ju, Bon Ju! Bon Ju!

903
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,270
But...

904
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,130
why did we get caught again?

905
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,240
Mun Jin.

906
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,860
Mun Jin ended up confessing,

907
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,280
saying we shouldn't lie.

908
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,900
Oh, right.

909
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,920
M-Mun Jin, how's she doing?

910
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,110
She's doing fine.

911
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,600
Mun Jin also works at the golf course as a caddie.

912
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,420
What? I didn't see her, though.

913
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,570
She's taking a short break these days.

914
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,830
Oh, really?

915
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,470
But is everything you said earlier true?

916
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,990
Of course, it's true.

917
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,890
So no one is getting fired, right?

918
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,660
Nope. No one's getting fired.

919
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,020
Oh, but the CEO will be replaced, though.

920
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,470
The buyer wants to manage it directly.

921
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,040
The CEO will either move to another subsidiary

922
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,320
or leave with a large severance package.

923
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,270
That's the end for the CEO?

924
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,420
Yes, probably?

925
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,780
I'm planning to quit.

926
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,270
Should I find another position at another subsidiary?

927
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,300
No.

928
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,930
Sanin's not in a great situation right now.

929
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,110
If I go to another subsidiary,

930
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,620
I might be taking away someone else's spot.

931
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,650
I think it's best for me to just step away.

932
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,060
Or we could help you transition to

933
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,230
one of our partner companies.

934
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,060
No,

935
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,780
I'd like to take a break.

936
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,080
Is there a reason?

937
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,770
Actually, I'm a "Goose Dad."*
  (*Father living in Korea whilst family is abroad) 

938
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,400
My wife and son are in the U.S.

939
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,470
I want to live with them now.

940
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,320
This is my son and his mother.

941
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,430
I guess your wife works with flowers.

942
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,120
Yes.

943
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,260
Our son got into NYU,

944
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,490
but the tuition is insane.

945
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,110
What I send isn't enough.

946
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,190
So she works part-time at a flower shop to help out.

947
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,970
The owner even asked

948
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,000
if she'd be interested in buying the business…

949
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:26,220
but I'm short on funds.

950
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,610
How much do you need?

951
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:37,590
I have some savings,

952
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,350
but I still need about a billion won.

953
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,410
I know you've worked hard for us,

954
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,500
but a severance package exceeding

955
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,630
Sanin's regulations will be difficult.

956
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,490
As you know, our company

957
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,200
isn't well off financially right now.

958
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,850
Yes...

959
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,800
But still, if the due diligence goes well,

960
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,130
there will be a chance to negotiate your severance package.

961
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,490
I'll do my best when that time comes.

962
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,470
Ball!

963
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,410
Hey!

964
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,460
Come here.

965
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:31,410
- Pardon? 
 - Is this course layout correct?

966
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,100
Are you sure there isn't a design flaw?

967
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:37,420
I think you just misplayed your shot, CEO...

968
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,980
- What did you say? 
 - Oh, what's that?

969
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,880
Our course was designed by BA Golf Design,

970
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,160
and was selected as Korea's Best Course in 2019.

971
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,950
Our customers are quite satisfied with it as well.

972
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:56,650
Still, shouldn't the green be over there?

973
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,460
CEO, courses must be at least 20 meters apart

974
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,500
because of safety concerns.

975
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,800
So if we did as you said, CEO,

976
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,040
it would be illegal.

977
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,520
Okay.

978
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,630
Thirty-eight...

979
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,550
See?

980
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,380
There are only 38.

981
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:42,680
It's written here that there are 52.

982
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,400
Were you trying to intentionally deceive me?

983
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,240
No, CEO.

984
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,630
Some are currently making the rounds.

985
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,320
Then

986
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,200
how many are out there?

987
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,490
There are 14 on the course.

988
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,040
Another cart is coming in over there.

989
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,000
Now, there are 13 out on the course.

990
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Please watch out for the cart.

991
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,620
A cart is coming in.

992
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,490
Should I go outside and count?

993
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,330
There's no need for that.

994
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,430
If you look here,

995
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,020
you can check it through the system.

996
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,920
Forget it.

997
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,930
The carts are so worn out.

998
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,200
Yes, that part is already factored into the depreciation.

999
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,690
Whoa...

1000
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,400
you guys all work very hard.

1001
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,430
You should learn a thing or two.

1002
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,870
Here.

1003
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:00,080
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1004
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,250
I hated it so much.

1005
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,390
Still, I think we completed it well.

1006
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,960
Buddy, what do you mean, completed?

1007
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,020
We should go to our office and work.

1008
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,660
Let's go.

1009
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,480
- Yes, we should. 
 - Let's go.

1010
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,800
Ms. Kwak, to your right.

1011
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,620
I never imagined the buyer would be

1012
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,370
CEO Lee Hun Min.

1013
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,640
He was scouted by a foreign fund.

1014
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,840
And there's not much info

1015
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,900
on the fund since it's a small company.

1016
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,370
Wow...

1017
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,120
And Seong Il hid that

1018
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,200
and asked me to introduce you to him.

1019
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,750
Well, I'm not really interested in that.

1020
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,550
Confirm for me if they really want to buy it,

1021
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,490
whether they really intend to run a golf business,

1022
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,900
and if employee retention is guaranteed.

1023
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,090
Yes, I'll look into that.

1024
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:27,540
I'm sorry, Mr. Yun.

1025
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,280
I really didn't know.

1026
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,910
I know.

1027
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,450
- You should go home. 
 - Okay.

1028
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,910
Yes, Ms. Kwak.

1029
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,070
 Mr. Yun, you should come to the office right now. 

1030
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,730
Is there a problem?

1031
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:57,290
 The numbers don't add up. 

1032
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,700
Go on.

1033
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,150
What's going on?

1034
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,870
Two days ago, 100 million was withdrawn but there's no record of how it was used.

1035
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,230
In cash?

1036
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,810
Yes.

1037
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,500
CEO Lee has the bank transaction authority, right?

1038
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,430
Yes, and there is one more person...

1039
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,200
 Have a good day. 

1040
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,790
 Customer 118. 

1041
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,560
- Welcome. How can I assist you? 
 - Hello.

1042
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,940
I want to make a withdrawal.

1043
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,990
How much?

1044
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,880
The full balance.

1045
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:51,950
- Jeong Bon Ju? 
 - Yes.

1046
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:55,640
You want to withdraw all this in cash?

1047
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,200
Yes.

1048
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,150
   

1049
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:46,130
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 🐺 Wolf in a Suit 👔 Team @ Viki 

1050
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,170
♫  The sights that go unseen  ♫

1051
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,570
♫  The songs that go unsung  ♫

1052
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,430
♫  The tension gets a hold of you  ♫

1053
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,850
♫  And then you come undone  ♫

1054
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:05,680
♫  The pounding of your heart as it beats inside your chest  ♫

1055
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,800
 Selling Greenview golf course is our top priority. 

1056
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,760
 I got hurt because the cart tipped over. 

1057
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,520
 I don't have it. I spent it all. 

1058
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,110
 Will the price drop a lot with embezzlement? 

1059
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:18,360
 How many years will it be for 1 billion won? 

1060
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,980
 It's an absolute mess. 

1061
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,240
 You must be going somewhere. 

1062
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,270
 Are you suspecting me? 

1063
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,080
 I heard Yun Ju No was doing fine. 

1064
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:31,020
 If you entrust me with it, I'll grow it well. 

1065
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,430
 You managed it separately. 

1066
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:34,320
 That's embezzlement. 

1067
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,230
 How can I work with embezzlers? 

1068
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:39,210
 He requested all the employees 

1069
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,470
 of the golf course to be let go.
