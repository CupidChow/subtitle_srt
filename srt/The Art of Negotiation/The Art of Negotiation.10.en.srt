What happened?

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,879
There was a withdrawal of 100,000 dollars 2 days ago.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,190
But they weren't accounted for.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,520
- In cash? - Yes.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,830
Withdrawals must be approved by CEO Lee Hyeong Taek, right?

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,200
Yes. And there is one more person who can approve of it.

15
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,870
There could be a reason behind that.

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,680
Or it could be a mistake.

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,650
We don't even know who made the withdrawal yet.

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,210
Bon Joo!

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,380
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,310
You took a day off. You didn't go away or something?

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,020
No. Did you come out for lunch?

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,220
Yes. I'm sick of eating in the cafeteria.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,090
Okay. See you tomorrow.

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,660
Okay.

25
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,760
Bye. Watch out for the car.

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,880
I'll meet with Bon Joo first.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello.

28
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,799
Hello.

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,440
- I'm sorry to bother you. - Hello.

30
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,570
Is Ms. Jeong Bon Joo here?

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,140
Bon Joo?

32
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,240
She took a day off today.

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,610
But I ran into her at the bank.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,620
At the bank? Which bank?

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,190
Sir.

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,770
Hello. What's this about?

37
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,500
You must be on your way out.

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,270
Yes. Why do you ask?

39
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,870
I need to talk to you.

40
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,110
Could you spare me a moment of your time?

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,810
I need to get going now.

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,650
What's this about?

43
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,319
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,380
- How much? - All of it.

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,620
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo?

46
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,090
Yes.

47
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,390
You want to withdraw everything in cash?

48
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,530
Yes.

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,860
Why? Is it not possible?

50
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,300
No. Hold on.

51
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
What?

52
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,280
Mr. Yoon. Don't you think you're being unreasonable now?

53
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,350
How could you after conducting due diligence?

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,520
You know how hard I worked for GREEN VIEW Country Club.

55
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,790
Are you suspecting me?

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,260
I understand your frustration.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,290
But you're authorized to make withdrawals.

58
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,730
So how much are we missing?

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,970
We're missing 100,000 dollars.

60
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,270
What?

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,140
Did you say 100,000 dollars?

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,440
If...

65
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,479
embezzlement is confirmed,

66
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,210
we must notify the Audit Team first.

67
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,980
After the Audit Team investigates this matter,

68
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,080
they will decide whether or not they will file criminal charges.

69
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,450
Let's find Ms. Jeong Bon Joo first.

70
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,990
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

71
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,089
If you're saying so for my sake...

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,230
Selling GREEN VIEW Country Club is our top priority.

73
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,560
To do that, it's more important to find the missing 100,000 dollars.

74
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,700
What if we find her and get the money back?

75
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,400
Can it go away as if it never happened?

76
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,010
It can't go away...

77
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,110
that easily.

78
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
I see.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,650
Then I'll come back after I meet up with some friends.

80
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,830
You know, don't you?

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,730
That's what everyone is talking about.

82
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,830
Everyone is utterly shocked.

83
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,839
We must find Bon Joo quickly, so she can return the money.

84
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,610
Or this could be really bad for her.

85
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,410
Will she go to prison?

86
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,479
The punishment for embezzlement is getting harsher.

87
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,580
So that's a possibility.

88
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,090
But we really don't know anything.

89
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,019
You know what she is like.

90
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,690
Bon Joo isn't the type to discuss this openly.

91
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,330
Jung Hwa.

92
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,130
You don't know anything?

93
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
No.

94
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,350
If we find her quickly, I can help her.

95
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,150
Give me a call.

96
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,150
I'll call you the moment I get any news about her.

97
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,220
Okay.

98
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,690
Bye.

99
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,560
- Don't skip your meal. - Okay.

100
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,520
Hey, Jung Hwa.

101
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,290
Are you on your way to Seoul now?

102
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,430
No, I'm at the terminal now.

103
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,100
I just wanted to wish you a safe trip.

104
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,300
By the way,

105
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,840
would you be interested in seeing Moon Jin?

106
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,540
Moon Jin? Why?

107
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,840
You know,

108
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,510
Moon Jin is Bon Joo's closest friend.

109
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,850
She's taking a break now, right?

110
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Yes.

111
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,390
Is she staying at home?

112
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,220
She's probably in the hospital now.

113
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,920
Moon Jin.

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Soon Young?

115
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,970
I hope your arm is recovering well.

116
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes.

117
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,610
I'll be fine once I have one more surgery tomorrow.

118
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,640
How did you get injured?

119
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,240
At work.

120
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,680
Bon Joo told me that you were working as a caddie.

121
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,250
Bon Joo? Did you see Bon Joo?

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,520
Yes.

123
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,050
We grabbed drinks together. It had been a while.

124
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,860
Gosh, it brought back old memories.

125
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,660
I bet it did for you.

126
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,960
- You've been away for some time. - Right.

127
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,630
- Oh, yes. When did you see Bon Joo? - Yesterday.

128
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,329
- Yesterday? - Yes.

129
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,970
- I see. - She visits me often.

130
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,670
It might be because she feels bad.

131
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,370
It's not like I got injured because of her.

132
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,580
My arm was injured because the cart tipped over.

133
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,050
- The golf cart? - Yes.

134
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,120
But our customers were also in the cart when it tipped over.

135
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,890
Other customers were badly injured too.

136
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
How bad were the injuries?

137
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,030
Well,

138
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,630
they didn't have bone fractures like I did.

139
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
But there was a severe injury to the face.

140
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,040
They even filed a lawsuit against me.

141
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Really?

142
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,410
Were you able to settle?

143
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,610
Yes. They said they would be lenient.

144
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
I see.

145
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,880
Bon Joo took care of it.

146
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,920
She's the best.

147
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,620
Isn't she so cool?

148
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,790
Yes.

149
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,190
She was the one who suggested this position.

150
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,300
She said I could make good money if I was a good caddie.

151
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,929
I see.

152
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,270
- That's how you started it. - Yes.

153
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,300
At first, I turned it down...

154
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,539
because I'd get the job based on her recommendation.

155
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,810
But if I didn't do a good job, it would affect her reputation.

156
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,540
But she said she had already paid.

157
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,280
Pay for what?

158
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,049
To become a caddie, you need to go through training.

159
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,120
But before that, you must put down 300 dollars as a deposit.

160
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,650
She also paid for that.

161
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,320
But she still felt responsible for the accident.

162
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,129
By the way, Bon Joo went to the injured customer and begged.

163
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,840
The customer who demanded 100,000 dollars initially...

164
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,170
decided to just settle.

165
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,040
- Is that what she said? - Yes.

166
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,180
But I know that's a lie.

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,610
I doubt she begged them to settle.

168
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,110
She probably made a scene.

169
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,780
You know what Bon Joo is like.

170
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,950
I do.

171
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,409
It might seem Bon Joo is always confident...

172
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,980
and doesn't care about what people think.

173
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,109
But she's so sensitive...

174
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,080
when it comes to inconveniencing others.

175
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,820
She's generous about other people's flaws.

176
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,090
But she's so strict about her flaws.

177
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Hello.

178
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm Jeong Bon Joo from GREEN VIEW Country Club.

179
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,330
How can I get a meeting with the manager of M and A Team?

180
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,700
- What was your name again? - It's Jeong Bon Joo.

181
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,240
Yes.

182
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,410
Yes, thank you.

183
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,880
Ms. Jeong is in the lobby now.

184
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Hello.

185
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,730
You should go.

186
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,970
Well, the thing is...

187
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,870
- Moon Jin. - Yes?

188
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
The truth is...

189
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,520
- Hold on. - Okay.

190
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,090
- Jin Soo. - Attorney Oh.

191
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,490
Ms. Jeong is in our office now.

192
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,420
With the return of 100,000 dollars,

193
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,819
the company is considering...

194
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
ending the matter with your dismissal.

195
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,900
I don't have it. I spent it all.

196
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,110
You used that as settlement money, didn't you?

197
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,010
Yes.

198
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,980
Thanks to that, I was able to settle.

199
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,140
So...

200
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I'll just face the punishment.

201
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,690
Bon Joo.

202
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,290
Embezzling...

203
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,960
under 100,000 dollars can result in 4 to 16 months of imprisonment.

204
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,860
Embezzling between 100,000 dollars to 500,000 dollars...

205
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,830
can result in 1 year to 3 years of imprisonment.

206
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,900
Then I'll probably serve a year in prison.

207
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,170
So I earned 100,000 dollars in 1 year. That's not so bad.

208
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,710
Is this about Moon Jin?

209
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,380
Lawsuits are just unbearable.

210
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,550
I'd rather serve a year in prison.

211
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,760
("Golf Cart Tipped Over, Is Caddie Solely Responsible?")

212
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Then we'll handle it as embezzlement.

213
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
But I have a question.

214
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Sure.

215
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,880
If it's one million dollars, how many years would it be?

216
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,890
What?

217
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,090
Are you asking what your sentence would be...

218
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,330
if you embezzled one million dollars?

219
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,530
Yes.

220
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,160
Did you...

221
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,700
embezzle a million dollars?

222
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,770
No, not me.

223
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,660
What's going on?

224
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,460
Darn it.

225
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,310
(Passport)

226
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,060
What is this about?

227
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,860
Could you spare us a moment?

228
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,730
Well, I have to leave now...

229
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,260
for a business trip. Let's talk another time.

230
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,730
Are you going to the US?

231
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Yes.

232
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,610
To take over the flower delivery company.

233
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,680
Am I right?

234
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
My goodness.

235
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,190
Excuse us. May we ask you some questions?

236
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,970
Did you receive caddie training?

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Caddie training? Yes, we all completed the training.

238
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,240
You have to complete the training to work here.

239
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,470
We heard you had to pay for the training. Is it true?

240
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,140
Yes, a 300-dollar deposit.

241
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,810
Pardon? A deposit?

242
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,909
But why? Unless it was needed...

243
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,779
to issue banknotes or...

244
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,550
Why would caddies be required to pay a deposit?

245
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,350
We heard they had to pay a deposit.

246
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,860
The thing is,

247
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,760
do you know how often the caddies quit?

248
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,200
Ninety percent of them quit as soon as they complete their training.

249
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,739
Then what about us? We fed them...

250
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,070
and even trained them.

251
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,470
If they run away because they can't work as caddies...

252
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,040
The company has to take care of all the expenses.

253
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,150
That's why they're all required to pay a 300-dollar deposit.

254
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,780
They get it all back when they leave the company.

255
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,250
So?

256
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,990
Did they get their money back?

257
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,190
They say we'd get it all back, but...

258
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,859
How would you get it back when you're running away?

259
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
You'd sneak out in secret.

260
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,289
We at least received training, and they feed us too,

261
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,330
so we can call it even.

262
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,859
Hey, they won't give us the money back even if we ask for it.

263
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,570
I've never seen anyone who got their deposit back.

264
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,400
I heard you never had to pay such a deposit in the past.

265
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,110
Then when did it start?

266
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,240
It all began when that cheapskate joined the company.

267
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,580
Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

268
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,380
Doesn't that make him a bully, not a cheapskate?

269
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,350
A bully?

270
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,089
Then how did you pay the 300 dollars?

271
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,090
What do you mean, how?

272
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,390
Did you pay the company directly? Or was it deducted from your pay?

273
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,229
Oh, they tell you...

274
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,160
to bring 300 dollars in cash on the first day of your training.

275
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,200
That money is in our bank account.

276
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,500
I didn't see it in your asset list. It must be a secret bank account.

277
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,970
Well, we have to return the money to them anyway.

278
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,339
It'll only complicate our financial statements.

279
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,540
So you've been managing it separately.

280
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,980
That's considered embezzlement.

281
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,710
No.

282
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,120
The money is all there.

283
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,579
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo said...

284
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,490
she wanted to use the money to pay Ms. Park Moon Jin's settlement.

285
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,390
And she obtained the other caddies' consent to do so.

286
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,029
Hey, weren't we donating that money?

287
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,030
I signed that form.

288
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,830
Me too. Wasn't that what it was for?

289
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,800
You signed a consent form? Who asked you to do it?

290
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,000
Bon Joo suggested we use that money to help Moon Jin.

291
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,369
I see. So, you all signed the consent form?

292
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,370
We did.

293
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,479
We all know Moon Jin suffered unfairly.

294
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
But why? Is that money gone?

295
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,380
The money should still all be there.

296
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,380
Bon Joo felt bad for what Ms. Park had to go through.

297
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,090
She was injured herself,

298
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,860
but she had to pay the settlement money.

299
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,329
Bon Joo thought the company should take care of the settlement money.

300
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,399
So she asked you about it, but you declined.

301
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
The accident happened due to her own mistakes while driving the cart.

302
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,270
Why should the company take care of it?

303
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,109
The cart that tipped over was an old one,

304
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,410
so the company is partially responsible for the accident too.

305
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,840
Bon Joo had planned...

306
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,750
to take 100,000 dollars out of the account...

307
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,350
to help pay Moon Jin's settlement money.

308
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
However, she found out that the bank account was empty.

309
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,659
She confirmed that...

310
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,190
the entire balance was transferred on October 11.

311
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,260
The total amount was about one million dollars.

312
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,030
Isn't it the amount of the severance pay he asked for, Mr. Yoon?

313
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

314
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,770
We met at Seoul Station on October 11.

315
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,809
That day,

316
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,070
you asked for a million-dollar severance package,

317
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,310
but I suppose you didn't think you'd be able to get it.

318
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,350
Do you have evidence?

319
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,950
No, we do not.

320
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,720
All we have is circumstantial evidence.

321
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,350
The thing is,

322
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,620
for us to check the transaction details of the account,

323
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,859
we'd either have to take you to the police...

324
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,630
or hand the case over to the prosecutors right away.

325
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,130
What would you like to do?

326
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,810
I was going to use it...

327
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,410
and deposit it back into the account.

328
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,120
That's also embezzlement.

329
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,320
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,030
Bon Joo.

331
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,260
I don't think you did anything wrong.

332
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,170
No, what I did was wrong.

333
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,330
That cheapskate is in the wrong.

334
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,080
(Tofu Village)

335
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,809
Mr. Lee probably thought of the deposit when he found out...

336
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,420
that the country club would be sold, right?

337
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,079
He figured no one else knew about the money,

338
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,590
so I bet he thought, "I should take this money." Right?

339
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,959
Yes. Based on the date when the money was withdrawn,

340
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,490
I believe he made the decision during the due diligence process.

341
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,730
My gosh. I thought Mr. Lee...

342
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,900
worked really hard to save the country club.

343
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,540
Who knew he'd do something like this?

344
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,810
He did work hard, but in the wrong direction.

345
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,840
He just tried to cut costs, which probably led to other problems.

346
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,450
He wouldn't even bother to fix broken golf carts.

347
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,050
A typical bean counter, I'd say.

348
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,390
"Bean counter?"

349
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,160
Yes. "Bean," as in a soybean.

350
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,330
A bean counter. A person who counts beans, literally speaking.

351
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,200
It's a mildly derogatory term for an accountant or financial officer.

352
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,760
They don't care about the quality of your product or service.

353
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,469
They're only concerned...

354
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,370
with improving your financial statements through cost-cutting.

355
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,410
But why count beans?

356
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Well, when you buy beans,

357
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,379
you should think about using them to make tofu.

358
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,119
Good tofu. But instead, they just keep...

359
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,350
counting the beans. One by one.

360
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,490
Hence the term, "bean counter."

361
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,089
What's wrong with beans?

362
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,730
Nothing, Mom.

363
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,730
Goodness. Beans are so important.

364
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,199
We only use locally grown soybeans to make our tofu.

365
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,269
I take out all the bad ones by hand, one by one.

366
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,440
We handpick only the good beans to make our tofu.

367
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,240
All right. Applause, please.

368
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,509
Thank you. This looks delicious.

369
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,880
All right, enjoy.

370
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,580
- Thank you. - All right.

371
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
- We can eat now, right? - Yes, let's eat.

372
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,990
Dig in!

373
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,020
You had each caddie pay 300 dollars for 4 and a half years.

374
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,030
That roughly amounts to...

375
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,760
one million dollars.

376
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,660
Goodness. That's a lot of money.

377
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,830
But...

378
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,300
you kept the money in a separate account, not your corporate account?

379
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,469
It was only because I knew we had to return the money...

380
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,710
You've said that several times already.

381
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,210
So, the total amount you embezzled is one million. Am I right?

382
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,320
No, that is not true.

383
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
What is not true?

384
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,190
It wasn't one million dollars?

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,890
I didn't embezzle anything.

386
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,330
Keep this up, and we'll have to hand this over to the police.

387
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,970
Will you still deny it?

388
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,540
Please contact my lawyer.

389
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,240
Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek.

390
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,380
This is Internal Affairs. You aren't at a police station now.

391
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,580
Call your lawyer yourself.

392
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
(Director's Office)

393
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:50,910
Yes.

394
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,450
Mr. Yoon?

395
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,860
You're here. My gosh.

396
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,490
Take a seat. Let's sit down.

397
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,870
I have a favor to ask.

398
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,670
See? I said you'd have questions once you joined the board.

399
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,339
We're trying to sell GREEN VIEW Country Club at the moment.

400
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,480
Yes, I know.

401
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,210
Chairman Song told you to sell it.

402
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,610
Yes.

403
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,380
But during the due diligence process,

404
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,590
we learned that some people in the company committed embezzlement.

405
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,320
I see. And?

406
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,519
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek embezzled one million dollars,

407
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,630
and Manager Jeong Bon Joo embezzled 100,000 dollars.

408
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,330
What a hot mess.

409
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
They had...

410
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,530
a situation though.

411
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,570
You can call your lawyer once you're at the police station.

412
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,539
Hand him over to the police.

413
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Yes, sir.

414
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,910
I told you. I never embezzled anything.

415
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,450
Sir, the attorney would like to see you.

416
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,850
- Attorney? - Yes, from the M and A Team.

417
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,930
(Interview Room 2)

418
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Here's a statement regarding Ms. Jeong Bon Joo.

419
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
(Statement)

420
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,870
This was written by Mr. Yoon Joo No and Attorney Oh Soon Young?

421
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,440
Yes. And it was approved...

422
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,910
by Mr. Cho Beom Soo, the HR director.

423
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,850
I see. But why would the M and A Team do this?

424
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,950
It happened while pursuing an M and A deal.

425
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,350
Right, I see.

426
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,050
Then...

427
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,959
we're letting her go, right?

428
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes.

429
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,960
All right.

430
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,030
Oh, wait.

431
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,800
What about Mr. Lee Hyeong Taek?

432
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,200
He should be arrested.

433
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,299
And we'll make him cough up the one million dollars.

434
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,700
We'll get that money back...

435
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,110
and use 100,000 dollars from it as settlement money.

436
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,140
But he keeps denying it altogether.

437
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,550
How's Joo No? Is he doing a good job?

438
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,020
I'm sure he is doing a good job. He'd better.

439
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,420
"He'd better?" Why? Are you worried about something?

440
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,690
I think Director Ha got his feelings hurt.

441
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,460
Oh, come on. Director Ha couldn't be happier.

442
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,570
Hey, play the song I like.

443
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Yes, sir.

444
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,110
You can do e-commerce...

445
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,450
while Director Ha does what he needs to do.

446
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,720
Then things will get even better for Sanin, you know?

447
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,560
- Let's sit and enjoy the music. - Okay.

448
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Sit.

449
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,320
(Yoon Joo No)

450
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,390
Oh, my. I wasn't expecting your call, Mr. Yoon.

451
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,830
What's this about?

452
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,200
Sure, let's do that.

453
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,260
Yoon Joo No, this fool.

454
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,760
He wants to buy me a drink.

455
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,659
I guess something happened between you and Mr. Yoon.

456
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,660
Something happened?

457
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,030
Like what?

458
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,630
It's just that...

459
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,400
I was the CEO of Sanin Construction,

460
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,269
so I know his face.

461
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,910
He was the one who sold Sanin Construction.

462
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,810
Don't you hold a grudge against him?

463
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,650
I am not a fan of his.

464
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,350
Anyway,

465
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,720
what did you want to talk to me about?

466
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,990
Oh, well...

467
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,729
If you happen to know whether or not the deal will go through,

468
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,760
I'd appreciate a heads-up.

469
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,899
For me, I don't have to have this deal go through.

470
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,970
What matters more...

471
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,570
is building trust between us.

472
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,170
I see. In other words,

473
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,480
you're worried I might back out after giving Yoon Joo No...

474
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
the runaround?

475
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,620
Director Choi.

476
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,850
How much did you get as your retainer for this?

477
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,059
Pardon?

478
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,790
Do you think I'd spend that much money just to discipline a mutt?

479
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,100
- Don't walk me out. Do your work. - Yes, sir.

480
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Get back safely, sir.

481
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,480
Will the price drop significantly if the embezzlement is confirmed?

482
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
The total amount embezzled...

483
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,619
will be taken into consideration when assessing the value,

484
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,490
but the company's ethics will be put into question.

485
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,430
My gosh. Lee Hun Min will use it to bring the price down like crazy.

486
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,100
He'll sue the employees involved in the embezzlement.

487
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,000
That's why Mr. Yoon went to meet with him, right?

488
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,880
Oh, my. Mr. Yoon, I'm surprised you called me first.

489
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,650
I've been here. The food here is very good.

490
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,890
I thought I should come here when and if someone offered to treat me.

491
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,830
This is on you, right?

492
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,590
Of course. Please enjoy.

493
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,500
I wanted to meet with you to ask for your understanding.

494
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,170
While conducting due diligence,

495
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,510
we found out some GREEN VIEW employees committed embezzlement.

496
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,350
How much?

497
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,279
The CEO embezzled a million dollars.

498
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,849
The financial manager, 100,000 dollars.

499
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,980
So, it's 1.1 million in total.

500
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,060
That's not a lot of money.

501
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,160
I trust you'll take care of it.

502
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,200
Yes, thank you for understanding.

503
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,499
We'll get the money back.

504
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,440
All involved employees will face disciplinary dismissal.

505
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,080
You're good at your job...

506
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,650
but quite slow-witted.

507
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,880
Do you mind elaborating on that?

508
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,090
I can't possibly work with those who have pocketed funds.

509
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,130
Everyone must be dismissed.

510
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,230
Are you implying a layoff?

511
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,740
Yes. Of every one of them.

512
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,190
Did something happen?

513
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,600
CEO Lee Hun Min wants all golf club employees...

514
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,970
to be dismissed.

515
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,570
I did think this so-called test was too easy.

516
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,480
(Chairman Song Jae Sik)

517
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,890
Yes?

518
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,660
Chairman Song. Director Ha and Mr. Lee are here.

519
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
Right. Let them inside.

520
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,770
Gosh.

521
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,100
Take a seat.

522
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,380
What the chairman wants to know...

523
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,250
isn't whether the golf club can be sold.

524
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,550
It's your loyalty.

525
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,390
With laying off everyone?

526
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Correct.

527
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,320
He wants to see...

528
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,930
if you can dismiss the employees for his sake.

529
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,730
So...

530
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,230
Do you think you can handle it?

531
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,540
Yes. Leave it to me,

532
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,440
and I'll develop it well for five years.

533
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,380
I love his straightforward answer.

534
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Good.

535
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:18,049
He doesn't hesitate when it comes to building apartments either.

536
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,050
I see.

537
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,750
And...

538
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,290
How was the land?

539
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,790
It was great, Chairman Song.

540
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,190
Since the intersection is close by,

541
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,260
it has good transportation.

542
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,960
And the new town is next to it.

543
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,600
As expected, you have a good eye.

544
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,940
I was surprised myself when I visited the place.

545
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Right?

546
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,810
Well, whatever.

547
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,010
Let's go hiking together.

548
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,850
We can talk on our way up.

549
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,220
How about it?

550
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,220
Sure, I'm in.

551
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,560
Even so, I think Chairman Song has a hidden purpose...

552
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,830
in selecting Mr. Lee as the buyer.

553
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,660
What do you mean by that?

554
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,830
Chairman Song...

555
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,370
must want to build apartments again.

556
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,140
Mr. Lee is willing to take over GREEN VIEW...

557
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,750
but demands the dismissal of all employees.

558
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,120
So apartments will go up on the golf course land.

559
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Yes.

560
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,460
That must be why...

561
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,090
Chairman Song asked for Mr. Lee.

562
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,330
Chairman Song did regret...

563
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,240
selling Sanin Construction.

564
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,969
He must believe that...

565
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,310
the business will grow in no time if he starts again.

566
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,950
What do you think?

567
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,450
Even if there's potential in construction,

568
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,650
Sanin can't jump into that business.

569
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,050
When selling Sanin Construction,

570
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,620
the promise was not to run the same business.

571
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,590
The term may last for five years,

572
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,300
but the implicit rule is that the promise lasts forever.

573
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,140
Despite it all, if Sanin starts a construction business again,

574
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,270
Sanin will be breaking the law.

575
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,740
Even if it's done secretly, the market will eventually find out.

576
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,290
- I'll be leaving, Director Ha. - Okay. Great work.

577
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,270
In other words,

578
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,600
Director Ha's job...

579
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,240
is to keep it a low profile.

580
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,140
And Director Ha must be using Lee Hun Min.

581
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,110
Oh, my.

582
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,750
I'm making a comeback.

583
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,950
Warn those who were happy to see me leave that they'll be sorry.

584
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,460
Say that you ask Chairman Song.

585
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,890
If he denies it,

586
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,630
you can't keep questioning him.

587
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,340
There's no way to stop it, is there?

588
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,240
We can't stop it.

589
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,180
This deal...

590
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,650
will decide whether you become a director or not.

591
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,260
But isn't your future relationship with the chairman more important?

592
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,100
So,

593
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,370
how about following the chairman's plan this time?

594
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm saying this because I get the feeling...

595
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,180
that becoming a director isn't solely about the position.

596
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Mr. Yoon.

597
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,030
Good morning, Director Cho.

598
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,270
I approved what the M and A Team requested.

599
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,740
It must be about Ms. Jeong Bon Joo.

600
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,810
- Thank you. - No problem.

601
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,310
Ask away if you need help again.

602
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay. Thank you for your trouble.

603
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,280
Is that all?

604
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,120
CEO Lee Hun Min stopped by the headquarters.

605
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
Right.

606
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,060
He's the one buying GREEN VIEW Country Club.

607
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,470
I see.

608
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,680
And so? Is he buying it?

609
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,080
Mr. Lee is demanding a full layoff...

610
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,410
as a condition of the acquisition.

611
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,660
Shall we talk in my office for a minute?

612
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,500
Unbelievable.

613
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,110
Laying off employees is not that tough.

614
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,240
What's more, corruption is involved.

615
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,910
Yes.

616
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,440
The two concerned employees will soon be dismissed.

617
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,680
No. That's not everything.

618
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,180
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek...

619
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,090
has an accomplice in the Game Department.

620
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,320
- An accomplice? - Yes.

621
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,990
What does the Game Department do?

622
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,890
You made the inspection, so you'll know well.

623
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,229
It oversees all support to ensure clients have...

624
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,130
a smooth golfing round.

625
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,970
That same department manages the caddies.

626
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,310
And the claim is that the deposit was embezzled there too.

627
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,610
Correct. That was what I heard.

628
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,950
It's not entirely unreasonable...

629
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,519
because if the company is being sold...

630
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,220
and the CEO pockets one million dollars,

631
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,790
the employees would feel anxious.

632
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,260
And they're the only ones who know about the deposit.

633
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,800
Do you also believe there might be an accomplice?

634
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,730
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

635
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,040
- There's a possibility. - Good.

636
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,570
Lay off some employees,

637
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,909
send the rest to training,

638
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,010
and give out packages. It won't take long.

639
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,910
Especially with the small number of employees.

640
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,920
What? Do you want HR to do it?

641
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,790
No.

642
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,890
The M and A Team will do it.

643
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,970
Things are looking good for you.

644
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,570
- Good morning. - Good morning.

645
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
Good morning.

646
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,910
Let's have a short meeting.

647
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,950
All right.

648
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,920
CEO Lee Hun Min is demanding a full layoff.

649
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,190
Are you going to do it?

650
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,960
Isn't that breaking the promise?

651
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,189
As Mr. Lee didn't guarantee...

652
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,959
employee succession by contract,

653
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,300
he can make such demands.

654
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,230
What's more, he can use...

655
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,530
the employee fraud within GREEN VIEW as the excuse.

656
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,800
Even so, laying off employees unrelated to the embezzlement...

657
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,310
won't be easy.

658
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,479
CEO Lee Hyeong Taek claimed that the Game Department...

659
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,850
had already embezzled quite a large sum of money.

660
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,050
Could that be true?

661
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,790
We should confirm it.

662
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,320
Mr. Han Gil Su from the Game Department?

663
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
That's me.

664
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,460
Why did you want to see me?

665
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,860
You know that CEO Lee Hyeong Taek embezzled money, yes?

666
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,730
I do.

667
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,970
But he argues that...

668
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,109
it wasn't his doing...

669
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,910
but the doing of someone in the Game Department.

670
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,610
That's why you're here, Ms. Oh Jeong Min.

671
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,120
I swear...

672
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,180
it wasn't me.

673
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,390
You're saying I also pocketed the money?

674
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,389
He didn't pinpoint you.

675
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,090
He said it was a Game Department employee.

676
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,070
Ms. Oh Jeong Min is also being interviewed next door.

677
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,030
Yes.

678
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,610
Either way, it wasn't me.

679
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,910
If it wasn't you, was it Mr. Han Gil Su?

680
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,980
I checked the bank statement.

681
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,450
Money has been gradually withdrawn for a while now.

682
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,990
Oh, that? I returned it to the caddie.

683
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,290
I see.

684
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,229
Ms. Jeong Bon Joo contacted everyone,

685
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,760
including caddies and former employees.

686
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,860
You know Park Moon Jin, right?

687
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,530
It's to use for the settlement money.

688
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,670
So what?

689
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:43,269
If a 300 dollar refund was issued,

690
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,070
was there a signed agreement for its use in the settlement?

691
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,510
The caddies could be lying,

692
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,780
saying they didn't receive it when they did.

693
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,079
True.

694
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,520
But if the story doesn't match with the next room's...

695
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,450
We didn't use much.

696
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,490
Three hundred dollars each.

697
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,460
It was used for team dinners and such.

698
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,200
But...

699
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,030
Mr. Han suggested we use it.

700
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,770
So you admit to using the money, yes?

701
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,240
Is Ms. Oh Jeong Min...

702
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,040
blaming me?

703
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,550
Well, you're her superior.

704
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,380
Darn it.

705
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,850
She knew about it all.

706
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,850
Didn't we use it together?

707
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,190
Seriously!

708
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,730
But it was the CEO who embezzled one million dollars, yes?

709
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,030
Yes, correct.

710
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,170
Darn it.

711
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,550
Hey.

712
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,990
I heard you were swamped these days.

713
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,260
Now that I've experienced it, HR is no joke either.

714
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,890
Of course not.

715
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,870
Layoffs are the most difficult task of HR.

716
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,470
Especially a full layoff.

717
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,279
Our director was on cloud nine...

718
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,680
when your team manager took that task.

719
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,450
Thanks to Mr. Yoon, he's at ease.

720
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,390
- I'm leaving. - What? Why...

721
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,230
Dismiss both of them.

722
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:53,970
Understood.

723
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,340
But this doesn't feel right at all.

724
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,240
What doesn't?

725
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,180
Laying off everyone because of this is wrong, isn't it?

726
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,250
Who's laying off everyone?

727
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,590
Was that what you thought we were doing?

728
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,090
Weren't we laying off everyone?

729
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,060
We can't dismiss innocent employees.

730
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,360
But others must think it's a full layoff.

731
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,670
Especially the HR Team.

732
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,700
I see.

733
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,340
I've already taken action.

734
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,310
The M and A Team is working overtime every day.

735
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,679
As you know, layoffs are a challenging task.

736
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,750
(Cho Beom Soo)

737
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,420
Yoon Joo No will climb up high.

738
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,730
He won't stop at the director.

739
00:49:58,830 --> 00:49:59,840
By the way,

740
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,439
CEO Lee Hun Min won't be able to run the golf club...

741
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,209
if all employees are dismissed.

742
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,310
So why is he making such a tall order?

743
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,620
You see...

744
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,590
Chairman Song seems to want to start a construction company again.

745
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,760
But that's impossible.

746
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,619
There's a five-year non-compete clause.

747
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,560
Exactly. That's why I suspect the chairman...

748
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,960
is using Lee Hun Min to grow the business and then acquire it.

749
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,940
CEO Lee Hun Min is demanding layoffs because...

750
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,670
The plan might be to build apartments on the golf course land.

751
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,280
What will you do?

752
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,319
Shouldn't we advise the chairman against this idea?

753
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,319
He's not openly stepping back into the field...

754
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,790
nor do we have definitive proof,

755
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,090
so who are we to go up to him and advise him against anything?

756
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,390
What do we do, then?

757
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,400
We seem to be out of options...

758
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,370
which is why...

759
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,500
we need someone who has power over the chairman.

760
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,910
Does such a person exist?

761
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,220
It's been a while, Mr. Yoon.

762
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,390
Right. It has been a while.

763
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,460
Are you still at Sanin?

764
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,160
My offer still stands.

765
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,070
For now,

766
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,500
I still have a job there, thanks to you.

767
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,870
I'm not saying that just to be polite.

768
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,779
Because you took over Sanin Construction...

769
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,210
at a decent price,

770
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,920
Sanin was able to avert a crisis.

771
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,580
Thank you.

772
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,419
Do you know how much grief I received...

773
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,960
for acquiring it at a price that high?

774
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,060
I should've demanded a discount.

775
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,630
I believe the price was reasonable.

776
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,870
However,

777
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,940
for selling it at that price,

778
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,739
Sanin added a clause...

779
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,940
stating that it wouldn't work in the same line of business.

780
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,379
For that price? Absolutely.

781
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,750
It'd be wrong to show up as a competitor.

782
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,380
Exactly. Hence this meeting.

783
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,190
I see. Why is that?

784
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,960
Is the chairman planning something in secret?

785
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,629
I can't be sure,

786
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,030
but I believe it to be a possibility.

787
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
But...

788
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,470
why are you telling me this?

789
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,410
Aren't you one of Sanin's people?

790
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,850
You bought Sanin Construction at a generous price.

791
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,380
I believe it is also my job to see that you remain satisfied.

792
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,420
The generous price includes after-sales service?

793
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,060
For purchasing it at its full price, of course.

794
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,170
So...

795
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,230
What can I do about it?

796
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,010
Do you like to go hiking?

797
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,540
- This is nice weather we have. - Right.

798
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,380
Goodness. Chairman Song!

799
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,390
Goodness me.

800
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,559
- Ms. Ji. - Hello.

801
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,990
Are you on your way down from a hike?

802
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,560
The company's building a new apartment complex,

803
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,600
and I wanted to receive some good energy.

804
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:50,970
I see.

805
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,670
CEO Lee?

806
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,240
That's right.

807
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,540
I see. What's going on?

808
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,580
What do you mean?

809
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,679
It's odd that you're all here together.

810
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,149
Those of us who like to hike...

811
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,019
got together to...

812
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,449
Yes, of course. And here I thought...

813
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,390
you were planning something behind my back.

814
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,590
Allow me to introduce you to my company's lawyer and advisor.

815
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,460
The name's Choi Yong Seok.

816
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,159
Chairman Song Jae Sik of Sanin. I heard a lot about you.

817
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,030
- Goodness. - What a pleasure.

818
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,370
I'm Senior Managing Director Ha Tae Soo.

819
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,570
I'm Lee Hun Min.

820
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,940
May I ask what it is you do?

821
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,350
I'm between jobs at the moment.

822
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,620
You must be a lawyer.

823
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,720
I passed the 27th bar exam. What about you?

824
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,019
The 38th, sir.

825
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,360
I see you passed it before Soon Young did.

826
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,829
Ms. Ji, we'll get going, then.

827
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,400
Yes, of course.

828
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,200
- I'll see you around, sir. - Sure.

829
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,110
Was I wrong to say that?

830
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,920
If we meet again, it won't be for something good.

831
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,220
Shall we?

832
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,270
Scrap it.

833
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:37,970
Sorry?

834
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,280
Call my driver. I'm leaving.

835
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,680
What...

836
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
- Did you run into the chairman? - Yes.

837
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,660
Mount Bukhan has quite the view.

838
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,830
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

839
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,510
By the way,

840
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,950
wouldn't the chairman know?

841
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,720
That Mr. Yoon sent her there?

842
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,490
Yes. That Mr. Yoon...

843
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,060
is a tattletale.

844
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,790
Come on.

845
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,060
No way.

846
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,669
He can't be sure that I told her,

847
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,800
so would he ask me?

848
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,310
I guess it could've been me.

849
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,039
Sir, the project is too good...

850
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,280
to scrap altogether.

851
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,420
Since you got the wheels moving, maybe you should keep it rolling.

852
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,789
That woman is wealthy, isn't she?

853
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,820
Sorry?

854
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,730
Do you mean CEO Ji Yeon U?

855
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,899
Yes, the company has a lot of capital.

856
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,130
Exactly.

857
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,869
Even her lawyer seems to be...

858
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,370
on an expensive retainer.

859
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,710
What if...

860
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,380
she sues us for breach of contract once we get into constructions...

861
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,780
and tries to rob me of my money? What then?

862
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,250
Come in.

863
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,520
- Sir, it's Mr. Yoon Joo No. - Right. Let him in.

864
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,730
Sure.

865
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,900
I'm here to brief you on the sale of GREEN VIEW Country Club.

866
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:50,970
Go ahead.

867
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,509
During the process,

868
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,110
my team discovered instances of embezzlement.

869
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,280
All those involved had their employment terminated.

870
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,350
However, the acquirer, CEO Lee Hun Min...

871
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,120
CEO Lee Hun Min is the acquirer, sir.

872
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,920
He recently began working at a fund...

873
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,030
and has been negotiating this deal as the acquirer.

874
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,599
CEO Lee requested that all of GREEN VIEW's employees...

875
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,000
be dismissed.

876
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,670
In order to proceed with this deal,

877
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,810
we must dismiss all the remaining employees.

878
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,639
That should be handled by yourself.

879
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,180
There's no need to brief the chairman on it.

880
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,620
I only did so since the chairman cares dearly for his employees.

881
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,450
However, selling GREEN VIEW CC is also just as important,

882
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,120
which is why I wanted his opinion.

883
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,100
Scrap it.

884
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,370
Yes, sir. I appreciate the wise decision, sir.

885
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,800
I'll excuse myself, then.

886
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,310
By the way...

887
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,350
- Yes? - You...

888
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,390
You're not cut out to be a board member.

889
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,090
You're dismissed.

890
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,060
Yes, sir.

891
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,750
You know, I was taken aback...

892
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,120
when I heard Bon Joo had embezzled.

893
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,190
Embezzlement like we hear on the news? That's what she did?

894
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,190
Well,

895
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,559
I was going to ask all the caddies for permission...

896
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,529
and spend the money accordingly,

897
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,969
but Lee Hyeong Taek stole the money away.

898
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,999
Still. Didn't you think you'd get caught?

899
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,500
Of course she knew she'd get caught.

900
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,410
Why else would she have wired it to her personal account?

901
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,640
She immediately turned herself in too.

902
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,909
You should've reported the boss, then.

903
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,980
How could you have taken the money yourself?

904
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,519
Then we wouldn't have been able to settle in time.

905
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,580
Unbelievable.

906
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,650
Lee Hyeong Taek, that piece of trash.

907
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,149
Do you know what he did...

908
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,920
to cut costs at the country club?

909
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,229
But now it turns out he took it all for himself.

910
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,290
What a jerk.

911
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,630
He really is a piece of trash.

912
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,499
Did Lee Hyeong Taek give back the million dollars?

913
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,230
Yes. The settlement was handled with that money.

914
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,670
Thanks, Soon Young.

915
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,310
What? What are you thanking me for?

916
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,140
Well,

917
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,910
I'm just glad you're our friend.

918
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,080
It was nice to see you after all this time.

919
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,590
- Sure. - Here you go.

920
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,889
- Have your fill. - Thank you, ma'am.

921
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,160
- Thank you. - Applaud.

922
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,960
You're the best, ma'am.

923
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,370
By the way,

924
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,039
it feels weird to have tofu after getting caught for embezzling.

925
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,270
Take that.

926
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,410
- Get chewing. - Keep chewing.

927

- Chew before you swallow. - It's good.

928
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,880
Cheers.

929
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,510
You didn't become a board member.

930
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,210
Yes, I'm afraid so.

931
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,310
Joo No.

932
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,480
We're running out of time.

933
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,550
Let's give up.

934

No. Begin as planned.

Sir.

939
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,840
You should take a look at this.

Anyway, we still have a little over two billion dollars to go.

945
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,970
It's 2.5 billion dollars.

946
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,470
Right.

947
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,410
He'll sell this time, right? Or will he acquire?

948
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,810
Can't Mr. Yoon get the money from somewhere?

949

What on earth are you doing?

953
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,960
- What is this? Stop this instant. - Wait.

975
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,429
you're constantly tempted.

976
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,999
Are you suspecting me?

977
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Mr. Yoon, this isn't true, is it?

978
