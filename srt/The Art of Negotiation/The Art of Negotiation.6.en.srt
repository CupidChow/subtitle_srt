00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,300
Hello.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
Gosh, hello.

11
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,240
- Shall we? - Sure.

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,550
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,450
Don't apologize. It's part of the job.

14
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,420
You got one over on me.

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,430
I guess I did.

16
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,770
Do you want to switch seats?

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,870
- Cigarette smoke's coming your way. - I'm fine.

18
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,540
- You're sweet. - Goodness.

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,280
Anyway, how did you learn Korean?

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,380
At Yonsei University.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,049
In Sinchon? At the language institute?

22
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,090
Yes.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,750
- I went to Yonsei University too. - Really?

24
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,619
I was there in 2015.

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,790
In 2015, I was a freshman.

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,629
I drank a lot in Sinchon back then.

27
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,460
I hung out a lot in Sinchon too.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,340
We may have crossed paths.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,370
We could have.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,780
Back then, I thought I'd be set once I got a job.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
Right.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Those were the good times for me as well.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,260
Will it get better once we're no longer the newbies?

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,830
Beats me.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm the newbie on my team too.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,970
Come on.

37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,599
We may both be newbies,

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,940
but where we stand couldn't be more different.

39
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,240
I was outsmarted by you, remember?

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,910
You were probably praised while I got chewed out.

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,380
On top of that, I'm hungry.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Shizuoka is famous for its fishcakes.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,690
Would you like to...

44
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,730
Shall we?

45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,400
Can I ask you one thing?

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,070
Sure.

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,080
What do you want to know?

48
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,050
This way.

49
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,120
SHIMIZ has no intention of dealing with us, does it?

50
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,090
This is all a facade, but we're not seeing it.

51
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,430
Well...

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,700
SHIMIZ is actually looking to move its head office.

53
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,800
Isn't the one in Shizuoka the head office?

54
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,340
It is,

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,580
but there are fewer number of people living in Shizuoka now.

56
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,610
That's why we're looking to move to Tokyo.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,550
Who'll move to Tokyo and who'll stay in Shizuoka...

58
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,720
will be decided this month.

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,760
Mr. Yoshida will stay behind...

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,990
due to lack of performance.

61
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,290
I see.

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,559
The same goes on in Korea...

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,830
with people only wishing to move to Seoul.

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,870
What can you do when Shizuoka is smaller than Tokyo?

65
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,640
What about you, Ms. Hirose? Are you moving to Tokyo?

66
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,850
Or are you staying in Shizuoka?

67
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,420
Only one from our team can move to Tokyo.

68
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,250
Mr. Ozaki will probably be chosen over me.

69
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,320
But you want to go to Tokyo, right?

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,330
Going to Tokyo will be better for my career but...

72
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,270
I must ask.

73
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,370
Can't Mr. Yoshida strike the deal with us...

74
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,540
and show that as his performance?

75
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,980
A deal with WIND...

76
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,350
won't be enough.

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,019
The money has to be received...

78
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,990
for it to be considered as one's performance.

79
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,360
But the down payment from the deal with WIND...

80
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,090
won't be enough.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,060
Is that why...

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,970
we're not being offered the discount?

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,200
At full price,

84
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,210
he could hit his quota.

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,940
But unless it's at a discount,

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,510
we have no reason to seal the deal.

87
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,720
It's a tough one.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,860
(Episode 6: Inner Thoughts)

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,460
This is the place. It's where I frequent.

90
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,970
I'm loving the vibe.

91
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,440
Shall we?

92
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,710
Then, how much is usually offered as a down payment?

93
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,149
Normally, ten percent should be received...

94
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,950
by the end of next month.

95
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,780
Next month?

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,290
Those moving to Tokyo would've already been chosen,

97
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,020
so that won't affect Mr. Yoshida's situation.

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
That's right.

99
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,300
Go ahead.

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,740
Here are your fishcakes.

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,340
- Thank you. - Thank you.

102
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,080
Choose one.

103
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,150
- I'll have this. - Okay.

104
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,050
Go ahead.

105
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,190
- I'll try this one. - Sure.

106
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,930
How is it?

107
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,969
- It's delicious. - Is it?

108
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,500
- It's incredible. - Really?

109
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,970
It's good.

110
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
By the way,

111
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,110
why are you telling me about SHIMIZ's situation?

112
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,520
I felt guilty in a way...

113
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,680
and wanted to tell you.

114
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,290
If by any chance,

115
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,830
you need to meet a quota too,

116
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,100
I'll look for a way...

117
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,800
so that you can move to Tokyo.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,070
Sure.

119
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,179
- It's so good. - Have your fill.

120
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Right.

121
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,980
- Here. - Yes?

122
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,830
- It's strong. - Is it?

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,760
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you for today.

125
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,640
You even treated me to a meal when it should've been on me.

126
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,280
You can treat me next time.

127
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,510
Sure. Next time,

128
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,620
I'll treat you to something delicious when you're in Korea.

129
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,450
There's an innocence to you.

130
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,959
What? To me?

131
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Yes.

132
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,940
I bet you said that to only be polite. Me, innocent?

133
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,199
Gosh, no. That came from the heart.

134
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,240
(Honne: One's true feelings)

135
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I see.

136
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,740
Mr. Oh.

137
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,780
You were giving me spy vibes.

138
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,620
Did you get anything?

139
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,750
I did.

140
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,960
SHIMIZ has its own internal issues.

141
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,590
Did she tell you all about it?

142
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Yes.

143
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,370
Really?

144
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,270
It's crucial for Mr. Yoshida...

145
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,269
to hit his quota, right?

146
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,280
Yes.

147
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,110
How much in down payment would he need?

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,309
With 9,000 at a 40-percent discount, the down payment...

149
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,950
would be 16.666 percent.

150
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,550
And at a 50-percent discount?

151
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,749
To get a 50-percent discount,

152
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,220
the order must be for over 10,000.

153
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,490
I know.

154
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
I see.

155
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,260
The down payment would be 18 percent.

156
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,370
That'll do.

157
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,040
- Should I schedule a meeting? - No.

158
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,700
I'll talk to Mr. Yoshida first.

159
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,840
Sure.

160
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,840
Excuse me while I make a call.

161
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Mr. Yoon, are things going well?

162
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,760
Yes, sir. We're still in talks.

163
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,430
Meanwhile, I had a request.

164
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,900
Go ahead.

165
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,999
Could we pay the down payment in advance...

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,700
and at a higher amount?

167
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,100
As in how much?

168
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,410
Twenty percent.

169
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,640
And it must be paid by this month.

170
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,680
The company can't afford to pay that much by this month.

171
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,590
I see.

172
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,830
Then, Mr. Park, I'll make a different request.

173
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,459
You can ask the head office...

174
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,870
for a short-term loan to cover the down payment.

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,430
However...

176
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,970
(Sanin)

177
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,740
Rather than going to Director Ha,

178
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,540
it'll be better to make the request directly to the chairman.

179
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,980
I'm asking for a loan,

180
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,380
and Director Ha is the CFO.

181
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,020
I'll be going over his head...

182
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,250
if I go straight to the chairman.

183
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,820
Yes, I know that.

184
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,560
But the dynamics at the head office are complicated at the moment.

185
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,659
For this particular deal,

186
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,360
it'll be better to make the request...

187
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,360
directly to the chairman.

188
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,030
I suggest a random encounter at the lobby if able.

189
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
(Sanin)

190
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,750
Mr. Chairman.

191
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,950
Goodness. What brings you here?

192
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm sorry, sir.

193
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,120
I should've run the company better.

194
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,629
Your job is to make good quality products.

196
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,230
It's our job to sell them for you.

197
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,630
Still,

198
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
I heard you were upset about the company not going public.

199
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,600
My gosh. As if.

200
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,840
What is it? Do you have something to say?

201
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,249
He'll be able to finalize the deal...

202
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,980
with a higher down payment amount.

203
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,350
Says who? The team leader?

204
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,350
Yes, Mr. Yoon Joo No.

205
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,889
I see.

206
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,260
If we're to pay a higher down payment amount,

207
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,720
the overall amount should be less. Don't you agree?

208
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,490
Sorry?

209
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,430
Have it approved.

210
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,730
Yes, sir.

211
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,410
Goodness. You must've been working out these days.

212
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,940
Your thighs are still as muscular as ever.

213
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,050
Of course.

214
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,090
Those with better stamina make better entrepreneurs.

215
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Goodness me. Have your tea.

216
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,160
The chairman approved.

217
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,860
Sure.

218
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,580
This is the secretary's office.

219
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,380
Is the Head of Planning there?

220
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,220
Yes, this is he.

221
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,120
Are you sure the order came from the chairman?

222
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,930
I see.

223
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,960
Got it.

224
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,600
All right.

225
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,960
He immediately approved it like you said he would.

226
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,160
That's great to hear. You did great.

227
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,200
However, he mentioned the overall price to be lowered.

228
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,439
The deal itself can't be easy to strike,

229
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,210
so a lowered price seems impossible.

230
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,070
I'll have to get it done.

231
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,340
You should hurry on out before Director Ha sees you.

232
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm worried about that myself.

233
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,190
CEO Park!

234
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,900
What is the meaning of this?

235
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,230
If you were here for a loan,

236
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,429
you should've come to me, the CFO.

237
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,269
Who are you to go straight to the chairman?

238
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,500
I was here to see you, sir,

239
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,639
but I ran into the chairman in the lobby.

240
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,540
He asked why I was here, and I couldn't exactly lie.

241
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,680
So? Did the deal happen?

242
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,580
Not quite yet from what I understand.

243
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,349
But to close the deal,

244
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,050
a higher down payment seems necessary.

245
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,160
The decision has to be made by tomorrow, right?

246
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,290
I'll submit everything tomorrow for your approval, sir.

247
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,580
Thank you for responding to such an urgent call.

248
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,980
No problem.

249
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,780
Thank you for your call.

250
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,520
I prefer traditional Japanese tea over coffee.

251
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,260
Is that all right with you?

252
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,460
I wanted you to experience Japan...

253
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,100
while you were here.

254
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,130
Of course. I appreciate it.

255
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,110
We proposed purchasing a significantly large quantity.

256
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,480
Around ten times the original amount,

257
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,880
believing it would be a favourable offer for SHIMIZ.

258
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,850
However,

259
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,449
it seems we may have underestimated...

260
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,660
the cultural differences between Japan and South Korea.

261
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Yes.

262
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,570
It can happen if you're not familiar with our culture.

263
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,170
Thank you for understanding.

264
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,920
I have received it.

265
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,110
Then,

266
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,450
we would like to inquire...

267
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,680
about how we can reach an agreement appropriately.

268
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,320
The requested quantity can be done.

269
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,860
But there are concerns regarding the change in the schedule,

270
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,700
issues of responsibility and such.

271
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,230
Sure.

272
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,469
How about we address those concerns...

273
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,770
by paying in advance?

274
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,510
By the way, why did Mr. Yoon want to meet him alone?

275
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,980
He wanted to be considerate of Mr. Yoshida.

276
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,710
How's that being considerate?

277
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,120
Mr. Yoshida knew that signing the deal with us...

278
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,090
would be a good thing for SHIMIZ,

279
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,160
but he turned it down to move up in the company.

280
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,289
If Mr. Yoshida had to admit that in front of others,

281
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,130
he'd be embarrassed.

282
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,870
I heard Japanese people cared a great deal about honour.

283
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,500
I guess Koreans are kind of like that too.

284
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,740
By "advance,"

285
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,250
what deadline are you referring to?

286
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,920
Based on the current contract terms,

287
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,620
we're expected to pay ten percent of the down payment next month,

288
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,020
but we would like to pay 20...

289
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,760
this month instead.

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,500
This month?

291
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,870
Yes. Additionally,

292
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,410
we request the cancellation of WIND's current order of 1,000 units.

293
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,150
We'd like to place a new order instead.

294
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,150
If...

295
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,419
it is because of the discount rate,

296
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,920
that may not be a concern.

297
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,920
From 1,000 to 10,000 units,

298
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,360
the discount rate is the same at 40 percent anyway.

299
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,900
No, we intend to order 10,001 units.

300
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,670
In that case,

301
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,440
we understand the discount rate would be 50 percent.

302
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Isn't that SHIMIZ's manual?

303
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,460
We will need to consider it.

304
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes.

305
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,760
But as you know,

306
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,030
the deadline is imminent.

307
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,150
Yes, Director Lee.

308
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,720
SHIMIZ decided to accept our offer.

309
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,380
I'm glad to hear that.

310
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,090
Chairman Song will be relieved too.

311
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
You're okay, right?

312
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,390
Me? Of course, I'm fine. I'll be stepping down anyway.

313
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,959
I just feel bad that you had to do this.

314
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,099
You're stepping down?

315
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,170
Yes, I should.

316
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,400
I can't work forever, you know.

317
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,009
I should retire and take it easy too.

318
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,140
You should be congratulated when you retire.

319
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,609
Thanks for saying that.

320
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,279
(Junior Managing Director Lee Dong Joon)

321
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,410
Get some rest.

322
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,670
- You should call it a day too. - Yes.

323
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,870
Right, Chairman Song.

324
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,780
I need to give him an update about something. Is it too late?

325
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,310
Should I check with the secretary's office?

326
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,850
Or you could just meet with him tomorrow.

327
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,290
All right.

328
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,760
(Jongno Go Club)

329
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,329
(Jongno Go Club)

330
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,230
- Hello. - Hello.

331
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,949
- Oh, hello. - My, it's good to see you.

332
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,049
It's been a while.

333
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,379
- I know, it's been a while. - Yes.

334
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,450
All right.

335
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,790
- Is the business doing well? - Yes.

336
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,590
- Your friends are over there. - Okay.

337
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Oh, over there.

338
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,770
(My eldest daughter)

339
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,039
(Dad, pick up some fried chicken on your way home.)

340
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,180
(Okay.)

341
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,090
Sorry, that was an important text.

342
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,790
Director Ha.

343
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,220
Why did you want to see me?

344
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,930
Well, the other day,

345
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,700
I saw you were having a hard time,

346
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,360
so I wanted to comfort you.

347
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,870
Comfort me?

348
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Well, I know you're under a lot of stress now.

349
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,070
Wasn't it your decision to acquire WIND?

350
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Well, it was.

351
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,709
Then we should take responsibility together.

352
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,780
Isn't it unacceptable to act like it's none of your business?

353
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,149
Unacceptable? What are you talking about?

354
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,120
IPO is the IR team's responsibility.

355
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,420
Director Lee apologized to me already.

356
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,360
And WIND...

357
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,960
will go public.

358
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Mr. Oh.

359
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,230
How did you become a board member when you were this dense?

360
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,670
What do you mean?

361
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,170
I heard you got chewed out by the chairman recently.

362
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,080
He was just...

363
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,649
He just said some stuff out of anger.

364
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
And to be honest,

365
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,619
it wasn't that bad.

366
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
What are you saying?

367
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,690
Hey, that is not the point.

368
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
Listen, Mr. Oh.

369
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Do you think Chairman Song chewed you out like that...

370
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,160
because of WIND?

371
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,099
That day, he called Director Lee to his office...

372
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,900
and scolded you like that...

373
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,510
so Director Lee would hear it. It wasn't about you.

374
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
What?

375
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,150
But I know they're close.

376
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,150
Why would he do that?

377
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,980
Because they're close.

378
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,890
He didn't want to say it directly to Director Lee.

379
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,589
That's why he called you there...

380
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,860
and said what he wanted to say to Director Lee.

381
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,160
Like I said, IPO is the IR team's job.

382
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,430
- So? - What do you mean, so?

383
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,740
Don't let them walk all over you.

384
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,870
Stop beating around the bush.

385
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,810
If you have something to say, just say it.

386
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,350
Your contract renewal is coming up, right?

387
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,820
You need to tell people the truth if you want to keep your job.

388
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
What are you talking about?

389
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,730
Tell the truth that Director Lee is to blame.

390
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,490
You want people to know the truth.

391
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,959
Can you do that?

392
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,929
You said even Chairman Song called me there...

393
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,070
because he couldn't scold him.

394
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
Right, exactly.

395
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,640
That's why we should call a board meeting.

396
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,970
What?

397
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,340
What, then? Do you have another idea?

398
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
Yes.

399
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,550
- I'm sorry I'm late. - No, it's fine.

400
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,220
You're right on time.

401
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,819
I called them here to have a drink with them too.

402
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
- Sure. - That's okay, right?

403
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,659
- Sir. - We're here.

404
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Yes, hi.

405
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,100
- Mr. Kim. - Oh, hey. You're here too.

406
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,230
What brings you here?

407
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,200
I came to have dinner. Why else would I be here?

408
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,940
What's your level?

409
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,640
Around Level Three, I'd say.

410
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,050
Come on. I can tell you'd be very good.

411
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,720
Then we can play without a bet.

412
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,590
Without a bet?

413
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
What would be the fun in that?

414
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,890
Please take a seat.

415
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm telling you. This place has the best sashimi in the country.

416
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,200
You know, I can't betray Director Lee.

417
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,500
I'll be going, then.

418
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,070
Hey, come on.

419
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,940
No one told you to betray him.

420
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,310
What, then? Are you saying Mr. Kim is a traitor?

421
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,310
Let's just stay for dinner. That's what I'm doing.

422
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,319
Mr. Oh, you have a knife at your throat,

423
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,920
yet you still care who's on whose side?

424
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,890
Look around you now.

425
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,260
The board meeting will be held even without you.

426
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,130
Then why did you call me here?

427
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,270
You can leave, then.

428
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,030
Come on.

429
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,070
Will you stand there as you listen to us?

430
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,900
I told you. I have something to tell you.

431
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,770
Mr. Oh.

432
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,740
Come on.

433
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,080
I mean...

434
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,520
I understand the situation, but a board meeting is too much.

435
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,219
You're saying we should turn our backs on him...

436
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,920
right in front of him.

437
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,660
What, then?

438
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,859
Will you resign in his place, then?

439
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,160
Why should I resign?

440
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,160
If you can't get your contract renewed this time,

441
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,930
you will have to leave.

442
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,569
Both Director Lee and Yoon Joo No...

443
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,170
really shouldn't do that.

444
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,570
Well, then how about...

445
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,510
Yoon Joo No takes responsibility for everything?

446
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,610
That will be a good solution too.

447
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,250
- Please help yourself. - Yes.

448
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,120
Oh, this looks good.

449
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,290
Here.

450
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You see,

451
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,210
I'm not saying we should gang up against Director Lee.

452
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,340
I'm simply suggesting...

453
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,110
we give him a reason to give up on Yoon Joo No.

454
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,780
The choice is his.

455
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,480
But...

456
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,190
if he says he'll take responsibility for everything and retire,

457
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,990
then what are we going to do about Yoon Joo No?

458
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,660
He'll just receive an indulgence, won't he?

459
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,660
Indulgence.

460
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,230
Why do you think Yoon Joo No came to the head office?

461
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,170
Do you know the reason?

462
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,040
Here. Mr. Oh, come on.

463
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,380
Cheers.

464
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,290
You see,

465
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,090
when you're handling a large sum of money,

466
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,260
you get confused.

467
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,300
You know the money isn't yours,

468
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,130
but you feel like it's yours because it's in your hands.

469
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,830
That's why money is a scary thing.

470
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,100
- Is that really true? - Yes.

471
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,910
When you do M and A deals,

472
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,280
you handle hundreds of millions of dollars.

473
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,519
So, you start thinking money is a joke,

474
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
and you feel like it's all yours.

475
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,049
One should be afraid of money.

476
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,050
Yes, exactly.

477
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
You know,

478
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
when you go out there to acquire a company,

479
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,359
you meet many fools who ask for 20 million dollars...

480
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,500
when their company is only worth ten million.

481
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,130
But they can never win against M and A experts.

482
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,200
In the end, they sell their business for five million and call it quits.

483
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,140
Then what about me?

484
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,510
I only paid 5 million for a company that's worth 10 million,

485
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,780
which means I brought in a profit of five million dollars.

486
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
That's true.

487
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,480
But what about my salary?

488
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,220
It's pathetic.

489
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,150
And I don't know when I might get fired.

490
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,419
So, one can't help but think, "I should pocket some of this..."

491
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,860
"when I have the chance."

492
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,560
Right, I get it.

493
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,729
The easiest thing to do would be to offer seven million dollars...

494
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,499
to the person who wants to sell a company worth five million,

495
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,000
then ask for a million-dollar commission.

496
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
Then you can tell your boss that...

497
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,869
you managed to acquire a company worth 10 million for only 7 million,

498
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,970
but that's too easy.

499
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,140
What?

500
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,249
Are you saying Yoon Joo No took rebates?

501
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,250
You see...

502
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,650
I'm not trying to be mean...

503
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,850
to my former mentee for collecting some kickbacks.

504
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,160
He is...

505
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,730
My gosh.

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,360
I swear,

507
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,700
I've never told anyone this, but...

508
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,609
- You know JUMBO Pharma, right? - Of course.

509
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,510
Sanin nearly went bust because of them.

510
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,680
That was...

511
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,780
That was Yoon Joo No's work.

512
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,490
I know the Prosecutors' Office investigated that case,

513
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,820
but they found nothing. Am I wrong?

514
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,660
That's not true.

515
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,030
Yoon Joo No did it in his brother's name.

516
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
But then,

517
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,030
his brother died while being investigated.

518
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,170
Because the suspect died,

519
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,910
they had no choice but to close the case.

520
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,180
Director Lee feels bad about that.

521
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,410
He feels sorry.

522
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,610
You all know how he is.

523
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
My gosh.

524
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,820
You're very good.

525
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,720
He's always agreeable and never complains.

526
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,860
He doesn't want to be blamed for anything, so he never speaks out.

527
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,430
A personality like that makes problems get out of hand.

528
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,560
A wound festers when left untreated.

529
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,460
Yoon Joo No is a ticking bomb waiting to explode.

530
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,200
He's a problem bound to explode.

531
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,439
So, we need to deal with Director Lee sooner than later.

532
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,140
If not, we're all finished.

533
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,340
But...

534
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,280
Yoon Joo No must know a lot about that stuff.

535
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,580
He bought shares in his brother's name? Wouldn't it be too obvious?

536
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,620
Look at this.

537
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,480
This is how kindhearted people think.

538
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,990
I'm not that kind.

539
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,960
If you were told to hire someone to manage all your money,

540
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,730
you could never do it.

541
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,860
Most people can't even let their own children do it.

542
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Which means,

543
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,670
Yoon Joo No and his brother were extremely close.

544
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,140
That's why it all happened.

545
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,450
Joo No.

546
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,060
Help me.

547
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,620
You're investing in JUMBO, aren't you?

548
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,360
How did you know?

549
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,870
How?

550
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,510
How did you find out?

551
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Sanin won't invest in that company.

552
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,690
That company is a fraud.

553
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,490
Hey, don't lie to me.

554
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,169
Shouldn't it go up if Sanin is investing in them?

555
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,200
But...

556
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,400
But why is it dropping?

557
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,670
Joo No.

558
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,240
Help me out once.

559
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,310
If you don't, I'll die.

560
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,350
Please.

561
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,380
Hi.

562
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
This way, please.

563
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,090
- The quantity is 10,001. - The quantity is 10,001.

564
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,530
- The unit price is 25 dollars. - The unit price is 25 dollars.

565
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,369
Twenty percent of the total amount will be paid this month.

566
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,569
- It will serve... - It will serve...

567
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,240
- as the down payment. - as the down payment.

568
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,410
Understood.

569
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,479
Please reconfirm the 50 percent discount rate...

570
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,049
as the quantity is 10,0001, exceeding 10,000.

571
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,210
Please reconfirm the 50 percent discount rate.

572
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,820
We already have the signature of WIND's CEO, Park Rae Gyeong.

573
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,489
We have also attached our guarantee as the agent.

574
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,619
They have also attached their guarantee as the agent.

575
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,660
Here.

576
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,880
Thank you.

577
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,990
Please.

578
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,859
We'll be receiving the quantity intended for Speed...

579
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,730
in Korea from SHIMIZ.

580
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,600
In Korea from SHIMIZ.

581
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,770
The MOU agreement with Speed will be attached later.

582
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,570
Thank you.

583
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,640
All clear.

584
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,240
We have no issues.

585
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,080
This company makes bicycles, yes?

586
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,990
They make bicycles, yes?

587
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,460
Does WIND make bicycles?

588
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,190
Yes, they do.

589
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,930
May I give him an explanation?

590
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,300
WIND also makes equipment for archery.

591
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,410
- In the archery industry... - My apologies.

592
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,280
I can't sign this contract.

593
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
He says he can't sign it.

594
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,890
What's the reason?

595
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,290
Why can't you sign the contract?

596
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,390
It's because I can't trust this company.

597
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,790
Mr. Naito.

598
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,029
You're being rude before our guests.

599
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,060
Mr. Yoshida.

600
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,269
Aren't you proceeding with this contract...

601
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,000
to fill your quota and return to Tokyo?

602
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,869
Calm down, Mr. Naito.

603
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,940
You're the same, no?

604
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,140
Please excuse me.

605
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
- Wait. - Excuse me.

606
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:42,550
What are you doing, Mr. Naito?

607
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,109
Mr. Naito? What is it?

608
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,150
Mr. Naito.

609
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,290
Mr. Naito. Please wait a minute.

610
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,529
Can you not trust WIND...

611
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,830
because of the change in order quantity?

612
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,930
If we were trying to deceive SHIMIZ,

613
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,900
we would've purchased the gears from other bicycle companies.

614
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,729
As mentioned,

615
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,599
Korea's bicycle industry is in a slump.

616
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,640
Listen.

617
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,009
The contract has once changed.

618
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,849
That means it can change again, no?

619
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,350
Signing such a contract is meaningless.

620
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,079
If the contract can change...

621
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,250
at any time, he sees no reason for another one.

622
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,890
That's why we're signing the contract today.

623
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,320
A contract is a promise to be kept...

624
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,229
and also specifies the penalties when breached.

625
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,529
A contract is...

626
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,999
My apologies, but I don't understand.

627
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,030
But...

628
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,030
a company that has once broken its word...

629
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,100
will do it again.

630
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,340
I know that for sure.

631
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Please excuse me.

632
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:46,739
He said that a promise...

633
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,710
once broken could be broken again.

634
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,530
My deepest apologies.

635
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,740
My apologies.

636
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,910
For changing the quantity on the contract,

637
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,610
the production manager's approval is required...

638
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,180
from the perspective of managing supply issues.

639
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,690
I'm very sorry things have turned out this way.

640
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,460
There must be a reason Mr. Naito is taking such a stance.

641
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,670
I can't say what the reason is.

642
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,299
But it should be noted...

643
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,070
that he comes from a generation of craftsmen.

644
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,040
That's why he has a very strong will...

645
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,680
and lacks business admin.

646
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,150
Does Mr. Naito's parents also make gears?

647
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,450
Not gears.

648
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,590
But his father was also a master craftsman.

649
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,790
Specifically, precision machining.

650
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,360
He even had his own factory.

651
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,270
The work clothes Mr. Naito was wearing...

652
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,470
were probably from his father's company.

653
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,040
Yes.

654
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,040
Yes.

655
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,610
Since that factory is currently SHIMIZ's.

656
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,350
Mr. Naito is continuing his family legacy,

657
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,690
running the factory himself.

658
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,289
I believe Japan is sustained...

659
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,230
by such craftsmanship.

660
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,680
(SHIMIZ)

661
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Dad!

662
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,630
Ken. Why are you here?

663
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,630
Did something happen?

664
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,670
Okay.

665
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,170
What?

666
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,540
Great work.

667
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,210
Did you sign the contract?

668
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,339
- Let's eat. - No.

669
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,580
What happened?

670
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,979
We have too many cancellations these days.

671
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,080
I know.

672
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,050
The warehouse is almost full.

673
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,920
It's fine as long as we make good products.

674
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,490
That's true, but...

675
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,460
Great work.

676
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,999
I don't think we can proceed...

677
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,230
with the contract any further.

678
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,670
I'm very sorry.

679
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,410
- My apologies. - No, it's okay.

680
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,190
I'll see you off.

681
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,670
- Ms. Hirose. - Yes?

682
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,900
Is there a way I can meet Mr. Naito?

683
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,710
He usually goes to the factory.

684
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,850
Excuse me. Please take us to this address.

685
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,310
Is it SHIMIZ Factory?

686
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,179
Yes. Do you know this place?

687
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,379
Of course.

688
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,350
It's been there for over 100 years.

689
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,020
- Is that so? - Yes.

690
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,459
Is SHIMIZ's permission required to receive...

691
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,230
Speed's quantity on their behalf?

692
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,770
Yes.

693
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,900
The resale prohibition clause is quite strict.

694
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,770
Can we delay our quantity contract schedule?

695
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,540
No. We already have an OEM contract scheduled.

696
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,420
Hello.

697
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,050
Who are you?

698
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,419
We're from WIND,

699
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,720
a company in Korea.

700
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,590
Can we meet the factory manager?

701
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,600
You're involved in the contract, right?

702
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,930
Yes.

703
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,270
Mr. Naito.

704
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,510
Mr. Naito.

705
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,080
Guests from the Korean company are here.

706
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,380
(Ongojisin)

707
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,660
To show up without an appointment.

708
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,590
He said we came without notice.

709
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,830
My apologies.

710
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,860
There's a question I'd like to ask.

711
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,930
I have nothing more to say.

712
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,900
Please return.

713
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,070
Mr. Naito.

714
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,480
Right. What's this?

715
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,180
Hey, kid.

716
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,860
Check if we don't have to do it.

717
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,560
Excuse me.

718
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,630
Can you ask if he's coming to work tomorrow?

719
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,370
Is Mr. Naito coming to work tomorrow?

720
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,910
The manager comes to work every day.

721
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,310
I see.

722
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,440
Apparently, he comes to work every day.

723
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,450
(Ongojisin)

724
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,530
CEO Park Rae Gyeong's name was on the contract, right?

725
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,370
Yes. His name and signature were on it.

726
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,209
Mr. Naito asked if the headquarters made bicycles...

727
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,309
before he signed the contract.

728
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,439
Yes. I replied yes...

729
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,580
and added they also made archery equipment.

730
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,190
Did the contract proceed well?

731
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,220
My apologies. We couldn't make the deal.

732
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,060
What happened?

733
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,900
The factory manager is a metal craftsman.

734
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,970
He's against the contract.

735
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,870
I see.

736
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,110
That's not uncommon in Japan.

737
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,480
Japanese craftsmen have great pride.

738
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,380
That gave me a hard time...

739
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,550
when I took over DAICHI.

740
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,620
Right. I can imagine.

741
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,380
Yes.

742
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,689
Until the early 1990s,

743
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,120
DAICHI was number one in archery equipment.

744
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,860
But among athletes, they had already lost...

745
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,300
the market to us.

746
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,269
DAICHI's situation worsened eventually,

747
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,700
and they had to sell the company.

748
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,540
And that was how you took over the company.

749
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,640
I didn't because I needed DAICHI's technique.

750
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,980
Technique-wise, we were already...

751
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,820
ahead of them.

752
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,280
Then why did you buy the company?

753
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,049
(CEO's Office)

754
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,520
DAICHI had a great reputation.

755
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,260
Had another company taken over DAICHI,

756
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,430
that company would've quickly caught up to WIND's reputation.

757
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,240
In short, you took over as a defensive measure.

758
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,240
Correct.

759
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,470
But...

760
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,840
back then, DAICHI set such a condition...

761
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,480
for acquisition.

762
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,450
"Make better archery equipment than DAICHI."

763
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,490
I was taken aback at first.

764
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,930
At first, I thought he was bluffing.

765
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,660
But now that I think about it,

766
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,870
he must've been sincere about it.

767
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,640
Mr. Park.

768
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,640
Can you spare me some time?

769
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,110
I'll come over at once.

770
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,110
May I ask why?

771
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,820
The DAICHI photo hanging in WIND's office.

772
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,890
That?

773
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,960
The one I took when taking over DAICHI?

774
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,930
Yes.

775
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:33,760
The craftsman in that photo...

776
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,860
drew the blueprint, right?

777
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,970
Correct.

778
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,900
That's why I gifted the frame to him.

779
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,870
"Ongojisin."

780
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,070
You remember.

781
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,380
You wrote it yourself, yes?

782
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,609
The craftsman asked me to.

783
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,779
(DAICHI)

784
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,820
The boy in the photo is the craftsman's son, right?

785
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,850
Yes.

786
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,490
Do you remember his name?

787
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,890
I don't remember the son's name.

788
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,860
But the craftsman's name...

789
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,660
was Naito DAICHI.

790
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,870
I see.

791
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,470
Mr. Park.

792
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,000
I need that photo.

793
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,340
Sorry?

794
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,880
You need the photo?

795
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,010
Yes.

796
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,150
Hey.

797
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,820
It's right here.

798
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,060
And wait.

799
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Thank you.

800
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,540
Thank you.

801
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,850
You even came to work today.

802
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,210
That's amazing.

803
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,580
Can't you please return?

804
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,919
There's something we must ask.

805
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,960
Could you please wait for a little while?

806
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,460
You people standing around here is troublesome.

807
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,430
How much longer will it take?

808
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,400
Please, we ask of you.

809
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,570
Excuse me.

810
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,910
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

811
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,550
Fine. What is it that you want to talk about?

812
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,280
I would like to check something first.

813
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:41,760
Did you refuse to sign the contract...

814
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,660
because you noticed Park Rae Gyeong's name on it?

815
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,560
We'd like to confirm something.

816
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,470
Did you refuse to sign the contract...

817
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,940
because you noticed the name Park Rae Gyeong on it?

818
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,610
You never saw Park Rae Gyeong's name in past contracts,

819
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,980
as there were no quantity modifications.

820
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,810
But Park Rae Gyeong took part as an authorized signatory,

821
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,120
and you saw the name. Am I not right?

822
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,390
Unlike before, you were involved...

823
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,360
in the revised contract,

824
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,360
And that made you discover Park Rae Gyeong's name. Yes?

825
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,430
So what about it?

826
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,029
CEO Park Rae Gyeong took over DAICHI,

827
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,930
the company making archery equipment,

828
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,639
which caused the number one archery company...

829
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,710
in the world to disappear.

830
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,520
With WIND acquiring DAICHI,

831
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,850
the best archery company in the world, DAICHI disappeared.

832
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,420
What...

833
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,360
That's enough!

834
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,230
All right?

835
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,460
Wasn't your father...

836
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,630
a craftsman who made archery equipment at DAICHI?

837
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,000
Your father was a craftsman...

838
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,799
who made archery equipment...

839
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,570
- at DAICHI, yes? - Yes, that's right.

840
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,909
Wait.

841
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:10,480
Did everyone come all the way here to tell me that?

842
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,980
I have something for you.

843
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,650
(WIND)

844
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,629
To give you this, Mr. Yoon made...

845
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,230
a round trip to Korea.

846
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,929
But due to the flight delay, he was late.

847
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,899
Please forgive him.

848
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,970
Listen.

849
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,400
If it's the contract, I will not sign it.

850
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,670
And I've already told you that.

851
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,580
It's not the contract.

852
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,710
But it is related to the promise.

853
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,850
It's not the contract.

854
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,250
It's about the promise.

855
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,500
(Ongojisin)

856
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,570
That's the picture of your father...

857
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,410
and the CEO of WIND, Park Rae Gyeong, from 30 years ago.

858
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,440
When your father...

859
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,050
sold DAICHI to CEO Park Rae Gyeong,

860
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,479
he gave the CEO the hand-drawn blueprint of a bow...

861
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,520
as a present.

862
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,750
When your father sold DAICHI,

863
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,119
he gave CEO Park Rae Gyeong...

864
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,629
the blueprint as a present.

865
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,659
With the request to make the best bow...

866
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
to the CEO.

867
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,069
With the request to make the best bow to the CEO.

868
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,799
And CEO Park gifted your father...

869
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,500
a calligraphy piece for a motto as a present.

870
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,940
The motto was...

871
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,440
ongojisin.

872
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,309
In return, CEO Park...

873
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:50,279
gave your father a calligraphy piece for a motto that said,

874
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,609
"Gain new insights..."

875
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,820
"by learning from the past" as a present.

876
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,350
Well...

877
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,560
Don't you know that...

878
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,130
this is an insult...

879
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,630
to the spirit of our craftsmanship?

880
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,500
That's how you saw it.

881
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,600
Despite that, you still hung the motto.

882
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,509
Despite your disapproval,

883
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,410
- why did you hang the calligraphy? - What?

884
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,010
That...

885
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,349
I saw it every day...

886
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,980
and tried to understand how my father must have felt.

887
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,890
Your father chose the motto...

888
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,490
for the calligraphy.

889
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,630
The motto for the calligraphy was requested by your father.

890
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,890
I reckon that...

891
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,130
your father must have wanted you to continue his legacy...

892
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,500
while hoping that...

893
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,700
you would pave your own path.

894
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:52,409
Your father might have wanted you...

895
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,540
to continue his legacy...

896
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,479
while you pursued something new...

897
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,549
on your own.

898
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,719
(Ongojisin)

899
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,850
Dad.

900
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,850
I'm back.

901
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,120
Welcome back.

902
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
All right.

903
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,600
I told you not to come to the factory.

904
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,360
No.

905
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,400
I'll be a master craftsman just like you.

906
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,900
Really?

907
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes. I promise.

908
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
Okay.

909
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,250
That's me.

910
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,090
Can you see?

911
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,320
That's your grandpa.

912
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,330
I'm sorry.

913
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,770
Dad, I have your life now.

914
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,610
The kid in the picture grew so much.

915
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,280
Right?

916
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,580
What's this?

917
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,750
Candy?

918
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,230
Your grandpa used to give me candy when I came to the factory...

919
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,060
after school.

920
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,100
Thank you.

921
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,270
It's a letter...

922
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,140
from CEO Park to you.

923
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,420
This is a letter from CEO Park.

924
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,570
Hello.

925
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,070
I'm the CEO of WIND, Park Rae Gyeong.

926
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,840
When I bought DAICHI, your father...

927
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,280
asked me to make the best bow in the world.

928
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:15,450
He gave me a hand-drawn blueprint of the bow.

929
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,220
Archery has changed so much compared to all those years ago.

930
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,860
But my intention to make good bows...

931
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,890
has not changed.

932
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,060
WIND didn't eliminate DAICHI.

933
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,129
WIND is the only company...

934
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,570
that has been continuing your father's craftsmanship.

935
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,310
And "ongojisin."

936
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,410
This motto was...

937
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,980
what your father wanted to tell you.

938
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,379
I heard that you had been following...

939
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,550
your father's wish.

940
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,690
I will continue to root for you for your future endeavours.

941
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,090
From Park Rae Gyeong.

942
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,940
Thank you.

943
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Thank you.

944
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,610
Thank you.

945
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,279
Thank you.

946
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,910
- Thank you. - Thank you.

947
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,720
Yes, Director Lee.

948
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,220
The deal has gone through. We're on our way back.

949
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,360
The discount rate is 50 percent.

950
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,930
This condition is much more favourable.

951
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,190
That was a big win.

952
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,100
How impressive.

953
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,830
But you haven't reported it to the chairman yet, right?

954
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,969
No. It's the weekend.

955
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,430
I'll do so once I'm at work.

956
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,900
But...

957
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,310
could you delay reporting it to the chairman?

958
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,580
Sure. I'll do that.

959
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,710
Jin Soo.

960
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,480
Aren't you sad to be leaving Japan?

961
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,980
My gosh. But...

962
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,350
I'm so relieved that the deal went through.

963
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,860
Right.

964
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,190
That's why.

965
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,590
I'm hungry because we just signed the deal.

966
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,660
My gosh. Aren't you hungry?

967
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:43,600
Sort of.

968
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,970
- Right? Goodness. - Wait.

969
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,309
You're still here.

970
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,210
I didn't think you guys had time to eat.

971
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,479
My boss told me to make sure you guys had some food.

972
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,510
I knew it. You guys are very kind.

973
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,080
- We were actually getting hungry. - I see.

974
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,580
Wait, no.

975
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,820
We know what this means now.

976
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,419
You want us to leave, right?

977
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,390
Gosh, no. We sincerely want to treat you to a nice meal.

978
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,959
Really? You mean it?

979
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,360
Yes, really.

980
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,500
She means it.

981
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,870
I was nervous the whole day. And now that I'm a bit relaxed,

982
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,170
I'm getting hungry.

983
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,739
Right. We're about to have some food together.

984
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,510
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

985
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,470
Sure. Sounds good.

986
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,480
Where should I bring you?

987
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,750
Well, what's good here?

988
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,580
Then...

989
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,450
how about ramen?

990
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,720
You already had fishcakes.

991
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,560
You also had fishcakes, didn't you?

992
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,760
- I... - Yes.

993
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,130
Does it mean...

994
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,040
she knew that we were tailing them?

995
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,840
I guess so.

996
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,270
Oh, my.

997
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,779
Maybe, she's only genuine...

998
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,139
- about you. - Enjoy.

999
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,480
It's nothing like that.

1000
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,080
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1001
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Let's eat together.

1002
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,590
Then...

1003
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,400
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1004
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,430
Jin Soo asked me to help you get transferred to Tokyo too.

1005
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,240
Yes, I heard it from my boss.

1006
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,440
But...

1007
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,040
I like Shizuoka.

1008
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,980
Yes. I've heard.

1009
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
I see.

1010
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,220
You helped us in many ways.

1011
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,660
No. I should thank you for your help.

1012
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,730
Thank you for your help.

1013
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,990
- I'll be in touch. - Okay.

1014
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,499
Thank you for your help.

1015
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1016
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,400
Thank you for your help.

1017
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,340
(Sanin)

1018
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,979
Hello.

1019
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,980
(Board Meeting Minutes)

1020
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,110
Hello.

1021
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,820
Hello.

1022
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,090
Hello, Mr. Kim.

1023
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,390
It seems Director Lee won't be joining us.

1024
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,400
Well, he must be embarrassed to show his face around.

1025
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,430
- Let's all be understanding. - What?

1026
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:42,640
Are you implying he's responsible for this problem with WIND?

1027
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,170
Have you gone mad?

1028
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:47,680
Then who's responsible for it?

1029
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,310
Which team is in charge of getting subsidiaries listed?

1030
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,850
I see.

1031
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,320
You didn't publish the news article yet, right?

1032
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,930
No, it's on standby.

1033
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,530
Should I publish it?

1034
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,600
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

1035
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,900
Should we begin our meeting without Director Lee then?

1036
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,070
Yes. Let's do that.

1037
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,270
I'm sorry I'm late.

1038
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,920
Now that everyone is present, let us begin the board meeting.

1039
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,659
Our main agenda today is...

1040
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,690
Let's start with the other matter.

1041
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,590
That seems to be more important.

1042
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,860
I see. All right.

1043
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,430
There is the matter...

1044
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,430
regarding the failure of getting WIND listed.

1045
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,140
Director Lee, we need you to explain what happened there.

1046
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,940
WIND will get listed without a problem...

1047
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,050
as long as the sales are good.

1048
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,379
To get a company listed, you need more than just numbers.

1049
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,520
It's about the momentum.

1050
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,790
So...

1051
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,460
are you holding me responsible?

1052
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,830
You're not the only one responsible.

1053
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,960
But it would be embarrassing if you blamed someone else...

1054
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,000
for the failure. Don't you agree?

1055
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,470
If the deal went through in Japan, things could've been different.

1056
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,400
But I take it that it didn't. Am I wrong?

1057
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,610
Or if you want, we can have a show of hands.

1058
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,910
Why would we do that? This matter doesn't require a vote.

1059
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,550
Shouldn't we make it clear...

1060
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,250
who is responsible for this?

1061
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,390
Sure. Let's do that.

1062
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,990
All right then.

1063
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,490
If you believe the failure of WIND getting listed is IR Team's fault,

1064
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:46,930
raise your hands.

1065
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,670
Mr. Oh, are you raising your hand now?

1066
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,540
Yes.

1067
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,170
My gosh.

1068
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,590
Hello. I'm stopping by briefly to bring you up to speed.

1069
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,290
First of all, the supply contract with SHIMIZ has been completed.

1070
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:20,900
Who approved the down payment for the contract?

1071
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,599
As the contract was signed on a weekend,

1072
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,430
I plan to request the approval today.

1073
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,340
WIND will release news articles about its new product.

1074
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,669
As WIND struggled to get listed due to the uncertainty about sales,

1075
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,110
I believe that this contract should remedy such uncertainty.

1076
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,350
Then excuse me.

1077
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,660
May I be excused too?

1078
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,720
Director Lee. I didn't mean to...

1079
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,290
- Mr. Oh. - Yes, Director Lee.

1080
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:27,130
Resign if you'll blame other people because you don't think it's fair.

1081
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,160
No, I never thought it wasn't fair.

1082
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,030
I'm sorry.

1083
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,100
Get back to work.

1084
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,270
I hear your contract renewal is around the corner.

1085
01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:01,730
(Main Agenda)

1086
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,070
Hey.

1087
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,210
How was your trip to Japan?

1088
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,580
It went well.

1089
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:19,980
I knew it.

1090
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,220
I found the players for the operation.

1091
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,720
They're still doing the same thing.

1092
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,260
That's good.

1093
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,230
Then...

1094
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,890
should I begin?

1095
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,040
I'll call you right back.

1096
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:46,970
Yes, Director Lee.

1097
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,710
Hey, you're still up.

1098
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,909
I'm sorry to call you at this late hour.

1099
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,850
No. Please go ahead.

1100
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,620
There's a problem.

1101
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,990
The chairman took out a loan with the stocks as collateral.

1102
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,960
And it seems he arranged it through his secretary.

1103
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,830
He must have wanted to do it secretly.

1104
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,570
This wasn't disclosed to the public.

1105
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,640
The secretary must have realized that this was a problem...

1106
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,779
when the loan was almost due.

1107
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,410
(Stock Pledge Agreement)

1108
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,950
It could be that the chairman didn't want anyone to know.

1109
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,350
Is this bad?

1110
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,590
Of course, it's bad.

1111
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,260
Could you help me out for my sake?

1112
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,790
Let's discuss this further in person.

1113
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,060
Okay.

1114
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:07,890
(The Art of Negotiation)

1115
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,760
Can I ask you where you spent 50 million dollars?

1116
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,860
This is off.

1117
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,929
We need to borrow the money from somewhere and pay it back fast.

1118
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:46,959
Do you think you can do it?

1119
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,099
I'll take care of it.

1120
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,429
If the tabloids start reporting that...

1121
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,760
he doesn't even have 50 million dollars...

1122
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,499
The stock price can plummet.

1123
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,929
I bought a resort.

1124
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,500
Are you seriously considering to sell it?

1125
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,370
I believe we should.

1126
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,170
I'm the owner of Unit 123.

1127
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,510
You must be from Sanin.

1128
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,810
You've been here for a year?

1129
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:08,220
It turns out someone named Song Ji O is the real owner.

1130
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,650
Don't sell it.

1131
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,250
Is there a reason I shouldn't?
