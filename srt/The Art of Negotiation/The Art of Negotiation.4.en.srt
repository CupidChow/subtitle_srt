By how much?

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,750
They doubled it.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,790
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,880
Someone offered CEO Cha twice our offer.

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,580
As in 20 million dollars?

14
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,219
That's absurd.

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,250
Let's call it a day.

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,090
This is a tactic.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,100
We only met with CHACHA Games last week,

18
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,230
but someone offered twice the amount?

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,370
To a nobody like CHACHA Games?

20
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,910
Word must've leaked about our interest in CHACHA Games.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,010
Which punk was it?

22
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,730
Mr. Yoon.

23

Are things going well...

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,180
with CHACHA Games?

25
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,110
Yes, things are going as planned.

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,520
As it should.

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,950
As it should.

Strawberries...

31
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,030
- at a discounted price. - Hey.

32
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,970
- Look here, lady. - Goodness.

33
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,769
Why don't you try a strawberry?

34
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,140
- It's tasty. - Forget it.

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,140
You can't sell these here.

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,180
Do you have any idea what kind of people live here?

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,679
- Fresh strawberries. - You're causing so much noise.

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,249
I'm getting complaints, so move this truck.

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,789
Don't be like that and try a strawberry.

40
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,819
- Darn. - Try one.

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Sir.

42
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,560
This isn't part of the apartment complex.

43
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,159
Of course it is. See this brick road.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,460
It's part of the apartment complex.

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,729
Move the truck before I report this.

46
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,430
Sir, this is publicly owned land.

47
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,329
The sidewalk was only laid down in order for the construction...

48
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,300

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,310
You must be here because of the complaints.

50
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,409
If only you knew how fussy these residents are.

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,250
The noise has them throwing a fit.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,710
It must be tough on you.

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,450
There must be all sorts of people living here as well.

54
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,350
However,

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,889
aren't there residents...

56
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,359
who complain that you are being harsh?

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,590
Of course there are.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,600
Who am I supposed to please?

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,160
We'll turn that off for now.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Do it fast.

61
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,229
The residents can't hear it that well anyway,

62
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,340
and no one comes by because of it.

63
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,670
Right. Sure thing. Let's do that.

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,040
We have to move in two hours anyway.

65
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,380
We'll start packing it up during that time.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,849
I assume that'll be the best for us both.

67
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,749
- You have two hours. - Of course. Absolutely.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,490
- Here you go. - What...

69
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,449
- Enjoy these too. - What?

70
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,660
Thank you.

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,460
- Thank you. - Thank you.

72
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,830
Hey, what a relief.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,430
Let's sell all these and go.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,760
As if we could sell anything here.

75
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,899
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,929
I chose to come here because this was a fancy neighborhood.

77
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,040
Exactly.

78
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,299
- The residents here... - Over here.

79
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,700
Won't buy fruit from trucks.

80
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,410
They'll buy better ones at the supermarket.

81
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,280
You don't know what you're talking about.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,509
These may be small in size being the last batch to harvest,

83
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,709
but they're delicious.

(Clearance sale! Strawberries straight from the farm)

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420

86
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,890
What about it?

87
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,690
Those with money don't only eat fancy things.

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,559
It's actually them who look for what's cheaper.

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
That's how they got to be rich.

90
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,670
Rather than helping out like I asked you to,

91
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,230
you've been nagging me nonstop.

92
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,240
Come and buy strawberries.

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Get your strawberries at a discounted price.

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,439

Mom, I'm off. I have work to do.

96
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,210
Hey.

97
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,550
That heartless brat.

98
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,519
- Are you happy... - I haven't had...

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,079
- a lot of strawberries recently. - to leave me working alone?

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,750
- I'm exhausted as is. - How much, ma'am?

101
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,719
Goodness me.

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,290
It's five dollars per basket.

103
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
We'll take one.

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,389
- Thank you. - Thank you.

105
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,359
- Enjoy. - Is it five dollars per basket?

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,899
Yes, per basket.

107
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,059
- That... - I'll take two.

108
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,930
Two? Got it.

109
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,770
You should buy one more.

110
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,400
This is CHACHA Games.

111
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,970
You didn't give us any pickled radish.

112
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,970
Sure.

113
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,510
They'll get it to us right away.

114
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,210
I should've ordered jjamppong.

115
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,049
If you did,

116
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,750
you'd be regretting that too.

117
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,120
Why didn't you also order kkanpunggi?

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,819
Their kkanpunggi is the bomb.

119
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,290
We'll have that once we get paid.

120
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
Will they really give us 20 million dollars?

121
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,290
What if they go back on their word?

122
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,460
They approached me first offering twice as much as Sanin.

123
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,500
Still, 20 million seems like a stretch.

124
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,969
A major company is entering the e-commerce market.

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,440
As an entrance fee, 20 million is nothing.

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,070
Ask for more, then.

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Should I?

128
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,240
- Should I negotiate? - Yes.

129
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,980
How about 30 million?

130
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
That must be the pickled radish.

131
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,580
Darn.

132
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,289
- Pickled radish... - Hello.

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,300
Hello.

134
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,600
- May I come in? - Well...

135
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,830
Ho Jin's not here.

136
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,270
Hi.

137
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,480
I was hoping to know more about the offer...

138
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,650
you received.

139
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,080
Why would you ask that?

140
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,719
Don't be clingy and be cool about this.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Hey.

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,520
That's rich considering you stood us up at the meeting.

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,489
Who'd buy CHACHA Games when it's a sinking ship?

144
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,490
Jin Soo, come on.

145
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,029
A sinking ship? No way.

146
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,860
The deal is twice of whatever Sanin's offering.

147
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,470
Twice of whatever Sanin's offering.

148
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,470
That's the term?

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Yes.

150
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,800
"You're closing a deal with Sanin, right?"

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,010
"Our offer is twice theirs."

152
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,070
That was it.

153
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,010
There's more to a deal...

154
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,010
than just money.

155
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,980
Do you think we're naive pushovers?

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,220
What other than money can be important?

157
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,920
When ordering lunch,

158
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,420
you probably debated between jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

159
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,520
Was price a determining factor?

160
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,560
What you wanted to eat...

161
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,960
was more the issue.

162
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,229
Aren't they the same price?

163
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,230
No.

164
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,840
Jjamppong is a dollar more.

165
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,169
For the price of jjamppong,

166
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,370
you can have a jumbo-sized jjajangmyeon.

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,410
But it's only a dollar.

168
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
To be honest,

169
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,480
we don't want to pivot.

170
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,680
Our next game can be a hit for sure.

171
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,979
But since we don't have money,

172
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,280
we'll get it by pivoting or diving into e-commerce or whatnot...

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,620
and develop games again.

174
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,490
That's why we're going with whoever pays more.

175
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,760
So if you're not going to offer more than 20 million,

176
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
leave already.

177
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,830
Hold on. Is this...

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,430
leftover food?

179
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,070
You should try to empty your plates.

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,439
Any leftover food must be eaten once you're in the afterlife.

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,910
This is terrible. What are you going to do about this?

182
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,480
Have it, then.

183
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,179
- What a relief. - Right.

184
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,480
Thanks for this.

185
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
It's good.

186
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Have your fill.

187
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,840
It's a photo of CEO Cha.

188
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
What is?

189
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,040
May I see this?

190
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,910
Sure.

191
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,190
This must be him in his younger years.

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,060
Yes, that's his seat.

193
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,630
The woman looks familiar.

194
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,360
- Is she his girlfriend? - What?

195
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,100
Gosh, no. We don't know who she is.

196
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,530
Aren't you done?

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Hold on.

198
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,280
It's good. The place serves decent food.

199
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,110
- Thanks for this. - Whatever.

200
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Shall we get going?

201
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,749
We probably ruined your lunch,

202
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,020
so let us put in another order.

203
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,130
It wasn't easy shoving that down my throat.

204
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,960
I thought my stomach was going to explode.

205
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,630
You seemed to be enjoying it.

206
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,340
What should we order for CHACHA Games?

207
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,770
What they were having?

208
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,440
Isn't there a combo of the two dishes?

209
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,640
The jjam-jjamyeon.

210
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,980
Yes, let's order that.

211
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,210
Order kkanpunggi too.

212
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,880
Four jjam-jjamyeon and one large kkanpunggi.

213
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,220
Three bowls will do.

214
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,690
CEO Cha wasn't there.

215
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,430
What?

216
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
Someone went to CHACHA Games...

217
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,970
and offered twice of whatever we were paying.

218
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,629
Whoever it is knew...

219
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,540
we were in talks with CHACHA Games.

220
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,109
Twice of whatever we were offering.

221
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,810
Whoever it was doesn't care about CHACHA's values.

222
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,780
They just knew we made CHACHA an offer.

223
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,280
We're the target, so who could it be?

224
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,020
Could it be DC Games?

225
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,490
The CEO is a thug, remember?

226
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,859
He even said in an interview...

227
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,990
that he'd like to get along with Cha Ho Jin again.

228
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,990
It could be a fund.

229
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,500
To have us buy it back?

230
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,230
What if we don't buy it?

231
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,699
It's possible...

232
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,840
if they know we desperately need to buy CHACHA Games.

233
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,950
Hey, did you perhaps meet with CHACHA Games?

234
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,480
We're currently exposed to a sniper...

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,950
and have taken a hit.

236
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,890
However, we don't know where the bullet came from.

237
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,160
Is he dead?

238
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,760
Your kill wasn't tallied.

239
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,130
We instinctively want to know where the shot was fired,

240
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,970
but our opponent...

241
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,870
is out there waiting for us to stick our head back out.

242
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,470
What do we do, then?

243
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,380
We go against our instincts.

244
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,610
Against it?

245
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,380
We'll act as though nothing happened.

246
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,920
Like we weren't hit by a bullet.

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,050
Until when?

248
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,930
Until we figure out who's pointing...

249
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,260
the gun at us.

250
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,300
How did you know?

251
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,169
(Jenny)

252
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,270
Meet with me. We need to talk.

253
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,040
- Jin Soo. - Yes?

254
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Did you...

255
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,880
beat the final level of Delivery King?

256
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,850
Yes.

257
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,520
There's a video that plays once you beat the final level.

258
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,720
The ending credit?

259
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,560
That's right. Didn't the image look a lot like...

260
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,830
the photo on CEO Cha's desk?

261
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,100
I'm not sure.

262
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,470
A lot of game developers get personal with ending credits.

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,470
Either way, you don't find it unusual.

264
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Not really.

265
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,850
I'm busy. It's my first day working at CHACHA.

266
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,090
Goodness me.

267
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,260
How many will we be getting this time around?

268
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,870
I'm guessing about 50 each if all goes well.

269
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,370
That many?

270
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,500
Only when done properly,

271
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,170
and this is what I'm good at.

272
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,310
Of course.

273
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,210
Is there any support I can offer?

274
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,880
I doubt I'll need it considering the size of the company.

275
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,689
No, wait. Director Teo,

276
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,520
would you like to role play as police with me?

277
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,860
As in good cop, bad cop?

278
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Exactly.

279
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,500
Our relationship's only going to get tighter.

280
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,030
It won't be too bad to see how well we work together.

281
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,000
Sure. I'd like that. It's been a while.

282
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,980
Excuse me.

283
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Yes?

284
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:08,250
We ordered your desk online.

285
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,890
- It'll arrive tomorrow. - Right. Thanks.

286
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,519
We ordered a pretty one.

287
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,390
One that's way better than mine.

288
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,730
Sure. You already told me.

289
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,059
You might not like the design, so...

290
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,300
You already said that too.

291
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Sure.

292
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,140
What's the Wi-Fi access code?

293
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,510
I'm afraid we don't use Wi-Fi around here...

294
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,190
because a wireless network is prone to hacking.

295
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,120
May I explain why that is?

296
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,520
It's fine.

297
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,060
I'm good.

298
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,990
It's fine.

299
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,800
- Should I get you a cable instead? - Yes.

300
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,690
Would you like me to format your laptop for you?

301
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,060
To signal a new beginning.

302
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,390
- Sure. - Then,

303
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,730
I need to take a look at your computer.

304
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,100
Thanks.

305
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,490
Who's she?

306
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,220
The girl Ho Jin likes.

307
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,130
- I see. - Hey.

308
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,230
Can I explain the Easter egg in Delivery King?

309
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,040
- Sure. - An Easter egg...

310
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,840
is a message within the game hidden by the developer.

311
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,670
It's mostly for fun,

312
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,440
but sometimes, there's a meaning behind it.

313
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,980
I know what an Easter egg is.

314
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,680
Which is the one in your game?

315
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
Well...

316
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,290
No one's been able to find it yet,

317
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,190
but let me give you the short version of it.

318
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,790
So...

319
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,960
Allow me to explain.

320
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,400
At night, that person waits there with that in hand.

321
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,100
- Who's that person? - Ho Jin.

322
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,070
- Why is CEO Cha there? - Guess.

323
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,610
How would I know that?

324
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,880
Here's your clue. First love.

325
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,079
It's unrequited.

326
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,580
How's that a clue? You gave her the answer.

327
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,250
Let me see. When Cha Ho Jin gets here...

328
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,420
Here. Give him this seat.

329
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,190
Have him face the windows.

330
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,399
That way, we can have the light behind us...

331
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,300
which will make us look more charismatic.

332
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,330
Lower his chair a bit...

333
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,140
so that he can look up at me.

334
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,270
Yes, sir.

335
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,810
Fix it while seated.

336
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,020
Look at me.

337
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,550
Okay.

338
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,460
No wonder you're a hotshot negotiator.

339
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
You don't miss a single beat.

340
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,560
Positioning is key in battles.

341
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,399
Have him sit uncomfortably while looking up at my face...

342
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,300
that's hidden in the shadow.

343
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,030
That would intimidate anyone.

344
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,540
With that, you'll already be halfway there.

345
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,769
Bring him iced coffee during the meeting...

346
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,110
- with lots of ice. - Yes, sir.

347
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,539
Why's that?

348
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,209
Finishing his coffee fast...

349
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,510
will pressure him to give us a quick answer.

350
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,050
That will lead to him signing the deal.

351
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,150
- Bring me the contract. - Yes, sir.

352
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,289
By having the entire contract printed out,

353
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,090
he won't think about revising anything.

354
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,170
Humans are fairly straight in terms of input and output.

355
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,100
- They're simple creatures. - I'll say.

356
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,839
CEO Cha is here.

357
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Right.

358
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:24,980
- Should I go meet him? - No, have him come up to us.

359
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,480
Your appointment has been confirmed.

360
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,950
You can ride that elevator up to the office.

361
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Which floor is Samoel Fund on?

362
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,820
- That'd be the 17th. - The 17th.

363
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,090
Thank you.

364
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,659
Once he realizes this isn't a place for just anyone to come,

365
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,560
he'll be intimidated from the start.

366
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,759
He'll then think...

367
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,200
it's in his best interest to sign this contract.

368
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll put my faith in you and leave you to it.

369
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,040
Director Teo, this all banks on you today.

370
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,110
I have to be the good cop, right?

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,550
No, you have the look of a bad cop.

372
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,920
Goodness, CEO Cha.

373
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,830
It's good to meet you. Welcome.

374
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,790
- Have a seat. - Hello.

375
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,430
Hello.

376
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,770
That's nothing serious.

377
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,779
It says you'll only be dealing with us.

378
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
Everyone signs that before negotiations begin.

379
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,110
There will be a finalized contract for you to sign later.

380
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
I see.

381
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,080
- May I read it? - Sure.

382
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,900
(Exclusive Negotiation Agreement)

383
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,430
(Exclusive Negotiation Agreement)

384
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,100
All right.

385
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,140
Won't I get to negotiate with anyone else once I sign this?

386
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,410
Why do you ask?

387
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,210
Are you in talks with another company?

388
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,680
Not really, but...

389
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,790
Then why are you on the fence when we're willing to pay money?

390
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,130
- May I borrow this? - Of course.

391
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,800
- Allow me. - Right.

392
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,170
- Thank you. - Sure.

393
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Thank you.

394
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,740
Can I ask why you want to buy our game?

395
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,950
CEO Cha, why did you develop that game?

396
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,150
Wasn't it to make money?

397
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,619
Money's good.

398
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,960
Who hates money, right?

399
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,160
But I truly believe...

400
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,459
that dreamers like CEO Cha should be acknowledged more.

401
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,530
I mean that.

402
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,030
When will I get the money?

403
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,240
That's not what's important.

404
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,710
To be honest, I don't know if this deal is the way to go.

405
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,740
What?

406
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,549
You didn't find any success...

407
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,210
nor does the company have any assets.

408
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,120
Why are we even acquiring this company?

409
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,050
You approached us with the 20-million offer.

410
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,960
Exactly, and I was against that from the start.

411
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,930
It's true the game flopped.

412
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,530
I'm sure your conscience agrees with me.

413
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,070
We still have Southeast Asia and China.

414
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,139
It's hard to get an approval to launch in China,

415
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
and the Southeast Asian market only brings in chump change.

416
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,050
I can get going, then.

417
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,650
CEO Cha, wait.

418
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,450
Come on.

419
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,020
It's not like that.

420
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,319
- Excuse me. - Yes?

421
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,120
You have a call from the US on hold.

422
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,899
- Sir. - Wait, hold on.

423
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,159
Stay for a cup of coffee.

424
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,399
You came all the way here.

425
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
No, I should get going.

426
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,839
Come on! You're making me feel so bad.

427
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,969
Sit. Take a seat.

428
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,040
Just have some coffee, okay?

429
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,170
Hurry up.

430
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,570
Please sit here, Mr. Cha. My goodness.

431
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,850
Please have some coffee.

432
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,700
Isn't the coffee good?

433
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,730
It's Gesha, a top-tier coffee variety.

434
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,469
You can only buy it through the fair trade program,

435
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,070
so I love it.

436
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,610
CHACHA reminds me of this coffee variety.

437
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,810
I see.

438
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,250
But I'll be honest.

439
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,690
I came here for the 20 million dollars.

440
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Well, we can't give you 20 million dollars.

441
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,460
We told you we could double Sanin's offer.

442
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,000
Right, so it's 20 million dollars.

443
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Listen, Mr. Cha.

444
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,600
You need to understand this.

445
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,639
Who did you meet from Sanin?

446
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,670
Manager Yoon Joo No.

447
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,970
I knew it.

448
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,610
He said you'd get ten million dollars, right?

449
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,649
He lied.

450
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,180
He'd never give you ten million dollars.

451
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,880
Everyone in the industry knows...

452
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,580
that he's a swindler.

453
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,220
You said he mentioned ten million right off the bat, right?

454
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,020
That means you'll get one million dollars at the most.

455
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,460
You see,

456
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,930
we know this process very well,

457
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,170
so we just said we'd double Sanin's offer.

458
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,100
So, will it be two million?

459
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,309
Oh, please. You're hurting my feelings here.

460
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,070
We're not a bunch of thugs here.

461
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,110
Make up your mind until Director Song gets here,

462
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,879
I'll do my best to make sure you can get 2.1 million.

463
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,950
What?

464
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,490
Did you say 2.1 million?

465
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,960
Look.

466
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,089
I came here because I was offered 20 million.

467
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,959
Come on.

468
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,929
I took all this time to explain how it works.

469
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,830
What am I supposed to do if you don't understand it?

470
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,529
No one would just give you...

471
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,640
the first amount you heard.

472
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,070
Ask around. It's all decided through negotiations.

473
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,950
Forget it, then.

474
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,650
Why? Will you go to Yoon Joo No now?

475
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,690
Everyone will soon find out that the deal between us fell through.

476
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,690
Then everyone in the industry will say...

477
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,060
you're not willing to negotiate.

478
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,460
Then Yoon Joo No won't buy it either.

479
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,830
Even if he were to buy it,

480
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
he'd never give you one million.

481
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,170
At the most, you'd get 200,000 to 300,000 dollars.

482
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,979
Mr. Cha, if you can't decide,

483
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,810
you don't have to do this with us.

484
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,180
But really, trust me.

485
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,290
I guarantee you that this is the best offer you'll get.

486
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,020
If not, you can take it up with me.

487
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Let's be honest.

488
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,790
If we just go ahead and sign the agreement when it's just us two,

489
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,360
Director Song can't do anything about it.

490
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,570
Well...

491
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,210
Should I sign it now?

492
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,780
Yes.

493
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,199
Goodness. If you're not going to do it, I'll just...

494
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
No, it's not that. One moment.

495
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,810
Just a moment.

496
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,629
(Delivery King)

497
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,770
No wonder Mr. Cha is so attached to Delivery King.

498
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,200
Delivery King is like a letter to his first love.

499
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,840
That's why Ho Jin is not even interested in any other women.

500
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,310
You're right.

501
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,580
Now, I get it.

502
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,150
At first, I wondered why he worked so hard to make this.

503
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,390
Honestly, the game itself is kind of lame.

504
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,390
I told you it was lame.

505
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,360
We really have to hit the jackpot with the next one.

506
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,760
Yes.

507
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,630
Ho Jin will sign the deal today,

508
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,860
so let's hit the jackpot this time, for real.

509
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,470
So, Mr. Cha went to sign the deal?

510
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes.

511
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,810
With Sanin?

512
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,780
No.

513
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,240
It was a fund company with a foreign-sounding name.

514
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,450
Samoel?

515
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:25,720
Oh, yes. That one.

516
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,990
Call him and just tell him to hurry back here.

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Why?

518
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
Well, we need the money to get started on our next project.

519
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,490
I've heard bad things about that company.

520
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,500
Then just tell him to get the agreement and come back.

521
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,370
I'm off.

522
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,740
No, you can't leave yet.

523
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,740
Jenny, we should all go out for dinner together to welcome you.

524
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,810
I've got plans.

525
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,979
Hurry up and call Mr. Cha. Tell him to just come back.

526
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,080
Okay?

527
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,880
Yes, got it. But...

528
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
if you...

529
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,750
don't want to go out with us because of these guys,

530
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,950
we can have dinner together without these two.

531
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,090
Oh, I should tell you.

532
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,260
I like women.

533
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
What was that just now?

534
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,710
Hey, let's meet.

535
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,840
I'm really disappointed in you.

536
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,510
Let's meet up and talk.

537
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,810
General.

538
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,219
May I behead my friend today?

539
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,289
Why did he have to call me here?

540
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,620
I said we should meet halfway.

541
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,100
What is this? What's with that gaze?

542
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,340
What? Me?

543
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,370
What's wrong with my gaze?

544
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,810
Forget it. Buy me a coffee.

545
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,080
Okay.

546
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,780
Did you doubt me?

547
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,390
No, I believed you.

548
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,220
As if.

549
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,920
But does CHACHA have that much potential?

550
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,630
Enough to justify you quitting your job?

551
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Yes.

552
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,600
Their development skills are solid.

553
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,900
They could really thrive with a bit of business support.

554
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,900
- Is that right? - Yes.

555
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,210
Oh, they do need better planning strategies too.

556
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,039
But aren't those guys weird?

557
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,450
They looked like total geeks.

558
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,950
Yes, they're weird.

559
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,080
But in a way, I'd say they're innocent-minded.

560
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,190
"Innocent" isn't the word I'd use.

561
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,530
I bet you don't know Delivery King has an Easter egg.

562
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,500
Mr. Cha Ho Jin had a friend he grew up with.

563
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,040
- And? - He always had a crush on her.

564
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,310
So, the friend was a girl? Is she pretty?

565
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,680
Hey, come on.

566
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,380
Do you like every girl who's pretty?

567
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,710
If she's pretty, I'd like her more.

568
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Anyway,

569
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
he never told her how he felt.

570
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,050
He kept on hovering around her.

571
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
You know what it's like, right?

572
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,290
I sure do.

573
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,990
What does that have to do with the game?

574
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,470
Keep listening.

575
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,200
- Sit here. - Okay.

576
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
So...

577
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,379
when Cha Ho Jin and Do Han Chul first developed the game,

578
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,150
they needed someone to sing the soundtrack.

579
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,250
But they were broke, so they decided to reach out to a friend of theirs.

580
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,120
So, they called that girl.

581
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,089
But she was no longer a little girl.

582
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,130
She was in her early 20s back then.

583
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,660
His first love?

584
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
What was her name?

585
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,600
Soo Yeon. Oh Soo Yeon.

586
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,870
She was a good singer too.

587
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,470
You call that good?

588
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I thought she was quite good.

589
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,910
Seriously? Are you deaf?

590
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
Take a listen.

591
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,810
Can you hear me?

592
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,180
What? Yes.

593
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,790
- Han Chul. - Yes?

594
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,950
- We're ready. - Okay.

595
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,560
Start singing when I give you a cue, okay?

596
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,499
What will be my cue?

597
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,900
Look at my eyes, and you'll know.

598
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,340
- Ho Jin, are you ready? - Yes.

599
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,100
Okay, go.

600
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,650
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

601
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
It's fine. I like to walk.

602
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,759
I'll give you a ride. It's dangerous to walk alone.

603
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,930
I like to walk along Bulgwangcheon.

604
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,460
I do it often, so I'll be fine.

605
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,970
I see. You must live in Mangwon-dong, then.

606
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,569
I'll go with you. I want to walk too.

607
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,840
I like to walk alone while listening to music.

608
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,740
You're sure that's why, right?

609
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,039
It's not because you don't want me to tag along, is it?

610
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Pardon?

611
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,640
- If you like to walk... - Yes.

612
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,620
Okay, then. I'll respect your wishes.

613
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,790
Hey, Ho Jin.

614
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,960
I'm off.

615
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,130
All right. Good job today.

616
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,670
- Ho Jin, spare me a moment. - What?

617
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,240
Come out for a minute.

618
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,970
Hey, what's up?

619
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,800
About what we recorded today. Can I get it too?

620
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh, that. It'll be released as a digital song.

621
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,980
No, I want to take a listen before it's released.

622
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,810
You can send it to me, right?

623
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,410
Yes.

624
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,090
You seem different...

625
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,190
when you're working.

626
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,500
In the old days,

627
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,770
you always played video games. I thought it was foolish.

628
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,740
Right.

629
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,110
Why do you like games so much?

630
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,840
Because it's fine even if you fail.

631
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,750
If you fail while playing a game, you can start again.

632
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,090
I wasn't expecting that kind of answer.

633
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,330
The street light in front of my house is out too.

634
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,560
How come no one would fix them?

635
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,500
Light bulbs only last up to about 1,000 hours.

636
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,039
If they're turned on for ten hours a day,

637
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,840
it means they'll die out in 100 days.

638
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,710
So, civil servants have to change the light bulbs every three months,

639
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,080
which means you'll have to wait...

640
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,510
ninety days at the most.

641
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,480
Light bulbs only last up to 100 days?

642
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,520
It's like dating.

643
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,230
- Dating? - Yes.

644
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,600
They say your feelings are bound to fizzle out after 100 days.

645
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
- Are you like that too? - What?

646
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,240
No.

647
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,340
I'm not like that.

648
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,510
You're not like that?

649
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,920
You prefer to walk alone now, right?

650
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
What?

651
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,319
You like to walk along Bulgwangcheon alone.

652
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,490
I know that much.

653
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,930
But the street light in front of my house is out now.

654
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,200
I find it a little scary.

655
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
All right.

656
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,110
What?

657
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,740
I'll be off, then. Get home safely.

658
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,310
What?

659
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Hey.

660
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,380
Hey!

661
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,250
Don't people call you dense?

662
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,120
No, I'm incredibly quick-witted.

663
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,730
Goodbye,

664
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,890
you fool.

665
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,610
The bus will arrive shortly.

666
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,760
Why didn't he take her home?

667
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,569
Why didn't he walk her home?

668
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,970
You said he liked Soo Yeon.

669
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,770
She never asked him to walk her home.

670
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,370
What are you talking about?

671
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,980
She did.

672
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,550
When? Did she say that?

673
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,420
Hey, Soo Yeon said the street light in front of her house was out...

674
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,220
and that she was scared.

675
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,950
Right, she said that.

676
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,860
But she never asked him to walk her home.

677
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,290
- That's right. - What is with you people?

678
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,160
Also,

679
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
Soo Yeon rejected Ho Jin when he confessed his feelings.

680
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,840
What exactly did he tell her? And when?

681
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,309
Asking her to sing the soundtrack was a love confession in itself.

682
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,940
Soo Yeon isn't even a good singer.

683
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,340
And Soo Yeon said she wanted to walk along Bulgwangcheon alone,

684
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,310
so Ho Jin took his cue and left her alone.

685
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,710
That was like his second confession.

686
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,850
You guys are driving me crazy.

687
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,090
Seriously, aren't they crazy?

688
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,560
Am I the weird one?

689
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,690
No, it's them. They're weird.

690
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,900
Right?

691
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,230
When I was there, I felt like the weird one.

692
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,200
How could they say that?

693
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,840
Have you heard of any developer jokes?

694
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,350
A developer was asked to buy three apples...

695
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,950
and one watermelon if there are watermelons at the store.

696
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,350
What would the developer do?

697
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,190
Most people would buy either 3 apples and 1 watermelon...

698
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,989
or just three apples if there were no watermelons.

699
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,990
No.

700
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,460
It's wrong to make that kind of decision on your own.

701
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,459
First, you'd buy three apples.

702
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,870
Then if there are no watermelons, you must call your wife.

703
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,470
Hello?

704
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,639
I'm at the store now. I just bought apples,

705
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,780
but there are no watermelons here, so I'll check a different store.

706
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
All right.

707
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,980
You need your wife's confirmation.

708
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,620
There were watermelons at the store.

709
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,320
Then what do you think the developer did?

710
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,390
The answer can't be 3 apples and 1 watermelon.

711
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,490
That's why you're quizzing us like this, right?

712
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,099
Did he only buy three apples...

713
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,800
- and forget about the watermelon? - No.

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Soon Young!

715
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,830
He bought 1 apple and 3 watermelons because he got it mixed up.

716
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,340
- Wrong. - Darn it!

717
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,900
And you, Mr. Yoon?

718
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,970
One apple?

719
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,080
- Why one apple? - How did you know?

720
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,079
I just guessed.

721
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,810
Yes, one apple is the correct answer.

722
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,350
"Buy three apples."

723
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,460
"If there are watermelons, buy one."

724
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,630
There are watermelons at the store.

725
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,900
Then...

726
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,600
buy one.

727
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,630
That's why he bought one apple.

728
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,140
For real?

729
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,639
That's how developers think?

730
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,270
No wonder they come across as so quirky.

731
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,540
This is called a developer joke.

732
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,910
But honestly, I don't think it's a joke.

733
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:02,250
That day, Soo Yeon said she liked to walk alone,

734
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,190
- so he didn't take her home? - That's right.

735
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,820
Then what about the street light?

736
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,959
Soo Yeon gets scared when the street lights...

737
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,530
in front of her house are out,

738
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,830
so Ho Jin lights her street.

739
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,070
- Until this day. - Until this day?

740
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,970
Please look at the screen.

741
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,049
After that day,

742
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,420
Cha Ho Jin started hanging a lantern at night.

743
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,290
Come again? What did he do?

744
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,260
Every night, he hung a lantern from the light pole...

745
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,960
and collected it at dawn.

746
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,330
- For real? - Yes.

747
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,300
He did it for 100 days.

748
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,230
A hundred days? Is it how long light bulbs are supposed to last?

749
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,069
Yes, and also...

750
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,170
she started going out with Do Han Chul after about 100 days.

751
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,110
With who?

752
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,680
Oh Soo Yeon?

753
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,409
Yes.

754
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,480
How did that happen?

755
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,680
That, I'm not sure.

756
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,499
I'm going to take a short break outside.

757
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,510
Okay.

758
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,420
It's Han Chul.

759
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,060
The song is out.

760
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,390
It's in a USB.

761
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,060
I'm alone.

762
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,830
I see.

763
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,069
Ho Jin wanted me to check...

764
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,140
if it played or not.

765
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,540
All right.

766
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,419
- You came all the way here... - Yes.

767
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,449
To give me this?

768
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,320
Yes. But I need to see if it works or not.

769
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,090
Shall we go inside to check?

770
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,800
Let's do that to be sure.

771
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,699
Cha Ho Jin must've left DC...

772
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,730
for this reason.

773
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,570
And that's Oh Soo Yeon's real house, yes?

774
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,269
Yes. The Easter egg was a confession...

775
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,340
to Soo Yeon.

776
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
It's this place, right?

777
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Yes.

778
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,410
The house looks awfully alike.

779
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,710
- She must've moved, right? - She did.

780
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,790
Who are you?

781
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,690
(Yoon Joo No)

782
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,060
Are you really from Sanin?

783
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,429
Yes. We're from the M and A Team.

784
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,860
There's something we're investigating.

785
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,330
I thought you were from the real estate.

786
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,639
Some hardcore gamers would drop by.

787
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,370
I put the house up for rent to move out.

788
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,240
"Hardcore gamers?"

789
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,870
Another word for avid gamers.

790
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
I know.

791
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,810
Easter egg or whatnot.

792
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,050
Either way, the hardcore gamers always come by.

793
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,520
They claim it to be a pilgrimage.

794
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,060
It'll be fine from now on.

795
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,360
That game shut down.

796
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,490
Was High Square shut down?

797
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,200
Darn it. That's bad.

798
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,200
"High Square?"

799
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,570
Isn't it Delivery King?

800
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,040
"Delivery King?" What's that?

801
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,139
(High Square)

802
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,580
This building is named High Square.

803
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,380
They say it's because the house is on a hill.

804
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,149
But there's a game named the same...

805
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,150
made by DC.

806
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,089
I heard the background of that game was this place.

807
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,090
How did you know that?

808
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,820
The Easter egg.

809
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,330
Isn't that what brought you here?

810
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,100
You're talking about High Square's Easter egg, right?

811
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,930
Yes.

812
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,070
Is there Easter egg other than that?

813
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,900
The game Delivery King also used this place as the background.

814
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,910
What? There's another game?

815
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,580
Who on earth made that game?

816
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,280
So this place was also High Square's background.

817
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,490
That tree must be a cherry tree.

818
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,890
Yes. It's really pretty in the spring.

819
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:21,500
High Square.

820
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,500
It's DC's killer content.

821
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,330
The story is simple.

822
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,470
One knight lives in a town named Buddha's Light.

823
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,739
You'll find out the reason for the name...

824
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,540
toward the end.

825
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,479
Anyway, the princess of that town...

826
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,180
gets kidnapped by monsters.

827
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,980
She is held captive at the top of the castle.

828
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:42,420
To save the princess, the knight enters the castle,

829
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,149
kills all the monsters,

830
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,890
and gets her out of there.

831
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,460
Well, the story is quite cliche.

832
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,060
But the game itself is really fun.

833
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,700
Simple is the best. It's the ultimate truth.

834
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,129
Did you know that an Easter egg is hidden...

835
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,130
in High Square?

836
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,200
Look at the character standing before the unlit lamp.

837
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,970
Before this character enters the castle,

838
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,940
you can see that's the only unlit lamp.

839
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,510
Get closer to it,

840
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,650
and you're told to write something.

841
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,590
Once you write "light on,"

842
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,850
ta-da.

843
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,420
You're given a kerosene lamp.

844
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,660
The name of this kerosene lamp is Buddha's Light.

845
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,160
You now understand why the town is called Buddha's Light, right?

846
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,930
And what are you to do with the lamp?

847
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,470
If you light it up, the background music changes.

848
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,370
Do you hear the humming?

849
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,770
It's this very music.

850
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,940
Other than that, it's useless.

851
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,610
But it's cool, isn't it?

852
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,149
Easter eggs are hidden traces...

853
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,710
that developers leave behind, right?

854
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,679
Developers do it for fun...

855
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,119
or to add meaning,

856
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,990
but it's often used to hide their traces.

857
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,859
If Cha Ho Jin's Easter egg...

858
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,990
is hidden in High Square,

859
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,230
doesn't that mean Cha Ho Jin is the developer of High Square?

860
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,999
That's true.

861
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,129
But DC's Do Han Chul also has memorable moments...

862
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,830
of that rooftop house.

863
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,800
He went out with Oh Soo Yeon living in that place.

864
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,139
Do Han Chul wouldn't have known...

865
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,810
Cha Ho Jin was holding a lantern outside the window.

866
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,410
Even if he did know,

867
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,810
the one holding the lantern outside...

868
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,150
was Cha Ho Jin.

869
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,680
Right.

870
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,389
Both the Delivery King holding a lantern outside the window...

871
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,890
and the knight lighting up the lamp in High Square...

872
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,130
are Cha Ho Jin.

873
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,099
Do Han Chul copied that...

874
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,160
without knowing it.

875
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,970
It's like even copying the typos when plagiarizing a thesis.

876
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,339
Cha Ho Jin's program...

877
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,970
had no traces of hacking, right?

878
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,140
You're right.

879
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,080
All traces are left in the blockchain or whatnot.

880
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,080
But there weren't any.

881
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,950
You scared me.

882
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,690
There was no hacking, but the Easter egg was there.

883
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,889
That means the program wasn't copied or hacked into.

884
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,720
The hard drive was stolen as a whole.

885
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,959
That was why...

886
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,360
Cha Ho Jin sued for theft rather than plagiarism.

887
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,269
Buddha's Light, the town in High Square, must be...

888
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,140
talking about this place, Bulgwang.

889
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,040
It means Buddha's light.

890
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,580
Do they mean the same thing?

891
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,610
Yes. Bul for Buddha and gwang for light.

892
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,080
Oh Soo Yeon liked walking along the Bulgwangcheon.

893
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,350
I get why Cha Ho Jin hates pivoting.

894
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,660
High Square, created out of yearning for his first love, got stolen,

895
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,790
and Delivery King flopped.

896
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,629
The photo of a woman on CEO Cha's desk...

897
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,500
and the princess in High Square must be the same person.

898
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,250
My brothers. See the vibe of this must-eat place?

899
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,720
I can tell this place is at least over 30 years old.

900
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,220
This place is legit. For real.

901
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,890
See this? Toothpicks made of starch.

902
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,520
These small props...

903
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,929
are what decides a must-eat place's vibe.

904
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,730
You get it, right? All right.

905
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,529
I'll be trying spicy kalguksu.

906
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,200
- Goodness. - Oh, no. I'm digging in.

907
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,769
I'm okay.

908
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:20,770
- Listen. - Yes?

909
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,240
You can't shoot in here.

910
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,710
Give me a minute.

911
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,510
- Are you the owner? - Yes.

912
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,210
This is no biggie.

913
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,109
I heard your kalguksu was great.

914
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,380
I'm here to promote it.

915
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,750
I'm shooting it in selfie mode.

916
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,790
If you look at my live stream,

917
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,689
over 10,000 people...

918
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,890
- are watching it. - I don't care about the views.

919
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,090
We don't let anyone shoot in here.

920
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,660
- You don't? - No.

921
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,830
Leave. You don't need to pay for it.

922
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,660
All right. I'll leave.

923
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,100
Let's go, Brothers.

924
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,240
I'm leaving.

925
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,970
Good grief.

926
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,540
The place won't let me shoot.

927
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,880
I heard rumors this place was good.

928
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,409
But the owner is very unpleasant.

929
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,579
- Goodness. - If you ask me for the address...

930
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,279
in the comment section, I'll let you know.

931
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,650
Don't come here, okay?

932
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,190
Listen, ma'am.

933
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,389
Those kids are practically a TV station.

934
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,830
It'll help with your business.

935
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:19,090
- Even so, I hate it. - Welcome.

936
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,959
But you run a business.

937
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,770
They want to spend money on you. You should endure it.

938
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,870
Just dig into the kalguksu.

939
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,670
- Gosh. - Goodness gracious.

940
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,909
There's no way the owner would know...

941
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,610
how fast the world is changing.

942
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,810
She told us to dig into the kalguksu, so let's eat.

943
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,550
I'm sure it'll help with her business. How weird of her.

944
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,460
By any chance,

945
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,160
are you still against...

946
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,030
e-commerce?

947
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,400
Are other companies making money?

948
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,700
Some have started to,

949
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,469
while others haven't.

950
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,740
Forget it, then.

951
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,270
Mark my words.

952
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,710
Those companies...

953
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,740
will fail one day.

954
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,710
Just wait and see.

955
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,660
Take care.

956
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,670
Bye.

957
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:57,960
Congratulations.

958
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,330
I heard you got a better offer.

959
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,800
Yes, well...

960
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,570
I did.

961
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,580
Delivery King was fun. Will it shut down?

962
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,980
People like you are known to see the whole world as money.

963
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,250
Why do you think so?

964
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,060
Honestly,

965
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,890
I signed the contract with Samoel.

966
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,560
Did you get twice the amount from Samoel?

967
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,100
Did you really try Delivery King?

968
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,110
You see my username?

969
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,540
White Snake.

970
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,050
"White Snake?"

971
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,020
I'm currently playing High Square.

972
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,750
I haven't finished it yet,

973
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,460
but I've found the Easter egg.

974
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
That's why I came to see you today.

975
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,230
If I were in your shoes,

976
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,700
I couldn't have made the same decision.

977
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,970
The game you devoted your life to creating got stolen.

978
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,279
But that very game became a hit at the hands of the man...

979
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,840
who stole your first love.

980
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,510
And that man keeps getting in your way.

981
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,880
You said...

982
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,720
you love games because you can keep trying, right?

983
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,030
But not everyone can do that.

984
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,360
I...

985
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,100
simply did what I wanted.

986
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,400
I couldn't have done the same.

987
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:52,810
I'm sorry.

988
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,940
For what?

989
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,950
This and that.

990
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,480
I went off the grid.

991
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,680
It's okay.

992
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,690
And I signed Samoel's contract.

993
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,360
That hurts a bit.

994
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,360
But I'm sure it was a decision you made for yourself.

995
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,900
Excuse me first.

996
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,940
Can...

997
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,710
the contract be nullified?

998
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,180
If you already signed it,

999
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,320
there must be a penalty clause.

1000
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,890
I doubt CHACHA can cover that amount.

1001
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,890
You're right.

1002
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,390
I don't know what kind of contract you signed with Samoel,

1003
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,960
but I hope you continue making games.

1004
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,630
I like your games.

1005
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,400
They're fun.

1006
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,770
I’ll be looking forward to it.

1007
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:13,860
CHACHA Games. There's got to be a way.

1008
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,590
It's one heartbreaking story, right?

1009
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:18,990
You're right.

1010
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,030
Can't Mr. Yoon have a meeting with CEO Cha?

1011
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,370
Great idea.

1012
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,470
As long as CEO Cha didn't sign the contract, there must be a way.

1013
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,970
Right?

1014
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,380
CEO Cha signed for 2.1 million dollars.

1015
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,150
How frustrating.

1016
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,690
CHACHA signed the contract...

1017
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,120
with another company.

1018
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,290
I'm sorry.

1019
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,460
With where?

1020
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,100
But why are you apologizing?

1021
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,000
To think even you'd get played.

1022
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,110
I know. It just happened.

1023
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,980
I'll let the chairman know.

1024
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,910
No. I haven't given up yet.

1025
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,650
As you already know,

1026
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,749
if you think it'll fail, the faster the report,

1027
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:18,990
the easier it is to settle.

1028
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,020
Can it be settled out?

1029
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,620
Right.

1030
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,529
If it can't be settled,

1031
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,160
everything possible should be done.

1032
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,830
Yes. I'll get in touch again.

1033
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,370
Mr. Yoon.

1034
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,180
I have something to tell you.

1035
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,280
All right. Take a seat.

1036
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,319
Actually, when you told me...

1037
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,260
to play Delivery King until the end,

1038
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,390
I suspected you were doing it on purpose...

1039
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,230
since I was against buying it...

1040
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,060
and couldn't...

1041
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,170
I didn't finish it.

1042
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,370
That's a reasonable suspicion.

1043
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,140
Like you wanted me to,

1044
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,239
had I finished the game...

1045
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,840
and seen the ending video,

1046
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,580
we could've persuaded CHACHA.

1047
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
I'm sorry.

1048
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,720
CHACHA Games...

1049
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,620
was offered a better deal than ours.

1050
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,730
Getting them to sign our contract was tough from the start.

1051
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,760
Don't be disappointed too much.

1052
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,740
Mr. Yoon. CHACHA Games...

1053
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,140
was sold to Samoel.

1054
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:48,940
I know.

1055
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,180
How did you know?

1056
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,880
Last night, I met with CEO Cha Ho Jin.

1057
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,390
He told me back then.

1058
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,320
How much was the offer?

1059
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,590
It was 2.1 million dollars.

1060
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,130
I got played.

1061
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,469
I'm sorry.

1062
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,570
No. It's not over yet.

1063
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,939
Samoel will get in touch...

1064
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,510
to sell it to us.

1065
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,210
How did you know CHACHA was sold?

1066
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
What?

1067
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:26,050
Jenny told me.

1068
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:32,220
I was wondering who was leaking our information.

1069
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,560
No. Jenny isn't that kind of person.

1070
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,690
She's quite kindhearted.

1071
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,610
I'm talking about the M and A.

1072
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,840
We're trying to buy the company that made this game.

1073
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,510
Why buy that company?

1074
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,780
That jerk...

1075
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,820
Mr. Yoon. Assistant Manager Im is the culprit.

1076
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,660
Who is he?

1077
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,129
That punk sees others as simply bad...

1078
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,630
and himself as complexly good.

1079
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,270
He's a senior from college.

1080
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,970
When he asked what our team was doing,

1081
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,500
I told him we were trying to buy CHACHA Games.

1082
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,180
Jin Soo.

1083
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,140
Listen carefully.

1084
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,620
Good grief.

1085
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,550
He's getting scolded again.

1086
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,420
It must be tough for him.

1087
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,540
What's wrong? Did you get scolded again?

1088
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,610
No, I wasn't.

1089
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,770
Mr. Yoon is giving up.

1090
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,410
- Give up what? - CHACHA Games.

1091
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,550
He's not buying it.

1092
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,310
I see.

1093
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,950
Did another company buy it?

1094
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,260
Can't you buy it back from them?

1095
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,359
Mr. Yoon is a pro at it.

1096
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,960
It's not his money he's spending.

1097
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,400
Mr. Yoon...

1098
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,930
is giving up e-commerce as a whole.

1099
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,340
Seriously?

1100
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,400
Yes.

1101
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,510
He's giving up on everything.

1102
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,340
Let's give CHACHA Games another shot.

1103
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,350
How?

1104
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,980
First,

1105
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,680
we should find out CHACHA Games' interest.

1106
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,350
Come in.

1107
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,320
I didn't know you were having lunch.

1108
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:49,860
Hi.

1109
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:53,830
Hi.

1110
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,670
Please excuse me.

1111
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,410
- CEO Cha. - Yes?

1112
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,210
Don't you want to make games again?

1113
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:17,220
How?

1114
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,419
CEO Cha will accept our offer...

1115
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,690
as long as he can create games.

1116
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,820
Games are meaningful to Cha Ho Jin.

1117
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,029
It's love.

1118
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,530
I agree with that.

1119
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,860
But what about the contract with Samoel?

1120
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:35,740
If...

1121
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,610
he's giving up on e-commerce as a whole,

1122
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,370
CHACHA Games is useless now, right?

1123
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:43,080
Of course. Who would buy a flopped game?

1124
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,550
Right. I see.

1125
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,220
I need to go now.

1126
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Hyeong Seop.

1127
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,330
It's that way.

1128
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,230
I was going to take a detour.

1129
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,580
(Sanin)

1130
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
Are you sure?

1131
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,960
Yes, I heard it from the intern of the M and A Team.

1132
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,700
Yoon Joo No will give up on going into the e-commerce.

1133
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,529
Could he be faking this?

1134
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:38,070
No, I don't think he is.

1135
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,630
How do you know that?

1136
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,700
Are you on social media?

1137
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:47,140
I'll send something over to you. Please wait.

1138
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,980
(Do Han Chul)

1139
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,910
Then let's tell Yoon Joo No...

1140
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,750
you'll sell it for ten million dollars.

1141
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,320
That was the price he wanted initially.

1142
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,090
You want me to do it?

1143
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:02,460
I can't exactly make the offer to him.

1144
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,590
I'm sorry.

1145
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,429
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Yoon.

1146
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,270
This is David from Samoel Fund.

1147
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,200
Oh, yes. Hello.

1148
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,810
I'll go straight to the point.

1149
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,539
I heard you were interested in a gaming company these days.

1150
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,879
As it so happens, we know a great gaming company.

1151
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,050
So I wanted to make the introduction.

1152
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:27,050
That sounds great. Which company is it?

1153
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,950
Well, this is off the record.

1154
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,590
Oh, wait. If it is CHACHA Games, I'm not interested.

1155
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,260
If it's a different company, do make the introduction.

1156
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,490
You're not interested in CHACHA Games?

1157
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,130
No.

1158
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,860
Our team also reviewed the company.

1159
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,800
But the value of the company was disappointing.

1160
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,530
There are better and bigger companies.

1161
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,500
I don't see any reason to go with them.

1162
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,170
You mean DC Games?

1163
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,170
No comment.

1164
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,980
I see.

1165
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,410
Have a good day then.

1166
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,400
Let's go.

1167
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,060
Hold on.

1168
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,400
Thank you. Seriously.

1169
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,970
Thank you so much.

1170
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,540
So...

1171
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:25,469
Sanin Group will give us ten million dollars, right?

1172
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,810
Wait, no.

1173
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,139
Expecting its value to reach ten million dollars,

1174
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,740
we'll invest 300,000 dollars.

1175
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,880
What?

1176
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,180
Hold on. What is this White Snake saying?

1177
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,789
CHACHA Games already sold Delivery King to Samoel Fund...

1178
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:39,450
for 210,000 dollars.

1179
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,360
If Sanin were to buy your game for ten million dollars,

1180
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,290
the executives of the company would be bound to suspect me.

1181
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,360
On top of that, the board won't approve it either.

1182
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,560
What? Look.

1183
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,370
You promised me ten million dollars.

1184
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,570
You said we could develop our game.

1185
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,070
Yes. I'll make that happen.

1186
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,910
You said you would only give us 300,000 dollars.

1187
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,370
Right.

1188
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:04,350
I'll get the capital for your game from someone else.

1189
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:06,680
From who?

1190
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,589
- Okay. The key is inside. - Hello.

1191
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,960
- Sure. I'll take care of it. - Yes.

1192
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,700
- We're not late. - No, we're not.

1193
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,040
Hello, Mr. Do Han Chul. Congratulations on your wedding.

1194
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,580
If you don't mind, could we talk for a moment?

1195
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,640
Who am I speaking to?

1196
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,980
Oh, right. I'm representing...

1197
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,280
CHACHA Games in the lawsuit.

1198
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,320
My name is Oh Soon Young.

1199
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,490
Since both games have the same Easter egg,

1200
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,130
I can easily prove that they were developed by the same person.

1201
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,830
Wouldn't you agree?

1202
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,530
- Are you recording this? - What?

1203
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,140
No.

1204
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,040
I'm just curious about your opinion as a developer.

1205
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,240
Well, I could agree.

1206
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,580
But that doesn't matter.

1207
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,010
The judge has to see it that way.

1208
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,310
Right.

1209
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,950
But you see,

1210
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,819
the judges are so busy with their work.

1211
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,990
I doubt they had time to play games.

1212
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,559
Besides, they were busy studying when they were in school.

1213
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,690
It's obvious that they barely got to play games.

1214
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,160
I bet they were thrown off by this Easter egg.

1215
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,170
Thanks to that, you won the first trial. Didn't you?

1216
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,669
What's your point?

1217
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:36,670
Hear me out.

1218
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,539
What a surprise turn of events.

1219
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,140
You see, I filed for a retrial.

1220
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,979
The name of the assigned judge is Cho Yong Hoon.

1221
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,050
You should look him up.

1222
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,910
Judge Cho Yong Hoon.

1223
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,080
He's one of the high rankers in StarCraft.

1224
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,389
That explains it. When there was...

1225
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,749
a match-fixing scandal in an esports game,

1226
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,720
he was the one who ruled that the match was fixed.

1227
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:57,390
So...

1228
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,860
I'm sure he'd be very interested in our case as well.

1229
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,339
Actually, he and I played StarCraft a lot together.

1230
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,640
(Images: Cho Yong Hoon)

1231
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,739
Here's what he did at the beginning of our game.

1232
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,439
Instead of making offense units,

1233
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,540
he built a base in the front yard.

1234
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,250
He went with the strategy to secure materials.

1235
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,350
My gosh. A top-tier gamer was indeed different.

1236
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
So...

1237
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,490
my friend, Yong Hoon... Wait, no. I shouldn't call him that.

1238
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,460
Judge Cho just might...

1239
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,830
give us a different ruling for the retrial. Don't you agree?

1240
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,540
So what are you thinking?

1241
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,140
What do you want?

1242
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,980
It's to settle.

1243
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,940
What are the terms?

1244
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:52,050
A ten-million-dollar settlement.

1245
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,280
And ten percent of High Square.

1246
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,249
I'm fine with the settlement money. But the shares...

1247
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,690
That's just absurd.

1248
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,890
At my first visit to CHACHA Games,

1249
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,790
I noticed the security camera at the wall.

1250
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,900
I...

1251
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,369
I found it a bit odd. I still don't understand it.

1252
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,370
Did you do it yourself?

1253
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,239
Do what?

1254
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,739
You knew that Mr. Cha would be able to find traces of anyone...

1255
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,480
who accessed the program via blockchain, right?

1256
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,540
So you couldn't have hacked into his computer.

1257
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:26,150
That's why you climbed over the wall yourself...

1258
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,550
and stole the hard drive. That's how the story goes, right?

1259
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,390
Do you have proof?

1260
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,290
Well, it's clear that the same guy created both games.

1261
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,730
You stole the game without hacking into his computer.

1262
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,560
Then...

1263
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,330
isn't it reasonable to conclude that you stole it yourself?

1264
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,200
Given your reputation,

1265
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,900
if someone in DC Games knew about it,

1266
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,670
they would have blown the whistle.

1267
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:54,040
But no one did.

1268
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,550
Do you believe that's proof?

1269
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,379
Yong Hoon loves cases like this.

1270
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,980
Well, that's grand larceny.

1271
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,049
You'll serve a minimum of 1 year, up to a maximum of 10 years.

1272
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,490
Aggravated punishment will also be imposed on you.

1273
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,190
You'll definitely serve over a year in prison.

1274
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:11,690
Smile.

1275
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,260
So your prison sentence will be over a year.

1276
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:19,930
Sir.

1277
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,170
I think you should...

1278
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,740
postpone this wedding.

1279
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
Ten percent.

1280
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,320
Okay.

1281
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,920
I got it.

1282
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,290
Get lost now.

1283
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,960
- Thank you very much. - Okay.

1284
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,900
Mr. Do.

1285
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,940
I remembered something when you told me to get lost.

1286
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,040
I'm going to add in a special clause.

1287
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,310
"Around the time CHACHA Games is to launch a new game,"

1288
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,909
"DC Games will not launch any new game..."

1289
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,850
"or hold any other events. They will just get lost."

1290
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:13,320
You released a press release that you made up with CHACHA Games.

1291
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,090
Congratulations on the wedding.

1292
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,970
Congratulations on the wedding.

1293
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,400
Okay. Bye.

1294
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,410
He's leaving.

1295
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,680
- Take care. Bye. - Bye.

1296
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,290
We just need the chairman's green light.

1297
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,759
I thought he already gave you the green light.

1298
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,160
Yes. Wait, I mean...

1299
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:59,870
I need to get his approval now.

1300
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,400
My goodness.

1301
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,610
Why don't we get some ice cream?

1302
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,310
What kind of ice cream?

1303
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,839
I had it while hiking with the chairman.

1304
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,479
- Gosh, not this one. - Here you go.

1305
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,480
Get something else.

1306
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,149
This was on sale up until yesterday.

1307
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,650
But it was good.

1308
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,050
Gosh, it feels like we're losing money for some reason.

1309
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,319
They'll probably go on sale again at some point.

1310
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,690
Have it then. Okay?

1311
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,440
Joo No.

1312
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,740
I might have misunderstood the chairman.

1313
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,210
I thought the chairman was against the e-commerce industry...

1314
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,949
because it came with a risk...

1315
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,810
and he didn't fully understand the industry.

1316
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,420
Perhaps, that could have been the case a long time ago.

1317
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,490
But that might not be the case now.

1318
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:01,800
The chairman might be regretting his decision then.

1319
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:06,200
So he regrets not buying Collection when he should have...

1320
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,770
and thinks that he blew his chance?

1321
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,270
Yes.

1322
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,040
He had a chance to buy it for ten million dollars.

1323
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,550
It's my guess that this lost chance could be stopping him.

1324
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,750
You're talking about the anchoring effect.

1325
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,380
Yes.

1326
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:24,619
(A phenomenon in which initial information shapes decisions)

1327
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,090
Did you already spot that?

1328
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,390
Is that why you offered ten million dollars to CHACHA Games?

1329
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,230
I wasn't aware of it.

1330
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,730
I just thought...

1331
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,600
it was wise not to go over that amount.

1332
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,670
I thought that spending...

1333
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:41,400
more than ten million dollars would be acknowledging...

1334
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,640
the chairman's mistake.

1335
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,440
How's the term for this deal?

1336
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,450
Sir, Team Manager Yoon Joo No is here.

1337
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,889
The term is to buy 30 percent of the shares for 300,000 dollars...

1338
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,590
with the expectation that it will reach ten million dollars.

1339
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,090
My gosh.

1340
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,860
- It's worth ten million dollars? - Yes.

1341
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:09,559
I'd like to put in writing that...

1342
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,659
we will have the right of first refusal...

1343
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,270
to buy 19 percent before any other companies.

1344
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,770
A game, you say...

1345
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,440
Will it be a hit?

1346
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,640
Yes.

1347
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,480
How big?

1348
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,779
The value of a new game in the gaming industry...

1349
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,310
cannot be estimated before its release.

1350
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,380
There could be a hundredfold profit.

1351
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,450
Or it could lead to a loss.

1352
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:34,759
But one fact is that CHACHA Games received financial aid...

1353
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,560
of ten million dollars to develop a new game from DC Games.

1354
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:40,730
- A financial aid? - Yes.

1355
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,630
They received the fund with no strings attached.

1356
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,070
My gosh. Why would DC Games do that?

1357
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,470
I don't know.

1358
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,970
What we have to know is that even if their next game fails,

1359
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,940
CHACHA Games won't face any loss.

1360
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,480
Then why don't we just acquire the company?

1361
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,080
Why buy only 49 percent?

1362
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,780
Do I not have enough money for it?

1363
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,150
CHACHA Games must hold 51 percent of the company,

1364
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,260
so they will have a sense of ownership and work hard.

1365
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:13,529
In my opinion, that will help our company in the end.

1366
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,200
Goodness, do you think I don't know that?

1367
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,330
If we demand more than 51 percent,

1368
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,340
I believe this deal will not go through.

1369
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:31,980
Buy it then.

1370
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,880
Yes, sir.

1371
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,140
How did you manage to sort out the contract with Samoel Fund?

1372
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:05,749
If Samoel Fund requested to cancel the contract,

1373
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,650
wouldn't they have to pay you the penalty?

1374
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,720
Usually, but that's not what it said in the contract.

1375
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,590
I'm not so knowledgeable about contract terms.

1376
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,960
I received the contract nullification certificate.

1377
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,200
I see.

1378
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:29,940
Okay.

1379
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,690
Now that our deal has gone through,

1380
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,530
let me treat you to a meal.

1381
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:54,759
Sure.

1382
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,860
This time, we'll enjoy your generosity.

1383
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,900
Yes!

1384
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,270
I have a question.

1385
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,479
Sure.

1386
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,239
You ordered us jjam-jjamyeon the other day.

1387
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,550
Is there a reason behind that?

1388
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,320
We could have both jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

1389
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,419
We could make games and run a platform.

1390
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,790
Was that like a metaphor of your message?

1391
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:24,890
Let's just call it that.

1392
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,360
Mr. Cha, I also have a question.

1393
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,630
Sure.

1394
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,569
Did you really...

1395
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,640
hang the lantern every single day for 100 days?

1396
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,740
Yes.

1397
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,540
Then I have a follow-up question.

1398
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,450
The light bulbs are good for 100 days.

1399
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,949
Since they switched the light bulbs every three months,

1400
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:53,320
the light bulbs must have been out only for ten days at max.

1401
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,290
But how did you end up doing that for 100 days?

1402
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,300
Hey, the customer is pestering me about when the package will arrive.

1403
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,370
You left a while ago. How come you haven't delivered it?

1404
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,469
Hey, the package was already delayed.

1405
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,170
If you don't deliver it on time, the customer will throw a fit.

1406
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,800
I'm on my way.

1407
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,940
But I took the wrong path.

1408
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,580
You fool. You haven't still learned the streets here?

1409
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,979
Don't curse at me. I'm trying my best.

1410
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:19,980
What?

1411
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,350
Hey.

1412
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,220
Are you the one who's been breaking the light bulb?

1413
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,590
I'm sorry.

1414
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,460
I don't know.

1415
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,270
I guess the civil servants didn't do their job.

1416
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,870
Well, may I ask you a question too?

1417
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,540
This is for the developers.

1418
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:50,179
I was supposed to go to a Chinese restaurant with my friend.

1419
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,440
But he's running a bit late.

1420
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:54,049
So he asked me to order proactively for him.

1421
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,420
This is his order.

1422
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,249
"Order three bowls of jjajangmyeon."

1423
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,050
"But if tangsuyuk is on the menu, order one."

1424
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,050
All right. How would you order for your friend?

1425
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,020
Tangsuyuk is on the menu.

1426
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,720
Naturally, I'd order only one bowl of jjajangmyeon.

1427
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:11,199
So that was true.

1428
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,200
What do you mean?

1429
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,200
How do their brain...

1430
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,870
You have such a smart brain.

1431
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,740
- That's what I was going to say. - Yes.

1432
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,410
No. I would order only one bowl of jjajangmyeon for myself.

1433
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,640
Why would I listen to someone who's running late?

1434
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,880
Besides,

1435
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,780
jjajangmyeon won't taste good if the noodles get soggy.

Right?

1437
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,390
- Yes, that's right. - Yes.

1438
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:35,459
No, you have to order one bowl of jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

1439
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,790
Here's why. The conditions...

1440
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,759
By the way, has anyone figured out...

1441
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,400
the Easter egg in Delivery King?

1442
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:47,430
No.

1443
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,500
I think it will stay that way.

1444
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,010
- Stop eating. You should leave. - No.

1445

Ms. Han.

1449
01:23:45,361 --> 01:23:47,389
This is the last story of this week's top stories.

1450
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,160
Yes. There have been some changes in the stock price of DC Games.

1451
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,069
It almost hit the ceiling, didn't it?

1452
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:53,170
- Yes. - What's the reason behind it?

1453
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,899
There was news of a possible merger or acquisition involving Sanin.

1454
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,469
But it was found groundless, correct?

1455
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,670
Yes, so the stock price did go down.

1456
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,980
But it indicates anticipation of future prospects with DC Games.

1457
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,880
Regardless of that, Sanin chose to partner up with CHACHA Games.

1458
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,450
Pardon?

1459
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,920
Yes. Sanin invested in CHACHA Games, not DC Games.

1460
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,319
Yes.

1461
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,950
It's a rare moment where even Ms. Han makes a mistake.

1462

Yes.

1470

You're in charge of covering Sanin, right?

1480
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,350
Why do you ask? Are you going to take revenge?

1481
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,690
What revenge?

Then Sanin could go bankrupt...

1488

or someone else could be the largest shareholder?

1489
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,270
Right. That's possible.

1490

But Sanin seems to be hanging in there.

1491

Isn't this a failed acquisition?

1497
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,490
Even so, it's only ten million dollars.

1498
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:54,220
That won't be enough for its stock price to budge.

We can get WIND listed.
