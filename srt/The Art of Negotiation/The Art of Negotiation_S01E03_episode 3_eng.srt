♫  Because money takes the heart, money takes the heart  ♫

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,110
♫  Money takes the heart away  ♫

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,840
   

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,100
How much did we sell last month?

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,890
A little less than...

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,740
300 million won.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,630
If we sell 900,000 won more today, we'll get a bonus.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,480
What a shame.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,650
Maybe we can?

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,470
Have you seen a man in a suit buy a washing machine?

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,300
I suppose.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,940
I'll send him away.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,760
Let's just go home.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,340
Sir, are you looking for something?

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,650
Are you closed for the day?

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,380
No, you can take your time looking around.

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,640
That's a relief.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,120
Could I ask you something?

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,250
Sure. What is your question?

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,970
I have to buy a washing machine and a dishwasher.

29
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,240
Oh, is that so?

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,470
Our bestselling washing machine is the one you're looking at.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,000
And for the dishwasher...

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,730
Here. This is the best one.

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,140
How much are they?

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,110
The washing machine is 810,000 won,

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,400
and the dishwasher is 450,000 won.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,500
So, for both, it would be 1.26 million won.

37
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,370
I was told to stay under 1 million won.

38
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,730
Oh, by your wife?

39
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,140
Yes, including a microwave as well.

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,200
That would be hard for us to do.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,360
I suppose.

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,770
That'd be like getting an employee discount,

43
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,260
right?

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,250
Well, I suppose so.

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,060
You need to close, right?

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,690
Is there another store around here—

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,140
Wait, Sir.

48
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,330
Why don't you try calling your wife?

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,870
We are giving a special discount

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,190
for residents of Astro Apartment.

51
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,940
Do you live there?

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,890
No.

53
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,870
Even if you aren't, we can give you a discount

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,120
and include the microwave for 1.2 million won.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,220
You can't get that price at any other stores.

56
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm here in this area

57
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,290
for the first time to meet someone.

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,060
Give me a moment.

59
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,190
I need to rush since I'm not used to this area.

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,080
Then you won't be back here?

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Yes, never.

62
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,040
A washing machine, dishwasher, and microwave.

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,820
Is this correct?

64
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,740
This is the lowest price since our store opened.

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,490
Thank you. I'll spread the word.

66
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,270
 Thank you. 

67
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,290
- Have a good day. 
 -  Thank you. 

68
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,250
Goodbye.

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,860
 Sanin Construction was acquired by Bium D&amp;I, right? 

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,610
 It was the largest acquisition this year. 

71
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,940
 Yes. It seems to be a move 

72
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,790
 to maintain financial stability. 

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,640
However, Construction was Sanin's main industry.

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,930
Are there any concerns?

75
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,020
The stock price initially dropped significantly,

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,400
but it seems to be stabilizing at around 110,000 won.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,900
- It didn't drop as much as I'd expected. 
 - No.

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,780
It's due to the expectation that Sanin will gain

79
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,460
new momentum after securing cash flow.

80
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,370
A new momentum...

81
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,530
Do we know what direction it will take?

82
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,800
No, nothing specific has been revealed yet,

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,010
but I'll look into it.

84
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,870
Yes, thank you for your report.

85
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,250
Reporter Han Ji Eun from Jungang Economic News.

86
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,360
This is all the news we have for you today.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,180
Thank you.

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Okay. Great work, everyone.

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
Great work, everyone.

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,900
 Great work, everyone. 

91
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,410
Do you really not know?

92
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,220
I have some stocks there.

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,370
Oh, Sanin?

94
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,180
They're not looking too good over there.

95
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,450
Then should I sell my stocks?

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,250
They'll go under.

97
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,170
   

98
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,250
   

99
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,990
   

100
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,920
   

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,590
   

102
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,030
Yes?

103
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,800
Here, give it to me.

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,870
We meet again.

105
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,410
Oh, hello.

106
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,030
You know, I live in this neighborhood.

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,470
When I start my shift with a customer from here,

108
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,300
I have good luck.

109
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,500
Sometimes, I even get long-distance passengers.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,530
I see.

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,400
I guess you like games.

112
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,330
Yes.

113
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,040
This is actually for work.

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,490
I see.

115
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,670
You don't need to worry about me.

116
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,960
It's true.

117
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,160
It really is...

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,980
 E-commerce began in the 1990s 

119
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,750
and experienced explosive growth in the 2010s

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,860
as smartphones became popular.

121
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,380
In 2017, the sales surpassed offline stores,

122
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,590
and it's clear it will continue to grow.

123
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,670
Thus, Sanin's entry into the e-commerce market is—

124
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,510
Mr. Yun.

125
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,810
What are you doing right now?

126
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,050
The chairman already said no to this.

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,200
Don't you think you're overstepping your boundaries?

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,850
I guess he wants to challenge the owner.

129
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,140
What I'm trying to say is that Sanin's problem

130
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,190
isn't simple. It's systematic.

131
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,420
Well, that's for us to decide.

132
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,820
This isn't something for you to be speaking about.

133
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,910
Do you think e-commerce is a joke?

134
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,700
Hear him out a bit longer.

135
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,560
Mr. Lee,

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,360
you tried this before, and it didn't work out.

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,350
That was because I was lacking in many ways.

138
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,390
But I guess Mr. Yun's opinion is similar to mine.

139
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,960
Exactly.

140
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,200
We can't afford to have another failure like that.

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,690
Mr. Yun, do you believe you can pull this off?

142
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,230
Yes. That's why—

143
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,850
The key to e-commerce is the platform.

144
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,210
But platforms tend to have strong user lock-ins.

145
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,680
Once they start, they keep using it.

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,300
They rarely switch.

147
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,050
Yet, you want us to take that market?

148
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,220
How?

149
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,770
As you said, consumers tend to use

150
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,040
the platform they start with.

151
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,890
They're very loyal.

152
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,580
As Naver and Coupang continue to dominate the market

153
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,760
with ongoing fierce competition.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,440
Even these dominant players are competing fiercely,

155
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,690
but you think we stand a chance?

156
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,560
Yes.

157
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,730
The company with the upper hand is expected to

158
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,380
raise shipping or subscription fees to make up for

159
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,340
low-profit margins from prolonged price wars.

160
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,980
They fought fiercely and won.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,330
- They should have their reward. 
 - Yes.

162
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,200
I believe that is an opportunity for us.

163
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,800
How is that an opportunity? That's just game over.

164
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,570
Are you saying we have a chance if we go up

165
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,450
against a company that just finished fighting?

166
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,630
That's right.

167
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,310
Also, the e-commerce market recently

168
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,370
is shifting from a platform battle to a logistics one.

169
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,460
It's also a chance for Sanin with strong logistics.

170
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,640
Lowering prices and

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,350
speeding up delivery are about logistics.

172
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,540
Thus, entering the e-commerce market

173
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,110
is a new opportunity for Sanin,

174
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,820
as well as a strategy for its survival.

175
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,400
Sanin Retail's main product is Bareun Lifestyle,

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,560
and Sanin Fashion's main product is the SPA brand,

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,330
but their sales are mostly on the decline.

178
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,680
It's because most key products

179
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,250
have shifted to e-commerce.

180
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,080
Other affiliates are in a similar situation.

181
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,070
As the e-commerce market grows,

182
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,070
this trend will only intensify.

183
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,440
Thus, now is both the right time

184
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,560
and the deadline.

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,610
So how exactly will we sell products online?

186
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,860
Are we Naver?

187
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,930
We don't have a platform!

188
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,580
Then I'll speak on the platform.

189
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,930
Rather than hiring new developers or

190
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,000
working with a professional development company,

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,500
an M&amp;A would save time and money—

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,180
Mr. Yun.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,450
Please go ahead.

194
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,200
Do it.

195
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,930
You're saying you'll acquire a platform company.

196
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,600
Go ahead and try it.

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,660
But it's all on you if it doesn't work out.

198
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,750
You know that, right?

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,530
Mr. Ha,

200
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,740
we should discuss it among ourselves first—

201
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,690
He says it's our opportunity and survival strategy.

202
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,620
He's saying we'll go under if we don't do it.

203
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,480
That's what you're saying, right?

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes. That's right.

205
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,120
Exactly.

206
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,280
The company is in danger of going under.

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,140
Mr. Yun should also put his neck on the line.

208
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,250
Isn't that right?

209
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,220
Okay, I'll do so.

210
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,870
Okay, let's end the meeting here.

211
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,580
Mr. Ha, is the chairman on board with this?

212
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,790
Let's grab a cup of tea.

213
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,020
- CEO Kim. 
 - Yes?

214
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,600
Are you afraid of losing Distribution?

215
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,180
That won't happen.

216
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,520
With this, Yun Ju No is done.

217
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
H-How?

218
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,650
Since we have logistics,

219
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,870
we have a fighting chance if we have a platform.

220
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,070
That's why I also pushed for it before.

221
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,950
However,

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,360
there's a reason why Mr. Ha is reacting that way.

223
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,370
In the past, Mr. Lee tried to do this.

224
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,240
Yes. Why didn't it work out back then?

225
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,940
Back then, he said the same thing Yun Ju No said.

226
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,320
Do you know about Collection?

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,550
Are you talking about the online shopping mall?

228
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,300
Yes.

229
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,140
It's very well-known.

230
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,110
Of course, you know about it.

231
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,270
Young people buy their clothes from there nowadays.

232
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,310
Sanin is also struggling because of the Collection.

233
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,550
They once...

234
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,140
requested us to acquire them.

235
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,060
Did we have a chance to acquire Collection?

236
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,480
It was when you were in Hawaii.

237
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,990
How much is Collection valued at these days?

238
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,120
It's believed to be valued at 4 trillion won.

239
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,230
It was 10 billion won back then.

240
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,760
It's multiplied by 400 times.

241
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,850
It originally started out as a blog.

242
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,150
I see. That's how they became a hit.

243
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,830
Yes. Since the blog got some traffic,

244
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,860
I guess they decided to sell stuff on it.

245
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,450
They wanted to distribute our fashion products.

246
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,680
And?

247
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,010
And so, we offered to

248
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,890
acquire 100% of their shares at 10 billion,

249
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,450
and in return, they'd sell only our products.

250
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,640
They'd have become Sanin's platform.

251
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,480
Yes, we'd essentially be doing e-commerce then.

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,120
But I don't think Collection would've accepted that.

253
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,740
Collection accepted the offer.

254
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,950
But the chairman vetoed it.

255
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,510
Do you think our chairman understood what that was?

256
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,590
Still, Mr. Lee would've tried to persuade him.

257
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,680
Even if distribution and marts don't earn money,

258
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,760
the price of property rises over time.

259
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,550
So even if the original business goes under,

260
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,830
you could make money from the sale of the property.

261
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,960
But there's no profit from e-commerce if it fails.

262
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,450
The opportunity cost is much greater.

263
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,900
The chairman probably felt that it was a gamble.

264
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,180
Our chairman always says he is a businessman.

265
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,910
He was saying why do a risky business

266
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,060
when there are safer businesses out there?

267
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,050
After that,

268
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,050
he'd get angry whenever we brought up e-commerce.

269
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,310
Even so, Sanin must show growth momentum in the market.

270
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,690
If we don't, its stock prices may collapse

271
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,450
before we can gather 11 trillion won.

272
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,440
I agree with what you're saying,

273
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,660
but isn't it too late for that?

274
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,200
If we do an M&amp;A, it's possible.

275
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,090
Will you acquire a platform company?

276
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,520
But there are no companies on the block.

277
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,250
Gosh, I thought this would be easy,

278
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,000
but it's harder than I thought.

279
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,080
Gosh, I was only a little bit late.

280
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,540
Why is this awful boss yelling at me?

281
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,490
The customer is returning the product for a late delivery.

282
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,090
Forget it. I'm not playing.

283
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,190
I can't do this.

284
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,860
Gosh, whatever.

285
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,070
How is it for you, Ms. Kwak?

286
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,390
I don't know, either.

287
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm not much of a gamer.

288
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,930
How about you, Jin Su?

289
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,710
Aren't you more familiar with games?

290
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,210
I'm not sure.

291
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,010
Are you saying it's mediocre?

292
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,750
No,

293
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,310
it's just hard to explain.

294
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,980
Did your presentation go well?

295
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,490
Yes.

296
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,120
What did you think of the game?

297
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,320
Well, this game seems simple,

298
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
but it contains a balanced mix of

299
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,730
timing actions, business strategy, and simulation.

300
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,330
The graphics aren't bad,

301
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,730
and there are details that only someone

302
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,740
with delivery experience would know,

303
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,120
making it quite realistic.

304
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,570
Also, they've implemented actual maps into the game.

305
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,830
That's what's amazing.

306
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,860
I will show it on the screen.

307
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,100
Here, actual maps during deliveries are used.

308
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,470
Every time you complete a mission,

309
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,730
it provides feedback for improvements.

310
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,470
To create it like this,

311
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,920
it would've taken significant resources.

312
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,130
Is this game that good?

313
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,730
Yes.

314
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,580
But I believe this game is a failure.

315
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,270
Why?

316
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,750
The game's quality is good,

317
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,120
but its BM is bad.

318
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,850
Its business model?

319
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,160
Yes. Even if a game's quality is bad,

320
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,620
it can become a hit if its BM is good.

321
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,660
So the worst case is a high-quality game that isn't profitable.

322
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,240
The development costs are high, but profits are low.

323
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,010
Yes. This game is like that.

324
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,290
Now that I think about it, I downloaded it for free,

325
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,110
but I never paid for in-game purchases.

326
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,740
It doesn't even have any ads,

327
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,800
even though they could've placed ads.

328
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,080
Yes, that's why I think this game will fail.

329
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,950
You're right. It went under.

330
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,340
It went out of business.

331
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,800
Thank you for the love you've shown Cha Cha Games.

332
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,640
Unfortunately, Delivery King will end its service at the end of this month.

333
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,790
We thank the users for all the love,

334
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,260
and we will return better than before.

335
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,420
They won't be able to.

336
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,140
Then how about we go to them?

337
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,670
It's here.

338
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,750
I don't think it's here.

339
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,850
This looks like a family home.

340
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,110
This is the place.

341
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,520
I guess they repurposed a house.

342
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,310
They could've just used this address for the business registration.

343
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,480
Don't get too discouraged.

344
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,340
We can just try again.

345
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,850
But we don't have any money.

346
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,800
I can get us funds again.

347
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,580
Who would give us money?

348
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,350
Hey, aren't you in the mood for some pizza?

349
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,270
Should I order some?

350
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,390
All right.

351
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,150
Go ahead.

352
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,310
Hyeong, cheer up, too.

353
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,810
See you.

354
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,340
Okay. See you.

355
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,200
Wh-Who are you?

356
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,800
Hello. I'm Yun Ju No of Sanin Group's M&amp;A Team.

357
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,820
Yes, well, so?

358
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,850
So you're saying

359
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,100
you like the system and not the game.

360
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,180
I like both, but I want the system.

361
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,430
What will you do with it?

362
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,660
We want to enter the e-commerce market with it.

363
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,790
Wait, Sanin doesn't do...

364
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,600
e-commerce?

365
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
Whoa...

366
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,620
E-commerce... This is hilarious.

367
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,580
You will bring Delivery King into the real world?

368
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,760
As a platform?

369
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
I guess that was a foolish thought.

370
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,650
Oh, no, no.

371
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,090
It does make sense.

372
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,490
DT. 
    

373
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,270
Anyone and everyone is doing it nowadays.

374
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,830
Yes. That's why I want to make a pivoting offer to you, CEO Cha.

375
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,710
Pivoting.

376
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,030
But I have to ask my team about this.

377
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,210
Pizza delivery.

378
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,660
It looks like we didn't get enough pizza.

379
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,830
Wow. This makes sense.

380
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,850
When Hyeong quit developing games, he did delivery.

381
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,420
Damn it. Why would you bring that up?

382
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,520
He got yelled at for being so bad that he made it not to get yelled at.

383
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,020
That's not it.

384
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,410
The system sucked but the manager blamed the worker so I made it.

385
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,390
Oh, I see.

386
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,440
No wonder it was so realistic.

387
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,590
The game character is also you, right?

388
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,310
- You look like him. 
 - That's not it.

389
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,860
Not only delivery, receiving orders, securing products,

390
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,650
and assigning drivers functions were there.

391
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,770
Do you have experience in those as well?

392
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,170
Yes.

393
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,770
At first, I did deliveries, but they said I was too slow,

394
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,390
so I took orders and assigned drivers.

395
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,190
In that field, the customers complain like crazy

396
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,960
if a delivery is even one day late.

397
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,700
But they wrote the delivery schedule on a calendar.

398
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,740
It's not like we're in the Joseon era.

399
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,000
So I just made it all by myself.

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,620
And?

401
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,570
Have you tried using it in real life?

402
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,430
No. I showed it to the boss,

403
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,210
but he didn't want it. The boomers don't get it.

404
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,900
So that's why

405
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,780
I turned it into a game.

406
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,750
So he made it for that purpose.

407
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,190
Yes, I guess so.

408
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,680
You could use it as a platform like you meant to.

409
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
I can't. The details are different.

410
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
That can be fixed.

411
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,400
We aren't in the position to be picky.

412
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,930
- Is it possible? 
 - Yes.

413
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,630
Orders and production volume can be turned into data.

414
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,380
We set it up so we can adjust the difficulty levels.

415
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,750
Yes, we can use this data to save logistics fees

416
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,890
and for marketing purposes.

417
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,770
Oh, you're quite knowledgeable.

418
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,020
Gosh, making that was such a pain.

419
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,610
It was useful, after all.

420
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,240
See? I told you we should do it.

421
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,630
When did you say that? I pushed for it.

422
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,880
Oh, but...

423
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,260
if we turn it into a platform,

424
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,720
it can no longer be a game, right?

425
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
No, it can't.

426
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,070
Would you like some time to consider it?

427
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,490
No. I won't sell it.

428
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,710
Okay. I still learned a lot from you.

429
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,450
Thank you for your time.

430
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
H-How much will you give us?

431
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,220
As for that,

432
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,050
we would need to study Cha Cha first to know.

433
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,750
Wh-When should we call you by?

434
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,300
The sooner, the better.

435
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,440
- Call you at this number? 
 - Hey, hey!

436
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,490
I said, I'm not selling it.

437
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,140
Shouldn't we look for another company?

438
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,010
Not all games have that system.

439
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,320
If CEO Cha is a decent leader, wouldn't he call us?

440
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,540
Okay.

441
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,970
Does he think he's Elon Musk or something?

442
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,030
Are young people all like that these days?

443
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,560
People in the game industry tend to be that way,

444
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,210
but he seems to be a bit extreme.

445
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,130
Right? I thought I was being a geezer.

446
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,420
The decision was up to CEO Cha,

447
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,980
and the team was on board with that.

448
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,140
That could be because CEO Cha is a decent leader.

449
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,450
How do you know those things, Mr. Yun?

450
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,020
I don't know either.

451
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,390
I'm just saying that's my hope.

452
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,910
But even if he calls us,

453
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,370
I don't know if CEO Cha will accept the pivoting.

454
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,520
Yes, he seemed to have a lot of pride in his game.

455
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,920
Pivoting...

456
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,190
Jin Su, do you know how to play basketball?

457
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,700
All right, give me a pass.

458
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,580
Pass!

459
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,240
All right.

460
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,650
Keep your foot planted.

461
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,520
To the left and to the right!

462
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,510
Do you get it now? Like this and that.

463
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,250
Michael Jordan, you know?

464
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,350
Attorney, please sit still.

465
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,140
The car is shaking.

466
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,080
Okay.

467
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,670
Pivoting is when you shift the direction of your business.

468
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,910
Actually, I knew that, too.

469
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,900
Oh, really?

470
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,480
You should've said so if you knew.

471
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,870
I got in trouble because of you.

472
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,990
We'll need a consultant for this deal since we don't know games very well.

473
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,480
I'll look into someone who knows games well.

474
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,560
My friend is a consultant and also a game enthusiast.

475
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,090
Should I tell him to come?

476
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,880
I hear Yun Ju No will go into e-commerce and set up a new system.

477
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,090
If so, Mr. Ha wouldn't have allowed it.

478
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,610
I mean, Mr. Ha did lose one to Yun Ju No...

479
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,530
You made it.

480
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,750
Why didn't you start eating first?

481
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,840
We should eat together.

482
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,340
Hello.

483
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,880
Mr. Ha said he'd introduce me to a good restaurant.

484
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,220
Come in. Take a seat.

485
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,650
T-This way.

486
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,140
How are things with the supermarket?

487
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,960
Not much to tell you.

488
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,130
You must be upset with Mr. Lee.

489
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,120
You're doing fine with the logistics

490
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,160
and now he wants to change everything to e-commerce.

491
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,970
Honestly...

492
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,470
Mr. Lee is like a father to me.

493
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,800
When he was in distribution and said he'd hand it over to me,

494
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,530
there was so much opposition,

495
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,610
but Mr. Lee persuaded everyone and made it happen

496
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,920
so... I was so grateful to him.

497
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,520
And I should be grateful.

498
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,360
We know.

499
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,650
Everyone knows how special you are to Mr. Lee.

500
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,100
Who doesn't know that?

501
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,790
But... wanting to do e-commerce means

502
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,390
he wants me to hand over the distribution.

503
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,430
Gosh, as if he's taking back what he gave me.

504
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,550
This is taking back what he gave you.

505
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,390
I feel like an illegitimate son pushed out by a legitimate son.

506
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,600
The legitimate son is Yun Ju No?

507
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,700
That's why you should've taken the right side.

508
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,940
Me?

509
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,320
I never sided with Mr. Lee.

510
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,090
I'm just saying I'm grateful for what he did.

511
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,380
People seem to mistake me for that.

512
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,070
That I am on Mr. Lee's side.

513
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,010
- Well, then... 
 - Oh, thank you.

514
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,970
What will you do?

515
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,500
Do I have to protect my position

516
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,290
after all I did to get to this position?

517
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,500
Don't I owe it to Sanin to do so?

518
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,940
Aigoo.

519
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,710
I'm dying.

520
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,220
Aigoo, we exercise so we can live long.

521
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,880
How could you say you're dying?

522
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,300
How much is the ice cream?

523
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,730
It's 3,000 won.

524
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,970
Gosh, it's expensive.

525
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,830
Why don't you go down and buy it yourself?

526
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,310
- Please give us two. 
 - Okay.

527
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,400
Since he distributes it himself, he should receive his fee.

528
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,290
Here you go.

529
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,640
Bye now.

530
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,860
- He knows how to do business, right? 
 - Yes.

531
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,280
Take a seat.

532
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,350
- Aigoo. 
 - But... young people don't seem to buy it.

533
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,930
Well, things are delivered to your house

534
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,620
at a good price these days.

535
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,470
I guess kids don't understand paying extra for being on a mountain.

536
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,270
Right. They aren't buying it because it's expensive.

537
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,170
If it was cheap, they'd all buy it.

538
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,970
It's good.

539
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,220
 Aren't you coming? 

540
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,270
Want to die?

541
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,060
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

542
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,040
I am an analyst, Jennie. Gaming and entertainment specialist.

543
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,600
Hello.

544
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm Yun Ju No of Sanin Group's M&amp;A Team.

545
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,000
Cha Ho Jin of Cha Cha Games.

546
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,520
He was born in 1988 in Ulsan.

547
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,070
He went to Science-Tech High and majored in math at SNU before dropping out.

548
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,720
He's got an elite background.

549
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,480
Yes, even dropping out of college.

550
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,400
He created DC Games with Do Han Cheol,

551
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,600
a seonbae in his major, and dropped out of SNU.

552
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,760
If he created DC Games, how many shares does he own?

553
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,480
Even if he had 1%, that'd be—

554
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,810
Ten billion won.

555
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,260
But I believe he doesn't have any shares.

556
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,820
Yes, Cha Ho Jin doesn't have any DC Games' shares.

557
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,100
DC wasn't a company when Cha Ho Jin left.

558
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,770
It was just the team name.

559
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,360
D, from Do Han Cheol. C, from Cha Ho Jin. DC.

560
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,230
Why did the two part ways?

561
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,320
About that...

562
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,940
I think you'd know that better than me, Attorney.

563
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,000
They're in the middle of a lawsuit.

564
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,600
A game by DC hit it big. What was it called?

565
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
- High Square? 
 - Right, right. That one.

566
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,770
- That was a major hit. 
 - Yes.

567
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,410
It's the game that made DC what it is today.

568
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,450
But Cha Ho Jin filed a lawsuit

569
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,850
saying it was stolen from him.

570
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,700
Do Han Cheol and Cha Ho Jin were a team then

571
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,860
so plagiarism or copyright makes more sense.

572
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,550
But it's so strange...

573
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,040
that he sued for theft.

574
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,300
Right. The industry also found it strange.

575
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,320
- Was there a verdict? 
 - Cha Ho Jin lost.

576
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,980
What if he went for copyright or plagiarism?

577
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,430
He probably would've still lost.

578
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,380
From a judge's perspective, plagiarism is very tricky.

579
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,370
It's hard to tell if something was copied

580
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,120
or if it was just a coincidence.

581
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,500
They both could've had the same idea simultaneously.

582
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,580
That's why circumstantial evidence is important.

583
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,520
Yes, but the timing of Cha Ho Jin's

584
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,660
lawsuit wasn't good.

585
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,750
When CEO Cha struggled to fund his next project,

586
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,970
he asked CEO Do for an investment,

587
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,000
but he was rejected.

588
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,060
Right after that, he filed the lawsuit.

589
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,050
From the judge's point of view,

590
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,450
they might think CEO Cha filed the lawsuit

591
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,700
because he was angry about being rejected.

592
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,200
So, well,

593
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,580
he would've lost, no matter what.

594
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,460
Did he appeal?

595
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,730
Yes. It's ongoing.

596
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,820
DC also filed a counter-suit for false accusation.

597
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,580
Cha Cha Games probably doesn't have the money to sue.

598
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,030
It's a matter of money

599
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,070
so they'll just have to settle.

600
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,070
But they've got such a bad relationship.

601
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,670
They even unfollowed each other on social media.

602
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,380
Is that important?

603
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,190
To put it in perspective, unfollowing is the same as

604
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,930
severing ties with someone.

605
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,810
It can be seen in real life as well.

606
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,340
DC keeps releasing a new game whenever Cha Cha Games releases a new game,

607
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,460
though DC says it's a coincidence.

608
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,860
It doesn't seem like a coincidence.

609
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,370
Well, yes.

610
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,240
What is the valuation of Cha Cha Games?

611
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,550
We don't evaluate the value of game companies.

612
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,180
It's tough to predict which games will take off

613
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,210
and the value varies greatly depending on its success.

614
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,620
But I can tell you about Cha Cha's value.

615
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,220
Cha Cha has no value whatsoever.

616
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,770
Delivery King already failed,

617
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,590
and they are in a lawsuit with DC,

618
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,950
which has industry hegemony.

619
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,210
I bet no one would take them

620
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,700
even if they were given away for free.

621
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,060
Thank you for coming.

622
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,550
Bye now.

623
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,160
My CEO says...

624
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,840
your team leader's nickname is White Snake.

625
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,180
People seem to think it's because of his hair,

626
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,200
but I heard it's really because he thinks things through 100 times.

627
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,300
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

628
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,150
So I had high expectations about how great he'd be.

629
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,790
But I'm disappointed.

630
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,210
Why?

631
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,630
He says he'll buy Cha Cha Games.

632
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,790
Is that thinking it through 100 times?

633
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,830
If he'd thought about it at all,

634
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,160
he'd never buy Cha Cha.

635
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,430
Cha Cha says they won't sell anyway.

636
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,300
Really?

637
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,200
That's a relief then.

638
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,220
   

639
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,030
 ­  

640
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,600
   

641
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,140
   

642
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,510
   

643
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,900
 Yes, Mr. Ha. 

644
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,300
Hey, ask if it's Mr. Jo's workout time at the General Affairs.

645
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,700
 Yes, will do. 

646
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,320
Hello.

647
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,670
Oh, Mr. Jo.

648
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,940
Thank you.

649
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,010
I kept saying I'll work out,

650
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,010
but all I did was think about it.

651
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,380
Thanks to you, I'm here, Mr. Ha.

652
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,800
Mr. Ha,

653
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,700
CEO Kim seemed to cater to you well last time.

654
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,350
I thought about it.

655
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,890
Oh, okay.

656
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,070
He probably is up to something.

657
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,490
Do you mean Yun Jun No?

658
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,140
Yes, him.

659
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,370
Yes, I think so.

660
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,770
How about looking into what that is?

661
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,900
That sounds good.

662
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,600
Oh, me?

663
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,150
Oh, okay.

664
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,220
I was thinking about doing something anyway.

665
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,770
Exactly.

666
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,910
You need to show something.

667
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,260
Even CEO Kim came.

668
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,800
Director, are you looking for something?

669
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,850
Me?

670
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,540
You know him, the intern?

671
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,210
Which intern are you referring to?

672
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,540
I thought he was your junior.

673
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,260
That intern.

674
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,140
Oh, I-Intern Choi Jin Su?

675
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,270
You're close to him, right?

676
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,600
Why are you asking?

677
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,600
Look into what he's up to right now.

678
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,330
Well, he's currently in the M&amp;A Team.

679
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,220
Not that!

680
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,250
I'm saying secretly ask him

681
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,650
what Yun Ju No is up to.

682
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,440
Okay.

683
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,900
Why are you so slow?

684
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,810
Why are you following me?

685
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,560
He should speak clearly...

686
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,820
Hey.

687
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,350
Yes?

688
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,430
When his intern period is up,

689
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,360
let him go.

690
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,850
Okay, I'll s-see to it that

691
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,920
n-none of the current interns become full-time.

692
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,890
That's right. Now, you get it.

693
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,340
Mr. Yun, the CEO of Cha Cha Games

694
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,620
says he won't sell.

695
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,820
What if we sell more of our subsidiaries instead?

696
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,190
Cha Cha Games will sell soon.

697
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,530
Pardon?

698
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,450
If they don't sell, Cha Cha will go under.

699
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,110
They have no choice but to sell.

700
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,020
It's crucial to save their face in this instance.

701
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,430
By helping them make their own choice.

702
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,240
And we shouldn't sell any more subsidiaries.

703
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,990
If Sanin sells another one of its subsidiaries,

704
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,850
would you buy Sanin's stocks, Jin Su?

705
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,020
I don't think I would.

706
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,320
The market would respond similarly as you.

707
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,050
Though it's currently holding at 110,000 won,

708
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,660
the stock price would plummet if we sold again.

709
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,340
That'd be like acknowledging our fiscal difficulty.

710
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,820
If it goes below 100,000 won,

711
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,410
the Private Placement Fund would be calling,

712
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,340
demanding we pay off our loans. If not,

713
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,940
we should hand over the company.

714
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,700
What do we call this again?

715
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,440
- Bankruptcy. 
 - Bankruptcy.

716
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,700
Just like how Cha Cha has no other choice,

717
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,250
we also have no other choice.

718
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,820
That's why this deal will go through.

719
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,700
It must.

720
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,920
So shall we do our best?

721
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,380
Cha Cha Games filed a criminal lawsuit against DC.

722
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,280
Wouldn't it be appropriate to file a civil one?

723
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,090
You're right. I'll look into it.

724
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,180
I'll do my best.

725
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,520
Please check the condition of DC.

726
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,740
Oh, okay.

727
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,970
Jin Su...

728
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,140
Did you beat the final level of Delivery King?

729
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,560
Pardon?

730
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,950
No.

731
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,240
Try finishing the game.

732
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,830
Okay.

733
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,320
 The mobile and online numbers don't line up. 

734
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,280
 The last digit seems to be different. 

735
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,900
 Want to grab drinks tonight? 

736
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,070
 Pardon? Where? 

737
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,320
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

738
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,790
Goodbye.

739
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,400
 Going down to the basement floor 1. 

740
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,300
 Doors are closing. 

741
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,440
I'll go ahead.

742
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,400
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

743
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,860
Mr. Yun,

744
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,060
all I need to do is play the game?

745
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,820
Yes. It takes quite a while to beat the game.

746
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,270
Or should I look into some developers?

747
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,530
No, please try beating the game.

748
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,720
It's fun.

749
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,690
Okay.

750
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,100
Great work today.

751
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,120
Good evening.

752
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,090
Hello?

753
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,430
 Hey, don't you know to reply to my text? 

754
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,280
Yes, I don't know how to do anything.

755
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,210
I don't know anything.

756
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,770
 Really? 

757
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,370
 Let's grab a drink. 

758
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,310
- It's pretty here, right? 
 - What?

759
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,040
Try standing here.

760
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,910
Well, I guess.

761
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,110
I said we should grab a drink.

762
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,810
Why are we in a place like this?

763
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,910
I come here often when I'm stressed.

764
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,110
This place must be so old.

765
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,490
When I sit here,

766
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,000
I realize that my concerns

767
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,420
are really fleeting.

768
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,690
- I see, okay. 
  - I'm taking the photo. 

769
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,710
 - One, two, three.  
 - Hey.

770
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,740
Do you know why working life is hard?

771
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,970
I don't know.

772
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,080
It's hard because you don't know.

773
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,320
Once you learn a bit about working life,

774
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,330
then it's not hard.

775
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,920
It's hard because you don't know.

776
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,340
 Come down one step. 

777
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,430
   

778
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,670
Hey, what are you doing right now?

779
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,670
A game.

780
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,880
Not that.

781
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,390
I'm asking what your M&amp;A Team is working on.

782
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,160
Trying to buy the company that made this game.

783
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,380
Why would you buy that?

784
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,030
I told you, I don't know!

785
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,220
This jerk! Why are you taking it out on me?

786
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,990
- Hyeong. 
 - What?

787
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,790
You won't betray me, right?

788
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,630
Wh-What do you mean?

789
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,960
I'm saying it's hard because I'm not good.

790
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,570
I'm not saying Mr. Yun is being hard on me,

791
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,060
so don't tell anyone.

792
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,610
Geez.

793
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,410
Of course.

794
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,000
Mr. Yun seems like a decent guy.

795
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,150
He's quite competent, too.

796
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,060
Hey, don't be fooled.

797
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,290
Everyone is selfish.

798
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,190
But your team leader is a bit

799
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,570
selfish in a complicated way.

800
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,110
People like him are the scariest.

801
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,310
You have to watch out.

802
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,240
What is being selfish in a complicated way?

803
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,740
Well, basically,

804
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,990
it's when you think others are purely bad,

805
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,810
and you're good in a complicated way.

806
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,460
Your team leader is exactly like that.

807
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,590
Hey, if you're going to be selfish,

808
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,570
you should just be selfish outright.

809
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,090
Don't you think?

810
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,380
Rather than doing things while pretending not to,

811
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,300
it's better to be selfish outright.

812
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,880
Y-Yes, Director. Yes.

813
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,820
Yes, it's Cha Cha Games.

814
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,770
Yes, yes, right. It's a game development company.

815
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,240
They're trying to acquire it.

816
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,870
O-Oh, well, I don't know about that.

817
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,410
Yes.

818
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,080
Okay, good night.

819
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,010
- Aigoo! 
 - Aigoo, CEO.

820
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,940
Managing Director Ha.

821
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,660
This is the future of our Private Placement Fund's

822
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,460
Mr. Song. You know him, right?

823
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,430
Of course. How could I not know Mr. Song?

824
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,330
Please take a seat.

825
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,720
Just...

826
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,060
call me Theo.

827
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,800
Mr. Theo was so meticulous last time

828
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,640
when Sanin was issuing convertible bonds.

829
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,130
Do you know how much trouble I went through

830
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,620
to persuade my Chairman, who got so furious?

831
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,570
I apologize for that time.

832
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,870
We were just trying to protect our clients' money.

833
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,160
Of course, of course.

834
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,540
It's not like I don't get the fund's position.

835
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,470
Please have a glass.

836
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,890
- CEO. 
 - Yes.

837
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,310
But that was then.

838
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,370
And the present is the present.

839
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,660
That's right.

840
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,310
I was trying to say that's how dependable you are.

841
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,100
Let's go for something sweet together this time.

842
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,500
Let's do so!

843
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,550
Oh, nice.

844
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,710
But...

845
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,300
I hear what we're taking is Yun Ju No's.

846
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,750
Yes.

847
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,510
Are you sure it'll be okay?

848
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,360
What's there to worry about when you're here, CEO?

849
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,420
Still, we should be careful.

850
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,850
You know how Yun Ju No isn't just anybody.

851
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,740
How is he?

852
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,810
You know Jumbo Pharma, right?

853
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,360
He's the one who siphoned it off.

854
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,690
He's the one who siphoned off Jumbo?

855
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,190
Yes.

856
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,380
You wouldn't know since you were in the US, Theo.

857
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,940
Yun Ju No was the one behind that.

858
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,280
We've got a witness right here.

859
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,730
He didn't get investigated by the prosecution?

860
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,360
He did.

861
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,590
That's why he fled overseas.

862
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,300
The group covered up the news

863
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,560
and people kept quiet for us,

864
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,700
so not many know the full story.

865
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,520
But I never expected him to come back to Korea.

866
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,280
I don't know if he's shameless or just brave.

867
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,160
He could be running from something over there, too.

868
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,110
Many people flee overseas and return like that.

869
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,560
Then again, he probably

870
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,440
lost everything trying to cover it up.

871
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,880
There's no way his family stayed intact.

872
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,640
When you go bankrupt, you usually end up divorced.

873
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,410
Gosh, money is such a scary thing.

874
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,940
Hello?

875
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,080
Oh Wun.

876
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,820
It's Daddy.

877
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,570
You're doing well, right?

878
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,730
Daddy is doing well.

879
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,000
 Oh Wun, who is it? 

880
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,590
 Hello? 

881
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,650
Yes, it's me.

882
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,330
 I see. 

883
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,940
 How are you? Are you doing all right? 

884
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,490
Yes.

885
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,410
I'll be going to see Hyeong this week.

886
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,170
Should I take a picture while I'm there?

887
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,900
Sure.

888
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,720
You know...

889
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,260
 Yes. 

890
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,400
Don't call yourself daddy to Oh Wun.

891
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,700
 Take care. I'm hanging up now. 

892
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,130
Okay.

893
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,240
 DC is making steady profits with High Square 

894
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,730
 as its cash cow. 

895
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,640
 By reinvesting the profits into game development, 

896
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,070
 they are maintaining a virtuous cycle. 

897
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,910
High Square is the engine that makes DC run, I see.

898
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,310
 Yes, thanks to that, new games also perform well. 

899
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,060
Their stock prices rose recently.

900
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,940
Did they release a new game?

901
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,380
No, it's because of a photo CEO Do posted online.

902
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,920
It looks like he secured a government project,

903
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,930
but it was just a publicity stunt.

904
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,130
CEO Do seems to pull such unexpected moves often.

905
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,900
Shareholders are petitioning to have him

906
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,330
leave social media.

907
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,740
 Okay. Great work. 

908
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,260
 Min Jeong, you said you were moving today, right? 

909
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,860
Oh, yes. I'm almost done now.

910
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,500
 I sent you a moving gift. 

911
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,020
 I'll see you tomorrow. 

912
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,830
A gift?

913
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,350
Hello.

914
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,180
You ordered a washing machine, dishwasher,

915
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,810
and microwave, right?

916
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,650
I did?

917
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,410
Yun Ju No. Is that you?

918
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,390
Should we place the dishwasher over here?

919
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,290
Yes, yes.

920
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,880
   

921
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,520
 ­  

922
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,690
Traitor.

923
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,650
Prosecutor!

924
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,010
Walk far away from me. You don't know me.

925
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,990
The chief prosecutor might find out I'm meeting you.

926
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,680
Come on.

927
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,330
Oh, this? 
    

928
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,210
Yes, what happened with this?

929
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,620
Why should I tell you this?

930
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,250
Why not?

931
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,510
What's the point of having colleagues?

932
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:08,770
It's to help in times like this.

933
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,600
You quit after posting that prosecutors were corrupt.

934
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,090
Now, you want your colleague?

935
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,430
I wondered if I should report it to a newspaper,

936
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,090
but I didn't want my good colleague to be criticized

937
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,570
so I posted it internally.

938
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,410
- Can I eat this? 
 - What the hell.

939
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,120
So what happened was...

940
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,290
 The prosecutors also told CEO Cha to file a civil lawsuit. 

941
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,220
 But CEO Cha filed for theft because 

942
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,370
 DC's Do jumped a wall to break into Cha Cha Games. 

943
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,970
DC's CEO jumped a wall?

944
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,100
Hey, it doesn't make sense for a game company's CEO

945
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,570
to break into someone's house.

946
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,950
But Cha Ho Jin says he has hard evidence.

947
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,480
So we told him to bring it.

948
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,300
But he brought some kind of software code.

949
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,000
Supposedly, it's some blockchain thing.

950
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,030
He said that was the evidence.

951
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,370
Goodness.

952
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,420
Prosecutors don't even know how to use Excel.

953
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,450
How would you know what a blockchain is?

954
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:11,320
You think prosecutors are a joke. No wonder you quit.

955
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,390
So? Did you call in the Digital Team?

956
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,940
We did.

957
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,430
They looked at it and there was no trace of hacking.

958
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,800
I hear a blockchain always leaves traces.

959
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,680
But if there was nothing there, it means he's innocent.

960
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,080
You're right.

961
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,190
The CCTV they installed to catch the perpetrator

962
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,720
- proved his innocence. 
 - Exactly.

963
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,840
But this jerk says that's proof he broke in.

964
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,370
What does that mean?

965
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,410
I don't know.

966
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,800
He says having no trace is the evidence.

967
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,100
What kind of bullshit is that?

968
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,640
The game that Cha Cha developed was released by DC,

969
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,170
but there was no trace of hacking

970
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,900
so DC must've stolen it physically?

971
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,320
 Yes. 

972
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,620
 And to say DC's CEO jumped a wall is hard to believe. 

973
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,970
 And he changed his statement, so his claims lack credibility. 

974
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:06,040
 Though CEO Cha claims he said that from the beginning, 

975
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,610
 it wasn't accepted. 

976
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,910
Okay. I see.

977
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,100
 But that CEO of DC Games... 

978
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,260
CEO Do Han Cheol?

979
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,530
 Yes. 

980
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,690
 I was told to watch out for him as well. 

981
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,790
- Why? 
 - Be careful.

982
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:27,340
That guy is a scoundrel.

983
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,910
Why do you say that?

984
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,870
He...

985
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,910
Yun Ju No and him both.

986
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,820
- What? 
 - Hey,

987
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,570
do you believe Yun Ju No is innocent?

988
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,230
- Yes. 
 - Absolutely ridiculous.

989
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:48,060
And you quit being a prosecutor to work with him?

990
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,670
- Yes. 
 - Aigoo, what a hotshot you are!

991
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,330
Do Han Cheol, Yun Ju No... they're all scammers!

992
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,790
Can't you tell?

993
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,230
 I just think you shouldn't meet Do Han Cheol. 

994
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,420
   

995
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,450
 He's infamous for using people and 

996
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,210
 throwing them out in this field. 

997
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,580
Mr. Yun.

998
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,070
Hello, Mr. Kang.

999
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,950
And you're CEO Do Han Cheol, right?

1000
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,350
Wow, Team Leader Yun Ju No.

1001
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,480
You're as handsome as I was told you were.

1002
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,800
I wanted to meet you, so I begged Mr. Kang.

1003
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,970
To be honest, I heard the rumors before I came.

1004
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,990
I heard Sanin is entering the game industry.

1005
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,030
What a great idea that is!

1006
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,680
I see there was such a rumor.

1007
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,200
Yes. Well, I'm not trying to brag,

1008
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,380
but we're the best in the industry

1009
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,640
in game development quality or experience.

1010
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,200
Yes, I hear that's the case.

1011
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,150
Then how about you work with me?

1012
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,120
What do you mean?

1013
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,620
With Sanin's capital and DC's technology,

1014
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,950
it would be a major success.

1015
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,870
I'm afraid the rumors were false.

1016
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,220
We're not entering the game industry.

1017
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,050
Gosh, how disappointing that is.

1018
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,130
You know how much DC is worth, right?

1019
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,080
Of course.

1020
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:41,760
We came today to just say hello anyway.

1021
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,430
Since we said hello, we should leave now.

1022
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,810
Mr. Yun, let's meet next time as friends, not as business partners.

1023
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,190
Okay, sounds good.

1024
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,760
I'll see you again next time.

1025
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,780
If you do end up making a deal, how about—

1026
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,060
I don't like that jerk.

1027
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,630
Pardon?

1028
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,060
No, no.

1029
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,310
I put you in a difficult spot by asking to meet him, right?

1030
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,900
No, no. It is my job, after all.

1031
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,230
Exactly. You said you were close to him

1032
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,600
so I thought you really were close to him.

1033
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,900
Do you think he came knowing that we were interested in Cha Cha?

1034
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,670
- Who came by? 
 - Hello.

1035
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,460
DC's CEO, Do Han Cheol, came by.

1036
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,450
- How did he know? 
 - Mr. Kang probably told him.

1037
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:11,210
And how did Mr. Kang know?

1038
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:17,000
Because I asked him how much it would cost to make a game at DC.

1039
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,270
Yes, Director. You're on speakerphone.

1040
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:25,410
 Oh, okay. As you've said, 

1041
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,290
 he seems interested in receiving investments. 

1042
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,810
 When I told him it was Sanin, 

1043
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,320
 he asked to go meet you right away. 

1044
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,180
Thank you for coming.

1045
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,090
 What do you think? Not so great, right? 

1046
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,680
I'm not sure.

1047
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,620
But does DC even need investments?

1048
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,310
They should have enough capital.

1049
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,230
 Well, their stock price rose recently 

1050
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,510
 because he posted on social media 

1051
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,740
 as if he secured a government support project. 

1052
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,540
 It will probably drop soon. 

1053
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,030
So he wants to maintain that price.

1054
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,130
 Yes. 

1055
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,260
Why?

1056
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,490
Is there an option involved?

1057
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,400
He wants to sell his shares while they are high.

1058
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,470
 No. Rather than that, 

1059
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,010
 I think he just wants to. 

1060
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,900
He just wants to?

1061
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,950
 Yes. 

1062
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:14,000
 I think he wants to maintain its market capitalization ranking. 

1063
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,320
 He tends to view this like a game score ranking. 

1064
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,360
I should at least earn my travel costs.

1065
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,720
   

1066
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,710
Hyeong, take a look at this.

1067
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,990
What? What is it?

1068
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,960
Everyone, come here.

1069
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,560
What, what? What is it?

1070
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,630
After we rejected them, they went to DC.

1071
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,080
   

1072
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,540
It looks like Sanin will sign with Do Han Cheol.

1073
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,850
Hyeong, we need to do this.

1074
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,770
If we don't, we'll lose out to DC again!

1075
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,520
Hello, you're Team Leader Yun Ju No, right?

1076
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,510
Who are you?

1077
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,270
I'm Reporter Han Ji Eun of Jungang Economic News.

1078
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,660
Could I interview you?

1079
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,910
Is there a particular issue?

1080
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,050
I heard that Sanin is entering the gaming industry.

1081
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,850
What's your source?

1082
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,160
Considering Sanin's past actions,

1083
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,450
this is an unprecedented move.

1084
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,000
I'm curious as to how this came about.

1085
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,560
You're directly handling the M&amp;A.

1086
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,150
It's DC Games...

1087
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,770
Right?

1088
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,950
Nothing's been decided.

1089
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,670
Then there's nothing between Sanin and DC.

1090
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,980
I can quote you on that as an insider, right?

1091
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,140
No.

1092
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,730
Should I take that to mean there is something?

1093
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,290
I'm sorry, but I'm late to my appointment.

1094
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,310
   

1095
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,600
   

1096
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,080
Today's a holiday. Are you still heading to work?

1097
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,160
Oh, no.

1098
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,040
Could you take me to Bongansa?

1099
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,940
Okay.

1100
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,750
Thank you.

1101
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,280
 Ten billion won. 

1102
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,710
   

1103
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,460
 The call is not going through. 

1104
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,740
 You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

1105
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,520
 Hello, Cha Cha Games CEO Cha Ho Jin. 

1106
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,230
 This is Team Leader Yun Ju No 

1107
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,160
 of Sanin Group's M&amp;A Team. 

1108
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,420
What did he say?

1109
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,120
- Will they give it to us? 
 - Did they refuse?

1110
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,240
He thanked us for making the offer.

1111
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,100
But he said they need to evaluate us.

1112
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,710
What? How will they evaluate us?

1113
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,340
He wants to meet first.

1114
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,070
Gosh, why's he asking to meet?

1115
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,440
 I sent you an email. 

1116
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,840
   

1117
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,420
TIC?

1118
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,660
Did you say it's fun?

1119
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,740
Are you playing a game?

1120
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,030
Oh, no.

1121
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,460
What is this?

1122
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,910
Should I make you some toast?

1123
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,240
No, the food is already good.

1124
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,310
   

1125
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,810
TIC?

1126
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:04,190
This is supposed to be a business email...

1127
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,210
What a weirdo.

1128
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,900
People like him get the rest of us in trouble.

1129
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,290
This is the back-end code, right?

1130
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,910
Yes.

1131
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,540
He's an absolute lunatic.

1132
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,280
Daebak.

1133
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,510
He says to come in.

1134
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,530
Oh, he's not going hiking?

1135
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,970
He says to have some tea with him.

1136
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,860
Aigoo.

1137
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,400
What brings you here?

1138
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,040
Pardon?

1139
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,190
What you're saying is we should try doing what Yun Ju No says.

1140
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,140
Oh, yes.

1141
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,880
That's right, Chairman.

1142
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,100
Aigoo, do you also listen to what Yun Ju No says now?

1143
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,800
No, Chairman.

1144
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,980
To tell you the truth,

1145
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,980
DC Games wants to buy this company,

1146
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,310
but the relationship between the CEOs is terrible.

1147
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:53,200
If we buy it first and resell it, I feel we'll make quite a profit.

1148
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,130
Are you sure about that?

1149
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:59,560
Yes, rumors have spread regarding this already.

1150
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,320
Also, DC Games' stock prices will fall on Monday.

1151
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,150
Okay.

1152
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,140
I can trust you, right?

1153
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,350
Good morning.

1154
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,570
- Good morning. 
 - You made it.

1155
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,280
Did you see CEO Do Han Cheol's social media?

1156
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,340
Yes.

1157
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,930
Because of that, news spread about Sanin making a game with DC.

1158
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:31,890
Even though a countering article was released, it rose by 17%.

1159
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:36,910
"An insider at Sanin didn't deny a relationship with DC."

1160
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,700
Is this insider you, Mr. Yun?

1161
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,480
Do you think so?

1162
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,170
Cha Cha must've seen the social media post.

1163
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,440
They made an offer of 10 billion won.

1164
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,200
So you were the insider.

1165
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,910
Mr. Yun, by chance...

1166
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,820
did you meet with DC to intentionally spread the rumor?

1167
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,760
DC came to us,

1168
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,790
so I didn't intentionally meet him...

1169
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:04,860
It would provide a good reason for Cha Cha.

1170
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,000
What good reason?

1171
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,070
Cha Cha would be...

1172
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:13,610
selling to beat their rival, rather than because they're going under.

1173
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,810
So they'd be retaining their dignity.

1174
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,320
Jin Su, did you try playing the game?

1175
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,340
Pardon? Yes...

1176
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:26,400
But I haven't reached the end yet.

1177
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,840
I did check the email.

1178
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,370
Oh, what does TIC mean?

1179
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:38,820
It means the "Title Is the Content."

1180
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,070
I see...

1181
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,660
Is that what kids say these days?

1182
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,880
It's no longer that trendy these days.

1183
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,260
TIC, TIC...

1184
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,090
I'll show it on the screen.

1185
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,990
This is called the back-end code.

1186
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,930
Basically, it's Delivery King's program.

1187
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:08,480
This is what you see when your computer goes down.

1188
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,460
In my opinion,

1189
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,830
the black part is the screen and the white is the text, right?

1190
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:17,050
What we typically see is the front end

1191
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,530
and this is the program running behind the screen.

1192
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,340
Yes, that's right.

1193
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,240
Do you usually share this?

1194
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,500
No, it's never done.

1195
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,410
How should I put this...

1196
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,210
If we compare it to a fund manager,

1197
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,470
it'd be like showing their personal portfolio.

1198
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,090
Like a popular restaurant's recipes.

1199
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,330
Yes, that's right.

1200
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:41,520
He sent us all his trade secrets and know-how?

1201
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,350
Why did he do that?

1202
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,540
Is he saying he's that confident?

1203
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,930
Maybe he thinks we won't understand it.

1204
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:51,540
I couldn't understand as well, so I asked for Jennie's help.

1205
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,630
And she said she'd personally come to explain.

1206
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,680
You shared this content with her?

1207
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,200
Yes.

1208
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,380
Hello, Mr. Yun.

1209
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,090
Why do you think Cha Cha Games sent this to us?

1210
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,740
They showed us their back-end code.

1211
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,700
Isn't this such an illogical move?

1212
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,180
Exactly.

1213
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,820
Couldn't we see this and copy it?

1214
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,920
We would?

1215
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,030
Everyone does coding these days.

1216
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:28,980
Right.

1217
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,090
I've never seen anything like this either.

1218
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,890
I thought it was one of two things.

1219
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,850
Either he's stupid, or he trusts Mr. Yun too much.

1220
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,210
Or he looks down on us.

1221
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,890
I don't know about looking down on you.

1222
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:46,770
In any case, it wasn't either of what I'd thought.

1223
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,520
Then?

1224
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,780
This is blockchain.

1225
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,180
If it's blockchain, it's something like Bitcoin, right?

1226
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,700
That's true too.

1227
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,600
The thing about this blockchain is that it can prevent hacking.

1228
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,490
All-access logs will be recorded here permanently.

1229
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,440
And this record can't be altered.

1230
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,910
So

1231
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:11,270
since it also recorded us opening this email,

1232
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,710
they could send us their assets without worrying.

1233
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,390
That's right.

1234
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,410
Cha Cha was trying to show off, I see.

1235
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:24,340
Yes, that is my opinion as well.

1236
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,890
Their blockchain technology?

1237
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,080
Yes.

1238
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,990
It could be revolutionary to use this to manage inventories.

1239
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:34,250
What does it have to do with managing inventories?

1240
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,860
Jin Su, come here.

1241
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,640
They say when the military does an inventory check,

1242
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,160
they can't even get the number of helicopters correct.

1243
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,540
It means that's how difficult it is to know exactly

1244
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,130
since inventory quantities change in real-time.

1245
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,300
That's probably true for a company as well.

1246
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,020
Yes. You're right.

1247
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,510
But with this,

1248
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,730
you can accurately know the inventories

1249
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:06,530
since all departments can use the same ledger in real time.

1250
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,930
This may seem like it's nothing,

1251
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,680
but this will spark a revolution in distribution.

1252
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,920
Then would you reevaluate

1253
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,020
this company's value, Jennie?

1254
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,850
Yes, absolutely.

1255
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:24,050
Okay.

1256
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:27,220
Cha Cha Games recently released a game, Delivery King,

1257
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,090
but it performed poorly, so it was shut down.

1258
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:33,460
However, if we use this game's system,

1259
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,480
we can manage everything from customer orders

1260
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,510
to secure products and delivery. All at once.

1261
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,980
What did you say?

1262
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,970
Delivery King?

1263
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,850
What are you trying to do with this failed game?

1264
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,710
Is this a joke or something?

1265
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:49,280
Do you think distribution is a child's game?

1266
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,400
How much will it cost?

1267
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,770
We've received an offer for 10 billion won.

1268
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:56,440
Is that so?

1269
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,430
If I okay it here, can you acquire it for 10 billion won?

1270
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,530
Yes.

1271
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,530
We decided to draft a binding MOU* 
  (*Memorandum of understanding) 

1272
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,870
that grants us the exclusive right to negotiate.

1273
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,400
With the MOU, we can proceed with negotiations

1274
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,500
around the 10 billion won mark.

1275
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,880
By when?

1276
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,950
Today.

1277
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:15,350
With speculative articles circulating, we should rush—

1278
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,480
Okay.

1279
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,000
Due diligence.

1280
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,870
Let's wrap it up here.

1281
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,460
How could we buy a game for 10 billion won?

1282
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,850
That's not important right now.

1283
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:24,810
Managing Director Ha.

1284
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:28,600
And personally report this to the chairman.

1285
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,300
That's okay, right, Mr. Lee?

1286
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,540
Yes, sure.

1287
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,310
   

1288
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,770
I'll go and report to the chairman.

1289
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,090
He'll probably oppose it, right?

1290
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,610
- Probably. 
 - I'm so scared.

1291
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,840
When is CEO Cha supposed to come?

1292
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,580
Is our contract ready?

1293
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,170
Yes. He's supposed to come at 5 p.m.

1294
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,040
I may be a bit late

1295
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,660
so please ask him for his understanding.

1296
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,560
 Is going to see the chairman that big of a deal? 

1297
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,870
 It is a big deal. 

1298
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,250
 Meeting with the decision maker 

1299
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,330
 is the most crucial moment in negotiations. 

1300
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,250
 Things that people on the project can't do 

1301
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,340
 could be decided there. 

1302
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,950
 He could tell us to acquire Cha Cha Games. 

1303
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,160
 Or our team could be dissolved. 

1304
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,450
Chairman, it's Team Leader Yun Ju No.

1305
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,220
 Come in. 

1306
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,000
Sit down.

1307
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,240
This is our first time meeting by ourselves, right?

1308
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,430
This is the second time.

1309
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,720
What?

1310
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:19,530
I met you once before going to Hawaii.

1311
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,400
Wasn't Mr. Lee there then?

1312
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,790
No.

1313
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,350
It was just you and me, Chairman.

1314
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:27,910
I see.

1315
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,010
I called you in like this

1316
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,960
to make sure.

1317
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,050
Are you...

1318
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,690
really working for me?

1319
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:45,880
I'm asking if I can trust you.

1320
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,250
Mr. Lee says it's not true,

1321
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,910
but weren't you responsible for stock manipulation?

1322
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,470
If you're referring to Jumbo Pharma—

1323
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,920
That's right.

1324
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,850
I heard you suggested buying it.

1325
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,330
Didn't you?

1326
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,970
 All right, let's say "Fighting" together. 

1327
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,020
 Fighting. 

1328
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,510
 But... 

1329
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,450
 About Jumbo... 

1330
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:33,070
 You weren't involved in it, right? 

1331
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,110
 I'm just asking... 

1332
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,870
 since you never know. 

1333
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,720
 I suppose you could feel that way. 

1334
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,920
 It's not like I don't know your personality, Mr. Theo. 

1335
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,600
 I'll only speak to you with facts. 

1336
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,960
 If we go to my office right now, 

1337
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,980
 I can show you the report by Yun Ju No 

1338
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,190
 saying we should acquire Jumbo Pharma. 

1339
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,560
 Really? 

1340
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,680
I asked you if you suggested we should acquire it.

1341
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,390
Yes.

1342
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,370
I did say we should acquire it.

1343
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:17,780
Despite that, you say you are innocent?

1344
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,780
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Then

1345
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,070
why did your brother have so much of its stock?

1346
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,520
Huh?

1347
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,640
 That's why... 

1348
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,570
 Yun Ju No was investigated by the prosecution. 

1349
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:36,910
 But he somehow managed not to end up in prison. 

1350
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,740
 He bought the stocks under his brother's name. 

1351
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,500
 Under a proxy name. 

1352
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,770
 So the prosecutors 

1353
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,590
 arrested and beat the crap out of him first, 

1354
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,720
 but he ended up dying. 

1355
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,370
 How? 

1356
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,280
 He committed suicide. 

1357
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,780
So

1358
01:14:56,770 --> 01:15:00,170
will you take revenge on the company,

1359
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:02,070
blaming it for your hyeong's death?

1360
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,680
No.

1361
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,700
Can you promise me that?

1362
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,120
Yes.

1363
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:22,710
If you promise, then acquire it.

1364
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,740
Pardon?

1365
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,510
Aren't you going to say you're acquiring a company?

1366
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,050
Yes.

1367
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:36,830
I want to acquire a game company, Cha Cha Games.

1368
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,280
Cha Cha Games made an offer of 10 billion won.

1369
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,590
There will be a price negotiation

1370
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,120
through due diligence if we choose to accept.

1371
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:47,410
But if we draft a nondisclosure agreement—

1372
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,970
Okay.

1373
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:52,350
Acquire it.

1374
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:05,590
He seems to be running a bit late.

1375
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,070
Should I call him?

1376
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,920
I'll do it.

1377
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:37,710
A lot of people don't like taking calls these days.

1378
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,740
Should we try calling the company instead?

1379
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,920
Oh, okay.

1380
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,640
Yes, this is Cha Cha Games, right?

1381
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,620
I'm Kwak Min Jeong of Sanin Group's M&amp;A Team.

1382
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:59,640
You have a meeting with us today—

1383
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,210
 Ho Jin went to meet you. 

1384
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:03,650
Oh, I see.

1385
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,300
I guess there must be a lot of traffic.

1386
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,630
 It's been a while since he left, though. 

1387
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:11,290
Well, I guess he should be arriving soon.

1388
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,630
Thank you.

1389
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,340
Then I will proceed with the contract.

1390
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,940
In return,

1391
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,120
make sure to acquire it.

1392
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,630
You got that?

1393
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,180
Okay.

1394
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,560
By chance,

1395
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,540
is there a special reason you said this?

1396
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,300
Reason? What reason would a businessman have?

1397
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,030
Okay. I understand.

1398
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,210
He's really bad at lying

1399
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,760
for a scammer.

1400
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,420
How did it go?

1401
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,670
We can proceed with it.

1402
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,620
Oh, really?

1403
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,310
You didn't get in trouble?

1404
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,580
As expected of our Team Leader!

1405
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,530
It appears CEO Cha is running a bit late.

1406
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:20,640
Okay.

1407
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,280
Gosh, is being on time

1408
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,250
not important for game developers?

1409
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,220
I know, right?

1410
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,760
I could've been late, so it's for the better.

1411
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,290
I suppose so,

1412
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,600
but it's an important meeting.

1413
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,550
Yes, CEO Cha.

1414
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,900
 I'm sorry, 

1415
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,260
 but I don't think I can make it today. 

1416
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,300
Would you like to reschedule?

1417
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,510
 No, it's not that. 

1418
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:06,660
 A different place offered more money. 

1419
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,000
How much did they offer?

1420
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,040
 They offered to pay double. 

1421
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,050
 I'm sorry. 

1422
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,050
 It's trouble if we mess with someone like that. 

1423
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,900
 He's capable of doing anything. 

1424
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,540
 What you are saying is true, CEO, 

1425
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,740
 but I know all the cards in Yun Ju No's hand. 

1426
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,320
 Oh, is that so? 

1427
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,550
 Then what will happen to our scenario? 

1428
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,910
 It's perfect. 

1429
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:54,280
Hello, this is Cha Cha Games, right?

1430
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,670
Yes.

1431
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,590
I came to make a proposal.

1432
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,940
Is the CEO here?

1433
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,210
   

1434
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,130
 Ho Jin, it's been a while. 

1435
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:32,310
 We've got things to talk about. Let's grab a drink. 

1436
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,970
 My treat. 

1437
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,900
Mr. Yun.

1438
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,340
   

1439
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:47,930
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 🐺 Wolf in a Suit 👔 Team @ Viki

1445

 Double the Sanin's offer. 

1446
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,610
 Is that the condition? 

1447
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,640
 - This was planned. 
 - We fell for it. 

1448
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,620
 Even Yun Ju No falls for it. 

1449
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,600
 In a battle, positioning comes first. 

1450
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,690
 As expected of a negotiations expert. 

1451
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:23,770
 Developers hide traces of themselves in easter eggs. 

1452
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:26,180
 There's even a game, High Square, that DC made. 

1453
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,310
 Aren't they crazy? 

1454
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,810
 They didn't hack, 

1455
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,670
 but the easter egg is still there. 

1456
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:33,230
 - Should I ask for that? 
 - He won't give you 10 billion. 

1457
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,380
 He's a scammer. 

1458
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,060
 They dare to mess with a reporter? 

1459
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,520
 Don't you want to make games again? 

1460
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,810
 I hear people in your field see everything as money. 

1461
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:41,220
 It's not over yet. 

1462
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:45,180
 Money isn't the only condition in a negotiation.
