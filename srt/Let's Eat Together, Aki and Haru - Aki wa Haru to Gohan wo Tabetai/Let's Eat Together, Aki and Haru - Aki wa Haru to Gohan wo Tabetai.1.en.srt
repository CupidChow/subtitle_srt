1
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:20,654
(May)

2
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,015
Aki!

3
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,709
Aki, are you still sleeping?

4
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,921
Aki... Chief Penguin is saying

5
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:33,982
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

6
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:35,197
He's complaining.

7
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:40,221
I'm so sorry you're hungry.

8
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:44,263
How about you, Haru? Aren't you hungry?

9
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,366
I am.

10
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,416
I like your honesty.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,529
Okay. Let's get up together.

12
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,767
Okay. Let's get up together.

13
00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:58,771
Ready?

14
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:02,327
Chow time!

15
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,482
I'm hungry.

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,659
His name is Junta Akiyoshi.

17
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:16,751
A college student majoring in economics.

18
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,292
His friends call him Aki.

19
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:27,045
And his name is Harutsugu Fujishiro.

20
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,209
An art student whose friends call him Haru.

21
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:36,887
started sharing a house

22
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:39,209
when they entered college.

23
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,643
It's finally starting.

24
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,136
Keep the common areas nice and tidy.

25
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:47,584
Haru is in charge of cleaning up.

26
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,364
Aki is in charge of cooking.

27
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,597
All right. It's done.

28
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,127
and are always together.

29
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,807
Yum. This is great.

30
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:06,086
"zero distance" between them.

31
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:13,726
I didn't say that.

32
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,626
any talent or skills.

33
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:21,816
You wouldn't understand how I feel.

34
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,209
Aki... Aki!

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,849
and struggles

36
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,482
but eating together lifts their spirits.

37
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,966
Yum!

38
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:42,468
they're sharing.

39
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:46,370
I met them almost four years ago.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,601
Very nice to meet you.

41
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:56,810
Udon noodles.

42
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,038
A perfect late breakfast.

43
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,479
Isn't it?

44
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:04,078
They're my favorite toppings.

45
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,209
"Shredded kombu kelp and pickled plum."

46
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,453
Got it.

47
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:11,834
Let's eat.

48
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,434
Let's eat.

49
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,193
It looks so good.

50
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,225
Let's see.

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,083
Mix the tororo kombu.

52
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,370
Be careful.

53
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:31,274
Yum!

54
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,998
Yeah? Good.

55
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:41,515
It hits the spot.

56
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,310
some to the chief?

57
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,593
Oh yeah.

58
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,419
Let's see how it tastes.

59
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,309
Pretty good seasoning.

60
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,142
Just pretty good?

61
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,966
It was delicious.

62
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,498
I'm glad you like it.

63
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:11,194
Thank you very much.

64
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,177
That's it? So soon?

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,068
The zero-distance buddies

66
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,013
are graduating college next spring.

67
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:24,542
Wanna try it with this seasoning?

68
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,787
Okay.

69
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,823
Yes. I see.

70
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,469
From timecode 28 to 30.

71
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,130
Right here. Okay.

72
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:41,022
- Haru!

73
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,131
I'll send it by the deadline.

74
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,404
Hey, Haru!

75
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,607
Haru!

76
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,209
Yes. Yes.

77
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,176
I'll be in touch, Kani.

78
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,004
Haru! Can you hear me?!

79
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,537
What's up, Aki?

80
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,146
I need your help.

81
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,084
How do I tie a tie?

82
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:07,642
I can't get it right.

83
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:10,071
I've only worn clip-ons.

84
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:12,021
What?

85
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,726
Oh no...

86
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,391
You can do it!

87
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,457
You're brushing me off.

88
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:23,255
Haru, help me.

89
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:28,331
Can you hear me?!

90
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:36,326
"Forget it. I don't need his help."

91
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:38,392
I can handle it myself.

92
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:42,404
Like this and... What?

93
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,542
Huh? Um...

94
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,521
It turned into a bow tie.

95
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,248
Haru!

96
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,568
Hold on.

97
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:59,789
What is it?

98
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,359
Ta-da!

99
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,959
Wow. You look different.

100
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:05,771
Don't I?

101
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,880
You look sharp.

102
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,326
Why aren't you interested?

103
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:16,209
- I'm busy.

104
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,615
- What?

105
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:22,126
Okay.

106
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,042
You should try it.

107
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,732
- I'm working on this.

108
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:33,400
Come in.

109
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,775
Hello.

110
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:48,156
Thank you for your time today.

111
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,334
My name is Junta Akiyoshi.

112
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:52,224
It's nice to meet you.

113
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:57,692
Please take a seat.

114
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,109
Thank you.

115
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,251
Please close the door.

116
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,942
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:24,270
This is Chief Penguin, our CEO.

118
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:35,093
who you are.

119
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,183
You can use any form of expression.

120
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,167
That's not one of the questions...

121
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,109
Mr. Akiyoshi.

122
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,442
Is there a problem?

123
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,933
No, not at all.

124
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,104
Go ahead.

125
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,293
Is it starting already?

126
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,878
Eight seconds.

127
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,470
All right.

128
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:12,542
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

129
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,731
My name is Junta Akiyoshi.

130
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,519
I want to join this company.

131
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,088
Come on! This chance...

132
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,229
Time's up.

133
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,819
Thank you.

134
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:31,384
Now a one-line joke, please.

135
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,750
I would definitely hire you.

136
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:36,375
Really?

137
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,734
Really.

138
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,753
The egg quacked.

139
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,503
Job hunting is so much work.

140
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,535
Going to orientations.

141
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,559
Filling out applications.

142
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:53,859
I don't care what it is.

143
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,734
Job hunting. A graduation project.

144
00:08:57,097 --> 00:09:00,660
for my upperclassman.

145
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,095
You wanted that job.

146
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,722
Job hunting costs a lot of money.

147
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,464
Yeah...

148
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:12,571
What about lunch?

149
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:17,401
What do we have here?

150
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,942
Some rice in the fridge but...

151
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:24,359
We had egg-on-rice for breakfast.

152
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,807
There's meat sauce in the freezer.

153
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,164
But we're out of pasta.

154
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,282
- Why are you shouting?

155
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:45,736
so you tear the lettuce.

156
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:46,878
Okay.

157
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:50,197
- Okay, okay.

158
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,276
I said I'll tear the tomato. I'll cut it.

159
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:58,704
Microwave the rice and place it on a dish.

160
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,705
I'm hungry.

161
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,370
Tear the lettuce.

162
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,409
It goes on the rice.

163
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:33,970
Put heated meat sauce over it.

164
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:41,800
and melting cheese.

165
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,940
- Doesn't it?

166
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,536
There it is! Meat sauce taco rice!

167
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,001
Let's eat.

168
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm so hungry.

169
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,868
You mix it up?

170
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:06,976
Of course.

171
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,104
I keep it separate.

172
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,901
Yum!

173
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,712
So good.

174
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:20,206
Eat another bite.

175
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,776
I really love how you eat.

176
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,122
Yum!

177
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:35,015
We get veggies with taco rice.

178
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,386
But this isn't real taco rice.

179
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,640
It's not?

180
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,362
The real one is spicier.

181
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,790
But it's good with meat sauce.

182
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,668
Thanks, Aki.

183
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:53,339
I would've had egg-on-rice again.

184
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:56,737
I wouldn't have made this.

185
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,253
I made it for you.

186
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:06,755
I am so happy we're housemates.

187
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,682
That's the only reason?

188
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,254
Yum.

189
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,128
You're eating so fast.

190
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,987
Because it's so good.

191
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,804
I'm full.

192
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,538
A great meal.

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,743
Your legs are in the way.

194
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,416
First come, first serve.

195
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,399
Whatever you say.

196
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,500
It's hard not to think about job hunting.

197
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,770
Changing your hair?

198
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,854
I haven't decided yet.

199
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,048
that'll accept me as I am.

200
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,051
Yeah. That hair color totally suits you.

201
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,757
to get a job.

202
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,360
just the way you are.

203
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,089
Don't be someone you're not.

204
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,137
Find a company that appreciates you.

205
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,377
Plus, finding a job isn't the goal.

206
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:54,143
how we handle our jobs.

207
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,976
Haru...

208
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,437
Thanks.

209
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,634
What would I do without you?

210
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:10,511
I'll find a company that I can thrive in.

211
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,247
"Me too. But easier said than done."

212
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,417
You'll be fine.

213
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:21,526
of wisdom like you.

214
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,175
Any company would be lucky to have you.

215
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,354
I don't know about that.

216
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,942
Let's just do our best.

217
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:41,942
(1 month later in June)

218
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,776
I'm going to my job interview.

219
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,604
than the dark one.

220
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,192
Thanks.

221
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,503
Hold on.

222
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,972
You missed a button.

223
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:08,942
I must be nervous.

224
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,275
There.

225
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:11,306
Thanks.

226
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:14,503
Loosen up. Smile.

227
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:17,862
Ow. That hurts.

228
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:21,234
Stop it. My nose...

229
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,009
Look. I'm smiling.

230
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,484
There you go.

231
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,081
I'm going now.

232
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,744
- It is.

233
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:46,459
See you!

234
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:47,983
Good luck!

235
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,003
Have fun at school!

236
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:04,973
You'll be fine.

237
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,234
(Kuri Art University)

238
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:31,222
project looks fine.

239
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:33,614
Thank you.

240
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,580
You now have to decide on the concept.

241
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,942
Okay.

242
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,217
By the way...

243
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,818
how's the job hunt?

244
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,251
Honestly...

245
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,478
it's not going too well.

246
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:57,044
for photographers.

247
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:03,249
Much less, a full-time position.

248
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,589
Yeah...

249
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,362
Job hunting...

250
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,597
Tough, huh?

251
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,536
This is Fujishiro. Hello, Kani.

252
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,483
Hi.

253
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,751
I sent the video you edited to the client.

254
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,750
Was there a problem?

255
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:38,364
Not at all.

256
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:41,945
They were really impressed.

257
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:43,697
That's good to hear.

258
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,511
And...

259
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,892
here's the main reason why I'm calling.

260
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,376
Okay.

261
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:53,804
He wants to hire you right out of school?

262
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,730
Yeah.

263
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,190
Kani?

264
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:04,707
and the clients liked what they got.

265
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:09,192
for online ads, right?

266
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:13,996
It's an interesting field.

267
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,233
But you're not sure?

268
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,496
I appreciate the job offer but...

269
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,692
You want a job as a photographer.

270
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:31,942
But I have to face the reality.

271
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,250
Go to graduate school like me.

272
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:36,844
What? Graduate school?

273
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,536
I don't know...

274
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,783
Yes? No?

275
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,098
Closer to no than yes.

276
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,371
In other words, no.

277
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:46,509
Hey!

278
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:51,128
by the station with us?

279
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,924
Sure! Let's go!

280
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,059
Let's go.

281
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,167
Sounds great.

282
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,098
Yeah.

283
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:59,668
(Aki: I finished the final interview)

284
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,077
Sorry. I'm going home.

285
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:14,054
It's not the first time.

286
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,184
I know.

287
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:40,681
I smell curry.

288
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:44,217
The landlord's house?

289
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,622
No.

290
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,161
This way. Over there.

291
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,860
It's coming from our house!

292
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,926
I'm home!

293
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:09,395
Haru! This scent of curry...

294
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,288
Hi.

295
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:20,389
The food's ready. Wanna eat now?

296
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,004
Are you listening?

297
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:30,413
I'll eat.

298
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,538
I'll eat!

299
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,134
Okay.

300
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,549
Did you cook this for me?

301
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:40,958
I guess so.

302
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,862
The air outside smelled so good too!

303
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,518
- Haru!

304
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,933
- Curry first!

305
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,666
- Your curry!

306
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:55,042
- Smells so good!

307
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:56,501
Here you go.

308
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,504
Go ahead.

309
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,158
Thank you.

310
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:17,859
Wow. It looks great.

311
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,186
Here I go.

312
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:28,723
Wow! Delicious!

313
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,172
Awesome! I love your curry!

314
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:33,572
on the box.

315
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,418
That's the best way to make curry.

316
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,909
- Yeah.

317
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,668
All right. I'll eat too.

318
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,068
Yum!

319
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:50,343
Isn't it?

320
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:53,491
You make the best curry.

321
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,934
- Yum.

322
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:02,084
depending on who makes it.

323
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,172
The veggies are cut differently too.

324
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,434
Yeah.

325
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,223
I make it medium spicy with beef.

326
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,403
I like curry for kids.

327
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:18,184
I really like its gentle flavor.

328
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,642
Thanks.

329
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,213
It smelled so good when I came home.

330
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:32,338
Dinner was even cooked. Fantastic!

331
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:34,568
after your interview.

332
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:35,760
How did it go?

333
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:41,628
I think I did well.

334
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,057
Really? That's great.

335
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:44,606
Thanks, Haru.

336
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,434
Now it's my turn to support you.

337
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:53,999
Yeah...

338
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,469
Nothing.

339
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:01,465
Keep eating.

340
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:31,528
join our company.

341
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:42,902
Haru?

342
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:44,892
Haru!

343
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:47,434
Huh? What's up?

344
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,712
Oh... Nothing...

345
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,488
Ice Blade!

346
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:12,775
And then...

347
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:15,581
You're good.

348
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,477
So are you!

349
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:19,335
- Another match.

350
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:25,585
Go. Attack! I'm vulnerable right now.

351
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,026
Come on!

352
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,926
Here... And...

353
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,401
Yes! You win!

354
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,307
I won.

355
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,623
Way to go.

356
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:41,595
Excellent game, Haru.

357
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:43,573
- Totally.

358
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,112
Let's play again.

359
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,290
I'll change my character.

360
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:50,731
You can use one of mine.

361
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:53,258
Use whatever you want.

362
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,367
Okay?

363
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,567
Haru, are you free tomorrow?

364
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:06,356
Tomorrow? I have nothing planned.

365
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,801
So you're free. Very free.

366
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:12,760
Let's go to an aquarium!

367
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:13,859
Why all of a sudden?

368
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:17,559
My boss at work gave me discount tickets.

369
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:20,550
Let's go!

370
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:21,775
Okay...

371
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,092
Good. It's decided.

372
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:28,509
It'll be so much fun!

373
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:34,442
Haru seems kind of down these days.

374
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,301
- Yeah.

375
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,034
I want to cheer him up

376
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:41,543
because he always cheers me up.

377
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:46,285
Welcome.

378
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,895
- Hello.

379
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:50,734
Here's a penguin already.

380
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,468
Yeah. You brought him.

381
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,092
- Yeah.

382
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:56,675
But different color.

383
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,707
Thank you.

384
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:00,028
- Thank you.

385
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:06,484
I've always wanted to come here.

386
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,842
Your first time?

387
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:08,984
You've been here?

388
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:10,925
With my cousin years ago.

389
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,359
I should've asked first.

390
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:15,925
Why are you apologizing?

391
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,770
and I wanted to come back.

392
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:27,939
not the other way around.

393
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:28,964
Haru!

394
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,837
Wow! Penguins!

395
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:40,468
Look, Chief Penguin!

396
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,079
Your friends.

397
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,234
Hello.

398
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:44,592
Hello.

399
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:48,957
like Chief Penguin.

400
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:56,035
There are some big ones.

401
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,982
They look so relaxed.

402
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,059
- Scary!

403
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:10,259
- They're so cool.

404
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,422
Amazing.

405
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,645
Wow!

406
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:26,900
Awesome.

407
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,168
- Yeah.

408
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:32,509
This is so cool.

409
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,859
I wanna lie down on a futon.

410
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,859
I wanna drink and chill out.

411
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:38,426
As always.

412
00:27:38,762 --> 00:27:39,821
Is that a ray?

413
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:42,106
It is. It's so cute.

414
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:43,588
He looks like you.

415
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,315
No, he doesn't.

416
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,262
- Sure.

417
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,692
With which one?

418
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:51,900
- It's gone.

419
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,800
- Now! Say cheese.

420
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:57,823
There.

421
00:27:57,848 --> 00:27:58,925
Got it.

422
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,454
It's a great shot.

423
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:05,817
to bring your camera?

424
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,035
Huh?

425
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,668
You're not taking any photos.

426
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:14,981
When I feel like it.

427
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,357
Haru!

428
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,746
Are you thirsty? I'll get us a drink.

429
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,121
He's going out of his way to be nice.

430
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,106
Excuse me.

431
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:54,894
Will you take a photo of us?

432
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:55,835
Sure.

433
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,199
Here.

434
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:00,317
Stand right there.

435
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:03,134
Ready? Say...

436
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,838
She's hiding behind you.

437
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:10,192
All right. Put that dolphin on your head.

438
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,151
Say cheese.

439
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:18,234
Nice, very nice. You're taller now.

440
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,988
Can you jump now?

441
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:20,978
Ready?

442
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,129
Jump!

443
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,948
Again.

444
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,138
Ready? Jump!

445
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,715
Great.

446
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,229
What do you think?

447
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,299
Wow. You captured the moment.

448
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:34,565
It's a great shot.

449
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,319
Thank you.

450
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,427
Take a look.

451
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,144
Thank you.

452
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:40,461
Bye. See you.

453
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,009
Say bye.

454
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,973
Thank you again.

455
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:48,524
Look. Mr. Dolphin is jumping with us.

456
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:50,768
So cute.

457
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:22,900
Haru!

458
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,420
- Thanks.

459
00:30:27,184 --> 00:30:29,434
You have your camera out.

460
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:30,799
Yeah.

461
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:34,326
Thanks.

462
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:41,723
What happened without me?

463
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:53,721
It's so sunny now.

464
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:54,829
Yeah.

465
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:16,985
You know...

466
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,031
What?

467
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:22,732
You didn't need me...

468
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,592
To cheer up.

469
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:28,816
Excuse me?

470
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:33,937
to pull yourself together.

471
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:41,431
I knew you were trying to cheer me up.

472
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,563
What's on your mind?

473
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:49,754
I don't know.

474
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:59,707
as someone I need or not.

475
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:08,079
I like being with you.

476
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,613
I feel really comfortable.

477
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,348
Not good enough?

478
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:25,747
Very good enough.

479
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,404
Why be so formal?

480
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:29,415
I have no idea.

481
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:30,905
Whatever.

482
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:40,128
Aki.

483
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,915
Thanks for taking me out today.

484
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:48,034
I love taking photos.

485
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,848
a job as a photographer.

486
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:02,430
Aki, stand here.

487
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:03,497
Here?

488
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:06,040
- Yep.

489
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,637
Say cheese.

490
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:10,862
- Really good.

491
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,402
Now go like this.

492
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:14,613
- Yeah.

493
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:16,059
My legs are hurting.

494
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:17,629
Say cheese.

495
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,096
How is it?

496
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:21,917
- Totally.

497
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:23,483
- Okay.

498
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:26,841
Then... Hold on.

499
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,192
Ready?

500
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:30,520
Nice.

501
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:32,512
Say cheese.

502
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,069
Great photographer.

503
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:40,090
(Few weeks later)

504
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:49,125
- Yeah.

505
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:54,325
Stop it.

506
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,475
I lost it.

507
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,333
See what I mean?

508
00:33:58,475 --> 00:33:59,285
Where did it go?

509
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,769
I'll find it later.

510
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,639
Unbelievable.

511
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:26,762
I got it.

512
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,059
Got what?

513
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,230
A job offer.

514
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:35,676
It means I'm hired, right?

515
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:40,206
What? Let me see it!

516
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:41,973
Aki, hold on.

517
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,988
It's a job offer.

518
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:47,475
you wanted to join!

519
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,793
I'm not hallucinating, am I?

520
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:56,018
You're so calm even at a time like this.

521
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:58,832
I went all wild and crazy.

522
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,462
Are you ready?

523
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,100
Yeah.

524
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:13,142
Okay. Go.

525
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:21,637
a position at our company.

526
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:25,018
After a careful screening process,

527
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:31,171
you've been hired.

528
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,746
That's great.

529
00:35:38,517 --> 00:35:40,617
Get up. Stand here.

530
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,309
What are you gonna do?

531
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,137
What?

532
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:44,325
Congratulations!

533
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,701
It's cold! Hey!

534
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:50,582
Haru! I can't open my eyes! Wait!

535
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,892
Stop it! Knock it off!

536
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:58,309
Wait! Haru! Give it to me!

537
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:01,826
Haru! I can't open my eyes!

538
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:03,475
Like that.

539
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,767
Phew... I'm so relieved.

540
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,851
We should celebrate.

541
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:12,141
You just want an excuse to drink.

542
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,623
Come on.

543
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,534
Let's celebrate.

544
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,767
like Yoneyama and Mugita.

545
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:20,465
Usual members?

546
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,553
I don't know...

547
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,267
Why not? Hey.

548
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:27,259
I have a secret recipe.

549
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,832
- Yeah.

550
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:35,200
from a frozen pie sheet.

551
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,309
Here we go!

552
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:37,726
An important job.

553
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,242
- You got it.

554
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,267
- Squares.

555
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,826
- You're doing good.

556
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,784
What do you think, Chief Penguin?

557
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:50,934
She's good.

558
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,801
Haru, say something.

559
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:56,826
Haru!

560
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,392
Nice to meet you.

561
00:36:58,658 --> 00:36:59,450
Chief...

562
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:01,450
Squares.

563
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,976
Stretch the squares.

564
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:08,315
- How's this?

565
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:10,387
How are you guys doing?

566
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,409
Square...

567
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,158
- Start over.

568
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:17,042
- Shut up.

569
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,183
on the takoyaki plate.

570
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:23,970
There.

571
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:28,325
Press it down to make itgo like this, right?

572
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,450
How's this?

573
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,976
Yeah... It looks good.

574
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,504
- I'm good at this.

575
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,648
Looks good.

576
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,965
Put your ingredients of choice in there.

577
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:42,726
Yay!

578
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,711
The best part.

579
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,361
Tuna and corn.

580
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,910
Is this enough?

581
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,689
Now me.

582
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:59,121
Potato and...

583
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,754
fermented seafood.

584
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:05,543
It looks good.

585
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,575
My turn.

586
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:10,237
Pizza sauce and

587
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:12,262
sausage and

588
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,013
"mwelty" cheese.

589
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,199
Mwelty cheese.

590
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,054
Mwelty cheese. Mwelty...

591
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,412
No one's listening.

592
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:27,227
Are you listening to me?

593
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:28,210
It's looking good.

594
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:37,473
tartar sauce and nuggets.

595
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:43,400
First, the tartar sauce.

596
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,520
The nuggets...

597
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:52,590
They're ready!

598
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:56,115
Now that the ingredients are in place

599
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,681
the lid goes there and we switch it on!

600
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,257
While we're waiting...

601
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:05,676
Cheers!

602
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:17,450
I can finally relax and drink.

603
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:19,425
Congratulations on your job offers.

604
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,826
Congratulations.

605
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:21,742
Thanks.

606
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:22,659
Thanks.

607
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,184
I also got a job offer last month!

608
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:37,148
Congratulations, Yoneyama.

609
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,407
Thank you.

610
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,246
Forget it. I didn't want it from you.

611
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:48,129
What kind of company is it?

612
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:51,158
A home decor retailer called Toco Magica.

613
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:53,823
There's a shop in Machida.

614
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:56,357
I bought all my dishes there.

615
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:57,175
You did?

616
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,216
- I bought a lot.

617
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,188
Working in the shops?

618
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,255
I want to do product planning

619
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,946
are assigned to the shops.

620
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,028
I'll go see you.

621
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:10,718
Me too.

622
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,451
Please do.

623
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:14,986
I'm happy for you too.

624
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:17,145
Being patient paid off.

625
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,340
He's starting tomorrow at the studio.

626
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,665
Are you serious?

627
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,023
Just part-time until April.

628
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,718
You have to finish your graduation project.

629
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:31,781
I do...

630
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,903
You can slack off, can't you?

631
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:36,317
No way.

632
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,943
You're so diligent that way.

633
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,267
A part of him that we love.

634
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:52,177
Hey... Do you think they're ready?

635
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,327
I do believe so.

636
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,563
I can't wait.

637
00:40:58,118 --> 00:40:59,754
Here we go.

638
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:02,637
Open!

639
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,256
Takoyaki pies!

640
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:12,262
It smells so good.

641
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:14,184
They look good too.

642
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,684
I'm starving.

643
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,332
- Yeah.

644
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,351
Let's eat!

645
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,459
I'll try this one. It's round!

646
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:25,036
So cute like a hat.

647
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,000
Here I go.

648
00:41:30,209 --> 00:41:33,251
Crispy! Delicious.

649
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,959
The sound is good.

650
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:38,834
I'm gonna top it with something.

651
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:41,590
A little butter.

652
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,084
Definitely tasty.

653
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:45,160
For sure.

654
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,042
Here I go!

655
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:54,910
The butter is great.

656
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,226
The fermented seafood?

657
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,887
It's a really good pairing.

658
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:01,725
You'll love it.

659
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,834
It's good.

660
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,234
It is.

661
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,418
Yum.

662
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,642
What?

663
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:11,957
What did you say?

664
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,975
Can I try something else?

665
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,167
Sure.

666
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:19,351
I want Azusa's corn.

667
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,142
Go ahead.

668
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,709
Here I go.

669
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:28,629
It's super good.

670
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,137
- Yeah.

671
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,084
Wow. It's great.

672
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:38,424
- Great choice by me.

673
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:39,950
- Eat another one.

674
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,068
May I?

675
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:43,434
- Me too.

676
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,613
Great with booze.

677
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:48,169
A piece for me.

678
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,352
Go for it.

679
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,767
Tuna and corn go so well together.

680
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,762
- It's great.

681
00:42:58,215 --> 00:42:59,957
It's so good I almost passed out.

682
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,447
A one-man show?

683
00:43:02,472 --> 00:43:04,316
- Eat up.

684
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:06,561
- Yeah.

685
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,246
Our battle is just starting.

686
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,017
I'll cut the avocados I brought.

687
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,429
Nice.

688
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,703
- Okay.

689
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,277
How about sweet pies?

690
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:18,637
Great idea.

691
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,496
Aki, do we have chocolate?

692
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,416
In the fridge.

693
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,318
Nice.

694
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,754
He imitated you.

695
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:36,384
Haru, I'm sorry.

696
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:41,575
All of us coming to your house like this...

697
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,975
We're glad you're all here.

698
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,167
Really?

699
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:53,235
Aki could be timid sometimes.

700
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,802
He was worried about job hunting.

701
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:57,543
He was?

702
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,543
I didn't know that.

703
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:03,409
Now that he has a job offer

704
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:08,434
and drinking and eating.

705
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:11,176
I love watching him like this...

706
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,042
What's wrong? Are you okay?

707
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:20,589
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

708
00:44:21,086 --> 00:44:24,198
I want to replay this scene in my mind.

709
00:44:24,223 --> 00:44:25,204
Give me a second.

710
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,521
Okay. I'll look for the chocolate.

711
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:28,971
Thanks.

712
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:38,167
Let's start Round 2!

713
00:44:39,606 --> 00:44:40,934
Perfect alignment!

714
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,145
Nice.

715
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:43,465
Let's eat.

716
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,588
- Chocolate.

717
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:47,267
- I'll try the marshmallow.

718
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,761
Octopus.

719
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,245
It's hot.

720
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:54,184
- It's so hot.

721
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:55,209
Hot?

722
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,184
Sweet and good.

723
00:44:57,209 --> 00:44:59,910
Can I eat the chocolate now?

724
00:45:03,757 --> 00:45:06,549
Wow... It felt great.

725
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,042
Haru, your turn.

726
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,809
I drank too much.

727
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:17,600
It happens when we're with those guys.

728
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,667
- Go ahead.

729
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:27,481
I feel good.

730
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,416
Who is it?

731
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:35,449
Who could it be?

732
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:50,918
You're kidding.

733
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,555
What are little potatoes?

734
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,387
What are little potatoes?

735
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:20,287
Baby potatoes?

736
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,106
Close. Tator tots.

737
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,809
Okay. I get it.

738
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,393
- Let's see.

739
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:29,972
- 2.3 million?

740
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:32,917
- High-quality products.

741
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:35,101
I have the exact amount.

742
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:36,951
You're rich.

743
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:38,995
- Thank you too.

744
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,729
How's your job hunting?

745
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,409
I got an offer.

746
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,757
- Aki too.

747
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,279
Yes.

748
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,388
- Thank you.

749
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,594
Any celebration goodies for us?

750
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:53,036
Celebration?

751
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:04,574
Did something happen?

752
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,027
You're not yourself these days.

753
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,793
My imagination?

754
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:23,777
You see...

755
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:28,519
My workplace...

756
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:32,340
is gonna be in Osaka.

757
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:38,613
for the first couple of years.

758
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:49,090
I have to move to Osaka in April...

759
00:47:50,229 --> 00:47:54,949
a new place to live.

760
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:05,676
Okay. I will.

761
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:09,941
Aki, good luck.

762
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:14,829
You too.

763
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,101
Okay.

764
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:41,008
Nice.

765
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:42,843
Face the other way.

766
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:46,826
but will be full-time from April.

767
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:48,121
Thank you.

768
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:49,551
I'm counting on you.

769
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:50,793
I'll do my best.

770
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:52,784
Turning around lately?

771
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:54,706
No, huh?

772
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:57,826
If you need any help, ask Akaboshi.

773
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,060
I will.

774
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:01,121
Let's wrap it up.

775
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:03,576
Sorry. One more.

776
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:05,367
Looking good.

777
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:08,117
Let me check.

778
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:10,576
Akaboshi.

779
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:12,925
Hi, boss.

780
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,992
Hi.

781
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:17,008
His first day on the job.

782
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,496
Nice to meet you.

783
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,979
So you're our new star recruit.

784
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:22,934
Um...

785
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,832
I'm Akaboshi. Nice to meet you.

786
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:26,396
Thank you.

787
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,566
Hi.

788
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:29,950
Usa, come here.

789
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:33,033
This looks great.

790
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:34,008
Wow.

791
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:34,992
I love it.

792
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,742
This one's good, huh?

793
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,134
Excellent.

794
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:39,492
- Yes.

795
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:50,973
Haru...

796
00:49:52,644 --> 00:49:56,254
is going out to dinner with his colleagues.

797
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:11,754
My workplace...

798
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:16,229
is gonna be in Osaka.

799
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:21,637
I have to move to Osaka in April...

800
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:27,488
a new place to live.

801
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:34,176
Okay. I will.

802
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:37,973
Aki, good luck.

803
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:45,191
I wanted him to say...

804
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,637
that he'd miss me.

805
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:06,543
My life with Haru here...

806
00:51:16,432 --> 00:51:18,402
ends when we graduate.

807
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,707
Haru's scent.

808
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:33,332
I'm so sad.

809
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:48,738
Aki... Aki!

810
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:50,787
Aki, wake up.

811
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,467
Come. Hurry.

812
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:53,742
Good morning.

813
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:55,318
Aki!

814
00:51:55,343 --> 00:51:56,635
I'm coming.

815
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:10,933
- Thank you.

816
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,519
It turned out especially good this year.

817
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,551
Try it.

818
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,733
Thank you.

819
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,174
It's delicious.

820
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:27,582
Yum.

821
00:52:28,032 --> 00:52:29,907
The best so far.

822
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:34,223
Really? I'm glad you like it.

823
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,573
But it's sad to think

824
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:42,316
I'll be bringing over my plum wine.

825
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:48,916
Haru told me you're moving to Osaka.

826
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,996
Yes...

827
00:52:55,187 --> 00:52:58,613
So I told her we're moving out in March.

828
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,141
I'll miss you guys.

829
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,081
Where are you moving to?

830
00:53:06,237 --> 00:53:08,363
Somewhere near my workplace.

831
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:10,013
I see.

832
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:14,332
Time flies, doesn't it?

833
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:18,160
You're graduating from college soon.

834
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:21,266
Four years passed by so quickly.

835
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:26,113
when you guys moved in.

836
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,570
Too bad I can't be a student forever.

837
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,976
is like taking a bath.

838
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,746
Bath?

839
00:53:38,324 --> 00:53:41,474
Sometimes you feel too lazy to take a bath

840
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:45,863
you're glad that you did. Right?

841
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:48,559
Right.

842
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:52,399
But I never feel too lazy to take a bath

843
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:54,043
so I may be an exception.

844
00:53:54,894 --> 00:53:58,240
as soon as possible.

845
00:53:58,265 --> 00:54:01,884
So yes, you are an exception.

846
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,418
I see.

847
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:07,509
Do you feel too lazy to take a bath?

848
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,205
Are you kidding me? I love it.

849
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,987
See how supple my skin is.

850
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:14,143
It is.

851
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,799
I bathe in the morning too.

852
00:54:15,824 --> 00:54:17,308
Three hours each time.

853
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:19,362
- Yes.

854
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:21,182
- Wow.

855
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:23,393
I can't tell how old you are.

856
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:25,315
- Absolutely.

857
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,918
- Are you immortal?

858
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:38,121
(3 months later in November)

859
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:55,643
One last shot.

860
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:57,863
Okay. Let me check.

861
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,765
Looks good.

862
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:05,941
Which area

863
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,042
are you moving to?

864
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,620
I have no idea.

865
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:14,746
You should decide soon.

866
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,715
I don't have time.

867
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:18,871
What?

868
00:55:19,874 --> 00:55:22,415
You procrastinate sometimes.

869
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,845
I do not.

870
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,527
Yes, you do.

871
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:29,117
March is just around the corner.

872
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:31,825
and the part-time job...

873
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,340
I know!

874
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,769
You don't have to tell me.

875
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,136
Sorry.

876
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,496
I'll try a new lens.

877
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:52,637
Give me the 85 mm.

878
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,746
Hey!

879
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:57,559
Yes... Ow!

880
00:55:58,892 --> 00:55:59,892
I'm sorry.

881
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,746
Lunch break?

882
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,209
Go ahead.

883
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:06,973
- Okay.

884
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:09,934
To the dressing room.

885
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:18,426
What's wrong?

886
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,957
You're so out of it these days.

887
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:22,059
I'm sorry.

888
00:56:22,184 --> 00:56:24,394
Stay focused or leave.

889
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:34,269
Haru.

890
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:42,371
You look gloomy these days.

891
00:56:44,394 --> 00:56:45,302
I'm sorry.

892
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:47,551
Apologizing won't solve the problem.

893
00:56:49,392 --> 00:56:50,892
Go home today.

894
00:56:51,338 --> 00:56:52,503
But...

895
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,566
You're feeling something, aren't you?

896
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:05,691
Something iffy.

897
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:09,701
I don't know what it is

898
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:14,957
if you want to be a pro.

899
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:21,230
Let me take a guess.

900
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:30,152
Am I right?

901
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:33,655
Well...

902
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,059
So go home today.

903
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:38,902
I'll make an excuse for the boss.

904
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:44,841
Go.

905
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,392
Thank you.

906
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:53,465
- Yes?

907
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:05,996
Thank you.

908
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:21,951
(Chief Penguin)

909
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:26,101
(Graduation thesis)

910
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:38,902
Why did I say that?

911
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,707
Yes?

912
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:15,626
What?

913
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:19,725
Hi there.

914
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:21,421
Sis!

915
00:59:22,537 --> 00:59:24,287
Big sister Rikka!

916
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:25,895
That's me!

917
00:59:26,027 --> 00:59:27,485
What are you doing here?

918
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,148
It's ready.

919
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:30,918
What is?

920
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,818
We waited for so long.

921
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:34,895
We're starving.

922
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,070
Starving.

923
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:38,229
- Starving.

924
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:39,655
- Shtarving.

925
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,347
- Let's go.

926
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:44,507
Let's eat.

927
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,605
Wow!

928
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:59,887
I brought meat that you guys can't afford.

929
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:01,408
Now eat.

930
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,809
If you insist...

931
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:05,949
Let's eat!

932
01:00:08,332 --> 01:00:09,907
Beef...

933
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:11,668
It's beef.

934
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:22,250
Yum!

935
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:24,317
Now my turn.

936
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,157
Here I go.

937
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,410
Yum!

938
01:00:38,483 --> 01:00:41,441
Thank you, dear sister.

939
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:44,680
Eat to your heart's content.

940
01:00:45,317 --> 01:00:48,484
All right. I'll have some too.

941
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:50,543
Here I go.

942
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,730
Yum!

943
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:07,301
Fantastic seasoning!

944
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:11,159
Such kind words, dear sister.

945
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:13,707
What? Potatoes?

946
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:16,034
Oh yeah.

947
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,121
Your family doesn't use potatoes?

948
01:01:18,618 --> 01:01:19,992
No.

949
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:21,159
No.

950
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:23,783
My family does. Try it.

951
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,394
Let's see.

952
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:36,034
It absorbed so much flavor! Delicious!

953
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:40,742
It is. Great texture too.

954
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:42,226
Isn't it?

955
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:43,926
Potato, a new must.

956
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,508
I'm so happy

957
01:01:50,534 --> 01:01:52,950
that you're here to congratulate us.

958
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:57,742
A home decor retailer, right?

959
01:01:58,117 --> 01:01:58,825
It's so you.

960
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,275
- Definitely.

961
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,342
I'll buy your products.

962
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,409
Thanks.

963
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,742
Haru, you're gonna work at a photo studio.

964
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:08,909
Yeah, I guess...

965
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:10,679
You guess?

966
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:13,117
You'll be a star photographer.

967
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,691
Life isn't that easy.

968
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:21,277
Maybe I'll give you your first job.

969
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:25,825
Wedding photos. Will you?

970
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,409
Whose wedding?

971
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:31,644
Why do guys take so long to notice?

972
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:36,398
You...?

973
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,060
Congratulations, Rikka!

974
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:44,585
Thank you, Aki.

975
01:02:44,618 --> 01:02:46,242
It's about time.

976
01:02:46,593 --> 01:02:48,051
Who is he?

977
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:52,024
Yuji, her high school sweetheart.

978
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:54,174
They go back years.

979
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:00,276
you begged to play with him.

980
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:01,317
Did I?

981
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:03,092
You're so cute.

982
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:05,832
He imitated Yuji and pierced his ears.

983
01:03:07,611 --> 01:03:09,444
When's the wedding?

984
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:13,785
Just a party.

985
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:15,326
You're invited too.

986
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:17,342
I am?

987
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:20,355
Of course. We'll serve good drinks.

988
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,523
Thank you.

989
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:28,055
Why did you decide to marry him?

990
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:29,618
That's a personal question.

991
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,734
I'm curious.

992
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,223
Let's see...

993
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:40,930
I realized that we can share our problems

994
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:47,390
I feel in everyday life.

995
01:03:52,009 --> 01:03:53,851
Too much info for me.

996
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:56,190
Why? Are you embarrassed?

997
01:03:56,215 --> 01:03:57,340
Huh?

998
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:00,484
Same here.

999
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:04,525
Nothing.

1000
01:04:20,998 --> 01:04:22,998
Don't get all mushyduring the party.

1001
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:25,140
We won't.

1002
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:28,484
I don't want him to "kiss the bride."

1003
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:30,658
I see.

1004
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,826
That's why no ceremony.

1005
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:37,769
Aki?

1006
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,168
Bathroom.

1007
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:46,000
What should I eat next?

1008
01:05:04,636 --> 01:05:06,261
He's gone...

1009
01:05:10,461 --> 01:05:12,505
Aki, where did you go?

1010
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:22,080
Aki!

1011
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:02,889
There you are.

1012
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:04,923
I was looking for you.

1013
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:07,787
Sorry.

1014
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:09,189
It's okay.

1015
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:29,742
Where's Haru?

1016
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,784
Looking for you too.

1017
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:35,659
I'll tell him I found you.

1018
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:46,159
Sent.

1019
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:07,474
Listen, Rikka.

1020
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:18,029
Like you and your future husband,

1021
01:07:19,218 --> 01:07:24,343
all the joy and fun with Haru.

1022
01:07:25,804 --> 01:07:28,255
Much, much more.

1023
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:31,935
From now on...

1024
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:34,591
Forever.

1025
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:40,716
So I'm sad to move away.

1026
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:55,576
But...

1027
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:01,873
maybe it's a good thing.

1028
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,763
It made me realize how I feel.

1029
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:29,107
My true feelings...

1030
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,459
for Haru...

1031
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,302
Sorry.

1032
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,849
Haru is

1033
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:11,295
a lucky guy.

1034
01:09:18,578 --> 01:09:20,146
Why don't you...

1035
01:09:23,733 --> 01:09:25,552
tell him how you feel?

1036
01:09:35,346 --> 01:09:37,349
I'm going to keep it to myself.

1037
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:41,526
My feelings...

1038
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:45,623
might not sit well with him.

1039
01:09:59,227 --> 01:10:00,404
Let's go.

1040
01:10:01,606 --> 01:10:03,271
Haru must be worried.

1041
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:06,169
Okay.

1042
01:10:13,305 --> 01:10:16,139
There's a lot of meat left. Eat up.

1043
01:10:16,799 --> 01:10:17,758
Okay?

1044
01:10:19,057 --> 01:10:20,248
Yeah...

1045
01:10:21,023 --> 01:10:22,023
Cheer up.

1046
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:24,982
Thanks.

1047
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:35,317
Aki...

1048
01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:37,682
We're back.

1049
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,412
Hi.

1050
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:43,904
I'm hungry.

1051
01:10:44,326 --> 01:10:46,035
A lot of meat left.

1052
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:48,123
I only had a bite.

1053
01:12:01,104 --> 01:12:03,904
That sounds good. Let's go over there.

1054
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:06,426
Kuri Art University)

1055
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,159
It's now March.

1056
01:12:08,184 --> 01:12:10,402
(March)

1057
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,482
I bet Haru will be surprised.

1058
01:12:12,748 --> 01:12:16,221
come to the exhibition.

1059
01:12:16,246 --> 01:12:18,496
Photos are taken to be viewed.

1060
01:12:18,521 --> 01:12:20,137
Let's surprise him.

1061
01:12:20,162 --> 01:12:21,402
This way, right?

1062
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:22,521
No, that way.

1063
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,396
Right. Let's go.

1064
01:12:25,076 --> 01:12:26,951
What a know-it-all.

1065
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,777
Where's the exhibition?

1066
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,226
We know where it is. Sorry.

1067
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:34,492
a new place to live?

1068
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,604
Yeah. A new apartment with a loft.

1069
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:38,367
- Awesome.

1070
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:41,159
Even housing allowance from the company.

1071
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:43,408
- Totally.

1072
01:12:43,433 --> 01:12:46,325
I hear the food is great in Osaka.

1073
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,184
I wanna eat takoyaki pie.

1074
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:50,076
Me too.

1075
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:51,643
- I'm sure they do.

1076
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:53,232
I should open a restaurant.

1077
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,184
Hey... Hold on.

1078
01:12:56,892 --> 01:13:00,552
Split the rent.

1079
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,243
- Right?

1080
01:13:03,268 --> 01:13:04,784
- Save money.

1081
01:13:04,809 --> 01:13:06,873
We're moving out of the house.

1082
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,825
Oh... Right.

1083
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:15,659
Yeah, of course.

1084
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:18,408
- No problem.

1085
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:20,629
So your project...

1086
01:13:20,654 --> 01:13:23,552
Nothing has changed between Haru and me.

1087
01:13:24,559 --> 01:13:27,170
I'm relieved that we're still the same.

1088
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:31,475
I'm actually glad I don't have any courage.

1089
01:13:34,402 --> 01:13:35,610
It's here.

1090
01:13:37,438 --> 01:13:38,980
- Isn't it?

1091
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:40,700
Hello.

1092
01:13:40,725 --> 01:13:42,238
- Thank you.

1093
01:13:42,263 --> 01:13:44,367
Hello. Thank you.

1094
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:45,809
- Huh?

1095
01:13:46,017 --> 01:13:48,052
Nothing...

1096
01:13:50,545 --> 01:13:51,992
- Me.

1097
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:53,684
I thought we've met.

1098
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,974
In a dream, I think.

1099
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,724
What do you think?

1100
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,473
Hey, Haru!

1101
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,733
- Staff member.

1102
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:17,196
Why are you here?

1103
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:19,591
Surprise!

1104
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,285
Long time no see.

1105
01:14:22,101 --> 01:14:22,992
Hi.

1106
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:25,226
- The usual?

1107
01:14:26,799 --> 01:14:30,162
Yoneyama-man loves rice!

1108
01:14:33,222 --> 01:14:35,055
Is Aki here?

1109
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:36,662
Of course.

1110
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:38,811
Where is he?

1111
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,990
Looking at your photos.

1112
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,435
I'm sure he's still there.

1113
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:15,498
Haru!

1114
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:20,524
Your photos...

1115
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:26,688
are fantastic.

1116
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:36,699
if I was your roommate.

1117
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:40,005
Now I know why.

1118
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,849
You said I could.

1119
01:15:43,651 --> 01:15:46,193
I didn't know they were all me.

1120
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:51,388
Okay...

1121
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,599
This is your line of sight.

1122
01:15:59,095 --> 01:16:00,474
Gentle...

1123
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:03,263
Warm...

1124
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:06,880
Delightful.

1125
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:11,732
Being in your photos

1126
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:13,959
feels weird.

1127
01:16:57,626 --> 01:16:59,802
Sorry for asking you to cook that.

1128
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,841
Don't be sorry.

1129
01:17:02,988 --> 01:17:06,380
I'm super happy that you requested this.

1130
01:17:17,863 --> 01:17:19,825
Haru? What's wrong?

1131
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:24,051
Nothing. My mind went blank.

1132
01:17:25,526 --> 01:17:27,150
You must be tired.

1133
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:29,777
Maybe.

1134
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,168
Will you start the timer?

1135
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:47,552
You hardly ever drink beer by yourself.

1136
01:17:47,942 --> 01:17:49,400
I feel like it.

1137
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:10,927
I'm thinking of staying here in this house.

1138
01:18:12,282 --> 01:18:13,074
What?

1139
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,788
but the rent is so high.

1140
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:22,771
and moving is a pain in the butt.

1141
01:18:25,978 --> 01:18:27,458
It's up to you.

1142
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:38,903
moving into my room.

1143
01:18:41,652 --> 01:18:44,043
I don't want to live with anyone but you.

1144
01:18:47,585 --> 01:18:48,585
What?

1145
01:18:56,644 --> 01:18:58,036
Earlier today

1146
01:18:58,736 --> 01:19:03,028
in my warm and gentle photos.

1147
01:19:03,685 --> 01:19:05,102
It's the other way around.

1148
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:10,707
is warm and gentle.

1149
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:15,521
That's why I wanted to capture it.

1150
01:19:17,915 --> 01:19:20,716
I love the atmosphere between us.

1151
01:19:30,387 --> 01:19:33,903
I didn't mean it to sound like a pitch...

1152
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:37,802
Um...

1153
01:19:39,837 --> 01:19:41,671
How should I put it?

1154
01:20:15,551 --> 01:20:21,593
move back into this house.

1155
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:28,200
I don't want us to be apart.

1156
01:20:34,837 --> 01:20:36,247
Haru...

1157
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:46,794
I feel the same way.

1158
01:20:51,687 --> 01:20:53,450
Like those photos...

1159
01:20:57,913 --> 01:20:59,474
I want to be with you.

1160
01:21:00,058 --> 01:21:01,380
Then...

1161
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:03,888
But I can't...

1162
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:12,535
because I'm in love with you.

1163
01:21:15,616 --> 01:21:18,356
You wouldn't want to live with me

1164
01:21:20,582 --> 01:21:22,021
when I feel this way.

1165
01:21:35,764 --> 01:21:38,685
In... love...

1166
01:21:49,856 --> 01:21:51,794
Yeah...

1167
01:21:56,658 --> 01:21:58,903
It totally makes sense.

1168
01:22:01,868 --> 01:22:05,356
Okay. I get it.

1169
01:22:06,326 --> 01:22:09,106
Sorry. I was clueless.

1170
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:12,614
Knowing that, I'll wait for you.

1171
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:17,364
So it's okay...

1172
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:22,138
that I'm in love with you?

1173
01:22:22,749 --> 01:22:23,880
Yeah.

1174
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:32,724
to be in love with you.

1175
01:22:34,548 --> 01:22:38,771
You can fall in love with anyone you want.

1176
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:50,934
Seriously?! Haru!

1177
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:53,875
- I'm so surprised.

1178
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,517
- I am not.

1179
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:59,863
- Haru!

1180
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:02,866
- You can't.

1181
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:05,826
- Come on. Get up.

1182
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:07,971
- Say what?

1183
01:23:07,996 --> 01:23:09,708
Let's eat.

1184
01:23:12,352 --> 01:23:14,419
Hurry up and eat.

1185
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:23,912
Yum!

1186
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:27,849
I love your sweet Napolitan spaghetti.

1187
01:23:27,874 --> 01:23:33,208
and put in extra just for you.

1188
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:39,551
You look goofy.

1189
01:23:39,576 --> 01:23:41,896
I can't help it.

1190
01:23:42,544 --> 01:23:45,601
I'm so happy about what you said.

1191
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,412
I forgot what I said.

1192
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:49,600
You did not.

1193
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,458
- Liar.

1194
01:23:51,501 --> 01:23:52,917
I'll eat too.

1195
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,287
Here I go.

1196
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:04,107
Yum.

1197
01:24:05,142 --> 01:24:06,123
Haru.

1198
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,998
and celebrate our new beginning.

1199
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:12,442
Good idea.

1200
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:14,966
Yay! It's decided.

1201
01:24:16,276 --> 01:24:18,787
- Hello.

1202
01:24:20,183 --> 01:24:21,993
- Your recommendation?

1203
01:24:22,018 --> 01:24:24,575
Let's see... Cafe mocha?

1204
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,659
Cafe mocha?

1205
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:28,004
- Why?

1206
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,701
- Yeah?

1207
01:24:29,726 --> 01:24:32,200
- You do.

1208
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:34,742
We're twins. You noticed?

1209
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:37,138
So many types of coffee beans.

1210
01:24:37,642 --> 01:24:39,475
There were so many.

1211
01:24:39,684 --> 01:24:41,450
Here you go.

1212
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:43,644
- Yeah.

1213
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:45,224
- Hold on.

1214
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,540
- Okay.

1215
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:50,142
Here.

1216
01:24:53,809 --> 01:24:55,685
- Yeah?

1217
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:58,013
- Certainly.

1218
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:03,341
- Isn't it?

1219
01:25:03,366 --> 01:25:05,200
Come. So cute.

1220
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,982
- Hello.

1221
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:14,435
You're adorable.

1222
01:25:15,142 --> 01:25:16,642
Let's eat.

1223
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:20,451
- A huge bite.

1224
01:25:21,434 --> 01:25:23,365
My jaw...

1225
01:25:26,415 --> 01:25:27,857
Yum!

1226
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,474
- Thanks.

1227
01:25:32,976 --> 01:25:34,599
Yum.

1228
01:25:37,142 --> 01:25:39,138
Just veggies and bun.

1229
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:43,310
You're just eating the veggies and bun.

1230
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:47,115
This is how it should be.

1231
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:52,990
Yum.

1232
01:26:18,354 --> 01:26:20,904
I'm moving away soon.

1233
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:31,974
I'll be lonely without you but...

1234
01:26:38,077 --> 01:26:40,529
Knowing that you'll come back

1235
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:44,334
makes the loneliness more tolerable.

1236
01:27:05,438 --> 01:27:06,855
Yeah.

1237
01:27:09,902 --> 01:27:11,685
Let's hang in there.

1238
01:27:28,127 --> 01:27:29,418
Aki.

1239
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,498
I love you.

1240
01:27:47,298 --> 01:27:50,693
I wanted to tell you when I could.

1241
01:27:57,207 --> 01:27:58,263
Me too.

1242
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:03,990
I love you too.

1243
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,115
Let's go home.

1244
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:48,949
Yeah.

1245
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:47,029
Ready?

1246
01:29:50,513 --> 01:29:51,548
Cool.

1247
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:53,364
You look great.

1248
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:56,223
- Wow.

1249
01:29:56,677 --> 01:30:00,258
is on the same day.

1250
01:30:00,283 --> 01:30:01,492
It's a coincidence.

1251
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:05,160
after mine is finished?

1252
01:30:05,185 --> 01:30:06,559
Of course.

1253
01:30:06,584 --> 01:30:09,441
That tie is much better.

1254
01:30:09,466 --> 01:30:12,643
Really? Thanks. You said it'd suit me.

1255
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:16,834
You guys look great! So handsome!

1256
01:30:18,485 --> 01:30:19,985
Thank you.

1257
01:30:21,787 --> 01:30:23,841
Let's take a photo together.

1258
01:30:24,256 --> 01:30:25,548
I'd love to.

1259
01:30:25,573 --> 01:30:26,660
Let's.

1260
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:27,426
Right here.

1261
01:30:27,451 --> 01:30:28,716
Okay.

1262
01:30:29,444 --> 01:30:31,059
Let's do it.

1263
01:30:31,975 --> 01:30:33,599
Say cheese.

1264
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:42,242
You look so charming like a dress-up doll.

1265
01:30:42,594 --> 01:30:45,345
How handsome you are.

1266
01:30:45,559 --> 01:30:46,934
Ready?

1267
01:30:49,075 --> 01:30:51,117
Don't leave me out.

1268
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:52,767
- I'm here now.

1269
01:30:52,892 --> 01:30:56,091
Ready? Say cheese.

1270
01:30:57,809 --> 01:30:59,350
Okay.

1271
01:31:00,559 --> 01:31:03,142
Now just you two.

1272
01:31:04,757 --> 01:31:07,840
Ready? Say cheese.

1273
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,749
(May - Osaka)

1274
01:31:16,774 --> 01:31:18,607
Let me know if you need anything.

1275
01:31:20,837 --> 01:31:21,962
Hello!

1276
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:26,759
(Tokyo)

1277
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:29,227
Next. Another pose...

1278
01:31:29,414 --> 01:31:32,823
You're making her tense too.

1279
01:31:32,848 --> 01:31:34,265
What do you do?

1280
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:35,142
A smile...

1281
01:31:35,309 --> 01:31:38,142
- Sorry.

1282
01:31:38,309 --> 01:31:39,809
Looking for something?

1283
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,537
I want to renovate my room.

1284
01:31:42,738 --> 01:31:45,858
Okay. How about these tiles?

1285
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:48,032
Pretend you're the demon king.

1286
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,540
Good.

1287
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:51,767
Good.

1288
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:53,696
Wait... Okay.

1289
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:57,005
Hi, Haru.

1290
01:31:57,161 --> 01:32:00,369
Aki... Where are you?

1291
01:32:00,394 --> 01:32:01,727
I'm...

1292
01:32:02,746 --> 01:32:05,079
right here!

1293
01:32:07,644 --> 01:32:09,305
I'll be back next week.

1294
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:13,572
I'll be waiting with Chief Penguin.

1295
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:30,149
I'm home!

1296
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,801
Haru!

1297
01:33:35,826 --> 01:33:36,703
Stop.

1298
01:33:42,975 --> 01:33:44,642
Aki!

1299
01:33:46,876 --> 01:33:48,751
Haru!

1300
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:56,527
Welcome home.

1301
01:33:57,881 --> 01:33:59,048
Good to be back.

1302
01:36:21,771 --> 01:36:33,355
(Directed by Koji Kawano)

1303
01:36:35,969 --> 01:36:38,678
Our usual salt-flavored tomato ramen.

1304
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:43,274
Let's eat.

1305
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:01,527
Yum!

1306
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:05,907
So good.
