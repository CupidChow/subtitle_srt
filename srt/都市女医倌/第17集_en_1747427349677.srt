Episode 16

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,400
Dr. Gu,

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,240
this child has been waiting for treatment.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,240
Please wait.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
If Mo Deng Hospital

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,080
has economic needs,

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,160
my boss can help.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,600
Thank you.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Tell me,

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,680
why don't you want to treat the patient?

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,760
You're in the same group as them.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,000
Why do you ask me?

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
You mean,

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
your mother?

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,400
She doesn't deserve to be my mother.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't have a mother or a father.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
I only have a master.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,160
Now I even forget a lot of people I know.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
Do you think I'm more talented?

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,720
I have two fathers,

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,400
two mothers,

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
and a lot of brothers and sisters.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,120
They all want me to live.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,000
Look,

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,000
so many people care about you.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
Why do you still make them worry?

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
They want me to live

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,680
just to keep the money

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,160
my grandfather left me.

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
If I died before I was 18,

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,320
the money would be donated to the rescue fund.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
So, Dr. Gu,

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
they don't really love me.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
How could this happen?

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,440
Do I know him?

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,600
Why did you hide it from him?

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
Because you didn't take good care of him.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,800
You don't deserve it.

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,480
I'm taking him away.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,840
He won't go with you.

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,400
Do we know each other?

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
How can we know each other?

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
Then, is there anything between us...

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
Xiaofeng.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,120
Why did you hide it from him?

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Renyi,

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,280
Gu Xiaomei is mine.

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Brother,

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,440
are you sure you saw that person?

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
You can tell me first.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,440
How many Gu Xiaofengs did you draw?

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
I swear,

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,440
I only drew the one in the doctor's office.

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
I didn't do anything.

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
I just drew the one in the doctor's office.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,880
I drew one Gu Xiaofeng in the book

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of Life with You.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
There's no second one.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,000
Then why did you draw only one?

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,880
But he doesn't recognize me?

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
I don't know either.

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
Don't ask me.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I never thought that the character

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
could come out of the book.

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Brother,

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,400
there must be a reason why Gu Xiaofeng doesn't recognize you.

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,080
Gu Xiaofeng.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
He's a comic book artist.

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
Why does my heart ache?

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
Gu Xiaofeng.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
I'll give you an apple.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,920
Will it be better?

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
You know me?

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm the one who killed him.

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

81
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

82
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
Gu Xiaofeng.

86
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,100
After Ms Gu and Renyi

87
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,440
saved my grandma,

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
they often come here to visit us.

89
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,000
On diet,

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,320
the brain telomeres weak.

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
lovely not to see.

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:22,220
The

93
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,100
33

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,060
meaningful

95
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:42,160
wake

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,140
up

97
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,540
Now, your life is our life.

98
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,140
You agree, he can live.

99
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,940
You don't agree, he only disappears.

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
I warn you to stay away from Gu Xiaomeng.

101
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,340
Don't forget, Gu Xiaomeng is not a human in this world.

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
The Wujigian Pellet.

103
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,340
Then you should see if what I said is the Wujigian Pellet.

104
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,940
Only I know how to control Gu Xiaomeng's life.

105
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,340
Gu Xiaomeng, how can I protect you?

106
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,940
Did I really know how to use the Wujigian Pellet?

107
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,340
I will kill you.

108
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,940
Our boss said he would give you three days.

109
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't blame me for being cruel.

110
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,540
Go.

111
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,340
You...

112
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,540
If you want money, don't touch him.
