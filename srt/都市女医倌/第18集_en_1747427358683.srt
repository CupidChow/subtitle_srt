00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,380
ba

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,860
and

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,860
and

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,380
and

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:28,180
and

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,240
random

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,680
milk

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,280
Don't touch him

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,980
Want to be a hero

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,360
Come back and see what you need

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,760
Didn't expect

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,400
Why are you selling the Beaaf Mm nails?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
The bank is in a hurry

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,320
I borrowed money from someone

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,480
I can't go on

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Mo Deng Hospital was left by Grandpa Mo

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
You can't give up like this

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
What can I do?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,200
Xidong Sword has long been a life-saving way to cure the dead horse

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,000
Who would believe in my ability?

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,560
All things have a heart, grass and wood have a pit

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,600
It's been thousands of years

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
It can restore its original form

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,160
How long will it take?

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,160
The important thing is

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,200
This thing

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,960
It's not worth the money

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,360
Gu Xiaomei

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
Stay with me and guard Mo Deng Hospital

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
I can't

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,320
There are many reasons for amnesia

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,680
You'd better take him to check

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,320
OK

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,080
Hurry

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
Xiaomiao, who are you?

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
Go up

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,160
Go

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
Xiaofeng

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Xiaomiao, let me go

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,840
Xiaofeng

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,640
Lu Xiaofeng

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,440
Xiaofeng

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Xiaofeng

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
I won't let you get hurt again

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,200
Needles

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Take the needles away

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Needles

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,200
Hurry

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,080
Take the needles away

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Hurry

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
Dr. Gu

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,480
As long as you can cure Qian Chunmei's disease

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,760
The little sesame money she owes

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
Our boss doesn't want it

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
It's a two-way thing

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
Why is it so complicated?

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm sorry, Gu Xiaomei

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,080
I just want you to stay in Mo Deng Hospital

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,840
I didn't expect them to do this

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,120
Please, save Mo Deng Hospital

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,360
Save Mo Deng Hospital

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
OK?

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Since Dr. Gu has already known the reason

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
I won't hide it

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,960
As long as Dr. Gu

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
is focused on treating my daughter

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
and ensure that she lives to 18 years old

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,280
Everything else can be discussed

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I can't save her

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Didn't you say she would save people?

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
There must be a reason

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,280
Otherwise

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
She wouldn't leave the hospital

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,200
The reason is

76
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,680
You don't have a little status in her heart

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,880
I can convince her

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Give me some more time

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,880
Brother Qiang

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,400
Why did our boss take a big detour?

81
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,640
Too much knowledge

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,240
is no good for you

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,000
What does he want?

84
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,760
If Mo Deng Hospital has economic needs

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
My boss can agree

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Thank you

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Dr. Gu

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,920
I hope, you can figure it out as soon as possible

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,220
You will upgrade herons

90
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Chunmei, you can't wait any longer.

91
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,420
I'm not lying to you. I really can't show the patient to the doctor.

92
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,220
If you want to save your daughter, don't waste your time on me.

93
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,220
I only believe Dr. Gu.

94
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,220
You...

95
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,620
Dr. Gu, have a good rest.

96
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,220
Every 30 minutes, someone will come to ask Dr. Gu's decision.

97
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,220
What should I do?

98
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
How did it happen again?

99
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,220
This is exactly the same.

100
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Luckily, I have a hobby.

101
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Dr. Ren.

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
He...

103
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Soon, I will be the only one around you.

104
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
You agreed to let him live.

105
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,220
You didn't agree. He only has a little bit of time.

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,220
I'm warning you to stay away from Gu Xiaoming.

107
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
This Mu Haoqian...

108
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,220
He's so affectionate.

109
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
He's quite slow.

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,220
How did you decide to save your daughter?

111
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
I can't.

112
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
Then you have to think about...

113
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
I told you I can't!

114
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
You can't? You're done for.
