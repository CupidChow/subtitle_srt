Episode 15

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
Did you not expect that

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,680
you have been a person that you can't tolerate

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,000
and in the end

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,680
you saved my daughter?

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,920
I have done my best.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,760
You take care of her.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,360
You are so scary.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,280
It's over.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,720
In less than a month,

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,920
Mo Ge will wake up.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,720
You are so amazing.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,240
You have to wait for a month?

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
I didn't do anything.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,600
I didn't do anything.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,600
Then who did it?

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
Did you give the manuscript to someone else?

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,920
I didn't.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Can't you just let me stay here?

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,240
Actually, I am also confused now.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Every time I didn't draw Sister Gu back,

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,240
she has already come back.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,760
So I am worried

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,920
if I don't follow the plot you set,

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,800
anything could happen.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Then I want to ask

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,600
where did you go back the first couple of times?

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
I just asked.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
I just asked.

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,120
Mo Ge,

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
the Mo Deng Yiguan has been bought back.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
In the future,

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
whether I am here or not,

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,440
I hope you can protect it.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Only if you have enough trust in Zhong Yi

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
can you feel

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
how strong his power is.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, I am leaving.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,520
Sorry.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,120
I really don't have the face to see you.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Tell me, when did you wake up?

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,640
Just now.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,920
Where is he?

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,640
Ren Yi,

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
why don't we just leave him alone?

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Open your eyes.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,640
Is it fun?

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,120
Gao Xin,

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
I...

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
Mo Ge Ge,

54
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't want to hear you say thank you.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
I...

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
Say it.

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,720
I...

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
I want to go to the toilet.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
Mo Ge is awake.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Wang Yiqiang has been arrested.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,800
I am relieved.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Ren Yi,

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
thank you for buying Mo Yiye's hospital back.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
It's just that Wang Yiqiang bit the nail.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He did it.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Xiao Feng,

67
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
I am sorry.

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
It's okay.

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
It's not your fault.

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,800
The criminal will be punished sooner or later.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
Have you seen the fox's effect?

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Gu Xiao Feng

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,480
is the fox in the medical field.

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,000
It's just that

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,440
I am afraid that you will disappear again.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,560
My existence or not

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,240
has nothing to do with the comics.

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,840
It is not dangerous to me.

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,000
Because Gu Xiao Feng

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,320
didn't come out of the trap.

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,180
An

82
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,700
An

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:13,780
An

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,760
Since I existed in real life,

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,000
maybe

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
it's because something wasn't resolved.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
So I will go back and forth.

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,360
The year of the God, the God of the Nine Seas, Gu Xiaofeng,

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,800
went to Haicheng to save Wen.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Gu Xiaofeng found something strange, but was attacked and killed.

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't agree.

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
I will be fine.

93
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
What are you doing?

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
This is just your guess.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Besides, how do you solve such a big plague?

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Actually, that plague is not hard to solve.

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
It's just that someone deliberately did it and it keeps spreading.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
As long as you catch the black hand behind the scenes,

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
this plague will be controlled very quickly.

100
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,600
If that's the case, I can't let you take the risk.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I can protect myself.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
If you don't save them, they will die.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
That's different.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Ren Yan, I am a doctor.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,000
You made me watch so many people die. I can't do it.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Xiaofeng, you made me watch you take the risk.

107
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
How can I do it?

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Cheers!

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This time, I came to say goodbye to everyone.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Gu Xiaomei,

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
you went to fight them alone.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
How can you come back safely?

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you remember the question that Gao Xi asked me before?

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Then I want to ask you,

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
where did you go back twice before?

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Twice.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
I went back to the bottom of Haicheng Lake.

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I went back to the bottom of Haicheng Lake.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Instead of the time that Gao Xi set up in Pangu.

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,400
And I also discovered a common point.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ren Yan, I came back because of your call.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not a story at all.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
So,

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,200
I believe that as long as we have the same heart,

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,400
I can definitely come back.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I just came back from a long trip.

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Ren Yan, make everyone happy.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Marry me.

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I love you.

130
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Ren Yan, wait for me.

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I love you.

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I love you.
