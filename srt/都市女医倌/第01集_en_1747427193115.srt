What's going on?

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Miao Zuxi!

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Come back with me!

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Come back with me!

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Miao Zuxi!

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're welcome.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What a handsome young man.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But is this a dream?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Young Master!

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Isn't this a dream?

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's him.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was a mistake. I won't...

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you doing?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're so rude.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You want to be my wife?

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm saving you.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're lying.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Where is this place?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You brought me here to make a bet.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's strange.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you thinking about?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hello?

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Doctor Ren, you're going to be late for work.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll be right there.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Since someone deliberately created a danger,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that seal is a key element.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not good to be in the way of the ancient.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'd better make a bet with him first.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll find out the mastermind behind the scenes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Young Master, you can't go.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have to take me with you.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Young Master, we just had a wife and a husband.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't want to be responsible, so you're leaving?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can look for me.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm looking for you now.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let go. Let go.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I won't let go.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Stop. Don't move.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dad. Dad.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Remember me, dad.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Dad. Dad.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Dad, you're awake.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Dad.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have to help me, dad.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dad.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Dad. Dad.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's strange. What is this?

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you sure I'll take you?

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Doctor Ren, the operation is about to begin.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's too late.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is Ren Yi alive?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Doctor Ren went to pick up his sister.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She hasn't come back yet.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Young Master, why are you stopping me?

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Young Master, I'm scared.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you're scared, close your eyes.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The patient's liver is bleeding.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The pupils are starting to spread.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Remove the blood vessels.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Reduce the blood pressure in the blood vessels.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm so dizzy.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As a medical officer in the emergency department,

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you left the hospital and violated the rules.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you know what the consequences are?

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I know.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Forget it. Take care of your sister.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
With her condition, you can't run away.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I know.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I know.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I know.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't run away.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you, Master.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
By the way, how is the patient today?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His head was hit hard.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He suffered severe brain damage.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Whether he can wake up depends on himself.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's wrong with him?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Master, I'm taking him away.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come with me.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Young Master.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hold me.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't talk.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
To be honest,

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
your master is a lot worse than my master.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm telling the truth.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've treated patients with low blood pressure.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Since they all suffered head injuries,

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can try it.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Try it?

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You dare to use the word try to save lives?

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you don't have a medical license,

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you can't get close to the patient even if you're a model.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Listen to me.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Young Master, where are we?

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Haicheng.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Haicheng?

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've never seen it before.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Young Master, what are we going to eat?

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Can we go to your house after eating?

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can I stay at your house for a few days?

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't need a servant.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm driving.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I need to concentrate.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Listen to me.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to the hospital.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll be back in a few days.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The house here is so tall.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Can't it fall?
