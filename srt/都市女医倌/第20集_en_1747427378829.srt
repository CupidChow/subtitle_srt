00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
NnnnnNNNN~~~

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here, for you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can you really cure it with wine?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But Qian Chun Mei is still waiting for you to protect her.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I believe you.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm here.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ren Ye, come here.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't believe me?

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Ren Ye, I remember everything.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But I have a shadow.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The End

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Impossible.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Because the doctor had your interview,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and I couldn't turn the situation around.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I drew an outline for Gu.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's impossible for this to happen.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's the outline?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That...

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just drew the beginning.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You came back before you drew the end.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So now it's going to disappear.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Unless...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Gu Hao Qian, what are you doing?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Shouldn't I be asking you this?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you had cooperated with me before,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I wouldn't have had to do this.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's not a real person.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why do you have to...

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't pretend.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What did you do to him?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't...

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
do it.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Gao Qi.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Gao Qi!

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I could save him,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I wouldn't give up on any patient.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You didn't have to do that before.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What happened before was my fault.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
As long as my daughter lives to be 18,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't care what you do.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's good that you saved me.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it's not because of this.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It doesn't matter.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Since you've promised,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can also promise you the rest.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Xiao Feng.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Xiao Feng!

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ren Yi.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Xiao Feng!

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Xiao Feng!

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where did she go?

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
According to previous speculations,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
if the comic book that Xie Hu wrote

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is the one that's going to disappear,

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
my sister might never come back.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I checked the hospital's surveillance cameras.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The only suspect is Gao Xi.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mu Haoqian.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You always drag me down.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you know how to face the West?

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Get me the script.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've sent the script to print.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then do it again.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Dr. Ren.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Gao Xi, where did you take the script?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Didn't you say that Gu Xiao Feng has disappeared?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it's useless to bring the script back?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You...

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How do you know if you don't try?

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't want to try.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Gao Xi.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I sent it to Pangu.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So it's impossible to come back.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You continue to create according to your original plan.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If the publisher knows that Gao Xi took your original script,

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
it's also impossible to find out.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What can I do for Gu Xiao Mei?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Watch Gao Xi before Miao Zi finishes her creation.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll go.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Brother.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Xiao Feng, you must come back.
