Episode 16

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Qian Chun Mei has a mother like you.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
She's really a sadist.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The patient's rescue time is running out.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we don't proceed together,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the chance of success will be higher.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I can use acupuncture to stop the patient's injury.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It can also save more time.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Chun Mei has finally escaped danger.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank goodness you came in time.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's me and you.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Zhong Yi and Xiyi.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The most perfect combination.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, it's me and you.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Mu Haoqian!

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mu Haoqian!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please don't do anything!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't scare me!

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't scare me!

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry!

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's go.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Master Jiang, how is he?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
His head was hit.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
His brain is seriously damaged.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can he wake up?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's still unknown.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What happened?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where did you kidnap Gu Xiao Mei?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We didn't kidnap her.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I saw her in your car today.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We invited Dr. Gu to see the patient.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's none of your business.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You said you didn't kidnap her.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Kid, I think you're here to do something.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today, you're the one who's going to pay for it.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're the one who's going to pay for it.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Gu Xiao Feng, you're a bad person!

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If anything happens to Brother Mo,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I won't let you off!

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Brother Mo is hurt by you!

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You still have the nerve to pretend to be pitiful!

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Leave right now!

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm not leaving.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a hospital.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Enough!

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's go save her together.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Any hospital won't allow you to treat patients without permission.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Getting out of the hospital is the only option.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What if I can't cure her?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I trust you.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Brother Mo,

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can definitely save you.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sure you can.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sure you can.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can definitely save you.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Look!

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You!

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is your badge.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't have to speak for Brother Mo.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you believe I'll write you to death again?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Believe it or not,

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll make you shut up forever.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're breaking the law!

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So what? I'm not one of you.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll just go back to the world of comics.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You... you can really save Brother Mo?

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you for saving Brother Mo.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not your turn to say thank you.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Then, what can I do for Brother Mo?

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Actually,

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you're not bad.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you can't catch up, give up.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then why don't you give up?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I... I still have a little hope.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then I still think I have a chance.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
While I'm still alive,

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll go save Brother Mo.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
While I'm still seeing you as my target,

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
wake up quickly.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't be like that person.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're not a good person.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You regret it?

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Or am I too hard on you?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you're the one who's hard on you,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it should be me.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's one more thing I don't understand.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Master clearly knows that

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Qian Chun Mei's surgery success rate is very low.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why does she still insist on trying?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Didn't you say it was for a device?

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If it was before,

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Master would never have used a patient

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to trade because of a device.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Of course, Master Jiang didn't want to trade.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He probably just wanted to make up for it.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Master Jiang and Qian Chun Mei's parents

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
knew each other a long time ago.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's strange.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No matter what happened to her husband,

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Zhou Hong refused to let her daughter

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
come to the hospital for a checkup.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Instead, she agreed to let you come.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Because of this,

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the couple fought fiercely.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So Master Jiang

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
spoke for you.
