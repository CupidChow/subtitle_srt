1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
million appear on balance sheet.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Shen Yi.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Yes?

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's make a promise.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Say it.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
You can't go back on your word.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I won't.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
The first promise is

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to have a short separation with you.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And feel the scent of the same thing.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't mean to do that.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is this our promise?

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
To give a surprise to the one you love.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If it's forever, it's not worth it.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's just that we're always together.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Shen Yi.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why do you like me?

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Because you're the light of my life.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When time is gone, you and I will always be there.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Those memories also begin to be scattered.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The stars are looking at you.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you remember?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I hope you'll be happy too.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But how can I be sure?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's just that lovers...

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Will eventually lose.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Will you remember me?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shen Yi, will you marry me?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I also want to be with you.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As long as you think of me.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Promise me.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You must live well.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I won't live well.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Xiao Feng.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, Xiao Feng.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Xiao Feng.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
President Jiao.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm the one who's always thinking about him.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The one who's always looking at us.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's just that we're always apart.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm the one who's always able to be stopped.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's eat seafood.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't know I'm allergic to seafood?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But I don't know which kind of seafood you're allergic to.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Here.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Xiao Feng.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yizi.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come back.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're a little close.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But I've been in love for a long time.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is the friendship.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Loyalty and love.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You have me.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No matter what happens.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's face it together.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay?

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wu Xiao Feng.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Marry me, okay?

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yizi.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't die.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wu Xiao Feng.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Believe me.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll be by your side.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll be by your side.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll be by your side.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come closer.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Master.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm back.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sister Gu.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll find a way to save you.
