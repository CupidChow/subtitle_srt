MUSIC

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I didn't do it. He was already a drunkard.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who told you to touch my stuff?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're really not right. You did it.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Give it back to me.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You want to destroy the evidence?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No matter how good you are, you can't change the fact that you hurt people.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A man dares to do it.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you still want to deny your crime?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Gu Xiaofeng, I think you're a patient. I don't care about you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But don't touch my bottom.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Bottom? It's revealing your real face, right?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Give me the letter. Give it to me.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let go. Give it to me.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gu Xiaofeng!

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Gu Xiaofeng

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn't it him?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or not that letter?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's him.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not him.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's him.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not him.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's him.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll take you home.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Here, I prepared this for you.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it him or not?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Gu Xiaofeng.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You forgot to bring your stuff.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you mean?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do I have to take off my clothes to return it to you?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You should return it to me.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not only this.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Xiaomei gave me the clothes.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What does it have to do with you?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Return my stuff to me.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll pay you back.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll return it to you.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Didn't he take the pendant?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Didn't he take the pendant?

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Forget it.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't come back for me.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm leaving.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's weird.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's all over.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There should be a few more.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I really didn't mean to.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Since Second Aunt left,

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
this place has been her heart.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Maybe it's not a bad thing for you to do this.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But that letter was broken.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't see the content in the letter.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Second Aunt only left this letter to her before she went to the warm room.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So my brother tore it up when he was angry.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So he tore it up himself.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But that was the last thing Second Aunt left for him.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's why he kept it.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh no.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He won't forgive me.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe I can make up for it.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll call my brother right now.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hello, brother.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you free tonight?

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go with Sister Gu.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
See you later.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well...

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe I should give her some time.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Since Ren Yi is not a bad person,

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I should talk to her.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I should think of a way to go back.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ren Yi, it's me.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you okay?

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm a doctor.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't be afraid.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The acupuncture can ease your body...

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, thank you.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Trust me.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm serious.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't dare to joke with a child.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If a broken needle can solve the problem,

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
why do we need a hospital?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Acupuncture is safe and has no side effects.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Otherwise, how can it spread?

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, thank you.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't waste time with her.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Call the ambulance.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll go with you.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't waste time with her.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Call the ambulance.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I'll go with you.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Trust me.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If they don't trust me, I'll give up.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That means I don't trust my medical skills.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If I don't trust myself,

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
what about Yuta and the old man?

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you feeling better?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm feeling much better.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's okay.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your acupuncture is quite good.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Come to our clinic.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Grandpa, I'll introduce you to a doctor.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Come to our clinic.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Grandpa, don't you think he's young?

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's really good.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm better than you when I call a doctor.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't have such a life-threatening attack.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not better than you

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
without a criminal record.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't dare to stay.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Help the benefactor.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I saved you?

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you recognize the wrong person?

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How is that possible?

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If the benefactor didn't save me in time,

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I would have been dead by now.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now you're right.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Renyi, it's me.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to talk to you.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's be honest and not lie to each other.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay?

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Where are you?

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll wait for you at home.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.
