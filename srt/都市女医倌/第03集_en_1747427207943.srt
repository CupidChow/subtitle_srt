Episode 15

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I said I didn't mean to.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Will you believe me?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Come here.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll see how long you can endure this.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Change your clothes.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't catch a cold.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Dr. Ren, we didn't find the patient you're talking about.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Dr. Ren, can you give me a hand?

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, you can stay away from me.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're tired today.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll do something for you.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where did you hide the letter?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In my room.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The third drawer.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The second drawer.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The third drawer.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's locked.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Could it be the key?

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Young Master.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Young Master.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's on your body.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Get out.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who's looking at me?

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't believe you.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't be hungry.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have nowhere to go except for you.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Liar.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who are you?

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother Luo is such a jerk.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't worry.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
From now on, you'll live here.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If anyone dares to let you go,

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll let him go.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This time, I'm still brave.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look at mine.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Miss, I'll take you to Happy.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know to come back?

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How many times have I told you

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to cooperate with the treatment?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I have a special system.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Even if I get a liver cancer,

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't stand the surgery.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I won't treat it.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can cure your disease.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're a doctor too?

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Of course.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't talk yet.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let me guess.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My colleague, right?

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You like my brother, right?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He brought me back.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Stop explaining.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The female doctor who likes my brother

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is not a doctor.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But you're the first one he brought back.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
By the way, what's your name?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gu Xiaofeng.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Gu Xiaofeng?

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The wind of the wind?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No wonder you're so close.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a destiny.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll accept your sister-in-law first.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What do you mean?

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're going after my brother.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll help you.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But...

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're not the type

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
my brother likes.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Not bad.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's really busy.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What do you think?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're so cute.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What does he want?

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have no idea.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I just want to know

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
what you want.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You'd better send her to the police station.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want to leave.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I haven't received the letter yet.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't sign it.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's really like what I imagined.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I really want to date her.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's random.
