1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
delayed hold

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,640
10

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,960
well

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,440
well

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,260
well

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You know what I mean?

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
I just see you as my senior.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've always called you Gu Xiaomei.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But I've never treated you as a sister.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's your own business.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When you were together, you were far away from me.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now that you've broken up,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you should consider me.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not your sister anymore.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your senior.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not your senior.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're my senior.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We should be together.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Mu Haoqian, let go of me.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know who's the best for me.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let go of me.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mu Haoqian, let go of me.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Gu Xiaomei, I won't let go of you this time.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mu Haoqian, if you don't let go of me,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll die for you.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My sister's illness has worsened.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Xiaomei, you must get better.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because I need your help.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Although it sounds ridiculous,

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it's the truth.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So we shouldn't give up, okay?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The situation is not optimistic.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You should let her have a good rest.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She can't run around.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How's she sleeping recently?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She's been sleeping well.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's been sleeping well.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She's been sleeping well.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She's been sleeping well.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She's been sleeping well.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She's been sleeping well.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How's she sleeping recently?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She's fine.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong?

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you feeling unwell?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Under their eyes,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I secretly treated Miao Zishi.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't be discovered.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Otherwise, I'll be the one who died.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why did you avoid me?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No fate.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't meet you.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You don't want to meet me?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We've broken up.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Even if you die,

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
it's none of my business.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You care about me.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I...

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I care about the world.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I care about you.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't have to say sorry.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Shen Ye,

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have one more thing to confess to you.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Whether you believe it or not,

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it's all true.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Tell me.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I believe you.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Actually, I...

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Xiao Feng.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Xiao Feng.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Xiao Feng.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wu Xiao Feng.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What's wrong with you?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Please wake up.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's been three days.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why haven't you woken up?

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Stop looking.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have no chance.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
As long as I don't have him,

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll have a chance.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why are you resting in the ward?

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm worried about Sister Wu.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Brother,

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you haven't slept for three days.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If Sister Wu sees you like this,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
she will be heartbroken.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I believe her more.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Dr. Ren,

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the director is calling you.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're recovering.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't stay too long.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Those memories are starting to choose

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The heart is silent

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You said you remembered me

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How can I stop

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You said

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't hear you.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I heard it all.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why did you fall in love?

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will remember you

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Remember me
