8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,480

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 2

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're done.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, you should rest at home.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll take care of the breakfast.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't touch these medicine.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You forgot one.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's safe.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you doing?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me see.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Cafe.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let me see.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm a doctor from the 21st century.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My name is Ren Yi.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I only save people, never harm people.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
21st century?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just check it online.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Master and others...

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You...

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I...

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong with me?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You said you're leaving.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When did I say that?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You mean you won't leave?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have a goal to cure Miao Zishu's disease.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let me help you.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ren Yi, believe me.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can cure Miao Zishu's disease.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
See?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a building.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There are many hospitals in the city.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't guarantee.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just one needle can cure the disease.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Many needles.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've learned a lot about your medical school.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Miao Zishu's disease is original liver cancer.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's hard to cure and easy to recur.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your medical school is very aggressive and extreme.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But we're loyal.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know you're good, but I can't hide.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Excuse me.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He looks young.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's awake.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's awake.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's awake.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's amazing.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's amazing.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, he can cure the disease in this hospital.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's amazing.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's amazing.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's awake.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, no.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's bleeding.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's bleeding.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He needs to be treated in the hospital.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let me go.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can cure him.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're the one who did it.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't do this to your son.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Calm down.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a doctor.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Calm down.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's okay.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's okay.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The most important thing is to do the surgery.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's okay.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's okay.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Calm down.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's not in the hospital.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How long has he been missing?

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He disappeared.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I turned off the phone.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Could it be that the phone is out of power?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We'll split up to look for him.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What if he goes back alone?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You go look for him.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll go home.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't hate me.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If I leave,

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I may never see you again.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What should I do?

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How can I find the way back to the sea?

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hello, Miss.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Did you see a girl with a small bag

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and a tall body?

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's wearing a yellow dress.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hello, Miss.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you see a girl with a small bag

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and a tall body?

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you see a girl with a small bag

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and a tall body?

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The three fake hospitals in the city

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
have been closed for hundreds of years.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
With a needle,

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you can cure cancer.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know you're good,

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but I can't hide.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who told you to touch my things?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Forget it.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't come back for me.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Gu Xiaofeng, maybe you should really leave.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Gu Xiaofeng, where are you?

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It must be there.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Xiaofeng, wait for me.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll go with you.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll go with you.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll go with you.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll go with you.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll go with you.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll go with you.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll go with you.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll go with you.
