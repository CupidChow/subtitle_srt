1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,980
09. Shinch

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How long?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Can't you just bring her back?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She's a character.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Every step must be reasonable.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can you promise

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
she'll follow your plot?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What do you mean?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I... I was just talking nonsense.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And...

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If she comes back, she'll lose her memory.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll see where you find her.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was just talking nonsense.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Kid,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
if you don't know what to do,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
do you think you can keep the clinic

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with your little tricks?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, right.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My boss is more sensitive than women.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Be careful.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your boss is not Zhou Yi.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He's a good friend of mine.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He's a good friend of mine.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Your boss is not Zhou Hong.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It doesn't matter who he is.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Go back and tell her

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
if she dares to hurt her little sister again,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll never forgive her.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just you?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're so arrogant.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How about

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I drink with you?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Grandma, are you feeling better?

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Much better. Much better.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This will completely heal your teeth.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just take some medicine.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you need anything, come to me.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to give this kid an operation this afternoon.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You should know the symptoms.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Qian Chunmei?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What else do you know about her?

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll go do the pre-review.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No need. I'll go myself.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If this operation is successful,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
her family will donate a batch of

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the latest medical equipment.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The hospital values this operation very much.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to go.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll be back soon.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Bye.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bye.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bye.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bye.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Bye.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bye.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Bye.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bye.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Bye.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Bye.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Bye.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Bye.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Shen Yi, I'm Gu Xiaofeng.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm back.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll let Wang Yuqiang take me to the hospital

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to treat Chunmei.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mu Haoqian, stop!

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How dare you do this?

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't have the guts to admit it?

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't cry.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't cry.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't cry.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We were drunk yesterday.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not drunk.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We are guests of Yi Qiu.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's good to be together.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Gu Xiaomei.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Brother Mu?

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's Gu Xiaomei.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's your Gu Xiaomei again.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Didn't you draw her back at this time?

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Didn't you draw her back at this time?

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This...

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master, she's a little too active

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and takes the initiative to take the X-ray.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Her right heart is not working well.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can't she do the transplant surgery?

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The situation has caused the left lung to be too thick.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If we don't take the risk,

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
once the organs are broken,

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it will be difficult to return to the sky.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's almost not working.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The patient's blood pressure is also stopping.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The blood pressure is reaching 28.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Master,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gu Xiaofeng is at the door.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Master.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Master.
