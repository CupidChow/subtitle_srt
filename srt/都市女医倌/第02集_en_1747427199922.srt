1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
threw

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,440
food

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,660
the

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,300
the

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
Deep Square

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,760
That place is really strange.

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,060
Such beautiful Confucius...

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,000
How could he be that heroic?

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,660
Gondimasu...

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,000
It's no surprise that you're Dao flat.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Drink this.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
I can drink this.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
This is useful.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,600
You want to hurt me?

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
It's bitter. I don't drink it.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,160
I prepared this for you.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
What kind of make-up do you want?

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Have you seen enough?

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Not enough.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Drink it.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Drink it.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Drink it.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
What poison is this?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
No matter what it is, it's not easy to harm me.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
Since I haven't been in the water for long,

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,320
the wind will be on her.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,600
I have to find a way to get close.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
You want to set me on fire?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This...

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Do people here eat this?

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,440
How can I eat it without eating and drinking fast?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is that?

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
You eat first.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm not hungry.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Eat.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
You dare not eat.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Sir, can you not look at her?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She's so shy.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why is that lady picking up a burger?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to eat too.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't eat burgers.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Others can eat it. I want to eat too.

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to eat light food. You can't eat spicy food.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to eat it. I want to eat the same as her. I want to eat it.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay. Wang Yiqiang, go buy it for her.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to eat it.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm a good cook.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to eat it in the restaurant.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wang Yiqiang, stop her.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Stop her!

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Call an ambulance.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's going on?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Take a look.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's wrong?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you okay?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Save her.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If something happens, you have to take responsibility.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If we don't do anything now, there will only be bigger problems.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's not remind ourselves of them.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why isn't she relaxing?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who's this?

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Her shadow is so bright.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why's she not relaxing?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chuen Bei!

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The little girl woke up.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Look at her, she's awake.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So amazing.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
She really has potential.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll put her in the dorm.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
You finally woke up.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
You scared me to death.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, you're so good.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I was just about to hit you.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
This little girl is not just blood-related.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
She's very sick.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
She's probably allergic to the wheat in the hamburger crust.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
It caused her to have a problem with her blood vessels and her memory loss.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
That's why she's like that.

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
She's just allergic. Don't worry.

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
The theory.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't follow me anymore.

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,200
I was just being judged by the results.

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Don't you know that you have to watch the cars?

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
I only have a young master in my eyes.

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
You can go home.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
I don't have a home.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Then... where's your master?

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
My master doesn't want me anymore.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Mr. Zhu Luo, I can't go anymore.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll take you to a place.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
You mean you don't know him? He's been following you?

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
He wants to get rid of me. It's not that easy.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Mr. Zhu Luo, you were so rude to him last night.

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Now you say you don't know him.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,600
That's so heartless.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm warning you. Don't touch my things again.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
The heart must be hidden in his house. I have to find it.

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Mister, is this okay?

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Mister, you're taking revenge on me.

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm disinfecting.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
I think you want to get rid of the mark.

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Mister.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Mister, is this yours?

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Is this yours?

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
Give it to me.

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Give it to me.

110
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Mister, you're being so mean.
