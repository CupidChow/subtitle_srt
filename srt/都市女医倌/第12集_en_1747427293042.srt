1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Good Luck!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
The dean agreed to let you go to the public exhibition this time.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Master, I...

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
can't go.

6
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
You should know that

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
you have a very long way to go.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
If I hadn't recommended you,

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
how could I have given you such a chance?

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I know.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
But this time,

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm afraid I'm going to let you down.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Because a woman

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
will affect your future.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
You have to do your best.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Going abroad in public?

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
It sounds more important than me.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Master,

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I've thought it through.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Ren Yi,

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I've always opposed you.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Not only did it affect your future,

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
but also your identity.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
It's a mystery.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't want you to delay your future for me.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
And...

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
maybe I should go back and have a look.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
You've thought of a way to go back?

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
No.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I just don't want to drag you down.

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Listen to me.

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I will choose you without hesitation.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
You don't need to feel burdened.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Because there's Miao Zishi here.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I can't let him go.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Let's go.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Here, your medicine.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Dr. Gu, you look like a person.

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Sister,

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
am I just a person?

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
That's not what I meant.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I mean...

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Great! I remember who you look like.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Wait a minute.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
It's him.

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm fake.

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
The person I know is fake.

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Everything around me is fake.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm not a fake.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm not a fake.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm not a fake.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm not a fake.

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm not a fake.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm not a fake.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm not a fake.

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm not a fake.

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm not a fake.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm not a fake.

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm not a fake.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm not a fake.

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm not a fake.

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm not a fake.

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm not?

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm not a fake.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
No way.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Xiao Feng,

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
are you ready?

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Let's eat.

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Xiaofeng, are you okay? Answer me!

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I've been against you.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Not only did it affect your future,

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
but also its identity.

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It's not clear where it came from.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
It's him!

76
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Wu Xiaofeng, if you keep pestering Ren Yisheng,

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
he will be destroyed by you!

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
You can't be too selfish!

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm not a gentleman.

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
How can I have a true lover?

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Xiaofeng, I'll teach you how to swim.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Let's break up.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Brother Meng, please help me.

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Okay.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Ren Yi, I'm telling the truth.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
We've broken up.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Did something happen?

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
It's a long story.

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Promise me.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
If I leave one day,

91
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
don't leave, okay?

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
This... this is impossible.

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
You must be testing me.

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I've fallen in love with someone else.

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
This is impossible.

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Gu Xiaomei, we should leave.

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Let's just break up.

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Help! Help!

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Is my medical skill really that good?

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Gu Xiaomei, save her!

101
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I can't do it.

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Dr. Gu, please save my daughter.

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Calm down. We'll save her.

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
You scared me to death.

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Why is it you again?

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

107
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I'll save her.

108
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I've saved her before.

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Why is it so different?

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Gu Xiaomei, let me take you to relax.

111
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I'll go with you.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll say it again.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
We've broken up.

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't agree.

115
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I don't want to see you.

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Don't worry. I'll take care of her for you.

117
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
The End
