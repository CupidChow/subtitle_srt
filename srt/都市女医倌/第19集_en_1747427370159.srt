Episode 16

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That was a special case.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can go and give it to Chunmei right away.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's too late.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
She has been taken to the hospital.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait!

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I have something to say.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you have to say?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That...

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Take her away!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Stop!

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go!

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Be careful!

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're back.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's good that you're back.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you for saving me.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I didn't protect you well.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I won't let you go again.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I seem...

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I seem to remember it.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wait for me at home.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll find my way home.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm always alone

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's just that I'm used to making choices

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shen Yi, let me do it.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to try a...

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
5, 9, 2, 1

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Those memories start to make choices

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I remember what you said

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How can I let go?

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Will you remember me in another time?

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
5, 9, 2, 1

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,280
But we forgot to make a choice

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,320
When time is no longer in the wind, there is always you and me

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,680
Those memories also start to choose

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,960
The heart is silent, you said it but I remember

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,560
Just how can I sing

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Xiaofeng, you're back.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Xiaofeng, you're finally back.

42
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,840
Brother, can you be more polite?

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
There's a kid here.

44
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,280
Tell me, how do you thank me for this month?

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I was just about to ask.

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
What's going on here?

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,960
Actually, I don't know either.

48
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,200
Xiaofeng, let's go.

49
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

50
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,280
Brother, what about me?

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,240
Kid, don't be so rude.

52
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,440
Let's go.

53
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,920
What are we going to eat today?

54
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,240
Today, I'll take you to eat the best crayfish in Haicheng.

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
How delicious is the best?

56
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
It's very delicious.

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
It's Gu Xiaofeng again.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,760
Damn it.

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
You're the one who's sick.

60
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,480
Xiaofeng.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
You're sick all over the house.

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Gu Xiaofeng.

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
You're sick all over the house.

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
You're the most important luggage doctor.

65
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
Listen to me.

66
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
He... he said I was sick.

67
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,280
Some doctors often say that others are sick.

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,200
How come you can't accept it when it's on your own?

69
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,160
It's so different.

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,600
Psychological trauma and physical trauma are both trauma.

71
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,160
Loss of memory is also a symptom.

72
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
I understand.

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,960
But...

74
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
You just don't want to admit it, right?

75
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,120
Do you believe me?

76
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
I believe you.

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
I also believe that I can remember it.

78
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
I've already remembered you.

79
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,680
Hello?

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,600
Dr. Ren.

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,160
Qian Chunmei is seriously ill.

82
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,120
Is it worse?

83
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,880
Okay.

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,040
I got it.

85
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,080
What's wrong?

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,280
Chunmei's disease is getting worse.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,360
It seems that the medical skills of the couple are not going to be delayed.
