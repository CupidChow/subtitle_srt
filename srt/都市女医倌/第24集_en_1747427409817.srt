1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Perfect, sharing is caring.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,880
Ribbon

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I remember what you said

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But how can I let go

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In a time, I will never let go

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are my greatest luck

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You must remember me

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The sea is like spring water, never to be washed away

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Whether I can come back

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
My love for you will not disappear

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I may be stopped

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If love can not be lost

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But if forever is not enough

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's just that we forgot to make a choice

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But time does not care about you and me

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Those memories also start to decide

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You said you remember me

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But how can I let go

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In another time, will you remember me

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Sea of Love

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shen Yi

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Master

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiaodie

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm back, Master

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Xiaodie, I'm back

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was so worried about you and Master

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Xiaofeng, you went to Haicheng to save Wen

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You accidentally fell into the water

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
General Qi Xuan and General Qi rescued you

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Qi Xuan?

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ren Yan, why are you here?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dr. Gu, I...

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It doesn't matter

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What matters is that it's not safe here

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You have to go back

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you for thinking for me

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am fine now

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's going on? You are hurt

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dr. Gu, is this not appropriate?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Dr. Gu, why are you so rude?

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dr. Gu, what are you doing?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You go inside and lie down

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are a doctor who saved my life

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But it doesn't mean that you can be like this

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have something important to do

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll go first

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's going on?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not Ren Yi

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm back

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm really back?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm dead?

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or I was poisoned?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Jiang Zhicheng

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
His name is Chai Cang

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You are a team?

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Chai Cang killed you

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I saved you

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's going on?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's that letter

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Accusation letter?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Chai Cang's daughter was infected with the plague

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She was killed by Hai Cheng after he was quarantined

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Chai Cang stole her back

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And spread the plague on purpose

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If this world is unfair to me

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why should I care about other people's lives?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
General Qi, you don't want to go back and report to the court?

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chai Cang is dead

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hai Cheng helped me to save Wen

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's more important than reporting to the court

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
General Qi

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Take care

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here, take care

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The dead are always the same

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But some people don't cherish them

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have a jade pendant just like you

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In the 21st century, you are called Dashan

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's different

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Otherwise, I would have made a choice

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I'm not afraid of death

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ren Ye

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When I'm not here

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You should smile more

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The moon always has you and me

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Those memories also start to choose

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This jade pendant

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
As a reward for you these days

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Xiaofeng

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When will you come back?

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In another time, will you remember me?

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This patient should pay special attention

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Director, a new intern doctor has been transferred

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The dean asked you to take him

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hello, director Ren

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm the new intern doctor

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Please take care of me

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We always make choices

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But time no longer stops

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There are always you and me

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Those memories also start to choose

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This jade pendant

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
As a reward for you these days

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank you
