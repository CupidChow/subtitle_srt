00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Corn boy

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Ren Yi?

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Sister, please save my grandma.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
But I don't have any money.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Brother, please save my grandma.

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
She's sick.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,600
What illness did your grandma have before?

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,800
The doctor said she had some kind of a stroke.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I can't remember.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,320
The neck is

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
the same as the patient's last blood test.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,200
It's safer to send her to the hospital.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,200
I don't have money to go to the hospital.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,600
Please save my grandma.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Believe me.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
There will be no accident this time.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
You're awake.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Grandma, you're finally awake.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Thank you for sending me back.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I...

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
You...

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
Why are you still so taciturn?

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,800
You don't invite me in?

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600
Recently, I bought a new oven in my house.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Try it.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Good morning.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Drink this.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
It's good for girls.

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Drink this.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Drink milk as a personal drink.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:20,340
Drink it as a

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
health checkup.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll go too.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
No need.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm going to work tonight.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm not going to look for you.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Grandpa Mo,

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm sorry for the medicine.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm sorry for the medicine.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry for the medicine.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm sorry for the medicine.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm sorry for the medicine.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Grandpa Mo, this medicine...

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Grandpa Mo, lie down.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I'll give you some wine.

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
No need.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm old and I'm old.

55
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
No, no, no.

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Grandpa Mo,

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
you can live a long life.

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm satisfied to live until this age.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Grandpa Mo.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Xiaofeng,

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
in this life,

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
whether you're poor or rich,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,200
there are different difficulties.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
We can't change our fate,

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
but we can't listen to the fate.

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
After all,

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
we live once.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't live seriously,

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
but live seriously.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Do whatever you want to do.

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Don't leave any regrets.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't leave any regrets.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Master,

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
why do we only see

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
three hours of patients a day?

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
You just have to follow the rules.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
But there are many patients outside.

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Xiaofeng,

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
you're just a doctor.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,400
You can't do anything.

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Sometimes,

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
you have to listen to the fate

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
to save your life.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Dimension

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
It's not like you like me. It's like you really like me.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Do you know what it is?

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Yes. I already have someone I like.

88
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Let go! What are you doing?

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Dr. Ren, you were so gentle just now.

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
He...

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Gu Xiao Feng!

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
You crazy!

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I helped you drive away the cockroaches today.

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You don't have to treat me to something good.

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Then, let's eat some bread that has been baked.

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Why did you come here today?

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
If I didn't come, how would I know that you are very gentle?

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I want to apologize to you.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Apologize to me?

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
You can treat whoever you want to be gentle. It's none of my business.

101
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I always thought you were sick.

102
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
This is your attitude to apologize?

103
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm serious.

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
At first, I thought you had a dream.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Dream? What dream?

106
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm in love with you.

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
You mean this is a dream?

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
So, I want to apologize to you.

109
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
This is all true.

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
You... you sleep again.

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm in love with you.

112
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
In love at first sight?

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Then, I'm getting angry day and night.

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
This is a relationship?

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
ï¿½ dish.
