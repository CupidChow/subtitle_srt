1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
pumped around.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 2

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Naughty.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Let's eat.

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
What do you want?

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
I want...

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
You want...

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
this?

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
No, no.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I want to sleep.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Drink it?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're annoying.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
I mean you woke me up.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Brother, come here.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
The press conference is about to start.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Okay.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Is this good?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Not yet.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Welcome to the wonderful cartoonist, Miao Zishi.

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
The Doctor Has You.

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
The new book press conference.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Great.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm the host of this press conference,

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Jia Mingming.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Now, let's welcome Miao Zishi

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
with a round of applause.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Thank you very much for taking your precious time

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
to attend my new book press conference.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
The Doctor Has You is my first book.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Thank you for your support.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll keep working hard.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Thank you.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Would you mind opening a book?

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Not now.

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Okay, thank you.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Is there a character in the book?

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
There are historical backgrounds.

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Okay, thank you.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Thank you.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Thank you.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Why are you here?

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Congratulations.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sister Lu!

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Sister Lu!

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Sister Lu!

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Are you okay?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you okay?

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The temperature is 36.5 degrees.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The breath is 20 degrees.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
The pulse is 88 degrees.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The blood pressure is 110 degrees.

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
The blood pressure is 75 degrees.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
The life is normal.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you for your help.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Thank you.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
This is for you.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Isn't this...

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Yes.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
This is the pendant we inherited from our family.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've been wearing it since I was a child.

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I hope I can bless you with a safe and sound life.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
When you were lying there today,

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I was really worried that something might happen to you.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm an old man of hundreds of years.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What could possibly happen?

68
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Naughty.

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I wonder if the king of the Sea City

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
has fallen asleep or is already dead.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Will Master be worried?

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Xiaofeng.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Gu Xiaofeng.

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
You're not in a good condition.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You should not go to the clinic.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
No.

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm happy only when I see a doctor saving people.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
But you're also a patient.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
I'm not like a patient.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You...

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
We are both doctors.

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
You should understand me.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Come to the hospital to see me after work.

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm going to see you again?

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
No way.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Someone is watching us.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Let him see the dog.

88
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Get lost!

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
From now on,

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll cut you into two pieces.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You don't know how to be a good man.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
You'll die a poor man's death

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
if you don't work hard.

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm just starving to death

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
and I don't harm patients.

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
The Chinese medicine industry has long been like this.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Why do you insist?

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to earn my conscience.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't want to harm patients

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,800
just to make money.

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Even the medicine factory is fake.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
It's because of you

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
who have no conscience

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
that the Chinese medicine industry is ruined.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not a good man.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Get lost!

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Get lost!

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Grandpa Mo!

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Grandpa Mo, are you okay?

110
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Feng,

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
take a look at this medicine.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
It's strange that

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
patients can get better after taking this medicine.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
It's not only inefficient,

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
but it also ruins the health of the body.

116
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
It used to be 3 or 5 times more effective.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now it's 10 times more effective.

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
It's not effective at all.

119
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
The medicine is only good once.

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
It's all about profit.

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Shouldn't we make money in this age?

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Grandpa,

123
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
why did you hit me?

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
I didn't sell this medicine.

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,800
You can sell your conscience

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
just to make money.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
For money,

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
can people really be like this?

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
People can be unworthy

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
in front of profit.

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
It's a pity.

132
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
People should forget their duty,

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
their kindness,

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
their roots,

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
their intentions,

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
but we should football.

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Naturally,

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
people don't take their time to do license.

139
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Unfortunately,

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Anything can change.

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
That's a pity.
