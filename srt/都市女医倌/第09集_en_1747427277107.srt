00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ärb трömmel

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You promised me you wouldn't leave.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You said you would help me cure Miao Zishi.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You...

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you still believe I can cure your sister?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I...

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't cure her.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I didn't find the murderer.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She was still trapped here.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I almost killed a person.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not Shen Yi.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm just a maid.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're the best.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please stay.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The one who died hundreds of years later,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the Seven Kingdoms tree became a Chinese medicine.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And there's a Chinese medicine.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All the things we didn't see,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the things we didn't see,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
they all saved people.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What's the point of me staying?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Without the Chinese medicine, the Western medicine,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or the Seven Bloods,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
all of these are just to save the dead.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Save the dead?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But you never really trusted me.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I trust you.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you also believe I came from a hundred years ago?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whether it's a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
as long as it's you, Gu Xiaofeng.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Shen Yi?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Shen Yi, come on.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Shen Yi, come on.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If the plague doesn't come out,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
will Master end up like this?

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I still have to find a way to go back.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That...

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How about I go out and find something to do?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm embarrassed to spend your money.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This jade pendant,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
take it as a reward for the past few days.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why did you suddenly say that?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This jade pendant...

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This jade pendant...

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why does it look like me?

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It does look like you.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But it's not the same.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yours is the key, mine is not.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And in the clinic,

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it can play the biggest role in me.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Isn't it?

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Gu Xiaofeng

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Dr. Gu,

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
do you really not remember me?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I really don't remember you.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It shouldn't be.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Could it be that I'm old and blind?

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's just a few hundred years.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Gu Xiaomei,

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
thank you for your hard work.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then Mo Ge, you should study medicine,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and help Mo Grandpa enter the clinic.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
With Gu Xiaomei here,

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
what else should I worry about?

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Xiaofeng,

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
come with me to get a diagnosis.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Coming.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll go too.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Chunmei,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Chunmei, don't run away.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chunmei,

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it's her.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hurry, she's in danger.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Chunmei,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chunmei.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hurry and get her up.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's wrong with her?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's born with different blood vessels.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She can't be fine.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
After an hour like this,

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
she'll be able to wake up.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chunmei,

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
don't have another chance.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why you again?

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your body is weak.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't run around again.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's none of your business.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you have another chance,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you can't save me.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There aren't many young people

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
who are talented and eager to learn like you.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm old.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You know,

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the best skill is

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to keep your hands off.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mo Grandpa,

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm still in the clinic.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been a doctor for decades.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Most of my peers

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
are in the arts,

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
in medicine, and in business.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We have to work hard in this field.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I won't give up.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What our ancestors left behind

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
can't be taken away from us.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Times are useless when they're gone.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But it doesn't include Chinese medicine.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm relieved

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that you can think like that.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you have another chance,

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you can't save me.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's just a teenager.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why does he want to die?

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sister, buy an apple.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How much is an apple?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's sold for money.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then, help me put it in.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.
