improving werenas

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wu Xiao Feng, have you seen anyone like this before?

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If that day, it was someone else who pulled you up,

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
would you still follow them?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, it must be you. I just wanted to get close to you.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Actually, I'm not what you think I am.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Pei Xin's hospital! My poor dad!

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today, you must give us an explanation!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,820
Where is the patient with the

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,000
congenital injury in Xingjiang?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come and explain it to me!

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Explain it to me.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My father-in-law has been in surgery for so many days.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why can't he still make it?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everyone, come and see!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Pei Xin's hospital! My poor dad!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Your hospital must give us an explanation!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Otherwise, I will expose you!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, didn't we say we would do our best?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Your hospital is going to go in and save people like this!

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everyone, be quiet.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Every doctor will do their best to rescue patients.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The hospital will also report to the family

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
before the surgery.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You also signed the consent agreement.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the consent that allowed you to cure my dad.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you don't cure him, he will die!

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Miss.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't touch me!

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who touched me? I'm not done yet!

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you doing?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You can't save people. Why are you still beating them?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come and make way.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello, Miss. Please calm down.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I know you.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are among the people who did the surgery for my dad!

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, yes!

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You are the accomplice!

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are also the accomplice!

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please, calm down.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come on, let's go.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The doctor is beating someone!

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,300
You people, come and

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
have a look!

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,380
Quickly!

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,500
Stop messing around!

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,720
Claire!

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,840
Let go of meâ€¦

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,200
What's is this!

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,300
Claire, don't

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,620
Carrying this bill with me

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,260
It works!

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,300
The head has been hit by a sharp object.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,300
It causes severe brain damage.

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Whether he can wake up or not depends on him.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
What do you mean by his own?

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Look at mine.

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,300
The head has been hit by a sharp object.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,300
It causes severe brain damage.

60
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,300
It causes severe brain damage.

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,300
It causes severe brain damage.

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,300
It causes severe brain damage.

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Dad!

64
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
What are you doing?

65
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Let me explain.

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Dr. Gu, can my dad really wake up?

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Yes, he had a big surgery and he didn't wake up.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
How can he wake up with a few acupuncture points?

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
You saw it too.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Uncle Xu really dared to look at you.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
That's hope.

72
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300
If my dad really wakes up, you are the real doctor.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Thank you.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
But we do have a real doctor.

76
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Miss Gu, what is your identity?

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Why do you give the patients in the hospital treatment?

78
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I am a doctor.

79
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
What about the medical qualification?

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Medical qualification again?

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I have the qualification.

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
It's the best proof to cure patients.

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
You are being unreasonable.

84
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,300
You didn't cure anyone.

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Your daughter is here.

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
You should thank me.

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Besides, you are all old people.

88
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Why do you judge me like a judge?

89
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Why are you so arrogant at such a young age?

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm not.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Master, that's not what she meant.

92
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
That's what I meant.

93
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
What else do you want?

94
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Shut up.

95
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Master, I brought Gu Xiaofeng here.

96
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
If anything happens, I will take responsibility.

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
I will take her away.

98
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Go.

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Come with me.

100
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm leaving.

101
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Dr. Ren, you are right.

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Gu Xiaofeng.

103
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,300
Shen Yu, are you a good person or a bad person?

104
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Thank you for talking for me.

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You are welcome.

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Thank you so much.

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Dr. Ren, what's your relationship with him?

108
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
For him, you dare to go against Director Jiang.

109
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Go home first.

110
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Don't bother to give him any more advice.

111
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
I'm listening to you.

112
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
You...

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Hello.

114
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Dr. Ren, you are knocked out.

115
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
You haven't made it clear yet.

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Don't go.

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Let go.

118
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm fine.

119
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Don't lie to me.

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
You just want to be with him and leave me alone.

121
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Dr. Ren,

122
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,300
why don't you accept me after all these years?

123
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
As a nurse,

124
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
I heard that someone had a first reaction.

125
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
I was still thinking about it.

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Do you think I will like you?

127
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I... I'm off work.

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Since you made your career choice,

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,300
you should know that your duty is to do it every moment.

130
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm fine.

131
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Luckily, I came in time.

132
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Sorry, I didn't stop him.

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Don't worry.

134
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
He's just asleep.

135
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't give the patient a needle injection?

136
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
I didn't use it.

137
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Trust me.

138
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
He's fine now.

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
You can go.

140
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Don't say sorry anymore, okay?

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Miao Zishi.

142
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
The End
