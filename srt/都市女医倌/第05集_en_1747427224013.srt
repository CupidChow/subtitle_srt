Miao Zishi!

Do something!

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Impossible.

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
He was just...

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Please leave the hospital.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Or I'll call the police.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Master.

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
He's out of danger.

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Thank you, Master.

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Master, is it really his responsibility?

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
I don't want to hide it from you.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
If he didn't save the patient in time,

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
your sister wouldn't be able to make it to the operating table.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
A man's eyes.

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
A man's son.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
You're so bold.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
You don't believe me?

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
You dare to kiss me?

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
You dare to question my medical skills?

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
You dare to drive me away?

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
You'll be in trouble if I leave.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,940
The

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
This letter

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
was delivered so easily.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
It's boring.

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I don't want to hide it from you.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
If he didn't save the patient in time,

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
your sister wouldn't be able to make it to the operating table.

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't be so pitiful anymore, okay?

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Please leave the hospital.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Or I'll call the police.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
You deserve it.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Please leave the hospital.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Or I'll call the police.

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
My master doesn't want me anymore.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Except for my son,

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I've already used all my strength.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
The

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
It's you.

55
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
You know me?

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
You may not have a deep impression of me.

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
You saved a life in time.

58
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I don't study Chinese medicine very often.

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Moreover,

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
you're still a little girl.

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
I've been following my master's way of practicing Qi Guang since childhood.

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Is it called Chinese medicine here?

63
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Not bad.

64
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm Mo Haoqian from Mo Deng Hospital.

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
If it's convenient,

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
you can find me anytime.

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
It's not convenient.

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
It's not convenient...

69
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,840
What am I supposed to do now?

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Who was that man?

71
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Today...

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm alone.

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I have nothing to rely on.

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I didn't eat, drink, or have money.

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I had to go around and get people to pay for my drink.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Why are you so pitiful?

78
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't worry about me.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
You made me the most honest and the most beautiful.

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
I'll take you home.

81
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Home?

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Did you get into a fight with a thief?

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
This thief is quite a good guy.

84
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
He's just a little angry.

85
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Go take a shower. Don't catch a cold.

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I'll cook for you.

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll go get some water.

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
He's quite a good guy.

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Forget it.

90
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
He can't find out my true identity.

91
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I'll just ignore him for now.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll just go outside.

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
This is a phone.

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
This is an e-book.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
This is for taking photos.

96
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
The most important thing is to remember these numbers.

97
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Then type in the numbers.

98
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Click on this button.

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
You can find me anytime, anywhere.

100
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Anytime?

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Yes, anytime, anywhere.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Hello? Are you off work?

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Yes.

104
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Where are you?

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm almost home.

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
No!

107
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
No?

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I mean, I want to keep calling you.

109
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Don't come back.

110
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm home.

111
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
What are you doing?

112
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm not doing anything.

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Gu Xiao Feng!

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Gu Xiao Feng

115
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Gu Xiao Feng

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Gu Xiao Feng

117
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Gu Xiao Feng
