1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
carrots.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,120
about peace in a person is enough for formation

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,200
I am your Episode story

4
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Gu Xiaofeng.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Could it be...

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You finally woke up.

7
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Is it true?

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Then...

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
My brother...

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Let's cherish this moment.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Can you tell me what happened to you?

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't ask anything.

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I just want to hug you tightly.

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Okay.

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
So annoying.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
They are playing with us.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Let's show them.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Gu Xiaomei, come to the hospital.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Mo Yanyan...

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh no, something happened to Mo Yanyan.

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Mo Yanyan...

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Yanyan...

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Gu Xiaomei is here.

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Xiaofeng, you are here.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Xiaofeng is here.

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
How could this happen?

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Mo Yanyan, Xiaofeng can save you.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Mo Yanyan, Xiaofeng can save you.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Xiaofeng, don't do this.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Xiaofeng.

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
The hospital will never give up on treating patients.

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Xiaofeng.

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Mo Yanyan is sick.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Even the immortals can't help it.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Mo Yanyan, Xiaofeng is not important.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I can't save you.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Xiaofeng.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
According to your background,

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
you call me Mo Yanyan.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
As for the medical skills,

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I want to call you master.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Don't blame yourself.

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Grandson, follow me.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I'll be with you.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I'll be with you.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll be with you.

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
You follow Xiaofeng to study Chinese medicine.

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Chinese medicine has the history of our country for thousands of years.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
You have to believe in it.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I believe.

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I believe everything.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
You are really well now.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I promise you, I'll study medicine well.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Good.

55
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Grandson.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Grandson.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Grandson.

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Don't scare me.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Grandson, wake up.

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Grandson.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Grandson, don't scare me.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Grandson.

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I won't let you get angry again.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Grandson.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Wake up.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Grandson.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Grandson.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Grandson.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Grandson.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
My grandfather asked me to give this to you.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll give it to you.

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Xiaofeng.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,200
It's the responsibility of the Chinese medicine to inherit the culture of the old dead and the new.

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
But my grandson is very talented.

75
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
He has limited ability.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
He will leave you in his care.

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Renyi.

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
My grandfather is very good.

79
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
He taught me everything.

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
He always thought of me when he had something delicious.

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,200
But my grandfather never went to the hospital again.

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
You and I.

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
No matter what happens.

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
We will face it together.

85
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Okay?

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Renyi.
