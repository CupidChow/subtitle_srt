1
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,833
How dare you snatch my parking lot?

2
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,291
Social media is so cheap
but they're complaining.

3
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,625
What's wrong with them?

4
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,708
Yes?

5
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,666
How dare you?

6
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,791
I was here first!

7
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,583
How dare you snatch my damn spot?

8
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,666
Sorry, I was on the phone
and didn't notice.

9
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,916
On the phone?

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,791
So many primary schoolers here.

11
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,166
And you're driving while using the phone?

12
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,583
Could you please talk softer?

13
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,291
I was in my damn car
sounding my horn so loudly.

14
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,833
Yet you couldn't hear.

15
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,333
If I lowered my damn volume,

16
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,791
would you be able to hear?

17
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,791
Can you stop swearing?

18
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,708
That is none of your damn business.

19
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,916
I'll speak my damn mind.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,166
Who are you to tell me what not to say?

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,083
My friend, it has already been 21 years.

22
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,708
I'm already a grandpa
and you're still stuck on "dad."

23
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,750
Right.

24
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,458
Your grandpa is talking now.

25
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,916
Your grandpa says--

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,958
Don't become a grandpa now.
Can you not say that?

27
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,166
I'll say what I want to say.

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,416
I'm saying, who are you to say

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,458
that I cannot say what I want to say?

30
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,083
- Listen to me.
- Listen to your grandpa.

31
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:05,125
I am "your dad." I am also "your grandpa."

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,666
Four-eyed monkey.

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,166
After 21 years,
you have not changed one bit.

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,541
You have not changed either.

35
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,708
You've snatched my parking lot yet again.

36
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,791
- Stop filming.
- Stop filming.

37
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,916
Don't shoot "your grandpa."

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,375
Don't shoot "your dad."

39
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:38,416
PRIMARY 6 PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

40
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,833
<i>Did you know?</i>

41
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,833
Last year, two students from this school

42
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,541
got into Hwa Chong through DSA

43
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,791
and another two
got into Raffles Institution.

44
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,250
More than those
who used their PSLE results.

45
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,208
But the DSA for good schools

46
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,708
either takes in those from GEP

47
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
or the Math Olympiad.

48
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,666
Actually, nowadays,
DSA is looking for students

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,208
who are good at sports and arts.

50
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,291
So if they're naturally gifted
at sports and arts,

51
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,541
they'll stand a higher chance.

52
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,458
Do you mean sports and arts?

53
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,375
So through sports and arts DSA,

54
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,500
they can directly enroll
into a top school?

55
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,875
How high must their standards be?

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,166
If my child starts learning now,
can he make it?

57
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,166
You're only going to start trying
to get into a top school now?

58
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,958
- Is it too late?
- Not much time left.

59
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,500
That means it's not too late.

60
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,416
As long as we can get into a top school,

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
we will do our best.

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,166
Don't you need his opinion?

63
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,041
My mom will never ask for my opinion.

64
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,250
I just have to abide by her decisions.

65
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,166
And she will say…

66
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,416
- "This is for your own good."
- "This is for your own good."

67
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,333
Yes.

68
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,666
This is for your own good

69
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,875
and your children's own good.

70
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,375
Good morning, parents.

71
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,750
Today's briefing is to urge you all

72
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,250
not to force your children
to aim for elite schools,

73
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,375
but to choose schools
based on their abilities.

74
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,875
You see, every school has its strengths.

75
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,916
Just like every child has their strengths.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,166
Just like in the movie <i>I Not Stupid</i>,

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,291
you must understand
that time and resources can be wasted

78
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,708
if you put them into the wrong things.

79
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
So I urge you today.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,333
Your child may be a valuable asset.

81
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,833
But you must teach them
how to identify their strengths

82
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:18,125
so that you can put your time
and energy in the right place.

83
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,250
So your children can flourish.

84
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,166
To flourish.

85
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,291
Still has to do with grades, doesn't it?

86
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,875
Of course. Let me tell you.

87
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,708
Do not worry too much about grades.

88
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,750
I'll help all of you.

89
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,916
- Thank you.
- That's nice.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,125
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

91
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,125
Thank you.

92
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,583
Thank you.

93
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,416
Jayden, I want you
to finish this bird's nest

94
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,625
and take the supplement.

95
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,583
Your exam is coming.

96
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,375
This is good for your memory and focus.

97
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,583
Didn't Aunty Su give us
some bottles of bird's nest last week?

98
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,791
Why prepare it yourself?

99
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,958
The one I prepared is my secret recipe.

100
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,708
How can you compare it
to the mass-produced stuff?

101
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
Of course mine is better.

102
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,041
I only want the best for you.

103
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:10,083
Mom, you promised to bring me
to an awesome burger place.

104
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,250
When are we going?

105
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,916
Behave yourself
and I will bring you there.

106
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,916
Drink up.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,125
It's expensive.

108
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,666
Why do you always ask me
to drink this stupid bird's saliva?

109
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,750
Jayden, you mind your language.

110
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,250
Sorry, can I have my water?

111
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,541
Maria.

112
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,958
Maria!

113
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,500
Water, please.

115
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,958
Next time when he's taking supplements,

116
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,458
please bring water along.

117
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,875
He can't possibly take them
without water, right?

118
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,916
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,041
Maria!

120
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,416
Yes, Jayden.

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,750
- I need my water now.
- Coming soon.

122
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,541
Jayden! Where did you learn that from?

123
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,083
That's very rude.

124
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,041
- Thank you.
- Sorry, ma'am.

125
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:00,958
It's okay.

126
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,166
Say thank you.

127
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,041
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jayden.

128
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,541
- Hey.
- Hey, so how's the speech script?

129
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,166
Did you manage to improve it?

130
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,333
As you wished.

131
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,416
Jayden, don't use the last script.

132
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,333
I have found the best lawyer
in the company to improve it.

133
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,375
Use this instead.

134
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,541
Don't be stressed.

135
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,416
Yes, this one is a lot better.

136
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,625
You're going to shock
the school again, my little champion.

137
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,291
We'll practice this later.

138
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,541
Finish this first.

139
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,541
- Wen Ting.
- Hi.

140
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,208
It has been a while.

141
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,250
It has been a while.

142
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,583
You look as pretty as ever.

143
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,750
Same to you.

144
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,958
Are you still working at this company?

145
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,208
The China division sent me
to the Singapore HQ.

146
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,125
Let me introduce some of my friends.

147
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,333
- Sure.
- Let's go.

148
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,083
Are you used to it?

149
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,583
You look so good.

150
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,291
Thank you for taking care of Zi Hao.

151
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,750
I'd be lost without you.

152
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
It's no trouble.

153
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,458
Don't mention it.

154
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,166
I'll do it for you later.

155
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,833
Let me introduce my good friend, Wen Ting.

156
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,250
- Hello, I am Wen Ting.
- Hello.

157
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,458
- Come, take a seat over here.
- Okay.

158
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,458
You too.

159
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,041
You are all so pretty.

160
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,666
You are very elegant too.

161
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,500
Yes, such disposition.

162
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,916
Wen Ting, how old is your son?

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,750
- He's 12 years old.
- He's 12 years old.

164
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,666
So Primary 6.

165
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,583
PSLE this year.

166
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,583
Could he enter
a government school at Primary 6?

167
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,791
He came here last year

168
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,166
and stayed alone for a year.

169
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,833
He came alone?

170
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,625
Why didn't you come along?

171
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,666
I had some affairs at home
so I couldn't leave.

172
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,958
But thanks to Xiao Hui who recommended

173
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,375
this company that specializes
in overseas education.

174
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,583
This is the one.

175
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,916
From arranging visas
to finding a homestay family,

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,458
enrollment, and tuition classes,

177
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,500
they do it all.

178
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,958
Primary 6 is crucial.

179
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,041
The mom should be around for all of it.

180
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,875
To build a strong foundation, right?

181
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,791
But your son arrived just a year ago.

182
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,666
I guess he just needs help
in Science and English.

183
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,791
No issue with the rest?

184
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,541
His English is poor,
so it has affected his math too.

185
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,875
This is a headache for me.

186
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,583
You need to build his English foundation.

187
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,791
Expand his vocabulary and reading.

188
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,583
For math, word problems are key.

189
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,583
Make sure every step is clearly written.

190
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,958
If the answer is wrong,
he doesn't get any points.

191
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,458
For Science, focus on keywords

192
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,083
and make a mindmap.

193
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,291
Sweetie, why are you such a professional?

194
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,041
I am a mom of two after all.

195
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,833
And one-on-one monitoring.

196
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,875
What does that mean?

197
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,958
Eat, drink, learn, and sleep with them.

198
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,458
Sleep with them? Isn't that too much?

199
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
No. If you don't monitor him,

200
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,458
he'll wake up in the middle
of the night to play games

201
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,041
and sleep in school the next day.

202
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,125
That's right.

203
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
Zhan Rui, move.

204
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,541
Go left.

205
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,250
Zhan Rui, I'm dying. Come save me quick.

206
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,750
Hey, enemy beside you.

207
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,625
Do you need me to assist?

208
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,541
Wang Zi Hao, open the door.

209
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,833
Mom, I'm almost done.
Give me five more minutes.

210
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,875
Wang Zi Hao, open the door.

211
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,250
I'm almost out of stamina.

212
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm almost done! Just a while more!

213
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,208
Wang Zi Hao, you have three seconds.

214
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,958
If you don't open the door,
you'll face the consequences.

215
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,416
I'm almost done!

216
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,375
- One.
- Give me a moment.

217
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,541
Two.

218
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,125
I'm almost done, Mom.

219
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
Mom!

220
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,208
You're even shouting at me? What?

221
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,125
You even have the guts to lock the door.

222
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,458
Now I know the reason
for your declining results.

223
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,541
It's because of your gaming, isn't it?

224
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,000
You made me betray my friends.

225
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,708
How could you be so heartless?

226
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,125
Betray? Do you even know what that means?

227
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,416
You betrayed me by playing games.
Do you know?

228
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,083
No wonder everyone says

229
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,333
that video games turn kids into monsters.

230
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,250
I have finally witnessed it for myself.

231
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,291
How dare you cover your ears.

232
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,916
Remove your hands.

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,166
Wang Zi Hao!

234
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,208
Fine. I will call your dad.

235
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,458
Don't.

236
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,416
Sit properly.

237
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,875
Wang Zi Hao.

238
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,625
Do you know why you came to Singapore?

239
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,458
You are here to study.

240
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,208
I came all the way from Shanghai
to accompany you while you study.

241
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,041
Can we just perform
our own roles as best we can?

242
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,125
You're not a kid anymore.

243
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,750
Don't make me fret over you.

244
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,250
You made me betray my friends.

245
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,750
Finish this book by tonight.

246
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,500
These words dance.

247
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,833
Dancing words.

248
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,375
And pigs can fly.

249
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,708
No dinner for you tonight.

250
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,541
We'll see if the words still dance.

251
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,208
- What are you eating?
- There's a sunny-side up.

252
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,250
Yes.

253
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,083
- What are you drinking?
- Milo.

254
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,958
You also have prawns.

255
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
I want my prawns.

256
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,833
Let me ask you.

257
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,625
Does your mom scold you when you game?

258
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,583
No.

259
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,583
Will she make you do homework?

260
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,625
No.

261
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,375
My mom just tells me to try my best.

262
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,125
In the worst-case scenario,
I can sell noodles with my dad.

263
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,958
Sell noodles?

264
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,583
Is your mom's expectation that low?

265
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,208
Low? It doesn't feel that way.

266
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,208
Is your goal to get into a top school?

267
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,291
Do you think

268
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,208
I'll praise you for stating the obvious?

269
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,083
Come on.

270
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,083
How about you?

271
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,166
I'll go with the flow.

272
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,333
- And you?
- I'd like to but I don't think I can.

273
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,791
- You?
- Not with my poor grades.

274
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,958
How about you, Fatty?

275
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,291
Which school do you wish to get into?

276
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,000
Nanyang Girls' School.

277
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,833
- Girls' School?
- Just imagine.

278
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,375
As the only guy in the school,

279
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,041
everyone will be fighting over me.

280
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,375
It's because I'm not there.

281
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,000
Bro, what is wrong with you?

282
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,333
You sabotaged us!

283
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,125
Yesterday, you suddenly went offline.

284
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,333
And now because of you,

285
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,208
all of us lost our equipment.

286
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,916
You made us lose a lot of money.

287
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,833
What now?

288
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,458
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,958
It's because my mom suddenly came in.

290
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,083
Still trying to find an excuse
for yourself.

291
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,291
Your mom today, your dad tomorrow,

292
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,125
and your grandparents the day after.

293
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,458
Anyway, you are a burden.

294
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,875
Confirm plus chop.

295
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,333
It really wasn't intentional.

296
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,458
My mom switched my computer off.

297
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,500
You can't be trusted.
You're out of this group.

298
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,708
Boys, he has already explained
his reason very clearly.

299
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,291
So please be understanding.

300
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,000
Can't you just shut up?
Why are you such a busybody?

301
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,125
We weren't even talking to you.

302
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,000
I can report you guys to the
Principal's office and settle it there.

303
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,041
We lost money. Real money.

304
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,791
Because of this guy,
all of our money is now gone.

305
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,083
Let's go to the Principal's office.

306
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,250
No.

307
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,291
Come on, guys. Let's just go.

308
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Boys can be so petty.

309
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,416
It's all my mom's fault.

310
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,500
Lost my friends and Mom is still mad.

311
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,083
What else can I do?

312
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,500
I have a solution about your mom.

313
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,833
- As long as you follow my instructions.
- Really?

314
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,875
I have a good strategist behind me.

315
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,000
- Can you teach me too?
- Can you teach me too?

316
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,458
- I want to know.
- I want to know.

317
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,458
Am I dreaming?

318
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,375
You are actually doing housework for me.

319
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,625
Have you finished your homework?

320
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,208
Done. I have finished both.

321
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,291
So quickly?

322
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,541
You are behaving weirdly today.

323
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,041
Fess up. What do you want?
One, two, three.

324
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,875
- May I play games?
- May I play games?

325
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,125
I can read you like a book.

326
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,500
If you are always so obedient,

327
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,958
I'll let you play every day.

328
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,708
Of course, this is my motivation.

329
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,041
Is two hours enough?

330
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,208
Yes, of course.

331
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,375
Thank you for your grace, Empress Mother.

332
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,583
Rise.

333
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,708
Thank you, Empress Mother.

334
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,166
Bye. I'm off to play.

335
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,083
See? The contents are quite different.

336
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,958
But the structures are all the same.

337
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,291
And the grammar is too perfect.
You see that?

338
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,666
Looks like
it's all copied from one person.

339
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
Exactly.

340
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,250
Agree?

341
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,750
Let me call them in.

342
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,791
Come in, students.

343
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,583
Come in faster.

344
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,250
Close the door behind you.

345
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,958
- Good morning, teachers.
- Good morning, teachers.

346
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:46,875
Say it together.

347
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,500
Together and louder.

348
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,791
- Good morning, teachers.
- Good morning, teachers.

349
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,208
All your essays are well-written.

350
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,458
I should be very happy, right?

351
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,333
But I am not. Why?

352
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:08,875
In the past,
your essays were full of mistakes.

353
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,208
But there were none at all this time.

354
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,125
Is this magic?

355
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,208
Ladies and gentlemen,

356
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,291
tell us the truth.

357
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,208
Did your tutor teach you how to do it?

358
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,750
Or did you copy from someone else?

359
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,458
Look up.

360
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,208
Be brave and admit it.

361
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,958
All your essays are too well-written.

362
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,125
It's not that we look down on you
or don't believe you.

363
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,791
We just want to know how you did it.

364
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,375
Speak up.

365
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458
Tell us the truth.

366
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,791
Come on.

367
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,333
Listen.

368
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,625
As long as the writing
didn't come from your head

369
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,750
or your brain,

370
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,208
that means it's cheating.

371
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,958
C-H-I-T-I-N-G.

372
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,541
It's C-H-E-A-T-I-N-G.

373
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,125
Did I spell C-H-I-T?

374
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,958
Either you tell us the truth or

375
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,708
I will tell your parents.

376
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,916
Your choice.

377
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,375
Good morning, teachers.

378
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,625
I am your new colleague.

379
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,041
Mr. Lee. Their new form teacher.

380
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:15,958
New teacher.

381
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,125
I think I may have an idea
of what's going on.

382
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,625
Allow me to share it with you.

383
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,875
Madam Ye,
what is the topic of the composition?

384
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,375
The proudest moment of my life.

385
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,875
Okay.

386
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,791
The proudest moment of my life.

387
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,083
Yes.

388
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,458
- Here you go.
- This new technology.

389
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,083
How could I not know?

390
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,458
Yes, this is actually
the latest AI technology.

391
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,375
It's called AI-GPT.

392
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,166
AI-GPT?

393
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,625
Yes, so what it does
is that you key in the topic

394
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,916
and the AI generates
the essay for you instantly.

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,208
What you mean is,

396
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,833
computers can write essays
for everybody now?

397
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,625
- Yes.
- So fast?

398
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,958
Instantly.

399
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,000
So students,

400
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,041
you copied directly from AI-GPT, right?

401
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,791
Gosh, no,
teachers will be out of job soon.

402
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,291
The few of you have cheated.

403
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,333
If the school informs your parents,

404
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,166
you'll be in deep trouble.

405
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,083
Let me ask you again.

406
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,583
What is AI-GPT?

407
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,875
AI-GPT is only a supplementary tool.

408
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,333
Whether it's AI or GPT,
if you're copying word for word,

409
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,250
then you are just deceiving yourself
and also the teachers.

410
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,500
Do you want AI
to replace all of you in the future?

411
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,750
No.

412
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,666
No, right?

413
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,125
Then you need to be creative

414
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,833
and have your own style of writing.

415
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Nice to meet all of you. I'm Mr. Lee.

416
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,583
Your new math teacher
and your new form teacher.

417
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,666
Good morning, class.

418
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,083
- Good morning, Mr. Lee.
- Good morning, Mr. Lee.

419
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,500
Students, I am not saying
that you can't use AI for your homework.

420
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:55,083
But you need to use your brain, okay?

421
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,416
You need to use your brain
and have critical thinking.

422
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,166
And do you know how to achieve that?

423
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,041
By studying harder.

424
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
So do you guys have any questions?

425
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,916
- Mr. Lee, pick me!
- Me!

426
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,375
Are you married?

427
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,500
Do you have a girlfriend?

428
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,541
What's your favorite food?

429
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,666
What's your favorite color?

430
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,666
Do you like gaming?

431
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,375
Okay, students.

432
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,708
I'm only going to answer questions

433
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,291
that are related to your schoolwork.

434
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,333
Hello, Mr. Lee.

435
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,750
I am Jayden.

436
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,708
- Top student.
- Top student.

437
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:37,208
- Top student.
- Top student.

438
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,583
Hi, Mr. Top Student.
What can I do for you?

439
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,958
Mr. Lee, since you're our math teacher,

440
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,291
you should be great at it.

441
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,458
I'm not bad at it.

442
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,083
I have a math question.
Could you solve it for me?

443
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,166
Can I have your permission
to use my phone to share the question?

444
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,125
Okay.

445
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,541
Thank you.

446
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,333
High school math.

447
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,958
Yes?

448
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,958
Mr. Lee, about the AI-GPT incident.

449
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,333
It's actually my fault.

450
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,250
I was the one who introduced it to them.

451
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,583
I should have reminded them

452
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,708
to not copy it into their homework
word for word.

453
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,333
So can you please not tell their parents?

454
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,666
Okay.

455
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,458
But this will be the last time, all right?

456
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,083
- Okay!
- Okay!

457
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,625
All right, let's start the class.

458
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,208
We don't normally provide

459
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,583
one-to-one home tuition service
for our students.

460
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,500
Well, because--

461
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,541
We can pay more.

462
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,583
It's not about money.

463
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,208
It's not an efficient use of resources.

464
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,791
- Our teachers--
- We'll pay double.

465
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,750
It's not about the money, really.

466
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,708
Using one teacher
for one student is very selfish.

467
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,875
Five times more.

468
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,916
But looking at your son,

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,375
he really has the talent
that requires one-to-one tuition.

470
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,208
So sometimes being selfish is good.

471
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,375
It's important.
These are some of our packages.

472
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,250
We have the "One To One" package.

473
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,125
We have the "Turbo" package.

474
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,208
What type of teachers do you have?

475
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,083
- That's important.
- We have three types.

476
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,333
We have a gentle teacher.

477
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,125
We also have those who are very good

478
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,083
at teaching their students
with clear instructions.

479
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,833
No, I want the tough kind.

480
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,333
That's the "Commando" package.

481
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,791
- Okay.
- We have a Commando teacher,

482
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,375
who's very good at handling
difficult students and parents.

483
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,958
Tough love.

484
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,583
Okay, but are your teachers discreet?

485
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,958
I need them to be discreet.

486
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:03,958
We can be discreet

487
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,583
with our "Keep It a Secret" package.

488
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,875
You have a "Keep It a Secret" package?

489
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,291
Don't worry, you're not
the only parent using this package.

490
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,041
Okay.

491
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,708
Mom, who told you that I cheated?

492
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,041
Does it--

493
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,250
Does it matter who told me?

494
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,750
I know about your every action in school.

495
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,875
This is not considered cheating.

496
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,833
I promise it will
never happen again, okay?

497
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,958
Why are you bringing me
to the tuition center to punish me?

498
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,208
You think I am punishing you
by bringing you here?

499
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,083
Giving you tuition is a punishment?

500
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,208
What is in that head of yours?

501
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,708
Don't think you're not at fault

502
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,708
just because
your teacher didn't inform me.

503
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,583
Your Mr. Lee

504
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,083
hid such a major incident
from the parents.

505
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,625
He's such a weirdo.

506
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,833
Don't blame him.

507
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,583
It has nothing to do with him.
Don't get him in trouble.

508
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,375
Get the teacher in trouble?

509
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,291
Fine.

510
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,000
I won't get him in trouble.

511
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,583
But with such a major incident,

512
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,375
I need to tell your dad.

513
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,416
Don't tell Dad.

514
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,916
Are you scared now?

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,125
I'm worried that he might be unhappy

516
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,333
and blame you for not teaching me well.

517
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,916
Zi Hao, for my sake,

518
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,333
can you try your best and study hard?

519
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,375
Get good grades for Dad, okay?

520
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,166
Okay.

521
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,166
The cheating incident
can never happen again.

522
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,833
Fix your strap properly first.

523
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,625
- Hey, Sophia.
- Jayden.

524
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,958
Are you here for tuition too?

525
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
- Actually--
- She's not here for tuition.

526
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,208
She's an "old kampung" friend.

527
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,791
"Kampung"?

528
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:48,708
Village.

529
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,458
- Old neighbor.
- I see.

530
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,375
- We'll leave first.
- Bye-bye.

531
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,291
Okay.

532
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:54,708
Bye-bye.

533
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,375
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. See you.

534
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,708
Mr. Lee, I don't mean to be difficult.

535
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,375
But this is a very difficult situation.

536
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,458
You may not see it from your perspective.

537
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,833
But your students took the answers

538
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,833
and copied them wholesale.

539
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,000
That is plagiarism.

540
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,458
That is cheating. That is an offense.

541
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,125
And then, you covered up for them

542
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,583
and hid it from the parents.

543
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,000
Now all the other parents
think that you're biased.

544
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,541
That you're favoring these students.

545
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,708
Today, you cover up for these students.

546
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,958
Tomorrow, another student
makes a mistake and you cover it up.

547
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,500
Bigger mistake, bigger cover-up.

548
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,458
Then you cover, cover, cover…

549
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,958
In the end?

550
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,208
Mr. Lee, your job is to teach,

551
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,833
not to cover up.

552
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,916
I'm not saying this
just to cover my own backside.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,375
I know you are a young teacher.

554
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,625
I'm going to retire already.

555
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:52,041
So everything I say is for your own good.

556
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,375
Do you understand?

557
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,833
If you understood what I said,
can you give me a nod?

558
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,750
For your own good, right?

559
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,208
<i>What we swore to keep a secret</i>

560
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,875
<i>became known to all the moms.</i>

561
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,958
If they became investigators,

562
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,375
they'd definitely be indispensable
to the country.

563
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,291
Just like that,
tough times are ahead for me.

564
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,291
When it comes to education,

565
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,416
her circle of friends
always comes up with weird ideas,

566
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,416
making me their guinea pig.

567
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,375
Goodness.

568
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,541
After all that effort,
you still got a score of six.

569
00:24:56,625 --> 00:25:00,208
Can I please get
a score of four out of you?

570
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,708
Do you know that with the same scores,

571
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,458
a Singaporean would have priority?

572
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,541
If you want to be 100% confident,

573
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,125
you need to put in 200% of effort.

574
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,750
I did my best.

575
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,166
Don't say that.
That's just an excuse to be lazy.

576
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,250
I really did my best.

577
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,041
You did not.

578
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,875
But I discovered your potential.

579
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:21,041
In the past month,
the pressure I put on you

580
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,041
gave exemplary results.

581
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,916
Even though it's just a six,

582
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,250
it's still an improvement
from a score of eight.

583
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,416
What does this mean?

584
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,916
If I continue to press you

585
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,041
and you keep pushing
to unlock your potential,

586
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,250
we will get a four eventually, my son.

587
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,291
Mom, before we came here,

588
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,833
you said it's not that competitive here.

589
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,541
And we have a good foundation
to outshine the locals easily.

590
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,041
You're still behind despite that.

591
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,083
What does that say?

592
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm a pig.

593
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,875
You're a pig? What does that make me?

594
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,708
You're not a pig. You're just lazy.

595
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:51,625
Tell me.

596
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,375
- Have you ever been top of the class?
- No.

597
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,791
There's someone in your class

598
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,083
who has been top student
for the past five years.

599
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,083
Jayden, right?

600
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,958
Mom, how did you know all of this?

601
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,083
Don't interrupt me.

602
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,916
What was I saying?

603
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,083
Jayden.

604
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,708
From today onwards,
Jayden needs to be your goal.

605
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,666
Goal?

606
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,208
With a goal comes motivation.

607
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,291
Motivation is what gets you to the top.

608
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,958
Son, I know studying is not easy.

609
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,916
But I'm here, right?

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,166
I'll be by your side.

611
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,208
We can conquer every difficulty together.

612
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,541
We're not locals.

613
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,541
We don't have any second chances.

614
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,791
If you don't do well this time,

615
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,500
how am I going to face your dad?

616
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,625
And what would he think of you?

617
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,666
Everything is in English here.
I suck at it.

618
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,916
It's just English.

619
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,916
I have a solution.

620
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,708
Check the dictionary?

621
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,041
That's too slow.

622
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,583
Memorize the dictionary.

623
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,000
Where did you get this?

624
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,000
I was too complacent
and underestimated the competition.

625
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,708
He improved so rapidly
on all four subjects.

626
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,791
You're from the same tuition center right?

627
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,083
Who are the four teachers?

628
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,916
Sorry, I don't know who they are.

629
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,875
What do you mean?
You're colleagues, you should know.

630
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,166
But we have so many tutors.

631
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,750
Then go find out for us, please.

632
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,083
Sorry, Madam Chew.

633
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,958
I don't think I'm going
to do that for you.

634
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,666
Anyway, today is my last session.

635
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,125
What do you mean?

636
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:28,333
Your son is fine but I am very stressed.

637
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,083
I really can't put up with you.

638
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,958
I quit.

639
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,833
What? How can you just quit?

640
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,208
We have a "Commando" package!

641
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,250
Can you please go and find out
who the four tuition teachers are?

642
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:43,125
Mom, it's not about the tuition teacher.

643
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,125
It's the mom.

644
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,375
The mom?

645
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,375
What do you mean?

646
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,208
Ever since his mom came over,

647
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,083
she has been supervising his studies.

648
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,833
His mom was also a top student.

649
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,833
So his results improved over time.

650
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,958
Top student?

651
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,708
She's only been here a few months

652
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,541
and there's so much improvement?

653
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,125
Jayden, you can't underestimate your foes.

654
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,458
Okay? If you do,

655
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,333
you won't get full marks.

656
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,833
Jayden.

657
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,375
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

658
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,500
Also, I feel that
you should stop tutoring Zi Hao.

659
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,208
The more you tutor him, look.

660
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:19,333
He's about to surpass you.

661
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,708
Do you still take him as a friend?

662
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:21,666
Dear.

663
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,208
It's just tutoring a fellow student.

664
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,083
What are you teaching here?

665
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,833
Teaching children
to turn friends into foes.

666
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,750
Is that what you want to achieve?

667
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,208
Come on.

668
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,583
They are just Primary 6 kids.

669
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,208
Primary 6 kids?

670
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,958
And so you think it doesn't matter?

671
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,583
91, 83.

672
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,541
That's still okay.

673
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,958
Look at this math paper.

674
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,208
92, 91.

675
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,750
Do you appreciate
the lack of a difference here?

676
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,083
How come I'm the only one who's worried?

677
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,708
The both of you.

678
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,833
You're his dad. Why aren't you worried?

679
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,208
Okay.

680
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,958
The script your dad got for you

681
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,375
is very well-written.

682
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,583
If you perform well,
you'll definitely be number one.

683
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,541
Have you looked at Zi Hao's script?

684
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:25,708
Mom, what are you worried about?

685
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,708
It's an English speech competition.

686
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,083
English speech competition,

687
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,458
so you think that it's completely fine?

688
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,166
I want you to go and find out.

689
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,750
Look at his script. Do you understand?

690
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,208
Well, can you do me a favor?

691
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,166
What?

692
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,250
My phone.

693
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,166
No.

694
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,500
Do you remember your mission?

695
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,083
Good.

696
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,166
Mommy, can I get my phone?

697
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,416
So you can find me.

698
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,083
No, you already have your watch.

699
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,750
I can locate and call you anytime.

700
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,041
You don't need your phone.

701
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,250
You're always like that.

702
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,708
Yes?

703
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:18,958
Mommy, please.

704
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,291
No, you'll just play games on your phone.

705
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,666
I will not.

706
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,041
You see your friend, Jia Yao? Turn around.

707
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,041
Turn around.

708
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,250
You see your friend, Jia Yao?

709
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,833
Mommy, I see my friend.

710
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,000
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Love you.

711
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,666
She has the same watch as you.

712
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,458
She doesn't need her phone, does she?

713
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,583
Off you go.

714
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,000
Remember the mission I told you, yes?

715
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,416
I love you.

716
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,916
When you meet Jayden and the rest,

717
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,041
remember to discuss your scripts.

718
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,541
I will pick you up at 2 p.m.

719
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,375
Zi Hao, we're here!

720
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,875
I'm going.

721
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:56,791
Get back here.

722
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,250
What now, Mom?

723
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,750
Give me a kiss.

724
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,875
Mom, I'm grown.

725
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,041
And my friends are all here.

726
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,416
It's so awkward.

727
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Scram.

728
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,041
Okay, I will.

729
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,916
- What took you so long?
- We waited for ages.

730
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,041
Come, Jia Yao. This is for you.

731
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,833
Their cheese dip is a must-try.

732
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,666
Come, Jayden. This is for you.

733
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,875
You all must try their cheese dip.

734
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,583
Zi Hao, this is for you.

735
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,083
Thank you.

736
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,666
Zi Hao, how's your competition script?

737
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,875
I'm pretty slow at writing it.

738
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:33,875
Did you write it yourself?

739
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,833
Of course.

740
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:35,958
Didn't you?

741
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,000
Of course.

742
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,416
Zi Hao, show me your script.

743
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,083
Edit it for me. Thank you.

744
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,708
Jia Yao, why are you only
helping Zi Hao and not me?

745
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,083
It's not fair.

746
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,208
Top Student,

747
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,083
your English is so much better than mine.

748
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,208
Are you trying to be sarcastic?

749
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,291
No, your English isn't bad either.

750
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,250
Are you jealous?

751
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,541
Do you want a beating?

752
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,583
I wouldn't dare.

753
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,375
Jayden, have a look for him.

754
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,708
You've helped him every time.

755
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:02,958
Are you afraid of losing?

756
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,708
What's there to be scared of?

757
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,541
- How is it?
- How is it?

758
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,541
How is it?

759
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,958
It's okay. Not bad.

760
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,916
You can definitely get second place.

761
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,833
Why?

762
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,291
Because I am first.

763
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,750
It's okay.
We'll take first and second place.

764
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,541
I will just continue improving.

765
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,541
Tuck in.

766
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,166
Pass me the phone.

767
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:28,416
It can't be helped.

768
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:31,333
I have to take care of my son and husband.

769
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,583
I'll settle the bill for that table.

770
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,958
I'll leave my card with you.

771
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,708
Recently, my daughter…

772
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,333
You're here.

773
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,750
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Hello.

774
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:42,916
Gosh.

775
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,458
Such a sumptuous spread.

776
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,583
Is this pork ribs?

777
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,458
- <i>Bak kut teh</i>.
- <i>Bak kut teh</i>.

778
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,500
Let me tell you.
The specialty dishes in Singapore include

779
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,791
chili crab and Hainanese chicken rice.

780
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,125
And the bak kut teh here
is very special. Try it.

781
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,708
So delicious.

782
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,125
My husband would love this.

783
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,250
Your husband.

784
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,375
It's always about him.

785
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:12,500
I've prepared two packets
for you to send over to him.

786
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,458
When he drinks the soup,
he'll think of you for sure.

787
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,458
Thank you.

788
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,208
Forget your husband.

789
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:20,833
Your child scored well
in Weighted Assessment 1.

790
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,791
Many parents have asked me

791
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,375
how you achieve such rapid improvement.

792
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,791
Yes, can you teach us too?

793
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:26,833
We want to learn.

794
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,000
Share your tips.

795
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,458
Just like what she said,

796
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,583
a personal one-on-one monitoring.

797
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,250
Eat, drink, and sleep with them.

798
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,416
Strictly limit the usage
of electronic devices.

799
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,541
No game.

800
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,250
- No game.
- No game.

801
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,041
Did you teach him yourself?

802
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,750
- Yes.
- No tuition classes?

803
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,250
Yes. How could he
not be attending tuition?

804
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,833
Has he improved in English?

805
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,000
He has improved a lot.

806
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,333
I got him to memorize the dictionary.

807
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,000
And I signed him up

808
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,583
for the English speech competition.

809
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,500
It's very useful.

810
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,291
Memorizing the dictionary?

811
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,041
My dear, that's what we did 30 years ago.

812
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,250
And you're doing it now.

813
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,333
What do you mean?

814
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,375
Is there a better way?

815
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,583
Yes.

816
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:10,833
Have you heard of <i>Hally Peter</i>?

817
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,083
<i>Hally Peter</i>? No.

818
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,500
It is a very famous novel.

819
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:18,208
Look it up online.
Watch some short videos.

820
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,791
Some Primary 4 kids have it memorized.

821
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,583
Memorising a novel?

822
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,625
Yes.

823
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,958
Not only Primary 4,
but even Primary 1 students are doing it.

824
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,375
- Is it effective?
- Of course.

825
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,333
I was in the English stream, right?

826
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,958
Listen, when learning a language,

827
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:31,958
context is crucial.

828
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,708
No point in just memorizing words.

829
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,583
Stupid idea.

830
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:42,916
S-T-U-P-I-D I-D-E-A.

831
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
- Stupid--
- Son.

832
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,583
No need to memorize the dictionary.

833
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,083
What did you say?

834
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,833
No need to memorize the dictionary.

835
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,250
Are you serious?

836
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,875
Mom, I'm the only one in school
memorizing the dictionary.

837
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,333
You’ve finally come around!

838
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,250
Yes--

839
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,041
<i>Hally Peter</i>?

840
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,250
Is this for me to read?

841
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:05,916
To memorize.

842
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,083
Memorize?

843
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,708
Novels are for reading, not memorizing.

844
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:15,125
Son, I learned something new today.

845
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:18,750
All my friends are experts in education.

846
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,708
They told me

847
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,375
that the quickest way to improve English

848
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,083
is to memorize <i>Hally Peter</i>.

849
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,250
Even students back home
are great at memorizing it.

850
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,250
There are so many videos of them doing it.

851
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,416
From today onwards,

852
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,875
forget that and use this.

853
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,333
Memorize it fully.

854
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,791
Once you are done, I will record a video

855
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,083
and send it to your dad.

856
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,750
I'm sure he'll be so happy.

857
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,000
What attitude is that?

858
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,250
Hurry up.

859
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,708
Quick, time is money.

860
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:51,916
Start after your shower.

861
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,416
Whose dumb idea was it
to memorize such a thick dictionary?

862
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,208
Hello, are you not able
to answer a video call now?

863
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,916
I video-called you.

864
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
It's not convenient now.

865
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:14,416
What is it?

866
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,416
There's something I need to tell you.

867
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,583
Our kid's PSLE is coming up.

868
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,541
We won't be able to return
to Shanghai during the holidays.

869
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,041
I was thinking,

870
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,916
could you find time to come over?

871
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,083
He misses you a lot.

872
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,708
Do you think I have the time?

873
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,958
Can't you free some time up?

874
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,375
I can't.

875
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,666
He has had exemplary results recently.

876
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,750
You know he needs his dad's encouragement.

877
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,375
The landlord came
and said he wanted to raise the rent.

878
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,750
Is the lease ending?

879
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,750
You know
that he's taking his PSLE this year

880
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,500
and can't afford to move houses.

881
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,500
When you signed the lease,
why didn't you--

882
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,208
You were here at that time.

883
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:55,916
Did you forget?

884
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,416
You said once the lease is up,

885
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,250
you'll move us to a bigger house.

886
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,625
Cut to the chase.

887
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,541
How much is it?

888
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,166
Three thousand dollars.

889
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,333
What? That's daylight robbery.

890
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:06,583
Have you tried negotiating?

891
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,416
This is after negotiation.

892
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,083
That's a lot. I can't afford that much.

893
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,250
Cut your expenses.

894
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,000
At this rate, I'll run out of money.

895
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,458
Do you think it's for me?

896
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:17,583
It's for our child.

897
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,333
Hello.

898
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:21,833
Hello?

899
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,666
You're reading an English novel now?

900
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,041
What about your dictionary?

901
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,250
My mom wants me
to memorize <i>Hally Peter</i> now.

902
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,708
What the heck is she doing?

903
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:10,041
She's hopeless.

904
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:11,458
I can see that.

905
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,708
Let me tell you, this horrid…

906
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,458
<i>Hally Peter</i>.

907
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:19,291
You should set this Horrid Peter on fire

908
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,666
and drink the ashes.

909
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,291
That way, all the information

910
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,083
will be downloaded into your stomach.

911
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,083
And you don't have to memorize it anymore.

912
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,333
So funny, right?

913
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,291
Yes.

914
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,666
Why did your mom do that?

915
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,833
Every time my mom comes back
from meeting her friends,

916
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,125
it's as if she's gotten a secret manual.

917
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,291
She's as excited as if she were in heaven.

918
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,875
But for me, it's hell.

919
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:42,916
My goodness.

920
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Thankfully, she's not my mom.

921
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,291
Let me tell you.

922
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,291
Those are not your mom's good friends.

923
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,958
They are "pig and dog friends."

924
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,708
Pig and dog friends? What's that?

925
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,916
Bad friends.

926
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,791
They are out to make your life worse.

927
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,916
You're studying very hard.

928
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,083
Have you tried telling your mom?

929
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,708
I tried, but our communication
is a one-way street.

930
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:04,666
Did you speak English with her?
That's why she doesn't understand?

931
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,125
No, I spoke to her in Mandarin.

932
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,458
Perfect Mandarin.

933
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,541
Why can't you communicate with her then?

934
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,291
Jayden, come join us.

935
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,791
Jayden, join us.

936
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,291
Jayden!

937
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,833
Our recent communication with him
has also been one-sided.

938
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,083
Yes, why is that?

939
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,458
How would I know? Why is that?

940
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,791
How would I know? Why is that?

941
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,708
I wouldn't know either.

942
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,916
"If you're not capable,
you'll fail in the job you're in.

943
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,125
Failing one job
means failing all other jobs.

944
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,083
Failing all other jobs
means failing every job."

945
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,875
Any volunteers?

946
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,708
Jayden, give it a go.

947
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,958
"If you're capable,
you'll flourish in any job."

948
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,333
Finish it.

949
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,416
"If you're capable,
you'll flourish in any job.

950
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,916
Good at being good means very good.

951
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,208
Very good means any job is good.

952
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,375
If you're not a job…"

953
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,791
That's enough. Stop laughing.

954
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,125
Take a seat.

955
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,208
Take a seat.

956
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,166
You give it a go.

957
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,333
"If you're capable,
you'll flourish in any job.

958
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,958
Good at one job means good at any job.

959
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,333
Good at any job means good at anything.

960
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,791
If you're not capable,
you'll fail in the job you're in.

961
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,208
Failing one job
means failing all other jobs.

962
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,583
Failing all other jobs
means failing every job."

963
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,375
Okay, please be quiet.

964
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,041
Although you did well,

965
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:10,166
you were reading
an English novel in class.

966
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,166
That shows that you're disrespecting me.

967
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,125
A Chinese novel won't do too.

968
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,416
I will hold on to this book for you.

969
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,708
Your mom can collect it later.

970
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:18,916
I'm not reading a novel.

971
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,750
Is <i>Hally Peter</i> not a novel?

972
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,541
I need to memorize
this chapter of <i>Hally Peter</i>.

973
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:24,750
So have you memorized it?

974
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,958
Recite it for the class.

975
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,958
"As he crept into the library,

976
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,083
his heartbeat echoed
the ticking of the grandpa clock.

977
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,166
Standing sentry at the entrance…

978
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,250
Magic was potent here.

979
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,541
…crackling in the air,

980
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,375
making the hairs on his
neck stand on end."

981
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,083
What's wrong with Jayden?

982
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,541
What is he so upset about?

983
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,750
I don't know when he became like that.

984
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,458
Forget him.

985
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,375
I have something awesome for you.

986
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,875
Awesome stuff.

987
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,833
- Thank you.
- Here, enjoy your meal.

988
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,000
Get ready to start mixing.

989
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:37,916
Go.

990
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,041
One, two, three.

991
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,291
It's good.

992
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:50,208
It's so delicious.

993
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,666
Zi Hao, you've been in Singapore
for so long.

994
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,541
Have you tried our other local delicacies?

995
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,041
I have not.

996
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,333
What delicacies are there?

997
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,416
- There's a lot.
- There's a lot.

998
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,583
Listen up.

999
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,166
<i>Lontong, chwee kueh, char kway teow</i>.

1000
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,833
<i>Nasi lemak</i>, stir-fried noodles.

1001
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,458
Rice noodle roll and <i>bak kut teh</i>.

1002
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,333
<i>Laksa, rojak,</i> chili crab.

1003
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,291
And of course, Hainanese chicken rice.

1004
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,125
I need to share it with my mom next time.

1005
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:12,875
Wang Zi Hao!

1006
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,041
Oh my God. Your mom is omnipotent.

1007
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,416
It's omnipresent.

1008
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,833
More like she's haunting me.

1009
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:19,958
What's haunting you?

1010
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,958
We were planning our next meeting

1011
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:25,875
at our usual haunt.

1012
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,333
Really?

1013
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,916
Did you forget
that you have English tuition today?

1014
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,541
And yet you're having noodles here?

1015
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,208
It's very nice. Do you want some?

1016
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,458
Do I look like I want to have noodles?

1017
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,458
I thought it would be quick
since it's next door.

1018
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,250
Aunty.

1019
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,166
I think Zi Hao doesn't need tuition.

1020
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,166
His English is already super good.

1021
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,916
You know in school today,

1022
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,791
he recited a full paragraph
of <i>Hally Peter</i>.

1023
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,125
- It was so impressive.
- Yes.

1024
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,166
Really?

1025
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,375
Don't you have
supplementary classes today?

1026
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,750
Their supplements
are through this nourishing soup.

1027
00:43:58,833 --> 00:43:59,875
My treat.

1028
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,625
Hi, Andy's mom.

1029
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,541
I don't want to let our fatty
be too stressed.

1030
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,250
Just has to pass his exams, right?

1031
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,750
Kids deserve a happy childhood.

1032
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,666
Totally true.

1033
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,791
Right, Fatty.

1034
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,250
Do you want to invite Zi Hao
to your birthday party?

1035
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,458
Yes. Zi Hao, can you come?

1036
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,000
Of course.

1037
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,375
Who said you could go? Did I agree to it?

1038
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,708
You can tell
just from looking at that Andy.

1039
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,916
He lacks ambition
and is happy with just a pass.

1040
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,416
Look at his mom.

1041
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,875
She doesn't care about his results.

1042
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,250
For your own good,

1043
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,500
cherish your life and stay away from Andy.

1044
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,125
Don't let his dislike for studying

1045
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,666
infect you.

1046
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,625
Or all your efforts will go to waste.

1047
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,125
If it reaches that point,

1048
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,625
I can't save you.

1049
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,875
Understand?

1050
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,875
Also, there is no way
I'm letting you attend it.

1051
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,416
So don't come begging.

1052
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,541
Son, did you get the address right?

1053
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,000
I remembered correctly.

1054
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:18,166
Sir, can I check
if this is the correct address?

1055
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,291
Yes, it's the address you gave.

1056
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,333
You don't believe this is Fatty's house?

1057
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:26,958
No, but they sell noodles.

1058
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,041
How could noodle sellers afford
such a huge mansion in Singapore?

1059
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,666
Pretty lady, it's possible.

1060
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,791
Not just Singaporeans but anyone can.

1061
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,333
My time is coming too.

1062
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,291
Hello, put down 100 on big
and 100 on small for me.

1063
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,333
I can feel it today.

1064
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,666
Mom, why don't I quit studying?

1065
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,833
I'll sell Shanghai wonton noodles instead.

1066
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,375
And we might just be able
to afford this house.

1067
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,750
Wait for me.

1068
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,875
This is so lavish.

1069
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,916
Mom, they are my gaming friends.

1070
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,125
Please explain to them.

1071
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,541
I still want to befriend them.

1072
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:04,666
Get back here.

1073
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,041
Greet the owner first.

1074
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,791
When did you become so rude?

1075
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:08,750
Let's go.

1076
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,458
Very good performance.

1077
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,583
That's my child.

1078
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

1079
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,250
- Hi, we meet again.
- Hello.

1080
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,500
Andy's house is so gorgeous and large.

1081
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,666
But

1082
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,666
aren't they fishball noodle sellers?

1083
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,708
Yes, they are.

1084
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,916
They have many outlets too.

1085
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,083
- I should have done the same.
- Me too.

1086
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:58,041
So they started from scratch?

1087
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,916
Yes, we did.

1088
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,291
Welcome to my house.

1089
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,500
Thanks for the invite.

1090
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,041
Your fishball noodle business
is so successful.

1091
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,583
Fatty's mom,
do you have a few dozen outlets?

1092
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:12,708
No, probably a few hundred outlets
in Singapore and Malaysia.

1093
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,958
A few hundred?

1094
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,458
Gosh, what's your secret to success?

1095
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,416
We have none.

1096
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,291
I grew up in the village

1097
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,666
and knew nothing
but how to make fishball noodles.

1098
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,000
We started with a stall.

1099
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,791
Then we entered shopping malls.

1100
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,666
Our business has expanded now.

1101
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,625
Like including pastries,
food courts, and fried chicken.

1102
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,166
I'm curious to know.

1103
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,083
With your success,

1104
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,250
which university did you graduate from?

1105
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,208
University?

1106
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,041
I didn't even graduate from Primary 6.

1107
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,666
Thankfully, my grandpa left behind

1108
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,333
his fishball noodle recipe

1109
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:50,375
which worked well with my talent.

1110
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:52,208
And I was lucky enough to earn some money.

1111
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,125
So I continued.

1112
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,750
You're so lucky to have this talent.

1113
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,000
I think we're just like a computer.

1114
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,583
When we are born,

1115
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,375
we're all pre-programmed with an app.

1116
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,458
The one in my husband

1117
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,791
is definitely for making fishball noodles.

1118
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,541
So he took to making fishball noodles
like a duck to water.

1119
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,416
That is my youngest son.

1120
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,625
I got it.

1121
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,250
Your youngest son
has got the music app installed.

1122
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,291
By that logic, our children
already have an app installed.

1123
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,291
Then why do we still force them to study?

1124
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,666
But if we don't,
how would we know what their app is?

1125
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,916
And if this person has more than one app,

1126
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,916
what do we do?

1127
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,250
Well, that's why you need
to push your children

1128
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,750
in order to find out
which one is the best app.

1129
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:49,833
I agree.

1130
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:52,000
- Hello.
- Hello, Sophia.

1131
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,125
Uncle, Aunty.

1132
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:54,541
This is Fatty's gift.

1133
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,708
Where is he?

1134
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,125
- Over here.
- He's there.

1135
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,750
Fatty, this is your gift.

1136
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,250
Happy birthday.

1137
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,833
Thank you.

1138
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,416
This is for you.

1139
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,166
Thank you.

1140
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,500
Thank you.

1141
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:13,750
Let's go.

1142
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,125
Let me introduce you.

1143
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,458
This is our company's senior management.

1144
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,750
He graduated from Harvard University.

1145
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,875
That's right because I am uneducated.

1146
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,500
So I hired someone well-educated

1147
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,125
to help manage the company.

1148
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,916
So the state of society now

1149
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,125
is the well-educated
working for the uneducated.

1150
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,041
See? No studying is required.

1151
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,083
Do you see that?

1152
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,500
You can't say that.

1153
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:39,291
Those who are even more highly educated

1154
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,291
own even bigger companies.

1155
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,375
Yes, you need to know

1156
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:46,041
not many people
are as lucky as Andy's dad.

1157
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,958
To me, paper qualifications
are the best assurance.

1158
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,916
That's right.

1159
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,458
All right, let's give him a big one.

1160
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,000
This is disgusting.

1161
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,666
It's going to stink. I can smell it.

1162
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,208
Zi Hao, once you drink this,

1163
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,000
all our problems will be resolved.

1164
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,333
- Come.
- What is it?

1165
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,208
Just drink. it's very nice.

1166
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:12,958
It's a spiced-up drink, right?

1167
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,541
A little bit.

1168
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,208
When Zi Hao played games with you,

1169
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:20,125
it was Aunty's fault that he went offline

1170
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,666
and caused you to lose your equipment.

1171
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,166
Today, I will finish this
to punish myself.

1172
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,833
But can we make a deal?

1173
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,708
If I finish this,

1174
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,916
all of you let bygones be bygones.

1175
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,791
And from now till PSLE,

1176
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,625
do not play games with him, okay?

1177
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:40,791
Aunty, stop.

1178
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,041
It's okay.

1179
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,375
No problem.

1180
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,375
Mom, don't drink it!

1181
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:58,458
Deal?

1182
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,750
- Deal.
- Deal.

1183
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,875
Thank you.

1184
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,958
Let's go.

1185
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,166
See you.

1186
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,000
Don't worry. I'm fine.

1187
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:38,875
Mom.

1188
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,125
Thank you, Mom.

1189
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,708
Are you okay?

1190
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,916
I'm just fine.

1191
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,833
I just want to say

1192
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,708
I didn't know you spent so much money

1193
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,458
just to get the equipment in the game.

1194
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,541
I would like to apologize for that, okay?

1195
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:57,916
Did you use the money I gave you
to buy in-game items?

1196
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,333
Not with that minuscule amount you gave.

1197
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,291
Even better.

1198
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,791
Hello, pretty lady. You're finally back.

1199
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:12,916
Let me ask you again.

1200
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,083
Are you still renting this house?

1201
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes, of course.

1202
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:19,750
Landlord, the increase in rent
is so drastic.

1203
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,875
We're not quite able to afford it.

1204
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:23,250
Can we--

1205
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,500
Ma'am, at this price,

1206
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:28,541
other agents would be after my life
if they learned about it.

1207
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,833
It is already very cheap.

1208
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,166
We can't rent at this price of yours.

1209
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,250
You finally said it.

1210
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,625
Looks like we're done here.

1211
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,583
Landlord, let's talk.

1212
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,583
Just give us three months.

1213
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:42,250
Once my son is done with his PSLE,

1214
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,666
we'll move out instantly. Okay?

1215
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,458
Three months?

1216
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,333
The rental is my source of income.

1217
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,666
What am I supposed to do for three months?

1218
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,833
Do me this favor.

1219
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:52,833
My son is still studying. Please.

1220
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:53,875
Do me a favor too.

1221
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:54,958
Last reminder.

1222
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,416
- You have two options to hurry.
- What?

1223
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,958
Hurry and pay the rent
or hurry and move out.

1224
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:06,708
Why not ask Dad to send more money over?

1225
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,791
Don't bother about that.

1226
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:13,666
Mom, are you all right?

1227
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,833
It's coming out.

1228
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,416
Close the door.

1229
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,291
You take a shower.

1230
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,791
I'm in favor of removing examinations.

1231
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,750
Having examinations…

1232
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,166
will also cause
unnecessary competition among students.

1233
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,208
Our parents will always be asking

1234
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,833
how we did on our exams.

1235
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:45,208
Therefore, I think
examinations are redundant.

1236
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:48,166
No more examinations in primary school.

1237
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,708
Examinations are actually good.

1238
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:57,250
It keeps students on their toes
and focuses on their work.

1239
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,833
So I do not agree with people

1240
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,708
who said that
we should remove examinations.

1241
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,500
Good afternoon, everyone.

1242
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:07,000
I believe that exam results
are definitely helpful

1243
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:10,000
in assessing a student's progress.

1244
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:13,500
While some may find
this perspective a little extreme,

1245
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,208
in today's world,
quantitative standards have become

1246
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,750
an important representation
of modern society.

1247
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:25,125
Although scores
can't completely measure a person's value,

1248
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:29,250
as of now,
there's no other method that we can know

1249
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,625
how much a student has absorbed

1250
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,458
and whether they are able
to apply what they've learned.

1251
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,708
If not for exams,

1252
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,333
in what other ways can we prove

1253
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:42,375
who is the most outstanding?

1254
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:43,833
Thank you.

1255
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,708
Actually, exams are just one of the ways

1256
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,250
to test a student's ability.

1257
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,250
Some students are better at hands-on

1258
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:55,041
while some are better
at creative activities.

1259
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,375
It is unfair to use exams

1260
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,333
to measure everyone's ability.

1261
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:02,166
Therefore, I think
we should use different methods

1262
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,625
to assess students' abilities.

1263
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:05,791
Thank you.

1264
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,083
Mom, are we staying here from now on?

1265
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:36,625
The room is so small
and there's only one bed.

1266
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,916
Did you not see
the hidden feature of the bed?

1267
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,125
See that? It's a double-layer bed.

1268
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:45,083
You can sleep next to me in the future.

1269
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:47,166
How long has it been
since we slept together?

1270
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,333
Also, do you know why you were shortlisted

1271
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:51,583
for the English speech competition?

1272
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,416
- Why?
- Because the feng shui here is good.

1273
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,458
The moment we moved houses,
you were shortlisted.

1274
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,583
You can't find such feng shui anywhere.

1275
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:01,083
Why don't we move back to Shanghai?

1276
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,541
The house there is much bigger.

1277
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,791
Does Dad not want us anymore?

1278
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,333
Who said that?

1279
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,333
Who said that he doesn't want us anymore?

1280
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,458
No one.

1281
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,458
Then why are you overthinking?

1282
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:14,750
Remember.

1283
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,208
You are the most important to your dad.

1284
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,708
He will never ever abandon you.

1285
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:22,875
Don't overthink, your little head.

1286
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:24,041
Does he really want us?

1287
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,458
Yes, of course he does.

1288
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,625
Okay?

1289
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,750
We have a beautifully decorated washroom.

1290
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,083
Come take a look later.

1291
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:46,041
AFTER CONSIDERATION, I FEEL THAT
WE HAVE IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES

1292
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,958
NO POINT HOLDING ON, LET'S GET A DIVORCE

1293
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,625
TAKE THE CHILD, HE'S CLOSER TO YOU

1294
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

1295
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,541
welcome to Yuzher Primary School's

1296
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,083
English Speech Competition.

1297
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,208
This is a really challenging competition

1298
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,541
as our topics will be chosen at random.

1299
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:47,625
Now, let us give our judges
a warm round of applause.

1300
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,875
Let's welcome
our first contestant, Indina.

1301
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,250
And your topic is…

1302
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,833
"My Mother."

1303
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,333
A warm round of applause.

1304
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,708
Mothers are like
the superstars of our lives.

1305
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:16,500
They love us more than anyone
and anything in the world.

1306
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,750
Their sacrifice is unconditional.

1307
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,625
And nothing is expected in return.

1308
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,625
They celebrate our victories

1309
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,958
no matter how big or how small

1310
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,916
and always make us feel special.

1311
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,208
Mothers demonstrate great strength.

1312
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:31,791
My ambition is to become a teacher.

1313
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,125
I think being a teacher is not easy.

1314
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,083
Mothers are the best.

1315
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,041
They are like superheroes without capes.

1316
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,750
This is the type of love that inspires us

1317
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:42,500
to become our better selves.

1318
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,375
This is the type of love

1319
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:47,000
that helps us overcome every challenge,

1320
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:50,500
every obstacle, and every hardship.

1321
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:54,375
This love is like a gift
and this gift is special.

1322
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:58,166
Because this is a gift
nobody can take away from them.

1323
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,958
Let's welcome
our next contestant, Jayden Lee.

1324
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,041
A warm round of applause.

1325
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,000
Gosh, again.

1326
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:21,916
"My mother."

1327
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,625
Excuse me, teacher.

1328
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:33,791
Can I choose my own topic?

1329
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,416
I'm sorry, you cannot.

1330
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:44,083
My mom is a great mom.

1331
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,291
She loves me a lot.

1332
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,791
And she…

1333
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,125
She loves me a lot.

1334
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:55,125
She also asks our helper

1335
00:59:55,208 --> 01:00:00,583
to cook many delicious meals for me.

1336
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,958
And she…

1337
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,583
She always asks our helper

1338
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:11,250
to cook many delicious
and expensive meals for me.

1339
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:14,875
And she…

1340
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,125
She…

1341
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:24,583
And she always buys
many expensive shoes for me to wear.

1342
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,750
And…

1343
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:29,958
She…

1344
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,125
Perhaps you can share more on

1345
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,625
how you feel
about your relationship with your mother.

1346
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,083
She…

1347
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:45,875
- Jayden!
- Jayden!

1348
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:50,666
- Jayden!
- Jayden!

1349
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:56,208
- Jayden!
- Jayden!

1350
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,083
Gosh, again.

1351
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,500
"My Mother."

1352
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,375
A big round of applause.

1353
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:20,708
Last year, my mother worked very hard

1354
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:26,125
so that I could come to Singapore
to study in Primary 5.

1355
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,458
At first,

1356
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:31,875
I hated her for sending me here.

1357
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:36,750
<i>Taking me away from my close friends,</i>

1358
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:39,000
<i>my classmates,</i>

1359
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:41,458
<i>and a lot of hometown food.</i>

1360
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,208
After many things,

1361
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:47,416
I saw her love for me.

1362
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,958
And it's beyond my imagination.

1363
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:51,375
Once,

1364
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,666
my friends forced me
to drink chili and wasabi.

1365
01:01:56,208 --> 01:02:00,166
My mother found out
and she drank it for me.

1366
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:08,708
My mother gave up her high-paying job

1367
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,125
to come and be with me.

1368
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:14,375
Over here, she doesn't have a job.

1369
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:19,958
And our expenses are dependent on my dad.

1370
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:23,791
But lately, something happened.

1371
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:29,500
I think my dad doesn't want us anymore.

1372
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:37,916
My mother hid it from me

1373
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:44,500
because she didn't want it to affect me.

1374
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:50,250
I don't know why but I guess,

1375
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,500
I'm not good enough.

1376
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,375
I will work harder

1377
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:03,958
and hope that my dad will see my value

1378
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,833
and come back to us.

1379
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:12,083
I hope this will make my mother happy.

1380
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,750
I love you, Mother.

1381
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,916
Thank you.

1382
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,291
See? This is the burger you wanted, right?

1383
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,750
Mommy kept her promise to you.

1384
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:49,708
Try it.

1385
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,333
Such a big bite.

1386
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,250
Dear, come and see the way he's eating.

1387
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,916
Gosh.

1388
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,500
Is this his reward?

1389
01:03:58,791 --> 01:03:59,625
Good job.

1390
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,375
Hey, the whole burger is yours.

1391
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,791
Eat slowly, okay?

1392
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:04,791
Well done.

1393
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,833
What did you say about me
during your speech contest?

1394
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,958
Where's the medal?

1395
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:18,333
Trying to surprise me, right?

1396
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,083
Okay, where is it?

1397
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,375
Where's the medal?

1398
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,291
Where's the medal?

1399
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,416
Swallow your food first.

1400
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,583
I…

1401
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:55,583
I…

1402
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,375
I didn't win.

1403
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,000
You didn't win?

1404
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,666
Why are you eating then?

1405
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,625
What happened?

1406
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:13,666
He didn't win.

1407
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:19,208
He tried his best.

1408
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,500
It's okay.

1409
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,208
What about that Zi Hao?

1410
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,666
How did he place?

1411
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:31,625
Fifth place.

1412
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,666
He should've been in ninth place.

1413
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:35,583
And you?

1414
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,458
Ninth place.

1415
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,625
How many contestants?

1416
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,583
Nine.

1417
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,208
Is it that hard to talk about me?

1418
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,875
I can only recite from memory.

1419
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,083
If Dad had written a script for me,

1420
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,458
I would have recited it.

1421
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:01,125
I would have gotten first place.

1422
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,708
Do you need a script
to talk about your mother?

1423
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,708
I have so many good memories with you.

1424
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,333
After all that I've done for you,

1425
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:24,791
and you can't…

1426
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:46,958
Maybe what?

1427
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,833
He just doesn't know
what you want from him.

1428
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:50,250
What do you mean? I don't know.

1429
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,500
I don't know
what you want from this marriage.

1430
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:55,083
I don't know. I have never, ever known

1431
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:57,041
what you want from this marriage.

1432
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,625
So I know what I want.

1433
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:00,208
I want that divorce.

1434
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,000
You suggested it. I'm taking it.

1435
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,458
- Let's just get the divorce.
- Is that the only way

1436
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,541
- we can solve this?
- Yes, that's the only way

1437
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:05,500
we can solve this.

1438
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,916
Let's go and get a divorce.

1439
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,416
All right, class. Eyes on me.

1440
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,416
- Eyes on you.
- Eyes on you.

1441
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,000
Your math test is next week.

1442
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,375
Are you guys ready for it?

1443
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

1444
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,708
I want all of you
to achieve a special result.

1445
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,750
- What?
- What?

1446
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,750
100% passing rate.

1447
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,333
Teacher, if 100% of our class passes,

1448
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:28,333
what is our reward?

1449
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,333
Reward?

1450
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,500
Aren't you guys supposed
to do it for yourselves?

1451
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:36,125
Mr. Lee should follow us to swimming.

1452
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,625
Swimming?

1453
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:39,708
Why swimming?

1454
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:42,625
Everyone, look. Mr. Lee's swimming photo!

1455
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,083
Class, sit down.

1456
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:50,625
Go back to your seats.

1457
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,708
Pass me the photo.

1458
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,166
Go back to your seats, guys.

1459
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,708
Hey.

1460
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,958
How did you get this photo?

1461
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,708
- Social media.
- Social media.

1462
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,083
Social media.

1463
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,333
Okay, fine.

1464
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,791
I'll go swimming with all of you.

1465
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,875
- Yes!
- Yes!

1466
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,625
But every single one of you, okay?

1467
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:14,125
Every single one will have
to pass your math exam.

1468
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,583
- Okay!
- Okay!

1469
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:16,583
Promise?

1470
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,083
- Promise!
- Promise!

1471
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,708
All right, class.
Get into your groups now.

1472
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,291
I heard you promised
to take the students swimming.

1473
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,208
I told them I'd bring them
if everyone passed.

1474
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,666
Do you think it's possible?

1475
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,625
We'll see.

1476
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:42,041
But at least it will motivate them, right?

1477
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,208
When Wen Ting comes,
don't talk about the divorce.

1478
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,250
What?

1479
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,375
All of a sudden?

1480
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,125
- They seemed so blissful.
- It's so sudden.

1481
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,833
It's no surprise.
They've had marital issues for a while.

1482
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:05,125
That's why she brought
her son to Singapore

1483
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,583
to give her husband some space

1484
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:08,208
and try to save the marriage.

1485
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:11,083
Now, her husband not only wants a divorce,

1486
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,833
but he's also dumping them here

1487
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,083
and turning his back
without paying a cent.

1488
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:17,041
- My goodness.
- What can we do?

1489
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,041
What a person he is.

1490
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,958
Should we think of something
to help her out?

1491
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:21,583
It must have been tough on them.

1492
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:23,250
We have to help.

1493
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,958
What was Wen Ting's job in China?

1494
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,083
Accountant.

1495
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,166
Accountant? Good.

1496
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,083
That's good.

1497
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,583
Wen Ting.

1498
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,625
Have a seat.

1499
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,583
- Sit.
- You look nice today.

1500
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,958
I heard you were
an accountant in China, right?

1501
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:39,750
They are well-regarded in Singapore too.

1502
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:42,375
Speaking of, I have a friend who's looking

1503
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,833
for an accountant.

1504
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:46,208
But he hasn't found a suitable candidate.

1505
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:47,583
Why don't I introduce you?

1506
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:48,666
You can do his accounts.

1507
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,125
Thank you.

1508
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:54,083
But I don't think I can work on this visa.

1509
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,708
I will be deported if I get found out.

1510
01:09:56,791 --> 01:10:00,208
You can get paid through necessities
instead of money.

1511
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,291
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1512
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:04,583
Relax.

1513
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,833
A lot of people are doing it.

1514
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:12,375
Getting necessities as compensation
is also probably prohibited.

1515
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,041
Sophia.

1516
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:16,083
These are the test papers you wanted.

1517
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:18,541
It's a whole ten years' worth
of PSLE exam papers.

1518
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:21,208
It's okay. If your friend needs help,

1519
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:22,625
I can do it for free.

1520
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:25,166
You are too careful, Wen Ting.

1521
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,208
She is right to do that.

1522
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,458
If anything happens here,

1523
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:29,708
she'd have nowhere else to go.

1524
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:31,750
I know.

1525
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,500
- I'm going.
- Hold on.

1526
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:37,625
Do you know that woman?

1527
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,833
Wen Ting? I do.

1528
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:41,208
She's a friend of a friend.

1529
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:43,958
She has
some financial difficulties lately.

1530
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:45,833
So she is looking for a job.

1531
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:46,958
Has she found one?

1532
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,083
Probably.

1533
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:50,833
There are so many people trying to help.

1534
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,333
I'll take my leave now.

1535
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,541
Keep in touch.

1536
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:04,041
Hi, I'm home.

1537
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,291
Sorry, it was a busy day.

1538
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:09,833
Maria, coffee.

1539
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:10,750
Yes, sir.

1540
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,041
Let me ask you.

1541
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,875
Are those study mamas

1542
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,625
not allowed to get a job here?

1543
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:20,583
Not in the first year.

1544
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:23,083
But they can in the second year.

1545
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,916
As long as the company
applies for the permit,

1546
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,416
they will be allowed to work.

1547
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:29,625
Why do you ask?

1548
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,333
I saw Zi Hao's mom at a café today.

1549
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:34,583
She seemed to be looking for a job.

1550
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,958
Actually, she's a study mama.

1551
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,375
Also, Singapore is an expensive city.

1552
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:43,208
Trying to earn some extra cash
is no big deal.

1553
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,083
As long as she's not doing it
out in the open,

1554
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,625
I think that's fine.

1555
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,875
You sure know how to take pity on others.

1556
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:50,083
What about me?

1557
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,833
I am talking to you.

1558
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,333
What are you talking about?

1559
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,750
I always offer help
yet you never accept it.

1560
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,000
Really?

1561
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:00,916
If I did, your mom would say
I don't know how to raise my son.

1562
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,250
- Why did you get my mom involved?
- And I'm an incompetent woman.

1563
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:06,291
She tells me
that I am an incompetent mother.

1564
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:07,250
I am just tired.

1565
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,750
I'm tired of always being the only one

1566
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,333
- in charge of this entire household.
- Stop.

1567
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,750
Stop what?

1568
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,625
Can you please just help out
in the family?

1569
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,916
- If you do, I'll very gladly stop.
- Stop, please.

1570
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,541
Stop, we are both tired.

1571
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,666
And I don't know
how to communicate with you anymore.

1572
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,000
I do think that
I'm a lot more tired than you,

1573
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,791
given all the responsibilities.

1574
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,083
Why are you walking--

1575
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,791
You call yourself a lawyer?

1576
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:29,375
Jayden.

1577
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:31,541
Come back, please.

1578
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:34,583
Sit down.

1579
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:41,208
I have been busy
and didn't have time for you.

1580
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:44,625
That's why your results
have fallen below Zi Hao's.

1581
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:45,833
You've lost five times.

1582
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,500
Will you keep on losing?

1583
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,041
I'll do my revision.

1584
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:51,791
Will you lose again?

1585
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,000
Will you be number one?

1586
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,708
Good. I don't care how you do it.

1587
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,750
Just make sure that you do it, understand?

1588
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,333
<i>The number you called
is currently unavailable.</i>

1589
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,958
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1590
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,416
<i>The number you called
is currently unavailable.</i>

1591
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,625
Ladies and gentlemen.

1592
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:54,000
Today is your first preliminary exam.

1593
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,583
I know you've been working hard.

1594
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:57,000
Don't be stressed. Just do your best.

1595
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:02,958
Cheating is a very serious offense,
let me remind you again.

1596
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:04,666
If you have any questions,

1597
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,833
please do raise your hands.

1598
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,625
The duration of the exam is 50 minutes.

1599
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,958
And the time right now is 8 a.m.

1600
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:12,208
You may begin now.

1601
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,333
Focus, please.

1602
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,791
I don't know. This isn't mine.

1603
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:20,500
Teacher, that slip of paper
really isn't mine.

1604
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:22,291
I know.

1605
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,333
Science is very stressful for you,

1606
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:26,708
especially since your mom
cares a lot about your grades.

1607
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:29,375
But this is not the right way.

1608
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,083
Mr. Lim, it's not me.

1609
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,500
That paper isn't mine.

1610
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,583
When things happen,

1611
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:37,000
it's very easy to say that it's not me.

1612
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:40,041
Sorry, but I have to inform your parents.

1613
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,916
Mr. Lim.

1614
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,791
Let me handle it.

1615
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,250
Your model student cheated.

1616
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:56,083
Zi Hao, tell me.

1617
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:57,958
Why did you cheat?

1618
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,291
Teacher, I did not cheat.

1619
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:04,333
Do you not know why this slip of paper

1620
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:05,875
was in your pencil case?

1621
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,541
Yes, I don't know why.

1622
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:12,958
I know you have your own reasons.

1623
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:16,000
So you need to tell me.

1624
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,250
Otherwise, your mom would be devastated.

1625
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,333
Please don't let my mom know.

1626
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,708
She has been very sad lately.

1627
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:27,833
I don't want to cause her more sadness.

1628
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,208
What happened?

1629
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,833
My dad doesn't want us anymore.

1630
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,791
You'll be okay.

1631
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,916
Zi Hao, did you write this?

1632
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:05,791
The words are so small.
I can't find the keywords.

1633
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:08,500
You see?

1634
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,833
I need to highlight to see the keywords.

1635
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:15,333
Otherwise, the words would fly around.

1636
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:16,958
They fly?

1637
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,250
Isn't it the same for all of you?

1638
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,041
Okay.

1639
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:28,625
I will admit it if I have to.

1640
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:31,041
But please don't tell my mom, okay?

1641
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:35,125
All right.

1642
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,750
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1643
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,458
Come, let me tell you. Words can fly?

1644
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:45,500
What rubbish.

1645
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,458
He admitted, right?

1646
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:49,083
- The truth won't escape me.
- He didn't write this.

1647
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,583
The handwriting is totally different
and he can't read it.

1648
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,500
Is that so?

1649
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:55,000
Mr. Lim, can you work with me
to find out who wrote this?

1650
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,333
This.

1651
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,500
This should be it.

1652
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:22,708
I think so too.

1653
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,333
- Yes, definitely.
- This is the one.

1654
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,916
Did you write this slip of paper?

1655
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:32,750
No, I did not write that.

1656
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,708
Can you rewrite whatever is on the paper?

1657
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:16,916
I wrote this but I did not plant it.

1658
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,125
Why did you do that, Rachel?

1659
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:22,875
Are you jealous of Zi Hao's grades?

1660
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,500
Why should I be jealous of Zi Hao?

1661
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:28,500
When compared to his, my results

1662
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:31,125
are the difference between night and day.

1663
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:33,250
Why should I be jealous?

1664
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:34,625
Okay.

1665
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:35,916
So who told you to do this?

1666
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,750
It's…

1667
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:41,541
Don't be afraid and just tell us.

1668
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,125
If I do so,

1669
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,041
my life might be in danger.

1670
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,750
Seriously?

1671
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,291
Have you watched too many dramas

1672
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,875
and are afraid of him taking revenge?

1673
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,416
No.

1674
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:54,875
But I don't want him to hate me.

1675
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,083
- Why?
- Why?

1676
01:19:57,958 --> 01:20:00,375
Because I like him.

1677
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:03,541
I see.

1678
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,791
Man, your student.

1679
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,625
It's not romantic.

1680
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,250
It's purely platonic.

1681
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:13,250
Friendship.

1682
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:16,291
Okay, why are you helping him then?

1683
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:18,500
My results have always been poor.

1684
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:21,333
And my family can't afford tuition.

1685
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,291
Jayden has helped me time and time again.

1686
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:27,500
So I was willing to do him this favor.

1687
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,375
- So it's Jayden?
- Jayden?

1688
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,125
Oh no…

1689
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,791
Jayden must hate me now.

1690
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,125
Please keep it a secret for me.

1691
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:39,291
Please.

1692
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:44,458
Summoning Jayden…

1693
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,791
It's not me, Mr. Lee. Not me.

1694
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,875
Jayden, we already have evidence

1695
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,375
that you're the one who did it.

1696
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:51,750
Just tell us.

1697
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,208
Let us know why you did it.

1698
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:54,791
Be a man.

1699
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,750
If you did it, you'd better own up.

1700
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,708
Sabotaging others is a very bad thing.

1701
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:02,125
Jayden, tell us.

1702
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,833
So we can understand what happened.

1703
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,750
Just tell us. Don't worry, okay?

1704
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,625
My mom forced me.

1705
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,625
I can't lose to him again.

1706
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:27,166
If I lose to Zi Hao again,

1707
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,375
I'll be beaten and scolded by her.

1708
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:30,291
You are a liar!

1709
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,041
Why did you lie to me?

1710
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,291
I had no other way to win him.

1711
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,375
I was left with no choice
but to sabotage him.

1712
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:50,458
How does your mom beat you?

1713
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:53,208
Sometimes bare-handed
and sometimes with a cane.

1714
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:55,000
Every time you promise me…

1715
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,041
You promised!

1716
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:57,375
You'll be the death of me!

1717
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,791
What I fear most is her verbal abuse.

1718
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:00,750
What did she say?

1719
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,000
She said

1720
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,708
she regrets giving birth to me.

1721
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:12,166
She calls me stupid.

1722
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,833
She calls me useless.

1723
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:14,916
She says…

1724
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,916
Other than scolding and caning you,

1725
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,666
has she used a wooden pole
to hit you anywhere?

1726
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:20,875
Like your head?

1727
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:22,666
No.

1728
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,750
The abuse from your mother.

1729
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,166
Have you told anyone?

1730
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,250
No.

1731
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:31,291
She told me not to tell anyone.

1732
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,500
As it is for my own good.

1733
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,666
But if it is for my own good,

1734
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,500
why am I in so much pain?

1735
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,041
I don't understand.

1736
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,333
I'm so confused.

1737
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,166
Is that why in the speech competition,

1738
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,500
you were unable to talk about your mom?

1739
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:56,375
I don't know what I could talk about.

1740
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:59,666
I didn't know what could be said.

1741
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,458
But I didn't want to tell a lie.

1742
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,750
Teacher,

1743
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,250
if you hate someone to the core,

1744
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,750
could you bring yourself
to say you love them?

1745
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,250
Is she your biological mom?

1746
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,166
Mr. Lim.

1747
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,875
I have to make sure. It matters.

1748
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,833
Yes, she is.

1749
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,125
I love you.

1750
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,750
See how much Mommy loves you?

1751
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,708
So I am even more confused.

1752
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,750
They quarrel often due to my results.

1753
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,583
Sometimes to the point
of wanting a divorce.

1754
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:53,791
I…

1755
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,125
I feel like a sinner.

1756
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,416
I feel unwanted. Am I unwanted?

1757
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,583
- Should I not exist at all?
- No.

1758
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,500
No, Jayden.

1759
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,625
You're not a sinner.

1760
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:04,625
It's not your fault.

1761
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,375
And you're not unwanted, okay?

1762
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,916
You have a value in this world.

1763
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,250
I don't want to end up like Zi Hao,

1764
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,125
with my parents apart.

1765
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,000
I can't live without either of them.

1766
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,875
I don't want to live in a broken family.

1767
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,708
Teacher, I know I made a mistake.

1768
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:34,291
But can you please not tell my mom?

1769
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,250
Promise?

1770
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,166
- Confirm plus chop.
- Plus chop.

1771
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,166
Okay, you may go out.

1772
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:56,916
Bro, from my experience,

1773
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,583
this is not family violence.

1774
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,333
It's a very normal family education.

1775
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:01,625
I don't think so.

1776
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,500
She's clearly verbally abusing him.

1777
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,791
We don't even know
how hard she's hitting him.

1778
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,208
I think Jayden is under a lot of pressure.

1779
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,000
What pressure?

1780
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:11,000
My dad used to hit me like I was a thief.

1781
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,916
Belt and wooden sticks,
even throwing chairs.

1782
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,375
He'd grab my hair
and hit me against the wall.

1783
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:16,791
- And your mom?
- She'd add on to it.

1784
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:18,500
Pull me to the room for another round.

1785
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,291
From singles to doubles

1786
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:21,916
and yet I came out fine.

1787
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,625
Is she even your birth mom?

1788
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:46,458
Mom, I'm back.

1789
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:48,416
Come in.

1790
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,625
Eat.

1791
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:04,916
Look at your face.

1792
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,500
Were you scared to death?

1793
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,791
You look really happy, Mom.

1794
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,375
Of course I am happy.

1795
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,666
Didn't you see what I made for you?

1796
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,583
Try the cowpea omelet.

1797
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:17,750
Is it salty?

1798
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,333
And there's herbal tea too.

1799
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,250
Drink some to cool down your body.

1800
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,375
Son, dig in.

1801
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:26,291
- No need to feed you, right?
- Thank you, Mom.

1802
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,625
Son.

1803
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:34,166
I know our current situation
is not as good as before.

1804
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,666
But I will work as hard as you.

1805
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,125
I'll try my best
and take good care of you.

1806
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,916
In a year's time when I can work,

1807
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,500
I will get us a bigger house.

1808
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,291
Are you confident in your mom?

1809
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:51,500
Yes.

1810
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,625
Eat up.

1811
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,916
You don't have to worry about anything.

1812
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,416
Just focus on your studies.

1813
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:00,916
There's something very important.

1814
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,833
Next week.

1815
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:04,375
- Math exam?
- Yes.

1816
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,000
This time, can you try your best

1817
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:09,250
and surpass Jayden

1818
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,958
to get top of the class?

1819
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,791
Aren't test results not important now?

1820
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:15,250
They just look at our rating.

1821
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:17,625
Jayden and I have very similar standards.

1822
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:18,833
Sometimes he gets a point higher.

1823
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:20,125
Other times I get a point higher.

1824
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:22,125
It's only a one or two-point difference.

1825
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:24,291
Why are you guys
being so nitpicky about it?

1826
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:26,000
What do you mean by nitpicky?

1827
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,000
Every single point is important.

1828
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,500
Sometimes the difference
between first and second place

1829
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,125
comes down to one or two points.

1830
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:33,708
To me, even half a point is important.
Understand?

1831
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,541
Son.

1832
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:38,666
Work hard

1833
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,625
and surpass Jayden.

1834
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:43,291
Surpass Jayden.

1835
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:45,625
Surpass Jayden.

1836
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,416
Okay.

1837
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:56,291
Surpass Jayden.

1838
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,583
So are you all ready
to slay for your prelims?

1839
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,791
- Yes!
- Yes!

1840
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,041
So confident. Okay.

1841
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,750
So what's our target for this prelims?

1842
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:11,333
- One hundred percent passing rate!
- One hundred percent passing rate!

1843
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,750
Can you tell me?

1844
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,833
Explain to me. Why can't you understand?

1845
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,083
Answer me!

1846
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:37,416
Give me your hand.

1847
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,041
- You'll be the death of me!
- No, Mom! No!

1848
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,625
Every time you promise me

1849
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,333
- and it's always a lie.
- I'll get first place.

1850
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:43,833
You are a liar! I tell you!

1851
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:45,083
A bloody liar!

1852
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,250
All right, students. Two minutes left.

1853
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:26,750
All right, class.

1854
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,208
Time's up. Pens down.

1855
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,708
Students.

1856
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:18,625
I see all of the hard work you have placed

1857
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:19,625
into this test.

1858
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:25,083
Now, I'm going to reveal your results.

1859
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:30,500
How much? Tell us what it is.

1860
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:33,083
The passing rate for this test is…

1861
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,291
Come on, tell us.

1862
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:35,500
What is the percentage?

1863
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,875
Hundred percent!

1864
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:52,625
- Swimming!
- Swimming!

1865
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:54,458
Wait, how about this?

1866
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:57,000
I'll treat you guys to a meal
instead of swimming, okay?

1867
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,375
- No!
- No!

1868
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:00,083
Mr. Lee, you can't back out.

1869
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:01,958
You promised us!
You can't go back on your words.

1870
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

1871
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:06,791
Okay, fine.

1872
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,458
I'll go swimming with all of you.

1873
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,875
Jayden.

1874
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:48,708
Zi Hao.

1875
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:50,250
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

1876
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:53,666
Look at it.

1877
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,458
Let's see the marks.

1878
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:24,166
Oh my God, Jayden got 48 marks.

1879
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,833
Almost full marks.

1880
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,125
How many marks did you get?

1881
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:33,833
Gosh, you couldn't even solve
these simple questions.

1882
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,875
Jayden, you are first again.

1883
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:37,750
You won again.

1884
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:38,916
He only got 45 marks.

1885
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:41,916
He couldn't even solve this easy question.

1886
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,625
You won.

1887
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:45,000
First place again.

1888
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,291
He only got 45 marks.

1889
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,500
Look, he couldn't solve
these simple questions.

1890
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:53,166
The answers were correct.

1891
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,875
Why did he cross them out?

1892
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:25,458
How was your math exam?

1893
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:26,750
Did you win Zi Hao?

1894
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:35,291
See?

1895
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,958
I told you.

1896
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:39,416
If I hadn't asked that of him

1897
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,333
and pressured him
and banned him from playing games,

1898
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:44,583
do you think
he would have been in first place?

1899
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,458
Kids are like that.

1900
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:48,083
You need to force them.

1901
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:51,458
How else would
they unlock their full potential?

1902
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:52,583
I was like that too.

1903
01:33:52,666 --> 01:33:54,458
My mom pressured me when I was young.

1904
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:56,916
Eventually, I managed to get my Masters.

1905
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,458
Olympic gold medalists are the same.

1906
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,500
They are pushed to do grueling training

1907
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:06,041
in order to get the gold medal, right?

1908
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,291
Mommy.

1909
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:11,333
Actually, I got first place

1910
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:12,583
because Zi Hao--

1911
01:34:12,666 --> 01:34:15,291
Jayden, all that matters
is that you got first place.

1912
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:17,458
No ifs and buts about it, okay?

1913
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:20,666
Sit back. Buckle up.

1914
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:24,458
Why are they so slow today?

1915
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:42,208
Mr. Lee, sorry to disturb you today.

1916
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:46,666
I would like to show you
Zi Hao's exam paper.

1917
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:50,625
Look, he had the right answers
for these questions.

1918
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,708
But he crossed them out
before submitting them.

1919
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:55,375
He wouldn't tell me why.

1920
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:57,958
I'd like to ask.

1921
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,250
Do you know why?

1922
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:03,833
Nothing. I just thought
they were the wrong answers.

1923
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,000
So I crossed them out.

1924
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,375
I didn't know what was the correct answer.

1925
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,166
And it was time to submit the test.

1926
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,791
No big deal. Let's go home.

1927
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:12,791
Stop.

1928
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,666
Come back.

1929
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:17,208
Did I say you can go?

1930
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:18,500
Have you calculated it?

1931
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:21,833
How many marks did you lose
because of this?

1932
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:25,333
If you don't get a score of four,
you can't enter a top school.

1933
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:28,375
So every mark is vital
and you need to maximize it, understand?

1934
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:30,041
I really didn't know how to do it.

1935
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,208
Don't talk back.

1936
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:32,916
I have asked your tuition teacher.

1937
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,833
He taught you these questions.
You can solve them.

1938
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:36,375
Even your answers were correct.

1939
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,875
And yet you handed it in like that. Why?

1940
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,458
Calm down.

1941
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,291
I'm sorry.

1942
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:44,875
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

1943
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,541
I am really at my wit's end.

1944
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:53,416
Sometimes, I look at my son

1945
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,166
sitting there with a book.

1946
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,083
He's not focused at all.

1947
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:58,833
I really want to turn into a worm

1948
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:00,125
and crawl into your brain

1949
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,416
to see what's inside!

1950
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:06,291
Okay, I understand.

1951
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:09,666
Zi Hao, I've gone through
the questions in class.

1952
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,125
And you knew the answers.

1953
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:13,958
You've even written the answers down.

1954
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:15,541
Why did you cross them out?

1955
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:18,666
Mr. Lee, since the answers are correct,

1956
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,125
are you able to add the marks back?

1957
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,125
No, I can't.

1958
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:26,125
- Why not?
- Sorry, but this is the school's policy.

1959
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,125
But this--

1960
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,666
I really can't do that.

1961
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,833
Zi Hao.

1962
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:33,083
You crossed the answers out

1963
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:34,791
to intentionally lose to Jayden,

1964
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:35,791
right?

1965
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:40,875
Intentionally lose to Jayden?

1966
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:47,250
Wang Zi Hao.

1967
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:49,708
What are you doing?

1968
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:54,250
Are exams a mere game to you?

1969
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:57,791
I'm sorry, Mom.

1970
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,541
It's my fault.

1971
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
I wanted to save Jayden

1972
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:04,083
because he was in a dire situation.

1973
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:10,750
If he loses to me by one or two marks,

1974
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,500
he'll get beaten up by his mom.

1975
01:37:13,833 --> 01:37:15,416
Beaten up by his mom?

1976
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:19,708
And it's very bad so I wanted to save him.

1977
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:24,875
Zi Hao's mom, what happened was,

1978
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:28,250
regarding Zi Hao's cheating incident
from before,

1979
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,875
Jayden was actually the culprit.

1980
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:35,583
He said if he lose to Zi Hao,

1981
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:37,666
he'll be severely punished by his mother.

1982
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:41,750
Zi Hao, did you overhear from outside?

1983
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,958
So you intentionally lost to him

1984
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,083
in order to save him?

1985
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:52,791
Wang Zi Hao.

1986
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:54,666
Zi Hao's mom.

1987
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,708
Please don't punish him.

1988
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:02,916
Wang Zi Hao.

1989
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:06,916
You silly child.

1990
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:28,416
Okay.

1991
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,208
Let's take a seat.

1992
01:38:30,291 --> 01:38:32,250
Mr. Lee is telling us to sit.

1993
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:33,333
Come on.

1994
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,416
- Sit.
- Please sit.

1995
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:41,208
Zi Hao's mom.

1996
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:43,583
There's something
I'd like to share with you.

1997
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:46,000
Do you know that

1998
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:48,208
Zi Hao may be suffering from dyslexia?

1999
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,333
Dyslexia?

2000
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:51,416
Yes.

2001
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:53,750
You're talking about Zi Hao?

2002
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:57,000
Zi Hao, when you are reading,

2003
01:38:57,083 --> 01:39:00,166
do the words float
and look like they are flying?

2004
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,083
It's tough for kids like him to study.

2005
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:14,708
So his results are commendable.

2006
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:18,291
His grades
have always been consistently good.

2007
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:22,125
He is very strong mentally.

2008
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,291
Why are you so silly?

2009
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:28,875
Why didn't you let me know?

2010
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,041
I thought it was the same for everyone.

2011
01:39:32,916 --> 01:39:34,083
You silly child.

2012
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:37,500
He didn't know
that it wasn't the same with everyone.

2013
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,208
I'm sorry, Mom.

2014
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,958
I didn't tell you.

2015
01:40:10,708 --> 01:40:12,291
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2016
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,625
Mr. Lee, wait.

2017
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:18,583
Yes, Madam Mok?

2018
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,083
I already told the Principal

2019
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,583
about Jayden's sabotage case.

2020
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:22,958
- What?
- Yes.

2021
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:26,333
Madam Mok, I promised him
I won't tell anyone about it.

2022
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:27,250
That won't do.

2023
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:29,875
Sabotage and cheating
are serious offenses.

2024
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,875
It's my job to let the school know.

2025
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:34,083
And it's your job to let the parents know.

2026
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:35,708
When such things happen,

2027
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:37,708
the parents must be the first to know.

2028
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:39,416
If they are the second to know,

2029
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,083
they will let the Principal

2030
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:42,125
and the MOE know.

2031
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,458
Then you'll be in trouble.

2032
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:46,333
Don't underestimate
the parents' complaints.

2033
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:48,208
I understand, Madam Mok.

2034
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:50,833
But the thing is,
Jayden is a special case.

2035
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,125
I need to think properly
about how to tell his parents.

2036
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:55,333
If not, we wouldn't know
what they'd do to him.

2037
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,083
Have you forgotten about your "GPS" case?

2038
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:58,583
My "GPS" case?

2039
01:40:58,666 --> 01:40:59,583
Yes.

2040
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:01,708
You mean the GPT incident?

2041
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:04,583
Yes. You tried to cover up for everybody.

2042
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:06,291
What did you get in the end?

2043
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:07,291
Nothing.

2044
01:41:07,916 --> 01:41:10,375
But if we break
our promise to the students,

2045
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:12,458
the students
will not trust us in the future.

2046
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:13,958
Have you heard of the saying

2047
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:16,208
"No good deed goes unpunished"?

2048
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:17,875
I don't understand.

2049
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:18,791
What does it mean?

2050
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:20,875
No good deed goes unpunished.

2051
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:24,083
You're still young and have a long way
to go for your career.

2052
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:25,958
If you want to be a good teacher,

2053
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:27,833
you must first know how to survive

2054
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:29,583
and do the right thing.

2055
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,000
Actually, I urgently need to poo.

2056
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:34,708
But I think your case is more urgent.

2057
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:36,458
That's why I came over to tell you.

2058
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:39,875
You go and talk to the parents
as soon as possible.

2059
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:42,708
All I said was for your own "poo".

2060
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,500
I mean, for your own good.

2061
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:47,000
Hey, what are you doing here?

2062
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:49,333
Go back to your classrooms.
What time is it already?

2063
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:54,375
What is this?

2064
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:58,583
You're accusing my son
of framing his classmate

2065
01:41:58,666 --> 01:42:00,875
just based on
the statement of one student?

2066
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:07,083
Ms. Sophia, we have evidence that

2067
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,833
Jayden was the one who did it.

2068
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:11,208
And he admitted to it as well.

2069
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:14,625
And how would I know
you didn't coerce him into saying that?

2070
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:17,458
In fact, I strongly suspect

2071
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:21,083
that you threatened my son
into giving a false testimony.

2072
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:23,375
Don't forget, my husband is a lawyer.

2073
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:25,000
You will go to the Principal.

2074
01:42:25,083 --> 01:42:27,333
And you will make sure
that this is not on Jayden's record.

2075
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:28,958
We can't do that.

2076
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:30,208
Wait.

2077
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:31,625
Ms. Sophia.

2078
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:35,666
To me, this is actually a very small case.

2079
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,583
A very small warning.

2080
01:42:38,166 --> 01:42:39,833
The school has been very lenient.

2081
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:43,166
For Lee and I,
our duty is actually to keep you informed.

2082
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,875
If you have any objections,

2083
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,958
we'll be very happy
to refer her to another department.

2084
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:48,916
Right?

2085
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:54,375
Ms. Sophia.

2086
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:56,958
I need to talk to you about Jayden.

2087
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:58,833
And I think it's a really serious matter.

2088
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:01,708
Based on my conversation
with him the other day,

2089
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,125
he told me that you mistreat him at home.

2090
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:05,791
Mistreat him?

2091
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:09,583
I cane him, yes.

2092
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:11,000
But caning is not a crime.

2093
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:12,708
Caning is used in schools as well.

2094
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:14,958
This is just the way
that I discipline my son.

2095
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:16,708
But you don't just cane him.

2096
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:18,958
You verbally abuse him as well.

2097
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:20,958
Do you know
that your quarrel with your husband

2098
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:22,500
are actually affecting Jayden a lot?

2099
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:24,208
He's under so much stress and pressure

2100
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:26,416
because he's afraid
you guys might get a divorce.

2101
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,583
And that affected him in his studies.

2102
01:43:29,666 --> 01:43:33,291
"Verbal abuse"
is a very strong term, Mr. Lee.

2103
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,125
Are you married?

2104
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:38,916
Do you have children?

2105
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:45,333
How dare you sit there

2106
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:47,708
and tell me how to raise my child.

2107
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:49,583
How to run my marriage.

2108
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:51,833
Even your Principal would never.

2109
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:52,750
No.

2110
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:54,708
You're getting me wrong.

2111
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:58,208
All I'm saying
is that we need to look out for Jayden

2112
01:43:58,291 --> 01:43:59,291
and his mental health.

2113
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:01,583
Based on my conversation
with him the other day,

2114
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:02,833
it is so obvious.

2115
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:05,041
He can't take any of this stress anymore.

2116
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:06,166
He's on the verge of breaking down.

2117
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,958
And as his teacher,

2118
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,958
it's my responsibility to let you know--

2119
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,708
As his teacher,

2120
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:13,583
your responsibility

2121
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:16,208
is to teach my child trigonometry,

2122
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:17,958
not sit there and judge me

2123
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:20,125
and tell me how to run my household.

2124
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:21,708
Yes, correct, Ms. Sophia.

2125
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:23,833
You are right.

2126
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:26,833
Lee, we have another meeting to attend.

2127
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:27,875
If you'll excuse us.

2128
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:28,875
Lee, let's go.

2129
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:30,666
Wait, I'm not done.

2130
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:33,166
Ms. Sophia.

2131
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:37,458
I think your anxiety
is causing too much stress to your son.

2132
01:44:37,541 --> 01:44:39,500
So if I may,

2133
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,708
I would suggest
you look for a psychiatrist

2134
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:44,250
or maybe a counselor
to deal with your anxieties.

2135
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:46,083
And I think that's going to help solve

2136
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:47,708
the issues you're facing at home.

2137
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:50,208
And it will help
to make Jayden's life easier.

2138
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:53,833
I think you have completely
lost the plot, Mr. Lee.

2139
01:44:55,083 --> 01:44:58,250
I'm going to lodge
a formal complaint against you.

2140
01:44:58,333 --> 01:44:59,750
We'll see how far you'll go.

2141
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:11,958
Mr. Lee, not that I want to be difficult,

2142
01:45:12,041 --> 01:45:14,041
but this is another difficult situation.

2143
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:18,083
And now, the parents
have written all the way to the MOE.

2144
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:19,833
And so I have to find out the truth

2145
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:20,875
and write a report.

2146
01:45:20,958 --> 01:45:21,833
Tell me what happened.

2147
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:23,208
I simply told the parents

2148
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:24,375
that the way they handle the kid

2149
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:26,166
is adding a lot of stress to them.

2150
01:45:26,666 --> 01:45:28,583
Parents like to treat their children

2151
01:45:28,666 --> 01:45:30,583
and teach them their own way.

2152
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:32,750
They don't want to be interfered with.

2153
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,500
How can you tell parents what to do?

2154
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:35,708
We're only teachers.

2155
01:45:35,791 --> 01:45:37,333
There's nothing we can do.

2156
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,708
I understand, Mrs. Tan.

2157
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:39,708
I'm just afraid

2158
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:41,708
because Jayden is already
on the verge of breaking down.

2159
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:43,083
If we don't help him in time,

2160
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:44,000
he'll be in trouble.

2161
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,250
Okay, I understand.

2162
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:47,125
No, you don't understand, Mrs. Tan.

2163
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:49,500
Why don't you come here
and be the Principal instead?

2164
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:51,958
You know, I've been a teacher
for more than 30 years.

2165
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:54,583
You think I haven't met
all the different kinds of parents?

2166
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:56,708
You have to trust me on this.

2167
01:45:56,791 --> 01:45:57,708
Every time I tell you

2168
01:45:57,791 --> 01:45:59,166
not to hide anything from the parents,

2169
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:01,083
you nod and say you understand.

2170
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:03,083
I understand. That's why I didn't hide it.

2171
01:46:03,166 --> 01:46:04,083
I told them the truth.

2172
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:05,708
The truth? Then…

2173
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:07,458
Then why is it written here

2174
01:46:07,541 --> 01:46:10,166
that you are interfering
with their marital affairs?

2175
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,958
I didn't interfere
with their marital affairs, Mrs. Tan.

2176
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:15,083
All I said is that
the quarrels in their marriage

2177
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:16,916
are causing a lot of stress on Jayden.

2178
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,500
See, you even interfered
with their marriage

2179
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:21,208
by talking about their quarrels.

2180
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:22,958
No wonder she was so upset

2181
01:46:23,041 --> 01:46:24,666
and wrote such a nasty letter.

2182
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:26,000
But it is the truth.

2183
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:27,458
I don't see what's wrong with this.

2184
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:29,208
Let me tell you what is wrong.

2185
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:31,125
It could be the tone of your voice,

2186
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:32,458
the structure of your sentence,

2187
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,166
the words you chose,
or your body language.

2188
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,125
You see?

2189
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:37,666
Your body language is making me angry now.

2190
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,208
You must have made them so angry

2191
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:40,833
until they wrote to the MOE.

2192
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:46,708
Okay.

2193
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:48,750
Mrs. Tan.

2194
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:52,708
I think I really don't know
how to handle the parents.

2195
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:54,000
And I sincerely apologize

2196
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:57,333
for all the trouble
I caused you and the school.

2197
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:03,208
I just hope that you understand.

2198
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,875
Jayden is in a very
vulnerable situation now.

2199
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:09,666
And I hope that
you can do something to help him.

2200
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:17,083
I've made my decision.

2201
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,541
I'm going to resign.

2202
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,625
Resign?

2203
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:23,708
Wait…

2204
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:25,625
Hey, I…

2205
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:28,125
This is for your own good, Mrs. Tan.

2206
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,250
No good.

2207
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:30,291
Cool down.

2208
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:34,958
Mrs. Tan, you're not going
to accept his resignation, right?

2209
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:37,333
He's one of the best
and most responsible teachers

2210
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:38,500
I've ever seen.

2211
01:47:38,583 --> 01:47:41,458
His students genuinely like him
and trust him.

2212
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:42,583
Look at Jayden's class.

2213
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:44,583
They have always scored below average.

2214
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:46,958
But after Mr. Lee took over,

2215
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,583
they managed to achieve
a passing rate of 100%.

2216
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:51,083
You know it's not easy, right?

2217
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:53,291
To be honest,
a few of us have been learning from him.

2218
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:55,375
I really don't know what is happening.

2219
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:56,958
These youngsters nowadays.

2220
01:47:57,041 --> 01:47:58,583
We just say a few words.

2221
01:47:58,666 --> 01:47:59,958
And then, they resign.

2222
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:18,458
- Mr. Lee, don't go.
- Mr. Lee, don't go.

2223
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:22,958
- Mr. Lee, don't go.
- Mr. Lee, don't go.

2224
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,416
Students, don't cry. Okay?

2225
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,333
I'm not leaving. I'm just taking a break.

2226
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:32,541
- Don't go.
- Don't go.

2227
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:35,291
Class, you must all continue
to help one another

2228
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:36,625
and do well for your math, okay?

2229
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:40,666
- Mr. Lee, please don't go.
- Don't go.

2230
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:45,583
- Mr. Lee, please don't go.
- Don't go.

2231
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:42,458
- This is good.
- Hello.

2232
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:44,791
- Wen Ting is here.
- Hello.

2233
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:46,916
- Sit there.
- Okay.

2234
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:47,916
Help yourself.

2235
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,875
- Gosh, another sumptuous afternoon tea.
- So exquisite.

2236
01:49:52,666 --> 01:49:54,250
How have you been, Wen Ting?

2237
01:49:54,333 --> 01:49:55,375
Not too bad.

2238
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:57,333
I'm sorry, Wen Ting.

2239
01:49:57,416 --> 01:50:00,166
But there have been
a lot of rumors circulating.

2240
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:02,458
I thought it'd be better
to ask you personally.

2241
01:50:02,541 --> 01:50:07,083
I heard Zi Hao lost to Jayden recently?

2242
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:10,041
Don't listen to rumors.

2243
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:11,458
Zi Hao did it on purpose.

2244
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:13,125
He wrote all the correct answers.

2245
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:14,916
But he was worried if Jayden lost,

2246
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,791
he'd be beaten up by his mom.

2247
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:19,291
I've heard that she's very fierce.

2248
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:20,291
Good for Zi Hao.

2249
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:21,833
He's definitely better than Jayden.

2250
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,083
Who said that?

2251
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:27,125
My child got first place
solely by his own effort.

2252
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:29,791
Who said Zi Hao gave in to him?

2253
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:31,291
Sophia.

2254
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,291
Have a seat, Sophia.

2255
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:34,333
- Sophia.
- Cool down.

2256
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,541
I'm investigating
the source of the rumors.

2257
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:43,208
I hope it's not your fear of losing

2258
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:46,333
that caused you
to create a rumor to slander my son.

2259
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:51,166
Sit.

2260
01:51:01,333 --> 01:51:04,500
Sophia, I feel that for kids,

2261
01:51:04,583 --> 01:51:07,541
the difference of a few marks
shouldn't matter.

2262
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:10,125
Jayden is a talented kid.

2263
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:13,875
And you brought him up well.

2264
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:15,750
There's a lot that I…

2265
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,958
need to learn from you.

2266
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:21,791
I have finally seen
your true colors today.

2267
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:24,375
You are such a hypocrite.

2268
01:51:25,583 --> 01:51:27,666
To think my son was so kind

2269
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,833
that when he saw
Zi Hao struggling at school,

2270
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,333
he tutored him out of goodwill.

2271
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:33,958
And how does Zi Hao repay Jayden?

2272
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:36,791
By going around his back
and spreading a baseless rumor.

2273
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:39,041
And you sit there doing nothing about it.

2274
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,541
You're even pretending
to eat humble pie now.

2275
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:43,625
You are so cunning, Wen Ting.

2276
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:46,666
Aren't you going too far?

2277
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:49,125
Better than being two-faced like you.

2278
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:52,166
You don't practice what you preach.

2279
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:54,125
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

2280
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,708
Like mom like son.

2281
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,583
Sophia, say what you want about me.

2282
01:52:00,666 --> 01:52:02,916
But leave my son out of it.

2283
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,416
I am no pushover.

2284
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,458
I don't fear you.

2285
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:06,916
I don't need you to fear me.

2286
01:52:07,583 --> 01:52:09,666
All we needed
was a little bit of gratitude

2287
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:11,583
and for you not to stab us in the back.

2288
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:15,166
Now everyone is saying

2289
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:16,666
that my Jayden

2290
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:19,125
had to rely on the marks Zi Hao gave up.

2291
01:52:19,208 --> 01:52:21,125
Yet you said nothing.

2292
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:22,666
Aren't you lying through your teeth?

2293
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,791
I am not.

2294
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:26,666
Let me tell you the truth.

2295
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:28,916
The truth is that Jayden got first place

2296
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,916
only because Zi Hao
gave him that advantage.

2297
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,666
This was what Mr. Lee told me.

2298
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:34,375
Ask him if you don't believe me.

2299
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:36,000
I don't have to.

2300
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:37,083
No matter what,

2301
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:39,708
my son is always number one.

2302
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,166
Of course.

2303
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:44,958
Your son is always number one.

2304
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:47,916
But you know how he got first place?

2305
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,125
You forced and beat it out of him.

2306
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:53,416
Do you know how awful he feels inside?

2307
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,166
He didn't dare to tell you anything.

2308
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:58,083
And that's why in the speech competition,

2309
01:52:58,166 --> 01:53:01,791
he was unable to speak
on the topic "My Mother".

2310
01:53:02,416 --> 01:53:03,958
Look at yourself.

2311
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:07,291
Do you think you're a good mother?

2312
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:08,750
You're not fit to be one.

2313
01:53:08,833 --> 01:53:10,416
Do you think you're better off?

2314
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,708
Just to get your son into a top school,

2315
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,416
you pressured him
to get four distinctions.

2316
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,208
You also forced him
to memorize the dictionary,

2317
01:53:16,291 --> 01:53:19,666
learn to swim, and memorize a novel.

2318
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,166
What sort of teaching is that?

2319
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,625
Who are you to criticize me?

2320
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:25,541
Look at yourself in the mirror.

2321
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:27,291
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

2322
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:31,416
Yes, I'm not one bit ashamed.

2323
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,291
As for you, you don't like losing.
You fear losing.

2324
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:35,791
You want to win in everything.

2325
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:38,583
You even had to buy
a bigger birthday present than ours.

2326
01:53:39,125 --> 01:53:40,583
What kind of person are you?

2327
01:53:40,666 --> 01:53:41,791
What is wrong with you?

2328
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:43,541
What's wrong with me?

2329
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:47,083
- What are you doing?
- You're asking what's wrong with me?

2330
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:49,500
You not only beat your child
but an adult too!

2331
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:50,875
I'm going to the police.

2332
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:52,583
I'll report you for child abuse!

2333
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:54,250
Child abuse?

2334
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:57,166
What are you talking about?
Are you insane?

2335
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,416
Let's go.

2336
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,291
Stop fighting.

2337
01:54:03,166 --> 01:54:04,500
This is ridiculous.

2338
01:54:04,583 --> 01:54:06,583
Don't you think Sophia was too much?

2339
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:08,083
She said I was just like her.

2340
01:54:08,166 --> 01:54:09,166
How's that possible?

2341
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:10,291
She hits her child.

2342
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:11,583
I don't hit my child.

2343
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:13,541
Say, she usually acts all refined.

2344
01:54:13,625 --> 01:54:15,875
But she's terrifying when she gets mad.

2345
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:28,375
I was very shocked
that you both quarreled.

2346
01:54:31,125 --> 01:54:32,916
Remember what you criticized Sophia?

2347
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,125
That she gave her child pressure?

2348
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:38,666
I have given you
a lot of ideas in the past too

2349
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:41,000
and told you to do
all sorts of ridiculous things.

2350
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:42,750
Like forcing him to go for tuition

2351
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:44,458
and memorizing the dictionary and novels.

2352
01:54:46,666 --> 01:54:48,083
As well as one-on-one monitoring.

2353
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:50,916
How different are we from Sophia?

2354
01:54:53,791 --> 01:54:56,333
Do you mean that I am just like her?

2355
01:54:56,416 --> 01:54:57,875
"We."

2356
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:02,083
Don't say that.
That's just an excuse to be lazy.

2357
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,416
Memorize the dictionary.

2358
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,625
Once you are done,

2359
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:08,500
I will record a video
and send it to your dad.

2360
01:55:08,583 --> 01:55:10,375
He will be so proud of you.

2361
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:24,625
Was I treating Zi Hao the same way?

2362
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:26,708
Why didn't I realize it?

2363
01:55:27,333 --> 01:55:28,958
I did not either.

2364
01:55:29,666 --> 01:55:32,958
Xiao Hui, you know the situation I'm in.

2365
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:35,041
What choice did I have?

2366
01:55:35,125 --> 01:55:38,541
Zi Hao and I left Shanghai to be here.

2367
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:40,666
If he doesn't enter a top school
and make a name for himself,

2368
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:41,916
how can I return to Shanghai?

2369
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,666
How can I have the cheek to go back?

2370
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:45,875
Is that why you forced him to study?

2371
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:48,375
Other than forcing him,

2372
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:51,500
what else can the both of us do?

2373
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,916
We're now in Singapore
with nowhere to go, not even a home.

2374
01:55:58,875 --> 01:56:00,333
What do you think I should do?

2375
01:56:03,041 --> 01:56:05,958
Wen Ting, I know
you're under a lot of pressure.

2376
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:09,750
But the stress is for adults
and not the kids.

2377
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:12,583
Zi Hao is still so young.

2378
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,583
How can he withstand so much pressure?

2379
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:18,833
The world is so big.

2380
01:56:18,916 --> 01:56:20,250
You'll always have a place.

2381
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:24,958
You always told him,

2382
01:56:25,041 --> 01:56:26,458
"It's for your own good."

2383
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:30,333
Was it really for his own good

2384
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:32,166
or for your own good instead?

2385
01:56:33,666 --> 01:56:36,541
Yes, it was for my own good.

2386
01:56:38,166 --> 01:56:41,208
Xiao Hui, did you know?

2387
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:45,416
Zi Hao never wanted to come to Singapore.

2388
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:48,791
He didn't want to leave Shanghai.

2389
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:50,958
He doesn't like it here.

2390
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:54,500
It was me.

2391
01:56:55,166 --> 01:56:57,208
I forced him to come here.

2392
01:56:57,291 --> 01:57:00,333
And I forced him to study
to get into a top school.

2393
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:02,208
I just wanted…

2394
01:57:04,916 --> 01:57:07,375
I only wanted

2395
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:09,708
my husband to see

2396
01:57:09,791 --> 01:57:12,916
how hard I am working for this family.

2397
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:23,291
Now I know how selfish I was.

2398
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:31,208
I forced him to study here.

2399
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:33,375
I forced him to get into a top school.

2400
01:57:35,625 --> 01:57:40,125
I was just using him to save my marriage.

2401
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,333
But now…

2402
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,041
I've lost everything.

2403
01:57:47,375 --> 01:57:48,875
I am the one.

2404
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,583
I'm the one

2405
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:54,125
who isn't fit to be a mother.

2406
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:03,416
Let me show you what I am capable of.

2407
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,458
Mommy, what happened?

2408
01:58:04,541 --> 01:58:06,833
Zi Hao's mom is bullying us now.

2409
01:58:06,916 --> 01:58:08,791
She's talking behind your back,

2410
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:10,416
saying that you got first place

2411
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,166
because Zi Hao gave in to you.

2412
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:14,500
She even said
that I forced you to get good grades

2413
01:58:14,583 --> 01:58:15,791
and I'm not fit to be a mother.

2414
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:17,083
How could I take that lying down?

2415
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:19,208
So what are you going to do?

2416
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:20,291
I'm going to report her.

2417
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:27,833
She can't work in Singapore
without a permit.

2418
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:29,166
I'm going to report her to ICA

2419
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:30,208
and get her deported.

2420
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:31,833
So we're no longer threatened.

2421
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:34,541
Mom, no one is being threatened.

2422
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:36,666
We are good friends and classmates.

2423
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,208
Why are you ruining our friendship?

2424
01:58:38,291 --> 01:58:40,333
There are no good friends
or classmates in the world.

2425
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:42,500
Everyone just stabs you in the back,
in the end, Jayden.

2426
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:44,166
No matter what,

2427
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,958
I've had enough of Zi Hao's mom.

2428
01:58:46,041 --> 01:58:48,416
I'm going to report her.

2429
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,791
I'll bring chaos to their home

2430
01:58:49,875 --> 01:58:51,291
so he can't focus on his PSLE.

2431
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:53,291
So he won't be in the same school as you.

2432
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:54,791
You'll top the class wherever you go.

2433
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:56,625
Mommy is trying to help you.

2434
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,958
Hello, hi, yes. I've been trying
to get a hold of you for days.

2435
01:59:01,041 --> 01:59:04,291
I've been trying
to report this lady to ICA.

2436
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,708
Mommy, that's enough.

2437
01:59:05,791 --> 01:59:07,125
Don't do such things anymore.

2438
01:59:07,208 --> 01:59:09,416
Listen. My mom isn't like that.

2439
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,291
My mom doesn't go behind people's backs

2440
01:59:11,375 --> 01:59:13,333
and use such underhanded means
to harm them.

2441
01:59:13,416 --> 01:59:16,666
The more you do that,
the more you're telling people

2442
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,416
that your son is a sore loser.

2443
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,708
That I am incapable.

2444
01:59:19,791 --> 01:59:21,583
And I have to rely on
my mom's dirty tricks

2445
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:22,750
to be the top student.

2446
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,458
Mommy, this is enough.

2447
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:26,583
When you do that,

2448
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:28,666
I really hate you.

2449
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:31,500
I don't have a mom like you!

2450
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:39,666
Jayden, wait.

2451
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:40,916
Jayden!

2452
01:59:42,833 --> 01:59:44,000
Jayden, stop!

2453
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:45,541
Jayden, please stop!

2454
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:46,583
It's really dangerous.

2455
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:48,166
Please stop.

2456
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:49,666
Jayden, please don't run.

2457
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:52,083
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

2458
01:59:52,166 --> 01:59:54,708
Jayden, please stop running!

2459
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:56,541
Jayden!

2460
02:00:37,708 --> 02:00:39,166
That should have been me.

2461
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,250
I did all those bad things.

2462
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:48,750
Why did it hit him?

2463
02:00:54,083 --> 02:00:55,416
Sorry.

2464
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:58,625
I really am sorry.

2465
02:00:58,708 --> 02:01:01,375
I didn't mean for it to go so far.

2466
02:01:02,333 --> 02:01:05,791
I never meant for it to go so far.

2467
02:01:06,708 --> 02:01:08,375
I'm sorry.

2468
02:01:09,458 --> 02:01:11,166
Oh God, what have I done?

2469
02:01:13,958 --> 02:01:15,750
What have I done?

2470
02:01:30,458 --> 02:01:32,125
- Aunty.
- How is Jayden?

2471
02:01:32,208 --> 02:01:33,375
Is he okay?

2472
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,416
Sophia.

2473
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:43,625
I'm sorry.

2474
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,291
THREE DAYS LATER

2475
02:02:13,833 --> 02:02:15,583
You can begin now.

2476
02:02:52,625 --> 02:02:57,208
Jayden, your friends are here.

2477
02:02:57,291 --> 02:02:59,041
Jayden, wake up.

2478
02:02:59,125 --> 02:03:00,416
We're all waiting for you.

2479
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,791
Jayden, we miss you.

2480
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:02,958
Jayden, we're here.

2481
02:03:03,041 --> 02:03:04,791
Faster, Jayden. Let's go play.

2482
02:03:04,875 --> 02:03:06,166
Wake up, Jayden.

2483
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:09,500
- Wake up.
- Wake up.

2484
02:03:13,375 --> 02:03:17,166
He was born in this very hospital

2485
02:03:18,541 --> 02:03:20,208
at 2.8 kg.

2486
02:03:21,875 --> 02:03:24,416
I held him in my arms.

2487
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:30,375
And looked at his little face and hands.

2488
02:03:32,541 --> 02:03:33,791
I thought

2489
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:40,791
that all I wanted was for him
to grow up healthy and happy.

2490
02:03:42,875 --> 02:03:44,625
But I changed

2491
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:47,833
over time.

2492
02:03:49,625 --> 02:03:53,041
I stopped caring about his feelings.

2493
02:03:54,875 --> 02:03:56,583
I wanted him to be
the first in everything.

2494
02:03:59,291 --> 02:04:01,583
For the sake of his results,

2495
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:04,791
I even wanted to tear your family apart.

2496
02:04:07,375 --> 02:04:09,000
But my son is a sensible child.

2497
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,958
He stopped me from reporting you.

2498
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:19,208
But I refused to listen to him.

2499
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:23,875
And he said
that he doesn't have a mom like me.

2500
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,583
He said he hates me.

2501
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,875
I was so shocked, you know?

2502
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,541
But he was right to hate me.

2503
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,416
I pressured him.

2504
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:46,583
I turned his beautiful childhood

2505
02:04:47,166 --> 02:04:48,833
into hell.

2506
02:04:55,166 --> 02:04:56,583
You were right.

2507
02:04:57,875 --> 02:04:59,375
I am not fit to be a mother.

2508
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:04,458
I turned my own flesh and blood into this.

2509
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:08,083
I owe him an apology.

2510
02:05:09,875 --> 02:05:11,541
And I owe all of you an apology.

2511
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,791
But it's too late for regret.

2512
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:27,666
I'm so sorry.

2513
02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:46,000
THREE MONTHS LATER

2514
02:05:54,708 --> 02:05:57,083
FATTY, ZI HAO, JAYDEN, JIA YAO

2515
02:05:59,416 --> 02:06:00,291
GOOD FRIENDS FOREVER.

2516
02:06:04,333 --> 02:06:06,916
Jayden, our PSLE is over.

2517
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,875
We all went to a school of our choice.

2518
02:06:08,958 --> 02:06:11,291
Please, wake up.
We're all waiting for you.

2519
02:06:11,916 --> 02:06:12,958
Yes, Jayden.

2520
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:13,916
When you wake up,

2521
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,791
I'll bring you
our homemade fishball noodles.

2522
02:06:16,875 --> 02:06:19,458
Do you remember, Jayden?

2523
02:06:19,541 --> 02:06:21,250
On my 1st day in Primary 5,

2524
02:06:21,333 --> 02:06:23,000
the teacher came into the classroom

2525
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:25,000
and assigned us homework.

2526
02:06:25,083 --> 02:06:27,208
But my English wasn't good then.

2527
02:06:27,291 --> 02:06:28,750
And I could not understand much.

2528
02:06:28,833 --> 02:06:31,125
You were the only one
who translated for me.

2529
02:06:32,333 --> 02:06:33,791
You may have forgotten.

2530
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:36,750
It was a trivial thing.

2531
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:39,333
But I have never forgotten.

2532
02:06:39,416 --> 02:06:40,833
Because in my heart,

2533
02:06:40,916 --> 02:06:42,416
you're always my friend.

2534
02:06:43,666 --> 02:06:44,583
His hand moved.

2535
02:06:44,666 --> 02:06:46,458
- Did it?
- It moved!

2536
02:06:46,541 --> 02:06:47,916
- Aunty Sophia!
- Doctor!

2537
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,833
What happened?

2538
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:51,458
- His hand moved!
- His hand moved!

2539
02:09:49,208 --> 02:09:50,875
They're all here.

2540
02:09:51,708 --> 02:09:53,416
Hi, Sophia

2541
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,416
…couldn't come.

2542
02:09:56,541 --> 02:09:59,083
Thanks everyone for your care and support.

2543
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:04,291
And thank you, Wen Ting,
for your graciousness and understanding.

2544
02:10:07,291 --> 02:10:10,916
I'd also like to thank you
for helping me find such a great job.

2545
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,458
Zi Hao and I will continue
to be in your care.

2546
02:10:14,958 --> 02:10:16,791
All right.

2547
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:21,125
Thank you, Mr. Lee,
for going above and beyond.

2548
02:10:23,083 --> 02:10:25,666
What matters most
is everyone learned and grew from this.

2549
02:10:28,666 --> 02:10:29,541
All right.

2550
02:10:29,625 --> 02:10:31,875
It truly is one blessing after another.

2551
02:10:31,958 --> 02:10:33,625
Let's welcome back Jayden.

2552
02:10:33,708 --> 02:10:35,291
Despite being out of action for a year,

2553
02:10:35,375 --> 02:10:37,333
he managed to score
an impressive four distinctions.

2554
02:10:37,416 --> 02:10:38,583
Amazing.

2555
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:43,500
Jayden, with your superb results,

2556
02:10:43,583 --> 02:10:45,375
I'm sure many schools
are clamoring to accept you.

2557
02:10:45,458 --> 02:10:47,875
Jayden's mom,
which top school are you planning for him?

2558
02:10:47,958 --> 02:10:49,041
- Hwa Chong.
- RI.

2559
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:50,125
NUS High.

2560
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:51,083
Nanyang Girls'.

2561
02:10:54,166 --> 02:10:55,208
About that,

2562
02:10:55,291 --> 02:10:56,916
I'm going to leave it up to Jayden.

2563
02:11:01,333 --> 02:11:02,750
I'd like to thank everyone

2564
02:11:02,833 --> 02:11:05,875
for your continued support
and encouragement.

2565
02:11:08,166 --> 02:11:10,166
Regarding my choice of secondary school,

2566
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:11,250
I've made my decision.

2567
02:11:12,208 --> 02:11:13,041
I've decided.

2568
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:16,208
I've decided to go
to a neighborhood school.

2569
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,000
- Why?
- What?

2570
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:22,833
Because no matter
which secondary school we go to,

2571
02:11:22,916 --> 02:11:25,708
we'll still have to study hard
and get good grades.

2572
02:11:25,791 --> 02:11:27,000
Also,

2573
02:11:27,083 --> 02:11:30,333
the grades we attain
in Singapore are recognized

2574
02:11:30,416 --> 02:11:31,416
across the board.

2575
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:32,833
So,

2576
02:11:32,916 --> 02:11:34,708
I think there's no difference.

2577
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:38,833
You've got that right.

2578
02:11:38,916 --> 02:11:41,208
Then let us wish Jayden and everyone here.

2579
02:11:41,291 --> 02:11:44,041
Fortune, luck, and prosperity!

2580
02:11:50,458 --> 02:11:56,583
THE END

2581
