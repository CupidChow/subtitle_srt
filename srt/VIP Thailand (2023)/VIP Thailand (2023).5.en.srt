🌟[VIP Thailand]🖤

8
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:26,647
How are you?

9
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,092
Are you having fun shopping?

10
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:31,242
Nothing much. I haven't bought anything yet.

11
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,036
I'm calling you to tell you that I've booked a fine dining table at Marina Bay Sands for you.

12
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,516
What's wrong with you?

13
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:45,260
Nothing. I just wanted to apologize that I had to work,

14
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,050
and I couldn't travel with you.

15
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,376
Anyway, have a good rest.

16
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,213
Okay.

17
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,079
Is everything okay?

18
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:09,933
Great.

19
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:13,236
Everything must be perfect for today's event.

20
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,986
Hello.

21
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:37,036
Is something wrong over there?

22
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,534
Be careful. Don't make any mistakes.

23
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:50,934
Yes.

24
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,590
The lighting on both sides must be even. I want 100% perfection.
[Tifóne]

25
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,490
This is fine, thank you.
[Tifóne]

26
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,495
Take photos according to the reference I sent you.

27
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:12,600
Thank you.

28
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,290
- Take care of this.
- Thank you.

29
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:19,306
Don't place it like this.
[V.I.P.]

30
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,613
You have to do this.

31
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:23,543
It must be perfect. Everything must be the same.

32
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,867
Do you understand?

33
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,827
Don't do your job carelessly.

34
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,130
I think one person is the most perfect in the event.

35
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,013
Madam Montira didn't come today so she's fully dressed.

36
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:43,190
Wearing brand names from head to toe, whom did she get the money from?

37
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,560
I like this lighting. Do it as I said.

38
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
Okay.

39
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,030
Everything that happened was an accident.

40
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:17,100
And it's really over.

41
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,967
You don't need to know.

42
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,007
You would hurt even more.

43
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:25,830
I think Meena is definitely pregnant.

44
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,513
Can you just let it end here?

45
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,132
It's over.

46
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,220
Let it end.

47
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,127
Rin.

48
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:57,090
What's the matter?

49
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:06,150
Did you send a message last night to lure Meena and Lalita out?

50
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:12,470
So you're stressed now because someone came, right?

51
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,950
Who?

52
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,787
Meena?

53
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,480
What now? Do you want to talk?

54
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,180
It's okay.

55
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,991
Today's event is very important to the VIP team.

56
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,451
Wait until the event ends, then let's see what to do.

57
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:51,218
You can be patient until the event ends. I really admire you.

58
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,930
Let's go. The event will begin soon.

59
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,553
This side too.

60
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,453
Here, please.

61
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:24,870
Hello, Madam, please come this way.

62
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,550
You look gorgeous today.

63
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:05,185
By the way, the VIP team is very professional.

64
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,105
It's no surprise since P'Pak trained you all well.

65
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,586
You complimented me. Why must you mention Khun Pak?

66
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,960
Men are all the same, always taking a side.

67
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
What's the matter?

68
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,710
Quickly.

69
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,513
- Hi.
- Hello.

70
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,430
What a coincidence.

71
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,810
This is Prae, my acquaintance.

72
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,473
This is my girlfriend.

73
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,860
Yes.

74
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,981
Please take some photos.

75
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:54,848
I didn't expect to see you here.

76
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,513
I've heard the news about your mother.

77
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm so shocked.

78
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:06,810
Sorry, your colleague doesn't know about it yet, right?

79
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,910
Please take some photos.

80
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:24,170
After you're done, I'll let the staff take you in.
[Tifóne]

81
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,295
Please.

82
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:36,030
Prae, who is it?

83
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,863
Don't mind this matter.

84
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,073
She didn't tell me.

85
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:45,860
- Hello.
- A guest is here.

86
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,280
Your seat, please.

87
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:56,253
Lita.

88
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,314
Start serving the welcome drinks now.

89
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,830
Okay.

90
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,627
Rin, we're in trouble.

91
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,463
The wine that we prepared has gone bad.

92
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,063
What?

93
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,207
Are any more bottles bad like this?

94
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,539
These vintage wines are very hard to tell.

95
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,810
We may have to open each bottle to check.

96
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,360
If you find bad wine again, throw it all away.

97
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,900
Don't let the customers drink it at all.

98
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,775
Yes.

99
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,667
Rin.

100
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,787
How many bottles of wine have you prepared?

101
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,010
About 10 bottles.

102
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,287
Aren't you supposed to prepare more wine than food?

103
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,800
Guests drink more wine during the second half of the event.

104
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,935
These vintage wines are very rare. This is the most I could find.

105
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:47,110
I don't think there will be...

106
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,780
Shouldn't you prepare it well? Don't you check first?

107
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,300
Call this supplier. Ask them if they have the wine we want.

108
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,687
And if so, let them send it over as soon as possible.

109
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,087
Okay.

110
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,737
Please don't let the guests drink the bad wine.

111
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,137
Yes.

112
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
Follow me.

113
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:28,807
You should be the one who knows best how important wine is to the guests.

114
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:31,807
If only one guest drinks the wine and complains about us,

115
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,680
the VIP team's professionalism will be ruined, Meena.

116
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,268
I'm really sorry, Rin. I won't make a mistake again next time.

117
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:43,970
You seem distracted lately.

118
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,598
Is something wrong?

119
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,310
I asked if you are hiding something from me.

120
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,053
Answer me!

121
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,353
Rin. Calm down.

122
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,627
Meena is sick now. She may feel distracted at times.

123
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,227
Calm down, both of you.

124
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,790
If it was someone else,

125
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,554
you would have cursed them without caring how sick they were.

126
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:20,830
You seem especially protective of Meena.

127
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,380
You're the one who insisted this work is very important.

128
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,430
We can't make a mistake.

129
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,542
If you make a mistake again, I won't let you go.

130
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,750
No one can protect you.

131
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,667
Rin, I've been working a long time. I just made my first mistake.

132
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,187
You made a mistake that we're not allowed to make!

133
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,967
Why are you talking like you didn't see all of my past efforts?

134
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,667
When your mistake is this serious,

135
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:58,790
no matter how good you've been in the past, it can't count.

136
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:02,327
Am I really that bad, RIn?

137
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,887
Yes.

138
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,397
Now, both of you...

139
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:15,762
Excuse me, I'm just informing you that a new batch of wine is on the way.

140
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,407
It should be enough for the whole event.

141
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,347
Good.

142
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:23,307
Rin. Rin!

143
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:38,630
Calm down and after you're okay, go inside.

144
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:16,752
Camera?

145
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,567
But it's just an auction. There are only VIP customers.

146
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,347
What's the use of recording the video there?

147
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,900
I don't think it's an ordinary auction.

148
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,230
I heard the news that Mr. Jakchai will have a talk with the shareholders as well.

149
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,840
You just have to hide a camera at a good position.

150
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,336
Don't let anyone see that.

151
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,130
Khun Meena.

152
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,220
How long have you been in the VIP team? Have they ever seen your importance?

153
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,050
Have they ever valued you?

154
00:14:56,193 --> 00:15:00,010
You just have to put effort in the right place.

155
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:05,571
Trust me, and you will prosper.

156
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,390
[Tifóne]

157
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,987
Mr. Jakchai, this way, please.

158
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,324
Is it all right?

159
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,278
Has Mr. Monthep arrived yet?

160
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,214
Yes, he's here.

161
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,983
Father, hello.

162
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,683
Hello.

163
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,520
Hello, hello.

164
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,543
Please go to your table.

165
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:37,260
Rin, does Mr. Monthep come to this event, too?

166
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,486
P'Pak just told me now, too.

167
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:43,420
That's weird. Mr. Monthep typically doesn't like going to events.

168
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,193
Why is he here today?

169
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:46,843
Right.

170
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:51,370
Mr. Jakchai didn't bring his wife, but his father-in-law instead.

171
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,553
Or does this event have something more than just a diamond auction?

172
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:16,323
Have you changed your number?

173
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,793
Is there anything?

174
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:25,760
I just want to sit near Mr. Somkiat, the CEO of Thai Steel.

175
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,964
I want to say hi to him.

176
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,961
Can you change the seating for me?

177
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:36,814
Sorry, we don't allow changing seats.

178
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:39,312
Wait, Prae.

179
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:43,629
In the past, I gave you many things.

180
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,375
Just this tiny favor,

181
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:51,383
can't you do it for me?

182
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,273
We are close anyway.

183
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,613
I'm really sorry.

184
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,203
And is your mom doing well?

185
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,703
Sorry.

186
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,903
I spoke too loud.

187
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,160
Wait a minute. Why are you walking away?

188
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,426
Prae, where are you going?

189
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,886
I'm really worried about your mom.

190
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:38,103
I forgot that your colleagues didn't know about it.

191
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,393
Sorry.

192
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:43,146
You must be embarrassed about your mom.

193
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,343
Did you know that—

194
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,743
Say it!

195
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,283
If you don't say it, I'll do it myself!

196
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,060
My family went bankrupt.

197
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,900
My mom flees from loan sharks.

198
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,460
As for me, I have to find and rent a small, cheap room.

199
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,063
Some days, I don't have food to eat.

200
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:14,033
My watch is fake. What you see is completely fake; are you satisfied now?

201
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,793
Are you satisfied?

202
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,120
When will you stop ruining my life?

203
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,873
Hey, Khun.

204
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:22,923
I'm worried about your current boyfriend.

205
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,313
If he knows your true colors,

206
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:31,660
he'll know that you're actually a gold digger.

207
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,640
Please respect women when you say that.

208
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,363
Some ladies are not worthy of respect.

209
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:42,433
Wow.

210
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,543
Using brand name stuff, although you wrap yourself in—

211
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,243
That's enough!

212
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,220
When I was with you, I never asked for a baht!

213
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,783
You were the one who gave me money.

214
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,605
You hoped for something in return,

215
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:00,966
but when I didn't, you were very disappointed.

216
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:04,064
Do you dare to retort? I'll report your behavior to The Legend.

217
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,446
Go on!

218
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:06,926
Go ahead.

219
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:12,363
Because if you report me, I'll tell your girlfriend your true colors.

220
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:17,206
Your business is in trouble, right?

221
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:20,840
Then suddenly you date the bank owner's daughter.

222
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,000
If you say I'm hungry for money, you're no different from me!

223
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,163
Watch your mouth, Prae!

224
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,543
What's going on?

225
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,106
Nothing.

226
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,743
I'm about to go in.

227
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:56,343
All I said just now is true.

228
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,623
I'll go check backstage.

229
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,466
Sorry.

230
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,073
It's me.

231
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:06,043
Cry... cry it out.
[Exit]

232
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:16,863
After you're done, wipe away your tears.
[Exit]

233
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,103
I'm waiting here.

234
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,623
You won't be alone.

235
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,223
When you're ready, come out.

236
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:03,383
And this collection of diamond necklaces worth ฿105,999,000 ($2.9 million) goes to Madam Wimol!

237
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,420
[Tifóne]

238
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,233
I'd like to congratulate all of you for acquiring this diamond collection from Tifóne!

239
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,926
Thank you to all honored guests who have attended today's event.

240
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:28,463
I wish everyone a safe trip back.

241
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:39,923
Say hello to your mother for me. Thank you.

242
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:44,440
Please. Have a safe trip.

243
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
Please.

244
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:52,100
How was it, Dad?

245
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,206
Good, you organized the event very well.

246
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:58,460
Mom sent me a message saying that

247
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,653
you reserved a good restaurant in Singapore for her.

248
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:07,883
I'm not wrong that I got you, a talented man, as my son-in-law.

249
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,693
By the way,

250
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,650
where shall we talk?

251
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,490
An important matter like this, we can't let many people know.

252
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:25,123
A special room has been prepared.

253
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,713
Is everything all right?

254
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,313
Yes.

255
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:39,384
We already know there will be a party after the event for shareholders and their families.

256
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:42,107
This is private. Don't let anyone know.

257
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,993
There will be two people from our team who will take care of the party.

258
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:47,718
It must be Pak and Rin, of course.

259
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:50,090
Let's go, Guys. Let's prepare for the party.

260
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,153
The ones who are going inside are me and Lita.

261
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:04,860
Why?

262
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,560
Rin is the Department Manager.

263
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,513
Why isn't she taking care of the shareholders?

264
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:12,823
This is a direct order from Mr. Jakchai.

265
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,660
All right, everyone, let's do our job.

266
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,203
Don't let irrelevant people enter the party.

267
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,746
Please be careful.

268
00:26:40,446 --> 00:26:42,346
Thank you.

269
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,040
Instead of you,

270
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,703
he lets his girl, Lita, go in. Is it okay?

271
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,386
There are only big shareholders, secrets and important matters.

272
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,063
Isn't he afraid that Lita will fail?

273
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:04,160
Hey. It pissed me off.

274
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,673
Isn't it annoying? Seeing that an affair is better than the manager who is Rin.

275
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:12,823
Oh, when Madam Mon was away, he did it shamelessly.

276
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:24,620
I'm sorry, P'Rin.

277
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,523
I never thought of being disrespectful toward you.

278
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,113
I also apologize to you all

279
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:37,333
if it makes you feel bad or uncomfortable.

280
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,400
It's okay.

281
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,006
It's the executive's order; it's not your fault.

282
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:47,193
Once you enter the party, take good care of everyone.

283
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:50,483
Don't ruin our VIP name, okay?

284
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,380
Yes.

285
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,471
So excuse me.

286
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,063
I'll just have to keep a few more sets in reserve.

287
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,010
Lita.

288
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,543
I'm afraid there will be a problem with the wine.

289
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:34,006
Let me check a bit. Many bottles have gone bad today.

290
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,506
Okay.

291
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,923
This one also has a slight stain. Can you change it?

292
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,993
I think there's no problem.

293
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,063
I'll leave you to take care of the party.

294
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
This way.

295
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:20,033
Can I have a glass of wine?

296
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:30,053
Normally, Rin would take care of this kind of job

297
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:32,683
so why did you come today instead?

298
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:34,386
Are you new here?

299
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:36,406
Yes.

300
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:40,184
You're cute.

301
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:42,560
Can you drink some wine with me?

302
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:47,260
Tonight, shall we go dine together?

303
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,866
You'll be happy for sure.

304
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:51,693
Hello, Mr. Somkid.

305
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:52,910
Hello.

306
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,613
Is everything all right?

307
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:57,321
Yes.

308
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,950
Didn't your wife come with you today?

309
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:11,553
Are you all right?

310
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,863
Excuse me for a moment.

311
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,763
How... is everything?

312
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:34,014
Everything is fine, Sir.

313
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:35,614
Don't worry.

314
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,206
Good.

315
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:47,040
Jak, today's party is not an ordinary party, is it?

316
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,060
I see only shareholders here.

317
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,683
Can you whisper to me what is your plan?

318
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,040
No need to whisper,

319
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,623
because I intend to tell everyone, anyway.

320
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:07,073
Everyone, please come this way.

321
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:08,573
Please.

322
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,363
Please.

323
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:23,248
I'm holding this party today...

324
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:26,791
because I'd like to request cooperation from everyone.

325
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:35,543
At the next general meeting of shareholders,

326
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:41,923
I would like to request everyone's cooperation to remove Mr. Chokchai as President.

327
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,386
Are you going to remove your father?

328
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:54,626
Forty percent of the Board are founding members who side with him.

329
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:58,403
Doing this will cause internal problems.

330
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:19,731
Aren't these two people the subordinates of Chairman Chokchai?

331
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:25,339
Thanks very much to Mr. Praphan and Mr. Wittaya for understanding

332
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,922
and joining me with the same ideology.

333
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:32,163
If we have only these two in our hands,

334
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:35,363
the other party will find it hard to exercise power.

335
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,998
The most important thing is

336
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:43,040
my father is very old now.

337
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,106
His health is not good.

338
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,043
I think it's time for him to rest.

339
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:56,626
I think if Chairman Chokchai is still in position, our department store will lag behind.

340
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,573
The world has changed.

341
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:03,963
I want a new generation, like Jakchai, to manage the business.

342
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,233
I'm not saying this because he's my son-in-law.

343
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:12,720
I just want to make a bet on it because I am a businessman.

344
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,683
I'm just thinking about the numbers.

345
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,693
You all don't have to worry.

346
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:23,180
My father laid a very good foundation for the company.

347
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:29,483
I'm just taking on the responsibility as the new generation to continue his ideology.

348
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,420
Let's drink to the future of The Legend.

349
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,029
Come on!

350
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:55,873
Have you seen Meena?

351
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:58,573
I haven't seen her since we finished the job.

352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,183
Rin, Prae...

353
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:17,503
Can you tell Meena to wait for me?

354
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,483
I have something to talk with her about.

355
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:26,333
What is the matter?

356
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:31,620
Just tell Meena to wait for me.

357
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,996
Thank you very much.

358
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,326
Something that you want to talk about...

359
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:37,730
Is it about Meena having another man?

360
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,453
Why do you say this?

361
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:45,506
Do you know something? Or did Meena tell you?

362
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,036
I beg you.

363
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,223
If you know anything, please tell me.

364
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:53,433
I don't want any problems. I want to stop this now. Please!

365
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:54,823
I'm just making a guess.

366
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:57,386
So why did you say this?

367
00:35:57,386 --> 00:36:02,473
If... if Meena is having an affair, please tell me.

368
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:04,126
Rin!

369
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,770
Whatever the problem is, I believe

370
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,380
you and Meena will get through it.

371
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,646
At least, you two already have responsibility to care for your children together.

372
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:24,928
I don't know. Perhaps the current problem is the children.

373
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:27,806
The work alone is already tiring enough.

374
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:31,320
We both work; we also have children to care for.

375
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,453
Don't you plan to have another child?

376
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,413
I can't handle any more!

377
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,303
It's too much to handle for me now.

378
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:44,243
Meena had me get sterilized after we had our second child.

379
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,523
Meena asked you to get a vasectomy?

380
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,420
Right.

381
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,850
Let's drink, come on.

382
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:23,267
Meena.

383
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:24,367
Rin.

384
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,350
What is wrong?

385
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,570
We need to talk.

386
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:40,850
How could you do this to me?

387
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,950
I trusted you wholeheartedly.

388
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,490
It's necessary for me.

389
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,134
"Necessary"?

390
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,438
How could you say it was necessary?

391
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:58,221
If I don't do it, I have to endure and work here until I die.

392
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:00,498
Is this your reason?

393
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:05,550
Is this why you are having an affair with P'Pak?

394
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,347
What did you say?

395
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:14,690
I think you've got it wrong.

396
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,520
Got what wrong?

397
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,330
Last night, you came here after I sent you a message.

398
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,153
So you were the one who sent that message?

399
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:27,693
Yes.

400
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:30,333
And I didn't send it to you alone,

401
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,780
but you were the only one who came.

402
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,890
Are you scared?

403
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:39,590
You are afraid that I'll expose you for having an affair with P'Pak.

404
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:42,934
Rin,

405
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,240
calm down. Listen to me first.

406
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,870
I'll tell you the truth.

407
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,970
What truth?

408
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,800
I know one more thing.

409
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,590
You're pregnant.

410
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,614
The baby in your womb...

411
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:06,350
Is that P'Pak's baby?

412
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:10,587
P'Pak protected you today because he knows you are pregnant, right?

413
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:13,017
It's not like that.

414
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:18,073
P'Pak knows it because he happened to see me at the hospital.

415
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:20,770
I begged him to keep it a secret.

416
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,063
But nothing is between us.

417
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,863
I don't believe you!

418
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,430
Why are you hiding it if the baby is not P'Pak's child?

419
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,090
Why are you hiding it, Meena?

420
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,870
How could you do this to me?

421
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,170
Are you pregnant, Meena?

422
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,980
Do you really have someone else?

423
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,270
Why are you doing this?

424
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,193
With Khun Pak?

425
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,513
Enough.

426
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:56,854
It's...

427
00:39:56,854 --> 00:40:00,140
It's not as you two think.

428
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,793
Nothing is between me and Pak at all. Actually...

429
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:06,027
- The truth is...
- Rin, Rin.

430
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,287
We have big trouble.

431
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:10,707
Is there a bigger one than this?

432
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,610
Khun Montira is here.

433
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,960
Where is she?

434
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,793
Meena.

435
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,020
Let's talk about it.

436
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,907
No!

437
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:35,807
Meena!

438
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,877
You did a good job.

439
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:53,847
A man must dare to think about something big.

440
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:56,410
You're my idol, Father.

441
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,697
Khun Montira.

442
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,800
The waiting room is over there.

443
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,153
If you want something special, I'll have the team prepare it for you.

444
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:37,990
You should know well whom I'm looking for.

445
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:46,030
A good wine smells like this.

446
00:41:48,314 --> 00:41:50,214
Mon.

447
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,493
Oh, Mon.

448
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:04,050
I thought you wouldn't come. We were talking just now, wishing you were here.

449
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:09,056
How can I miss a private party like this?

450
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:15,980
Why are you here?

451
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,547
Why can't I come? I'm your wife.

452
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:22,553
Even that brat can be here.

453
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,870
Take Lita out now.

454
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,640
Take it easy, Mon.

455
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,580
Do you know whom she is?

456
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,327
Mon.

457
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:31,927
Wait!

458
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,007
You're here at the event.

459
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,910
What is your duty?

460
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:48,612
I'm in charge of wine.

461
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:50,507
Are you good at wine?

462
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:52,550
Pick me a bottle.

463
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:06,633
What kind of wine is it?

464
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,393
It's 1987 Chateau Margaux.

465
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:16,380
It is a full-bodied wine with high astringency.

466
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,910
The aroma and taste are soft and deep as it is well-fermented.

467
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:27,810
Old wine with deep taste and good quality.

468
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,253
But some men

469
00:43:32,253 --> 00:43:35,100
are like new wines,

470
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,170
because they are cheap.

471
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,350
Is there something like that here?

472
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,830
Pour me a glass.

473
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,668
The wine went bad.

474
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:06,727
So smelly.

475
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,240
But it's not the aroma of the wine, it's your scent.

476
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,410
It smells like garbage.

477
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:21,530
Designer brand clothes like these don't suit you.

478
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:32,050
Come on, let's drink.

479
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,850
I'm really sorry.

480
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:35,590
I ruined everything.

481
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,727
It's all right, Lita. It is all right.

482
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:46,210
I think you should go home now. Don't worry; I'll take care of it myself.

483
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,980
Let's go.

484
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:11,395
Mon, Mon!

485
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,260
Stop right now.

486
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,299
I told you to stop!

487
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,027
What the heck are you doing?

488
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:21,742
With everything that happened,

489
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:25,554
the Board won't agree to vote Jakchai as President.

490
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:29,140
Why did you have to ruin your husband's career?

491
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,228
Nobody cared about me! Why do I have to care about others?

492
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:36,074
You're completely useless.

493
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:39,914
I've been useless to you for such a long time already.

494
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:43,175
I'm just one of your pawns for business growth!

495
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:46,427
My husband also sees me as a pawn.

496
00:47:46,427 --> 00:47:49,542
Can you please calm down? Let's talk at home.

497
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:53,107
It doesn't matter where we have this conversation.

498
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:55,787
How could you do this to me?

499
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:59,528
Your husband may do something wrong,

500
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:02,459
but he never let anyone outshine you.

501
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,646
What do you want from me?

502
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:07,874
I apologize on behalf of my daughter.

503
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:09,840
She never uses her brain.

504
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,291
Dad? Why did you apologize to him?

505
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,314
You should have protected me!

506
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:19,060
You're making something out of nothing.

507
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,434
No one died due to this. You're insane!

508
00:48:22,434 --> 00:48:25,254
I feel really bad for your husband!

509
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:59,715
Ma'am, I...

510
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:02,477
You must think that I was so mean.

511
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:11,437
I understand that you had your own reasons.

512
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:16,418
Well, I was really mean.

513
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:22,799
I couldn't affect my husband so I took it out on his girl.

514
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:29,817
But it's good.

515
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:34,685
Taking it out (venting) on someone with a lower position than me

516
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:39,398
made me feel better about my miserable life.

517
00:49:41,694 --> 00:49:44,259
The world is nasty to me.

518
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,577
Why should I be nice?

519
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,754
Hey, I'll take care of this table.

520
00:50:56,374 --> 00:50:57,774
Meena.

521
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,360
Meena!
[Tifóne]

522
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:03,264
Let's talk it out, Meena.

523
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:07,218
Meena! Meena!

524
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:11,478
Come back here and talk.

525
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,680
Meena!

526
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:21,080
Is this why you wanted to live by yourself?

527
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,442
So you could sneak out and meet him?

528
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:28,905
Will you stop that? I'm carrying your child!

529
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,654
Wait!

530
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,120
You're talking nonsense!

531
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,800
If you were really carrying my child, why hide it from me?

532
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,122
Because I'm getting an abortion!

533
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,521
I can barely take care of our two children!

534
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:45,399
I'm exhausted.

535
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:47,730
I also want to work.

536
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:52,539
I love my family, and I love my job!

537
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:56,500
I can't handle everything on my own anymore.

538
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,991
Why is this world so cruel to me?

539
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,817
Why did you have to hurt our child?

540
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,894
Why would you consider an abortion? It didn't do anything!

541
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:06,814
You guys, please calm down.

542
00:52:06,814 --> 00:52:08,894
You need to talk nicely.

543
00:52:08,894 --> 00:52:10,374
"Talk nicely"?

544
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:14,037
You got my husband's mind all twisted!

545
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:19,473
I had no affair with P'Pak! I'm pregnant with my husband's child.

546
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:22,874
But you said that your husband got a vasectomy.

547
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:29,717
Jomphol, you told her that?

548
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,514
That day,

549
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:43,505
my husband ran out of the operating room crying.

550
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:46,280
He said he was scared, and he couldn't do it!

551
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,007
Is that true?

552
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:52,080
It's true! But it doesn't confirm that the baby is mine.

553
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,654
What if the baby is someone else's?

554
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:56,100
- How could our sons and I live?
- What do you want?

555
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,647
Should we have a DNA test?

556
00:52:57,647 --> 00:53:01,078
We can wait for its birth to test it. But I'll break up with you before then!

557
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:04,647
I can't live with you if you don't trust me!

558
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:07,957
Hey, calm down.

559
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:14,187
When Rin sent a threatening message last night, why did you come?

560
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:18,867
I just wanted to see who sent it and explain that they got it all wrong!

561
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:21,678
I know who is having an affair with P'Pak.

562
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:24,154
You do?

563
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:28,437
Who is it? Meena, who?

564
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:31,008
Meena, who?

565
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:32,769
- Tell me.
- Meena?

566
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:35,527
Meena, are you okay?

567
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:38,055
Take her to the hospital.

568
00:53:38,055 --> 00:53:40,686
Meena, Meena!

569

Rin.

570
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,337
I talked to Jomphol and Meena earlier.

571
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,520
Meena was so stressed that she fainted.

572
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,398
Jomphol took her to the hospital already. She should feel better.

573
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:12,898
She insisted that she didn't have an affair with P'Pak,

574
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,278
but she knew whom it was.

575
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:25,554
But she didn't answer me. She fainted first.

576
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,417
I don't know if she is lying.

577
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,478
Got it, P'Pak.

00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:53,638

591

They're here, the celeb couple of our mall.

592
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:58,841
They're so cute together.

594
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:03,814
I do; everyone knows them.

595
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:08,641
They're the right-hand persons of Khun Jakchai, the vice president.
