Can I have it, too?

00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:09,633
Mick, Max.

10
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:12,693
Why aren't you in bed yet?

11
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:16,000
It's very late. The nanny told me that you were asleep already.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,153
And why are you eating ice cream late at night?

13
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:21,082
If Mom finds out, she will scold me to death.

14
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,379
Am I such a grumpy woman?

15
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,839
Meena.

16
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:30,499
We were already asleep, but we woke up when Mom came home.

17
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,860
Mom said she was coming back here.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,384
Mom bought a lot of ice cream to celebrate.

19
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,479
- Hooray!
- Hooray.

20
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,689
Is it tasty?

21
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,483
Did you share?

22
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:47,613
Brush your teeth and go to bed quickly.

23
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,246
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay.

24
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:01,254
Are you really back here to stay?

25
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,786
That's good.

26
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,583
Then Danai can't mess with you.

28
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,443
Can I ask you something?

I... I just want to know.

I don't want you to think too much,

31
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:46,693
but I want to know how we ended up like this.

32
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:53,683
Before, our family was amazing.

33
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:56,733
I just want to know,

34
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,206
did I do something wrong?

35
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,763
If I made a mistake, I will fix it.

36
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:07,523
Actually, you didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,462
I was wrong.

38
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:15,173
When you told me to quit and care for the children at home,

39
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:19,670
I was uncomfortable every time I heard it.

40
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,423
For me...

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,843
working is a part of my life.

42
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:37,123
If I quit, it means that...

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,923
all my efforts will be wasted.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,060
You...

45
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,540
Why are you carrying all these things alone?

46
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,343
Why didn't you tell me, Meena?

47
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,643
I was scared.

48
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:17,995
I... I was afraid you would get angry.

49
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,998
I'm afraid that you will hate me.

50
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:29,941
I can't even act like a normal mother and wife like other women.

51
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,706
I am sorry.

52
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,851
Sorry, that...

53
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,743
I haven't tried to tell you anything all these years.

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,866
Hey.

55
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:51,183
There's no need to say sorry.

56
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,293
I'm the one who should be sorry.

57
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,223
I never understood anything about you.

58
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,560
From now on, if you have problems, tell me.

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,243

I respect every decision you make,

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,520

00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,143
Please, let's get back together.

- Yes.
- Yes.

- Do as we agreed.
- Okay.

- Proceed with it.
- Yes, Sir.

81
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:18,756
This evening... Come to my room to provide the report.

82
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,256
Yes.

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,270
Have some manners; don't just barge in.

84
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:38,571
After what you did last night, you shouldn't even mention manners.

85
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,387
Meena flirted with me first.

86
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,987
You disgust me.

87
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:50,430
Aren't you ashamed of what you've done?

88
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,210
You don't think anyone can do anything to you, right?

89
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,830
You're very confident of your team member, aren't you?

90
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll tell you something.

91
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,004
Meena and I are more than that.

92
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,633
She won't sue me anyway.

93
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,350
You mean

94
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:15,580
your order to have Meena record the video clip?

95
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,989
I already know everything.

96
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,367
Meena confessed to me.

97
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,520
If I tell Mr. Jakchai about this,

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,780
Mr. Yutthachai likely can't help you, either.

99
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,914
I think you...

100
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:32,523
will probably get kicked out.

101
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,487
Do you dare? Do you dare?

102
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:39,170
If you tell Mr. Jakchai, Meena will be in trouble, too. Go ahead.

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,664
She confessed to what she did.

104
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,310
Of course, I will help my team member.

105
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,359
I haven't spoken of it yet because I don't want things to get any messier.

106
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:57,273
But if you don't stop doing evil things,

107
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,870
I'll make you pay.

108
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,436
I'm here to warn you.

109
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:07,650

Rin. Rin.

111
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,590
What did you talk to Danai about? You looked very serious.

112
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,093
It was just a misunderstanding.

113
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,630
We've cleared things up so there won't be more problems later.

114
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,940
What's the matter? Do you need me to help?

115
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,188
You should know.

[Golden Tulip]

117
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,480
If you want anything, let me know.

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,620
This restaurant is owned by my friend, Tik.

119
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,890
She opened it just for fun at first. But it went well

120
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,090
so she has opened many branches.

121
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,707
It looks delicious. I'll order more later.

122
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:31,190
Just seeing you brothers and sisters together like this,

123
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,250
I'm so delighted.

124
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:39,647
How about you, Nate? Did you find anything uncomfortable after starting the job?

125
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:43,440
You've laid a good foundation. I'm more than happy.

126
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,573
But there's one thing I don't understand.

127
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:46,707
What is it?

128
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:50,590
Transferring an employee from the VIP Team.

129
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,450
I saw that you had an order to move Rin to Phuket,

130
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,813
but you canceled it suddenly.

131
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,570
It's not like you at all.

132
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:08,035
At first, the Phuket team needed talented staff to help them,

133
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,547
but I thought about it.

134
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:13,853
Rin is responsible for many big, important projects here

135
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,030
so I canceled the order.

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,070
Are you sure your VIP Team doesn't have any problems?

137
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,213
Yes, I'm sure.

138
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,070
I didn't ask you.

139
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,530
I asked Lita.

140
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,860
I have to ask someone on the team, right, Lita?

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,690
Does Rin have a problem? You can tell me.

142
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:51,487
No.

143
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:59,040
I already told you my VIP Team has no problems.

144
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,617
Rin is fully committed to working for me.

145
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,727
Don't worry about me.

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,827
But I saw you trying to befriend Rin.

147
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,877
Are you planning to turn my subordinate into yours?

148
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,376
I knew it. Who will work for a novice like you?

149
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:26,967
So you plan to poach people from other teams.

150
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,567
That's so wicked, Sis.

151
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:31,285
You know me too well.

152
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:35,532
Let's see how long you can maintain your position

153
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,499
as President without anyone working for you.

154
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,110
You're talking and teasing each other just like when you were little.

155
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,812
You guys know each other very well,

156
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:51,529
as expected of siblings.

157
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,767
Eat more, Dad.

158
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:00,010
Have some fish, here.

159
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,990
I'm here to see you, Mom.

160
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,230
Don't worry, Mom.

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,150
I'm fine.

162
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:35,370
Do you remember the promise you made to my mom?

163
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,453
Pak.

164
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,833
Can you take me on a trip?

165
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,247
Sure, Mom.

166
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,820
But be patient and wait for your condition to improve a little more.

167
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,150
So I won't be able to go?

168
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,890
Then take Lita on many trips instead.

169
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,220
I can go by myself, Mom.

170
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,227
Don't bother P'Pak.

171
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,550
I like it when you are with Pak.

172
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:09,930
He's the only person who can make you smile.

173
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,930
Can you promise me,

174
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,350
you'll take care of Lita forever?

175
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,930
Don't leave Lita.

176
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,487
Sure, Mom.

177
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,287
I promise.

178
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,187
I remember it.

179
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,633
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:41,113
I didn't mean to pressure you or ask about that promise.

181
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,410

- Rin isn't here yet, right?
- Not Yet.

184
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:11,046
So why didn't you answer my call yesterday? What were you doing?

185
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:14,815
Our whole team was busy yesterday.

186
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,740
There were probably two people who weren't busy.

187
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,890
Hey.

188
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,473
I'm telling you something. Don't tell Rin. I pity her.

189
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:25,566
Yesterday, I went to a temple to ask for lottery numbers.

190
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:30,397
I got them, not the numbers, but those two.

191

Pak and Lita holding hands at the temple,

192
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:38,037
walking hand in hand.

193
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,306
If it wasn't at the temple, it would probably be a piggyback ride.

194
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:46,126
I really wanted you to see when Pak made a promise to Lita!

195
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,606
"It's all my fault."

196
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:52,540
"I promise that I won't leave you. I'll take care of you, Lita."

197
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,463
Do you believe that? When Lita's mom was still alive,

198
00:15:57,463 --> 00:16:00,906
Pak also promised her that he would take care of Lita!

199
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:05,353
At that time, he hadn't even broken up with Rin.

200
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,293
And do you know what Lita said?

201
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:10,606
"Thank you so much for being by my side."

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,360
Right, Rin? Oh!

Stop showing it off so much.

you flirted in the office,

281
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:10,031
and you two had dinner here.

282
00:25:11,204 --> 00:25:13,796
Did you really think no one would find out?

283
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:20,738
I tried so hard not to react and hid the fact that you were having an affair with this slut.

284

303
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,647
I spent my life with you and wanted the rest of my life with you.

304

Have you no responsibility for that?

305
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:51,239
Is it because I look strong, unlike a flimsy girl like her?

306
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:54,350
Is that why you don't care how I feel?

307

I'm sorry.

308
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,806

I wouldn't mind doing what you did over and over again,

333
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,584
but I can't.

334
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,768
I've caught my husband cheating on me so many times,

335
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:28,867
and he had a daughter.

336
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:32,988
Still, I couldn't do anything. I just had to hide this feeling.

337
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:38,561
We have different status in society,

338

340
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:24,805
I prepared your lunch for you and the boys.

341
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:27,910
I told you it's okay. I can do it.

342
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,725
Don't worry.

343
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,514
When you weren't around, I learned how to cook from YouTube.

344
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:35,687
They'll be tasty, all of it. Right, Boys?

345
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,985
I'll eat only half of it.

346
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,251
And I'll throw away the other half.

347
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,492
Hey, Mick and Max,

348
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:45,024
you won't get any ice cream tonight.

349
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,944
No more ice cream for you.

350
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,664
Here.

351
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:50,377
I prepared some fruit for you.

352
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:53,356
Here, have some.

353
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:07,887
My husband made me lunch, dessert and fruit.

Why don't you help me take care of it?

356
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:17,987

00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:26,212
will love each other even more after they fight and make up.

359
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,105
Well, how was it last night?

360
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:34,879
Are you crazy? I'm pregnant.

361
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:39,724
Nothing's permanent in this world.

362
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:45,342
I remember that you said you were jealous of me and P'Pak.

363
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:47,690
Look at me now.

364
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,301
I envy your love life.

365
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,738
Jomphol is so sweet.

366
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:56,729
I'm jealous of both of you.

367
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,426
Why's that?

368
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:03,037
You don't have to repay your mother's debts like I do.

369
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,485
Don't leave me alone.

370
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,035
Don't be silly. How could I?

371
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:14,045
We have been through so many problems.

372
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:17,866
At least, we're lucky that we have each other.

373
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:23,637
Keep on going.

374
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,798
- Let's fight together!
- Yes.

375
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:27,702
Yes!

376
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,879
Oh, Lita.

377
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,028
Haven't you finished the meeting documents?

378
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:55,800
Wait. Hold on.

379
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
What are these?

380
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,381
I didn't tell you to make copies of this report.

381
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:04,719
How many copies did you make?

382
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,578
About twenty.

383
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,453
"Twenty"?

384
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,662
That's 300 pages, Lita.

385
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:12,588
Why aren't you focused?

386
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:14,933
Do you know how many trees go into paper?

387
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,860
It's wasteful.

388
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,864
I'm sorry.

389
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,909
I'll get the new tasks, okay?

390
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,279
Wait.

391
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,879
Come here.

392
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:30,791
Before that, you have to finish the old task.

393
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,837
If you don't finish the old one,

394
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:36,263
then you might make the same mistake again.

395
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:37,925
Do you understand?

396
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,431
"Clear the old task"?

397
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:41,633
That's right.

398
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,565
Why are you still standing here?

399
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:48,550
Come on, finish the old ones first so you can do the next.

400
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,950
Hurry.

401
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:16,614
P'Rin?

402
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,491
Can I have a word with you?

403
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,250
I'll only talk to you about work.

404
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,290
But I need to talk to you.

405
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,805
Lita, what do you want to talk to her about?

406
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:44,464
About us.

407
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,832
I'd like to clear things with you.
[VIP Department, Purchasing Department, Production Department, IT Department]

408
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:51,299
I don't want to.

409
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,332
I'm sorry. I need to fix this.

410
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,558
Thank you.

411
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,143
Can we talk now?

412
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:22,366
You told me that I like leftover food...

413
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:27,754
because Pak is someone you don't want anymore, right?

414
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,669
Well, not for me.

415
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,879
He's more than that.

416
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,472
Lita.

417
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:39,438
Don't say anything right now.

418
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:40,982
Let's talk later.

419
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,776
No.

420
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,924
I need to.

421
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:51,320
If he means nothing to you,

422
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:55,091
can you please let him go?

423
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,964
Can you let him be happy?

424
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,914
You're so shameless.

425
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,443
You're a mistress.

426
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:11,722
How dare you ask me to get out of your way?

427
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:15,010
This is not just for me,

428
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,149
but for Pak as well.

429
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:19,603
So he won't have to live in this mess.

430
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:21,509
What about you?

431
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:26,602
Do you want to continue living like this?

432
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:30,719
Don't you want to be happy with someone else?

433
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:33,843
Stop pretending to worry about me.

434
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:36,276
How about this?

435
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:40,042
I could ask my dad to transfer Pak and me to another city or overseas,

436
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,946
then you won't have to see our faces again.

437
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:45,657
What do you say?

438
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:49,503
Otherwise, what do you want me to do?

439
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:53,335
I'll make you and P'Pak...

440
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:55,989
go to Hell with me.

00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:02,009
Please, P'Rin.

442

Can you not do that?

443
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:10,360
Can you just let P'Pak and me go?

444
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:15,789
Please, P'Rin?

Please, P'Rin?

00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:40,396
Can you let us both go? Please?

449
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,392
Stop right now, Lita.

450
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:55,994
Stop being so pathetic.

451
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:58,074
Please? I beg you.

I beg you.

Why are you sitting like that?

456
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,590
We... got stuck in the elevator.

457
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,170
Lita couldn't take it and fainted.

What the heck did you do?

460
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,087
Everyone saw what you did, including Treenate.

461
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,949
Why don't you show your affection in front of the building then?

- It's okay.
- Pak.

466
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,088
How could I fire you?

467
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:05,572
We've been through a lot together.

468
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,705

I'd like to talk to you, man to man.

471
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:29,429
You need to control all of your women.

472
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:36,178
Otherwise, they will tear everything down.

473
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:40,872

This is the champagne we have prepared for our guests.

481

This champagne is the same kind that they serve in first-class flights.

482
00:43:43,144 --> 00:43:45,923
Good choice.

Thank you, Ma'am.

00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,270
I have always paid attention to our services.

485
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:55,166
I just received the sales report for last quarter.

486
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:59,205
I saw that the VIP Team generated the highest revenue for this mall.

487
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:01,272
Now I know why.

488
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:05,409
It's because we have employees like you.

489
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,662
You have been taking such good care of our clients.

490
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:12,350
I like to learn new things all the time.

491
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,188
Initially, I didn't quite get what the VIP society wanted.

492
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:21,741
I'm so lucky that Mrs. Rinnara was there to help me.

493
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:24,488
She's been working in the VIP Team for such a long time.

494
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:27,399
So she knows how to deal with VIP clients.

495
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:30,878
She knows what they want.

496
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:34,749
So that means...

497
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:40,578
you must be really close to Rinnara.

498
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:45,540
We're very close. I go party at her house all the time.

499
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,663
But after she separated with Mr. Pak, I don't...

500
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:56,319
Is he... separated from Rinnara?

501
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,919

Jiraphorn, your good friend, told her.

518
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:28,300
Are you sure that she told Ms. Treenate?

519
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,543

Do I need to tell you why my sister visited the shop this morning?

523
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:48,372
It's because my right-hand man, my daughter, and the VIP Team's head were all acting weird!

00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:52,566
I'm sorry, it's just that

538
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:55,560
I was watching a clip of dogs fighting, and it's so funny.

539
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:57,982
Rin?

540
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,649
I'm talking to you.

541
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:02,009
Is this the right time to watch that?

542
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:06,358
If you don't want your sister to be suspicious,

543
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:09,251
I have an idea.

544
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,251
But I don't know if everyone would be okay with it.

545
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:18,974
What is it?

546
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:55,419
What's with the look?

547
00:49:55,419 --> 00:50:00,101
Aren't you happy that you can go inside our house one more time?

548
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:03,788
By doing this, what are you aiming for?

549
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:06,804
What do you mean?

550
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,444
Ms. Treenate was suspicious about us.

551
00:50:08,444 --> 00:50:10,805
I'm doing this for the VIP Team.

552
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:18,333
You're tormented, aren't you?

553
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:24,701
Lita just asked me to let you go so you two can stay together.

554
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:27,217
But you're stuck with me like this.

555
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,002
Well, hang in there.

556
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,737
You're welcome.

557
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,570
Wait.

558
00:50:47,132 --> 00:50:49,376
This is so Ms. Treenate won't question us.

559
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,982
My baby is home.

560
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:58,520
He has his suitcase with him, hooray!

561
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,231
Welcome home, Baby.

562
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:47,844
My baby is home.

563
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:50,201
He has his suitcase with him, hooray!

564
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:52,734
Welcome home, Baby.

565
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:56,802
He looks exhausted because he has been working so hard.

566
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,927
Let me help you with that.

567
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,474
Lita.

568
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:01,125
P'Pak.

569
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:08,513
Did you move back in with P'Rin?

570
00:53:08,513 --> 00:53:11,565
Because you wanted to fool others,

571
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:16,257
or are you both really getting back together?

572
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:18,517
What are you talking about?

573
00:53:18,517 --> 00:53:21,125
I saw the clip P'Rin posted.

574
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,880
She also tagged me.

575
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:28,615
She said that everything would be back to normal.

576
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,567
What is normal?

577
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:38,608
Lita. Don't overthink it.

578
00:53:38,608 --> 00:53:43,774
She just posted the clip for Ms. Treenate to see. It's nothing.

579
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:46,960
I didn't know.

580
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,482
I can't help but keep thinking about it.

581
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:55,285
I don't like it.

582
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,469
If I ask you something,

583
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:03,293
can you promise me you won't be angry?

584
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:20,030
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

585
00:54:20,988 --> 00:54:23,188
Our bed is made.

586
00:54:23,188 --> 00:54:25,316
Let's go to bed.

587
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,028
You can sleep on the couch or anywhere in this house.

588
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:52,148
Suit yourself.

[The Legend]

600
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,441
P'Pak.

601
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:11,900
Let me help you with that.

602
00:57:19,915 --> 00:57:21,853
You look so dapper today.

603
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,789
Why do you look like that, Lita?

604
00:58:00,652 --> 00:58:03,065
Is something bothering you?

605
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:05,344
Pak moved back in with you

606
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:08,632
because he worried that my aunt would know about us.

607
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:10,449
You shouldn't get the wrong idea.

608
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,669
Did P'Pak tell you that,

609
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:16,588
or are you telling yourself that?

610
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:18,374
P'Pak told me.

611
00:58:18,374 --> 00:58:20,569
You're so easy to persuade.

612
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:25,135
I don't know if you will believe me,

613
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,481
but we're close.

614
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:34,007
I think you would know what happened last night.

615
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:41,401
Do you still love him?

616
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:46,512
Why is that?

617
00:58:46,512 --> 00:58:50,495
If I love him or not has nothing to do with you.

618
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:56,987
If I tell you I still love him, will you back away?

619
00:58:56,987 --> 00:58:58,259
Fine.

620
00:58:58,259 --> 00:59:00,594
I still love him.

621
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,725
Now you should leave him.

622
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,141
Did you post the clip to tease the girl?

623
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:31,434
I teased the girl and the man.

624
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:35,934
The more uneasy P'Pak feels, the happier I am.

625
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:40,314
If you let P'Pak stay close to you like this,

626
00:59:40,314 --> 00:59:43,140
you'll be more hurt.

627
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:46,473
Or will you reconcile with him?

628
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:48,317
No way.

629
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:54,336
I just want the people who betrayed me to have my misery.

630
00:59:54,336 --> 00:59:57,794
I agree that you should get back at him.

631
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,176
But if you keep doing this,

632
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:02,220
it's not just he who will suffer.

633
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,806
You'll suffer as well.

634
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:07,418
I'll suffer either way.

635
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:13,288
I don't think it will be any different with one or two more wounds.

636
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:20,402
If you do this, when will you be able to heal?

637
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:03,216
Hello, Ms. Treenate?

638
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:08,036
You're in front of my house?

639
01:01:10,007 --> 01:01:11,307
Okay.

640
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,964
Sorry for stopping by so early.

641
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:40,538
I heard you just renovated the place so I got a little something for you.

642
01:01:40,538 --> 01:01:43,916
This is a gift for your renovated house.

643
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,116
Thank you.

644
01:01:53,354 --> 01:01:55,649
Mandarin ducks.

645
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:58,968
It symbolizes true love...

646
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:01,718
and faithfulness.

647
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:07,141
Chinese people believe that it will bring good luck to your house.

648
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,811
You can decorate your place with it.

649
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:27,864
Thank you, Ma'am.

650
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:32,611
I heard that you host parties for the VIP Team all the time.

651
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:35,769
Your place looks so cozy.

652
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:41,213
No wonder Lita always talks about this place.

653
01:02:41,213 --> 01:02:43,933
She said she wants a house like yours.

654
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,807
You have got it wrong.

655
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,534
Lita has never been here.

656
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,609
Oh, she hasn't?

657
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,012
Right.

658
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,016
Well, she should visit here soon.

659
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,979
Lita admires both of you so much.

660
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:09,504
Don't forget to invite me to your next party. It would be fun.

661
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,099
Sure, I will.

662
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:35,479
You know...

663
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:41,396
she did that because she wanted to break us.

664
01:03:41,396 --> 01:03:43,677
We're already broken.

665
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:46,374
No one has to break us.

666
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:48,831
We can't glue it back together.

667
01:04:00,263 --> 01:04:03,886
Mr. Pak and Mrs. Rin really moved back in together.

668
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:07,841
They moved back together, but it doesn't mean they love each other.

669
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:11,216
People who hate one another can still stay together.

670
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:16,675
Why do you think Mrs. Rin is protecting Mr. Jakchai?

671
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:20,541
She isn't protecting Jakchai.

672
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,994
She protects her VIP Team.

673
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:30,506
I hope there's no strong employee like Rin in the marketing team.

674

[Marketing Department]

675
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:40,347
Did you see the sales report that my sister received?

676
01:04:41,496 --> 01:04:43,335
Look at this.

677
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:45,956
This is the VIP Team's report...

678
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,634
and this is the marketing team's report.

679
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,845
This is so embarrassing!

680
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:54,670
We not only lost to them, but our numbers are even lower than last quarter's.

681
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:57,820
How can I show my face around?

682
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,600
Darn it!

01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:06,205

sent anything to you lately?

688

She wouldn't dare to make any move.

689
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:19,034

690

Keep pushing her.

691
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:23,925
Do I need to teach you everything?

692
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:26,722

- Yes?

01:07:06,746 --> 01:07:08,294
Will you talk to me nicely,

716
01:07:08,294 --> 01:07:10,249
or should I get physical?

717
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:12,267
- Help!
- Hey!

718
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,400
Someone like you...

719
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:57,940
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

720
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:04,940
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

721
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:12,440
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

722
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,870
♫ Please understand again ♫

723
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:23,570
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫
