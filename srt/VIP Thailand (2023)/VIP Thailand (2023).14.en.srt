🌟[VIP Thailand]🖤

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,993
I'd like to introduce you to the Privilege Team.

9
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:10,659
I don't think we need more than that.

10
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,135
You should know about them by now.

11
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:20,403
They will take care of our foreign clients and all VVIP clients.

12
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:25,528
But they are our top spenders and the highest-paying clients.

13
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,710
Their spending is even higher than all of our VIP clients.

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,224
That's right.

15
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,409
I must give VVIP clients special treatment.

16
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,809
The VIP team doesn't have to help with that.

17
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,033
We've been taking care of them just fine.

18
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,669
We are short of staff and we can hire more people.

19
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,950
I don't think we need another team to overlap the work.

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,305
Rin, even though you were promoted,

21
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:52,742
you're just a director.

22
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:56,650
Do you think I care what you think?

23
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:21,554
Rin, I have to do what Mr. Jakchai... asked me to.

24
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:25,168
But I'll make the minimum impact to your team.

25
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:28,323
If he's about to do anything to you, I'll warn you first.

26
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:30,023
No need to.

27
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:34,779
I don't need your good intentions anymore.

28
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,508
I don't trust you anymore.

29
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,016
But...

30
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:44,231
What do you want us to do?

31
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:52,481
P'Pak has tried to help you out all along.

32
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:57,485
And I deserved what I did.

33
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:58,713
I won't forgive you.

34
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:01,392
You don't have to.

35
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:04,920
Everybody knows that you two aren't together.

36
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:11,058
Well, I think we three should all get a fresh start...

37
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,385
in work and personal life.

38
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:14,981
Lita.

39
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,181
That's enough.

40
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:21,251
You're good.

41
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:27,565
I can't wait to see if your work is as good as your words.

42
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:45,225
Jak founded a new team to overlap with VIP

43
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,254
and to encourage his daughter, with the help of Pakawat.

44
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:51,749
I think this is too privileged.

45
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:56,320
Don't say it in a negative way.

46
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,237
Lita is my daughter.

47
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:02,494
But she's not too privileged.

48
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,351
She was born with a responsibility to manage the business.

49
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,044
One more thing.

50
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:13,153
I can give others many chances, but this is my own daughter.

51
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:17,054
You gave chances to people with high competence.

52
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:19,197
Is Lita competent?

53
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:24,597
Your daughter is having an affair so you founded another team!

54
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,503
You even appointed the cheating man to work there!

55
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,670
Don't you fear people will complain?

56
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,506
We can work on her competence.

57
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,444
Lita is his daughter;

58
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:42,378
blood is thicker than water.

59
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,215
If Lita and Pakawat would like to get serious,

60
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:52,068
can we wait until things cool down first?

61
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,487
Don't show it off too much.

62
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,291
It could be ruined.

63
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,628
Yes, Sir.

64
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,187
Rin is appointed as new director of VIP Team.

65
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,815
You should be satisfied, and everyone should be happy.

66
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:11,469
One more thing:

67
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:14,369
Pakawat doesn't take care of VIP Team anymore.

68
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:20,052
The ladies can show their real talents.

69
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,890
[The Legend]

70
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:38,589
We need new brand items to showcase at the VIP client's celebration party.

71
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,286
By tomorrow, can I get the list of brands for the party?

72
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:49,375
The launch of our team and VIP's celebration party will be on the same day.

73
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,821
Each brand needs to discuss which one will stay with what team.

74
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:58,519
Does this mean that not all brands will join VIP Team like before?

75
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:02,110
We need to host this party for our top spenders.

76
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,841
If things change, it'll be big trouble.

77
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,361
We've been working on it for too long.

78
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,103
Saint, what do you think?

79
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,758
Let me ask you something.

80
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:17,974
What are the differences of the Privilege Team and VIP Team?

81
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:20,468
Their jobs are overlapping,

82
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:26,618
and VIP Team's celebration party falls on the same day as Privilege Team's launch party.

83
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:29,869
This should be fun.

84
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:33,228
We can see who's the best.

85
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,900
Privilege Team will take care of VVIP clients

86
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,800
and foreign clients.

87
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,960
It means that VIP Team

88
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,240
will lose high-spending clients, right?

89
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:56,419
So we need to give old VIP clients to Privilege to take care of?

90
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,189
Do you think they'd like that?

91
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,162
Why wouldn't they?

92
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:04,046
They will be VVIP clients.

93
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:08,921
Or can clients not separate work and personal life

94
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,437
like everyone in this room?

95
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:20,066
If you don't like working with me for your personal reason,

96
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,573
then I'm sorry.

97
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,200
I can't change this fact.

98
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:36,371
Others in this room don't mix their personal life with work.

99
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,759
We're worried that VIP clients

100
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,630
won't be fine with new people to take care of them.

101
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,056
They didn't get to decide based on what they wanted or needed,

102
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:53,015
since they used to buy items from people they trusted.

103
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:56,345
Can I say something?

104
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,094
I am a manager.

105
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:03,281
My job is more than just tell them which items are the best ones.

106
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,822
We need to satisfy clients so they will come back to us.

107
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,945
People with money can buy products anywhere they want.

108
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:14,940
I can assure you that I know all my clients.

109
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,070
I know what they like or don't like.

110
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,797
Do you get it, Lita?

111
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:24,973
I kind of get that changing the team could cause decreased sales.

112
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,357
Thank you for letting me know.

113
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,472
What about this?

114
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:33,715
On Privilege Team's launch party, can I get the brand manager to help me?

115
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,757
- It's fine. We can share...
- No sharing.

116
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,359
Lita asked us...

117
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,166
then she can have all the brand managers.

118
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,606
VIP Team can take care of the celebration party on our own.

119
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,456
Thank you.

120
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,230
[VIP Management Team]

121
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,577
We have a big challenge.

122
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:30,967
Look at her saying we need to separate work from personal life.

123
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,229
Her dad couldn't do it.

124
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:36,624
You just encouraged them to get what they wanted.

125
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:39,061
They should have gone public by now.

126
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,770
I don't care. They can do what they want.

127
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,394
We're still working together, Rin.

128
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:50,217
How could we separate work from personal life?

129
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,796
Hey, let me ask you something. Must I be with them during the party?

130
00:09:56,974 --> 00:10:01,368
This is just like we are climbing a mountain,

131
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:05,172
but they are riding a helicopter to the top.

132
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:10,835
He founded the team to take our VIP clients.

133
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:13,847
You think someone like Lita can do it?

134
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,649
Maybe since P'Pak is helping her.

135
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,223
I'm not worried.

136
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,442
Do what they want.

137
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,870
It's fine. We can show them

138
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,790
our VIP team needs no luck.

139
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:42,677
Come on in.

140
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
Hey.

141
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,399
P'Pak, should we go to dinner together?

142
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,230
I don't think so. I'm busy, and I have a meeting.

143
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,636
I think I'll have dinner here. You can go.

144
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,470
Everyone knows about us already.

145
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:21,237
We have nothing to hide.

146
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,036
I've told you for so many times...

147
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:30,934
I can just take care of you.

148
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,598
That's it.

149
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,176
Why is that?

150
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,758
Why can't we date?

151
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,748
Or is it because you feel bad about Rin?

152
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,331
It's nothing like that.

153
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,331
But...

154
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:59,084
You should get this delivered.

155
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,239
I'd like to talk to you about what happened in the meeting room.

156
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:52,792
We can talk here.

157
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,957
Go ahead.

158
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,739
My team...

159
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:11,440
doesn't want to get in your way.

160
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,983
And I don't want to get in your way, either.

161
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,509
But you know that...

162
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:25,356
your team was founded to destroy my team.

163
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,317
I won't let that happen.

164
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,364
I won't let that happen, either.

165
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,604
It's good that we're fighting like this.

166
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:39,824
This is the first task, but our teams are already at it.

167
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,235
Listen.

168
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,191
It hurts me a little:

169
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,175
my team versus

170
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,775
your team.

171
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,064
We used to be on the same team.

172
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,710
You...

173
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:11,071
[Lalita]

174
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,543
Excuse me.

175
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,694
Where are you?

176
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:44,446
I'm waiting to have dinner with you.

177
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,103
I already ate.

178
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:48,442
I'm about to go to bed.

179
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,839
Rin, have you eaten?

180
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
- I bought you Japanese food.
- You should have it.

181
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,850
♫ If I were to love someone ♫

182
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:54,800
♫ I would never hurt my heart. Whomever I love, I’ll love only him ♫

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,870
♫ So why did you cheat? ♫

184
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:09,410
♫  Why didn’t you stop yourself? It is only I who loves this relationship ♫

185
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:16,490
♫ You once promised that we would love each other until the day we die ♫

186
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:25,410
♫ But when she came in, you easily forgot about me ♫

187
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,910
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

188
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:40,400
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

189
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,510
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

190
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,060
♫ Please understand again ♫

191
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,230
[The Best Team]
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫

192
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,360
♫ I don't want to believe it ♫

193
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:17,900
♫ You, a person I trusted, ruined this relationship ♫

194
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,680
♫ Dreams that I thought were beautiful, that we created together ♫

195
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,270
[The Best Team]

196
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,270
♫ Fell apart overnight♫

197
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,590
♫ You once promised that we would love each other until the day we die ♫

198
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,528
Rin. I sent you many restaurants to select.

199
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,498
Why did you choose this one?

200
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,959
Tell me. I'm learning from you.

201
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:52,809
Our VIP customers really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.

202
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,723
And I think it's a good fit to hold a celebration event.

203
00:17:55,723 --> 00:18:00,724
Most importantly, the award-winning Chef Keller is opening his restaurant here.

204
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:05,829
They will compete to be the big spenders to taste his dishes for the first time in Thailand.

205
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:08,205
Wow. So if the event works,

206
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:12,124
we can make this restaurant a regular venue for VIP customers.

207
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,270
I have asked the public relations team to help.

208
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,755
Chanont should have arrived.

209
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:18,255
- Yes.
- Let's go.

210
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,225
- Good afternoon.
- Hi, I'm from The Legend.

211
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,311
"The Legend"? You're here already.

212
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,446
Excuse me.

213
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,798
Rin.

214
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,125
The VIP Team has made an appointment.

215
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,685
Why let other teams intervene like this?

216
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:47,678
Oh, Ms. Rin, Mr. Pak. Aren't you in the VIP Team together?

217
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,202
Is your team using this place to organize a party for the highest-spending customers?

218
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:05,174
Lita. Did the VIP Team book this place, too?

219
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:07,185
Is this overlapping?

220
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:10,489
I just contacted the restaaurant.

221
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:14,579
When I told them I was from The Legend, they agreed and told us to come in.

222
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,003
Pretending. So you pretended to be us?

223
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:20,369
It's not.

224
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,921
I didn't know that you would come, too.

225
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,369
If so, I'll go to another restaurant instead.

226
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,569
We are always on the same page.

227
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,262
No need to find a new place.

228
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,373
We can share.

229
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,722
We have shared many things before.

230
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,441
Rin, I'm so sorry. I was stuck in traffic...

231
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,488
So both teams made an appointment here?

232
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:02,571
These menus must be prepared for 30 guests on that day.

233
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:05,164
- Are you sure you can do this in time?
- Yes.

234
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,225
Can I have a look at the wine list?

235
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:11,340
Okay, I'll prepare a wine list for you.

236
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,562
Yes. This is a menu list.

237
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,432
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

238
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,933
Do you have a rooftop zone here?

239
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,962
Yes.

240
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:30,536
But since it's now the rainy season, we closed it temporarily.

241
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,371
Can I have a look?

242
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,771
Sure.

243
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:36,403
This is the key card.

244
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,508
You can walk this way to the rooftop door.

245
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,508
Thank you.

246
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,732
I'm here to tell you.

247
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:10,272
I just want you to know I don't want to compete with you.

248
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:13,372
And I have never thought of stealing anything from you.

249
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,392
I know what I've done...

250
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:19,839
It's an unforgivable thing. I understand.

251
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,139
It's good that you know it.

252
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,563
And you should know this too,

253
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:27,630
that your dad established the Privilege Team

254
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,851
to force the whole VIP team to resign.

255
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,484
It's not just me who is ruined,

256
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:36,274
but all in the VIP Team,

257
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:40,252
who used to adore you, teach you,

258
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:43,807
and protect you when you were seen as your dad's mistress.

259
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,704
They will all be screwed (ruined).

260
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,045
Remember it.

261
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,531
- Then I'll list the wine for you.
- Okay.

262
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,937
- Thank you so much.
- Rin?

263
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:54,362
Saint.

264
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:56,425
Is it raining outside?

265
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:57,825
I'm stuck on the rooftop.

266
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,062
Tell the staff to open the door for me. It's locked.

267
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:02,722
Okay, I'm going right away.

268
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,280
Sorry.

269
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,332
I think the sensor might be broken.

270
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:32,762
I'll contact the security company right now.

271
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:49,425
Why are you standing there?

272
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:52,905
Do you want those coming to see that I made you get wet in the rain?

273
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:56,479
I didn't think like that at all.

274
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,964
Then get out of the rain and come here.

275
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,442
In the eyes of others, you look pitiful.

276
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,337
And I'm an ex who doesn't want to divorce.

277
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,519
I look like a villain anyway. Don't worry.

278
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,284
What should we do?

279
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:20,055
The rain doesn't look like it will stop soon.

280
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:22,902
Excuse me.

281
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:25,517
Is the security team almost here?

282
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:27,217
Yes.

283
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,226
- Please speed it up.
- Okay.

284
00:27:20,945 --> 00:27:24,594
Rin, are you okay? You're all wet.

285
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:52,553
Let me do it.

286
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:58,105
Please.

287
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,380
I'll turn up the temperature.

288
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,459
Yes. Take Lita back to the office with you.

289
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,923
See you at the office. Okay.

290
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,189
Thanks a lot.

291
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:23,940
Bro. Why did you do that?

292
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,779
Wasn't it a bit awful?

293
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:28,386
Rin was also standing in the rain.

294
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:31,546
No need to go that far even if you're already broken up.

295
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:35,855
Hey.

296
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:39,082
Even if I chose to pick up Rin,

297
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:42,910
she would have ignored me and went back inside herself.

298
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:44,879
So what?

299
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:47,489
So you chose to walk over to Lita.

300
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,805
Why?

301
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:54,009
Because she looks more pitiful than Rin? Really?

302
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,509
Why do you make people hate you?

303
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:02,279
Maybe doing this might be good.

304
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,769
I behave like a swine.

305
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,829
So everyone won't hesitate to hate me.

306
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:13,554
You made one mistake.

307
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:17,366
But will you destroy the rest of your life?

308
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:24,309
That one mistake...

309
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:28,190
It was the biggest mistake ever.

310
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,949
I can't get anything back.

311
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,999
I was once...

312
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:41,979
I was once a happy man.

313
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:47,084
But when I did wrong that time...

314
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,793
I was left with nothing.

315
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:45,372
[You were in the rain. Don't forget to take medicine.]

316
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,472
[You'll fall sick.]

317
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,867
[Pak]

318
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,930
[Lita]

319
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:32,025
Lita, what's the matter?

320
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,239
P'Pak, are you okay?

321
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:39,899
I saw that you've read the message, but you didn't text back.

322
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,935
Oh, I'm about to take a shower.

323
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:50,276
What's wrong? Are you sick?

324
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,151
I probably stood in the rain for too long.

325
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,648
But I have already taken medicine.

326
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,329
You...

327
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:03,309
Take care of yourself, too.

328
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:07,819
See you tomorrow.

329
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,319
Yes.

[The Legend]

331
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:32,958
I'd like to ask for information on the VVIP customers

332
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,392
that your team used to take care of.

333
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,989
I have the official permission letter.

334
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:44,759
That's the information I prepared for the VIP Team's celebration event.

335
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,966
But you won't use it anymore, right?

336
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:51,049
All those customers must be transferred to my team.

337
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,946
It's necessary for me.

338
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:55,619
Otherwise, I can't continue to work.

339
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,119
Anyway... I'll leave it to you.

340
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,999
Thank you.

341
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,949
So what now, Rin?

342
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:34,104
[The Legend: Request permission to use all information and contacts of VVIP customers]

343
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:36,879
[Dear Mrs. Rinnara Yamonkan, VIP Director]

344
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,939
So what will we do next?

345
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:48,609
If they want it, I'll hand it in myself.

346
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:03,689
Are these the documents I asked for?

347
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:08,129
Why are they paper documents? I thought it would be in digital file format.

348
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:10,612
That's the VIP Team's work.

349
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:12,752
We've already analyzed and organized it.

350
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,942
If the Privilege Team wants information,

351
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,813
work it out yourself from the raw data.

352
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,766
Wait.

353
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,566
Wait a minute.

354
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:39,220
Rin must be taking revenge on me.

355
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,359
That's why she's doing this.

356
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,199
No.

357
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,772
Rin is not that kind of person.

358
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,319
She doesn't care about me.

359
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,519
She cares about her work.

360
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,260
[The Legend]

361
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,339
Lita.

362
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:25,849
It's late now. Go home and rest.

363
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:28,136
It's okay.

364
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:30,536
I won't lose to Rin.

365
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:36,189
Others will see I can do the same.

366
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,618
You, too.

367
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:44,069
You will see that...

368
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:47,020
I can be as good as Rin.

369
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:32,747
We've been working so hard to help the company earn money.

370
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:35,702
But in the end, it's like we're useless.

371
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:40,357
When I first came here, I thought of this place as family.

372
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:43,846
What about now?

373
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:46,346
It's...

374
00:38:46,346 --> 00:38:49,749
The family of Cinderella.

375
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:54,159
What? Isn't it funny?

376
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,459
- Just eat.
- Yes.

377
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,700
Wait, Rin.

378
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,666
I have something important to discuss with you.

379
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,641
But I have nothing to say to you.

380
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:17,429
I have a solution to ensure the VIP Team's survival.

381
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:23,826
You know that Jak wants to harass the VIP Team.

382
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:26,126
He even wants to disband the VIP Team.

383
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:28,454
What do you want me to do?

384
00:39:28,454 --> 00:39:31,186
Should I apologize to him and ask for his sympathy?

385
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:33,938
No, I won't let you do that.

386
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,948
I want you to work for someone who sees your value,

387
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:39,328
a person who really wants you.

388
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:43,067
It's Ms. Treenate.

389
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,808
If you work with her,

390
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:49,057
she will make the VIP Team stronger,

391
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:52,649
strong enough to fight against Jakchai.

392
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,529
But if I do that...

393
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:01,229
your team might lose.

394
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,149
I suggest you do this, but it doesn't mean I'm surrendering.

395
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,786
I want us two to have a fair fight,

396
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,969
an honest competition.

397
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,349
Because...

398
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:24,039
you have been treated unfairly for far too long.

399
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:31,471
I need some time to consider.

400
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,820
[The Legend]

401
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,840

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,470
[VIP]

403
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:51,991
Hi, Mon. You're here, too.

404
00:41:51,991 --> 00:41:53,691
Hi.

405
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:05,577
It's just so-so.

406
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:08,063
We should go to the room over there. Rin is there.

407
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,068
Okay. Let's go.

408
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:21,298
Madam Mon.

409
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,009
- Hello.
- Hi.

410
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,718
Are you here because it's my event?

411
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:28,547
Do you see me as such a kind woman?

412
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:32,009
Well, I'd rather celebrate with the VIP Team.

413
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,178
I was in the other room just now and almost fell asleep.

414
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:38,451
I heard you arranged a designer to measure and customize outfits here.

415
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,295
Yes.

416
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,248
At the lounge inside.
[Fundao]

417
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:45,385
But if you want the whole collection as before, it will take a little time.

418
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:47,107
It's okay. Do you serve wine here?

419
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,003
Yes.

420
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:50,378
Then let's chit chat inside. Let's go.

421
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:52,178
This way, please.

[The Legend]

423
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,981
The launch event of the Privilege Team yesterday...
[The Legend]

424
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,401
achieved ฿7 million ($198,000) in sales.

425
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:57,391
Good job.

426
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:02,225
But the celebration event of the VIP Team

427
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,728
made ฿28 million ($792,000) in sales.

428
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:07,346
Oops (Sorry).

429
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:10,628
They are better.

430
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,588
Congratulations, Rin.

431
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:20,665
This is a good start for the position of VIP Director, Dad.

432
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:24,208
Thank you.

433
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,508
I have an excellent team.

434
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:33,708
But for the first task of the Privilege Team, this is still considered decent.

435
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:38,565
Have you seen the reports of previous years?

436
00:44:38,565 --> 00:44:40,054
Well?

437
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:42,482
When the VIP Team was launched,

438
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:47,423
they outperformed the Privilege Team by three times more.

439
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:52,605
That's because Pakawat was still in the VIP Team then.

440
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:56,217
If it was really due to Pakawat,

441
00:44:56,217 --> 00:44:59,588
the Privilege Team should have done better.

442
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:05,345
You can say whatever you want.

443
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:09,825
Both teams are under my supervision anyway.

444
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:12,768
I have something to tell everyone.

445
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,138
I think managing two teams is too hard for you.

446
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:23,902
From now on, you will manage only the Privilege Team.

447
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:31,221
The one to supervise the VIP Team instead of you...

448
00:45:31,221 --> 00:45:34,721
will be Nate.

449
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:54,385
Why did you let Nate manage the VIP Team instead of me?

450
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:57,809
Normally, you never intervene in work at this level.

451
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:03,388
Or did someone urge you to do this?

452
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:08,032
Nate always thought I didn't love my children equally.

453
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:10,810
So I will let you two manage those great teams

454
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:15,018
and compete to see which one does better.

455
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:17,014
Thank you, Dad,

456
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:19,614
for giving me an opportunity to prove myself.

457
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:28,531
I didn't give an opportunity to Nate alone; I'm giving you a chance, too.

458
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:34,588
Whoever does the next project better will be the president of The Legend.

459
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,540
[VIP Management Team]

460
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:57,625
If it were another team, they would need time to adjust to the work system.

461
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00,207
But the VIP Team...

462
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:05,108
is talented and consistently performs well.

463
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,861
Please take care of me.

464
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:14,092
We need to seek advice from an expert like you.

465
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:17,609
If we need to improve anything, please tell us.

466
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,751
I have to thank you.

467
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:21,878
If you hadn't accepted me,

468
00:47:21,878 --> 00:47:26,129
I wouldn't have dared to ask my father to let me lead this team.

469
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:30,065
And from now on,

470
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:33,991
the VIP Team and Privilege Team...

471
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:36,705
are no longer competitors.

472
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,608
We're enemies.

473
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:45,128
In this competition...

474
00:47:45,725 --> 00:47:49,293
we must only win.

475
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:51,343
- Yes.
- Yes.

476
00:47:55,718 --> 00:47:57,469
Excuse me.

477
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,464
I'm very uncomfortable right now.

478
00:47:59,464 --> 00:48:02,181
Would you mind if I let loose?

479
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:05,693
We're on the same team now. Don't be awkward anymore.

480
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:07,593
Thank you.

481
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,525
Lita.

482
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,018
P'Pak.

483
00:48:46,312 --> 00:48:49,028
I'm really not good.

484
00:48:49,945 --> 00:48:54,248
I felt that I tried my best.

485
00:48:56,758 --> 00:49:00,268
But no matter how much I try, I always lose to P'Rin.

486
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:05,548
And now Aunt Nate is supporting her team, too.

487
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:11,148
How can I compete with her now?

488
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,251
Hey. Don't think too much.

489
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:19,031
This is the first time you've taken on this task.

490
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:22,894
Mr. Jakchai also said you've started well.

491
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:26,308
I promise you that, from now on...

492
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:29,558
No matter how difficult the task is,

493
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:31,668
no matter what we encounter,

494
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:35,045
we will get through it together.

495
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:58,640
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

496
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,603
That's right, Lita.

497
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,088
I believe you can do it.

498
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,660
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

499
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,920
♫ Please understand again ♫

500
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,049
Ji is calling.

501
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:32,475
Yes, Ji.

502
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:33,929
Where are you now? Hurry.

503
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:36,412
Didn't you say you wanted to try Chef Keller's dish?

504
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:38,827
Okay, turn left.

505
00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:49,042
Do you want to go over there together?

506
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,691
You go.

507
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:53,401
Won't you go there with me?

508
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:55,222
Don't you feel lonely here?

509
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,762
I'm fine.

510
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,842
I'll take care of the customers here.

511
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:00,642
Go ahead.

512
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:05,049
If you change your mind, meet me there.

513
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:06,749
See you.

514
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,184
P'Rin.

515
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:15,383
Saint. What are you doing here?

516
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:18,682
Did you come for the view?

517
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:20,282
No.

518
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:25,307
I saw you walking up here so I followed you,

519
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,727
in case you get locked out again.

520
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:33,800
Didn't they get it fixed that day?

521
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:36,294
It shouldn't break anymore.

522
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:40,012
So why are you here?

523
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,152
Did you not have a good time downstairs?

524
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:53,572
At first...

525
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:59,271
I thought... I would be thrilled...

526
00:53:00,197 --> 00:53:03,094
if I really won.

527
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:06,839
But when that moment came,

528
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,972
I felt nothing.

529
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:14,272
I was a little sad, actually.

530
00:53:20,734 --> 00:53:25,297
It's because your feelings are still stuck on the rooftop.

531
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:30,877
We can't lock ourselves on the roof forever.

532
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:33,040
One day we have to let it go.

533
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,635
Therefore,

534
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:39,319
let go now.

535
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:49,342
Thank you.

536
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:52,286
You're welcome.

537
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,662
You're doing so well these days.

538
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:02,077
You taught me yourself.

539
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:11,556
P'Rin... Shall we go downstairs?

540
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:15,749
Let's go.

541
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:22,195
How far along are you in your pregnancy?

542
00:54:22,195 --> 00:54:24,362
I am six months.

543
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:27,062
You are the real working woman.

544
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:30,871
I wish both you and your baby stay healthy and strong.

545
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,978
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

546
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:39,299
Meena.

547
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:43,439
P'Ji was stuck in traffic and got lost, but she's on her way now.

548
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,441
Prae.

549
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,175
I think I'll resign.

550
00:54:55,702 --> 00:54:58,202
Is something making you uncomfortable?

551
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:00,616
Or is the workload too heavy?

552
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:05,235
No. Hard work is fun.

553
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:09,469
I like it a lot. I'm very happy when I work.

554
00:55:11,402 --> 00:55:14,482
But cooking for my children,

555
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:18,402
taking care of my children and Jomphol

556
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:21,155
make me happy too.

557
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:25,109
Could it be the mood swings during pregnancy?

558
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:27,649
Did Jomphol pressure you again?

559
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,662
He wouldn't dare to put pressure on me.

560
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,098
He completely understands me and gives me everything.

561
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,345
I want to work. He agrees with it and doesn't stop me.

562
00:55:38,345 --> 00:55:42,172
And he didn't push me to take maternity leave.

563
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,822
It's up to you.

564
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:50,555
At least it is your choice.

565
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,432
No one is forcing you.

566
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,430
Choose what makes you the happiest.

567
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,330
[The Legend]

568
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:15,069
Ms. Treenate called early to see Rin. Is anything wrong?

569
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:17,153
I don't know, either.

570
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:36,258
[Black Diamond: Invitation to join the auction for art, antiques, decorations and fabrics for special VIPs]

571
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,579
We must win this time.

572
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,819
Yes, Sir.

573
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:18,212
- Rin.
- Rin.

574
00:57:18,212 --> 00:57:19,461
How was it?

575
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:21,742
What kind of project did Mr. Jak and Ms. Nate call you about?

576
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,078
And why did they call both you and P'Pak?

577
00:57:24,078 --> 00:57:28,601
Because we have to work with the Privilege Team for this project.

578
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:33,779
The project's name is... Black Diamond.

579
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:39,725
It is a project where VVIP and VIP customers will attend the same event.

580
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:41,341
It's a party,

581
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:43,860
with an art auction at the event.

582
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,095
For this event, the customers of both our teams

583
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,242
won't be divided for service in tiers like last time.

584
00:57:49,242 --> 00:57:53,092
We will take care of both VVIP and VIP customers.

585
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:54,682
Right.

586
00:57:54,682 --> 00:57:57,449
So our team has an advantage

587
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:59,782
because we know our customers better.

588
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:01,687
Maybe not,

589
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,022
because this project is initiated by Mr. Jakchai.

590
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,649
Therefore, our team will select customers before the VIP Team.

591
00:58:07,649 --> 00:58:13,229
This means if we make our customers spend more, we will win, right?

592
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:14,629
Correct.

593
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:20,534
The least event expenses are not the only measure of success in this project.

594
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:23,384
Whichever team helps customers spend more

595
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:27,337
will continue to take care of top-spenders for the next five years.

596
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:33,557
So the winning team will get the highest-tier customers.

597
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:37,585
The losing team will take care of general customers.

598
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:40,932
Prepare to disband their team.

599
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:51,431
We can choose customers first, but we're at a disadvantage anyway, right?

600
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:57,971
Because the customers who are close to P'Rin and the VIP Team have more spending power.

601
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:03,628
It's true that Rin's customers and the VIP Team are very close with each other.

602
00:59:03,628 --> 00:59:07,862
But I think we can still persuade several of them to be our customers instead.

603
00:59:07,862 --> 00:59:12,512
We just have to figure out what the customers like, their favorite products,

604
00:59:12,512 --> 00:59:15,192
and find the products for them immediately.

605
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:19,340
But you have to work harder.

606
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,990
Yes.

607
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,992
Having you by my side is enough for me.

608
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:30,253
I'll list the potential customers who can be persuaded.

609
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:32,935
You need to check further on what they want.

610
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:34,635
Yes.

611
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:53,089
This is the list of customers that the Privilege Team has chosen.

612
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:57,962
Splitting in half for each team is fair enough, I think.

613
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:08,112
You've prepared well.

614
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,455
You know the customers who are close to my team,

615
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:15,052
whom you can steal from us.

616
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:18,712
You must be very good at stealing.

617
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:24,175
I couldn't do something like this alone,

618
01:00:25,882 --> 01:00:28,390
but I have P'Pak with me.

619
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:34,092
At first, I was very nervous.

620
01:00:36,202 --> 01:00:39,495
But since Pak has guided me in everything,

621
01:00:39,495 --> 01:00:42,292
I feel relieved.

622
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:47,717
P'Pak is very worried about me,

623
01:00:48,348 --> 01:00:52,990
worried if I work too hard

624
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,227
or get enough sleep.

625
01:00:58,402 --> 01:01:01,122
Even if it's strenuous (tough), I can do it,

626
01:01:01,802 --> 01:01:04,439
because P'Pak is beside me.

627
01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:11,135
P'Pak cares for a lot of people, I see.

628
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,829
What do you mean?

629
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:16,655
Whom do you think suggested I work for Ms. Treenate?

630
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:20,622
P'Pak is very worried about me.

631
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:23,046
He visited my house late at night.

632
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,969
He was afraid that Mr. Jakchai would harass me.

633
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:30,952
So he recommended I take the VIP Team over to Ms. Treenate.

634
01:01:34,095 --> 01:01:36,646
Although he's not with me,

635
01:01:36,646 --> 01:01:40,640
I'm sure he misses me

636
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,570
more than the girl he works with.

637
01:01:50,562 --> 01:01:52,062
That's not true.

638
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,942
You're lying.

639
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:59,135
Go ask P'Pak whether it's true.

640
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,853
Yes, Lita.

641
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:07,891
I myself told Rin to do that.

642
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,519
Why?

643
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,116
Why did you do that?

644
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,728
Even when you know she is our rival team.

645
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,277
You did this since you want her to win?

646
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:23,607
No, Lita.

647
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:26,614
But I think both teams...

648
01:02:26,614 --> 01:02:28,777
should compete fairly.

649
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:30,867
What is "competing fairly"?

650
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:33,417
Was it really about work?

651
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,317
Isn't it because you worry about Rin?

652
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,330
Right?

653
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,117
Rin and I have been together a long time.

654
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:51,567
We both...

655
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,197
have been through a lot.

656
01:02:57,242 --> 01:02:59,380
Yes, Lita.

657
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,380
I'm worried for her.

658
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:05,257
It's just that, right?

659
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:09,857
Isn't it because you want to go back to her?

660
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,437
Then can you promise me that you won't get back with her?

661
01:03:16,727 --> 01:03:20,527
Can you, Pak?

662
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,893
- Answer me!
- Lita.

663
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:31,483
Don't force me to say anything.

664
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,783
I don't want to lie.

665
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,990
Don't think about it now.

666
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,561
You should focus on your work.

667
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:50,490
Don't you care about me at all?

668
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:54,863
Why can't you do that either?

669
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,663
I did everything. And I gave up everything for you.

670
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:08,983
Why does it turn out that I matter to you only in work?

671

01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,110

673
01:05:02,326 --> 01:05:04,500
Hey.

674
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,151
Since you came home, you've been calling him a million times.

675
01:05:11,686 --> 01:05:15,182
If he doesn't pick up your calls, it means he doesn't care about you anymore.

676
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:18,246
Don't be pathetic anymore.

677
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:21,890
No matter how pathetic or pitiful I am in the eyes of others,

678
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,520
I don't care.

679
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,323
