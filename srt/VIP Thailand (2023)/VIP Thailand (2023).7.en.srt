I'll be right there, Sir.

8
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,970
Rin?

9
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,837
Is everything okay?

10
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:17,670
I have something to discuss.

11
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,878
I must do something. I'm in a hurry.

12
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:23,343
I need to talk about Lita.

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,390
She asked for leave, didn't she?

14
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,857
That's weird.

15
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,636
I'm her supervisor,

16
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:39,896
but she asked you for a day-off.

17
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,780
Why is that? What's going on?

18
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:50,880
You know it well.

19
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,248
Stop acting like I'm a fool.

20
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:58,800
I've never seen you as a fool.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,598
Never.

22
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,403
So?

23
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,540
What's on your mind?

24
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:13,137
I just want to ask you about Lita...

25
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,678
Mr. Jakchai? Excuse me.

26
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,390
Yes, Sir?

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,729
Sure. I'm on my way.

28
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,050
Rin?

29
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,061
I really need to go. Talk to you later.

30
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,896
Rin?

31
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:43,839
Do you know that Mr. Jakchai is about to host a press conference?

32
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,791
What press conference? No one told our team about this.

33
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,213
I didn't know about it, either.

34
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,407
Hello, everyone.

35
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,258
Thank you for coming today.

36
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,053
First of all, I need to apologize

37
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:18,113
for the wine splashing incident that went viral earlier.

38
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:21,090
It has upset many people.

39
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,467
I really need to apologize about that.

40
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:32,997
I'm hosting a press conference today

41
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,234
because I'd like to clarify something that happened to be misinformation.

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,790
Today, I'm here with you all to explain the truth.

43
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,178
The woman in the wine-splashing clip

44
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:52,428
was said to be my mistress in many sources.

45
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,199
The truth is

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,599
she's my daughter.

47
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,313
"Daughter"?

48
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:32,190
I can show you the DNA test

49
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:36,853
to confirm that she's really my daughter.
[Press Conference by the Vice President of The Legend]

50
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:44,430
That's why they organized the press conference without us.

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,079
I used to date a woman in university.

52
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,234
After that, I didn't keep in touch with her.

53
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,854
I had no idea that I had a daughter,

54
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:06,867
and I just reunited with her recently.

55
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:12,751
If you are angry or upset about my action,

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,974
please take it out on me only.

57
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,693
Did your wife know about this?

58
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:30,693
My wife knows everything about this.

59
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I'd like to confirm to you all

60
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,570
that all of this is true.

61
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,356
I'll be the only one to accept the consequences.

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,356
Hey, Guys.

64
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:10,966
Have I ever done something bad to Ms. Lalita?

65
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:14,467
Have I ever insulted her or something?

66
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:18,058
You called her Ms. Lalita?

67
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:22,216
It's better that she's not a mistress

68
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,536
but a daughter.

69
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:28,668
The shareholders' wives will stop yelling at us.

70
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,313
Hey.

71
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:34,883
Do you think P'Pak knows about this?

72
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:41,113
Lita is Mr. Jakchai's daughter.

73
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:43,937
No wonder P'Pak has taken such good care of her.

74
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Rin?

75
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,598
You said you'd like to talk to me about Lita.

76
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,253
Let's go talk in my office.

77
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,053
It's okay.

78
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,014
I get it now.

79
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,607
You said you'd like to discuss Lalita. What is it?

80
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,073
It's about the wine-splashing clip.

81
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:38,160
The shareholders' wives came to yell at us.

82
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,287
They forced us to fire Lita, thinking she was a mistress.

83
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:45,171
Now I know she's the daughter.

84
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,390
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

85
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,100
Mr. Jakchai asked me to keep it a secret.

86
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,518
P'Pak.

87
00:07:56,413 --> 00:08:00,030
How long have you taken care of Mr. Jakchai's daughter?

88
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:05,836
About a year and a half.

89
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:17,571
I should get back to work.

90
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,873
I'll deliver a baby in five months.

91
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:47,181
I don't think you need to install all this.

92
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,728
Of course, I have to.

93
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,243
We need to prepare for our baby while she's inside.

94
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:54,720
She will get familiar with this sound.

95
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,875
You're spoiling her even before she is born.

96
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,150
Our daughter will be attached to you for sure.

97
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,630
Did you just say our daughter?

98
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:15,213
I can't hear the baby's heartbeat. We need to prepare you for C-section now.

99
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,390
I'll prepare the operation room.

100
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,153
How is our baby?

101
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:24,073
She is gone.

102
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,610
That's not true!

103
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,819
How did you heal so fast?

104
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,990
Can you tell me how?

105
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,356
How can you cope with that?

106
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:54,750
I want to be alone.

107
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,390
Stay strong, Rin.

108
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,007
Now I know

109
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,613
how you could heal so fast.

110
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:19,071
You've known her since then.

111
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,336
I'm sorry, Sir.

112
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,547
I had no clue that she's the daughter.

113
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:41,694
Mr. Jakchai still did something wrong here.

114
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,993
Didn't you hear that? He said he had a baby even before he got married!

115
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,135
Before he got married!

116
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,284
He even pretended to be sorry about it.

117
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,413
He said he'd take full responsibility.

118
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,893
People will feel bad for him now!

119
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,161
How can this benefit us?

120
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,387
Darn it,

121
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,887
my brother is good at twisting this game.

122
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:12,017
He can clear his reputation,

123
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:18,247
but he can't be president easily.

124
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,578
This is not the end.

125
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:30,410
I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier.

126
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,830
The family affair has gone through media.

127
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,483
You're still smart about it.

128
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,246
Otherwise, people would see this as a scandal,

129
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:57,847
and it could affect your career and morality.

130
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:04,280
If people saw this as a family matter,

131
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,301
then the media would view it opposite.

132
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,952
And to persuade the media to look at that view,

133
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,532
you needed to say he truth, right?

134
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:27,113
You need to tell me things next time.

135
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,114
I don't like to know about it from others.

136
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:33,887
Yes, Sir.

137
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,450
That girl is still my granddaughter.

138
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,448
You need to find time to bring her over for dinner.

139
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,417
I'll have my secretary schedule the time.

140
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,922
Everyone knows Lita now,

141
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:17,909
but you still need to take care of her.

142
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,908
Yes, Sir.

143
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,798
I hope nothing more will bother me.

144
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:01,777
You didn't mention the press conference. Why didn't you tell me first?

145
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,837
You wanted me to be embarrassed by the whole country, right?

146
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,760
I thought you liked it.

147
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,341
You seemed happy that the wine-splashing clip went viral.

148
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,200
So you wanted to humiliate me before the whole country?

149
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,340
Are you happy about that?

150
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,920
I did that because it affected my business.

151
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,504
It affected my position.

152
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:28,367
More importantly, if I didn't host a press conference,

153
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,354
my chance to be President would be ruined.

154
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:32,634
It's back to this eventually.

155
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:37,054
I thought you did everything to protect your daughter!

156
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,953
Look at you,

157
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:41,525
you never change.

158
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,843
You did everything for your business.

159
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:49,043
Is this why you're still with me?

160
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,034
That's right.

161
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,077
So?

162
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:46,837
That woman is the Vice President's daughter? For real?

163
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,536
Well,

164
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,068
it could look bad on us.

165
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,690
It means Pak did this for his career,

166
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,430
and to secure his position,

167
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:02,779
which is even worse.

168
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,530
If it was in the past,

169
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,190
I wouldn't have believed Pak could do this,

170
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,497
but now that I see...

171
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:21,100
P'Pak can do anything.

172
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,697
He didn't even care if his actions could hurt me.

173
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,354
So?

174
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,785
Does it mean...

175
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,482
you will still do what you wanted to?

176
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,214
Talk to him about it?

177
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:42,924
I don't think so.

178
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,146
I'll wait.

179
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:53,574
No matter how much I want to confront him about it, I'll wait.

180
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,117
He didn't want me to know about it

181
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,337
so I'll act like I don't know anything.

182
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:06,260
Well, I think...

183
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,918
there are other ways to handle this.

184
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,635
Don't make yourself more miserable than you already are.

185
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:20,412
Can we find something else to lessen your pain?

186
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,260
Is there another way?

187
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:29,997
What way can I lessen the pain?

188
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:41,622
There's no other way to ease my pain.

189
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,702
I won't be the only one hurting.

190
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,800
People who betrayed me will be hurt as well.

192
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,855
Hey, everyone, did you see this already?

193
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,337
The viral wine-splashing clip

194
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:11,108
has become a CinderLita clip already.

195
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,540
Look at this.

196
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,134
People have been leaving kind words to her on both Twitter and TikTok.

197
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:30,503
Look? Can you see?

198
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,850
We need to be more careful when we do something.

199
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,924
We need to be nice to the right person so we can advance in our career, okay?

200
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:45,274
Ji, she's a daughter of the Vice President; she's not Vice President herself.

201
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,307
You need to be prepared!

202
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:52,164
Whoever has done something wrong to her will be hurt as well,

203
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,944
especially the person who leaked the clip.

204
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,500
But it's a good thing, right?

205
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,880
If it wasn't for the clip,

206
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,558
we wouldn't have known who she really is.

207
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:13,946
You're right.

208
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,367
Hello?

209
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,237
What? In a hospital?

210
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,654
Okay, okay.

211
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,187
- Hey.
- How are our boys?

212
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:47,234
They're in here.

213
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:52,492
- How are my sons?
- They got their stitches.

214
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,333
- Can we see them?
- Please go in.

215
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,648
Thank you. Let's go.

216
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,981
Dad! Mom!

217
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,450
- Mick. Max.
- How are you feeling?

218
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,105
I got stitches; am I cool?

219
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,574
- Does it hurt?
- No.

220
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,677
He's sleeping.

221
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:15,793
- I heard that you two were playing.
- Yes.

222
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,702
- You were playing with swords?
- That's right.

223
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:22,097
They were playing and got hit in the heads.

224
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,440
Mick, listen to me.

225
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,521
I'll confiscate your swords.

226
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,661
You can't play with them anymore.

227
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,267
Look at your head.

228
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:35,847
I'm glad that both of you are here.

229
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,366
I thought you were breaking up.

230
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:45,157
What are you saying?

231
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,287
Do you know the meaning?

232
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,285
My friend told me that if you two stay in different places,

233
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:54,379
it means that you broke up.

234
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,947
It's not like that.

235
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,860
Wait for me. I'll come back home.

236
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,894
Really?

237
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,961
- Max.
- Max.

238
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:15,897
You're up? How are you?

239
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,857
Stay with the boys. I need to take this.

240
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:41,367
You're up?

241
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:53,345
Yes?

242
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,095
Did you know about this?

243
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,086
About Mr. Jakchai's daughter?

244
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:59,075
I had no idea.

245
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:03,323
Lita being Mr. Jakchai's daughter, will I be in trouble?

246
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,054
No, you aren't.

247
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:07,487
I'll support you, remember?

248
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:10,628
It didn't go as we planned,

249
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,780
but we still hold the final card.

250
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:16,595
Are you sure no one will know that I did it?

251
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:24,377
I am the only one who knows you recorded the clip.

252
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,285
Don't you worry about that.

253
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:30,086
Fine.

00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:27,887
Aren't you two coming?

256
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:30,387
Is no one coming with me?

257
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,084
Why don't you two come with me?

258
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,625
I thought the VIP Team
[Jubilee]

259
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,325
wouldn't send someone to take care of an evil stepmother like me.

260
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:01,424
No one in the VIP Team thinks of you that way.

261
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:04,594
You'd better not.

262
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:10,814
It's bad to be known as an evil stepmother and evil lawful wife.

263
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:13,620
People gossip behind my back,

264
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,291
that I'm a lawful wife who came in second to the daughter.

265
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:23,970
But wouldn't it

266
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,570
be better?

267
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,761
You can quit

268
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,644
being a mistress,

269
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,614
but you can't quit...

270
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,544
being the daughter.

271
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:45,857
So?

272
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:50,217
Where's my stepdaughter? Is she coming to work today?

273
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:57,872
Or was she promoted to be Executive Officer after the announcement?

274
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,467
I don't know about that.

275
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:08,304
I found out at the same time as everyone that she's a daughter.

276
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:13,447
Pak is really good at keeping a secret.

277
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,334
That's why my husband trusts him so much.

278
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,115
He's good.

279
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:20,664
His wife didn't even know about it.

280
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:23,601
That's right.

281
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,912
He's good at keeping secrets.

282
00:25:29,114 --> 00:25:31,634
He has many secrets that I don't know about,

283
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,610
and I'll do the same to him.

No need.

00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:05,234
I'm here to officially announce to you all about Lalita.

288
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:15,924
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about her sooner,

289
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:21,715
and I need to thank you all for taking such good care of her.

290
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:26,008
You can teach and guide her as you please; don't worry about me. Okay?

291
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:37,507
Rin, you did a wonderful job at the diamond auction. Well done.

292
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:44,371
Thank you, but it was a team effort. We worked so hard on that.

293
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:49,454
This is why I admire Pak.

294
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,341
He has started a wonderful family

295
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:54,964
with a talented lady.

296
00:26:56,616 --> 00:27:01,418
Lita, you need to learn from Rin,

297
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:02,918
okay?

298
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:10,707
I know Lita is still a fledgling and not good yet.

299
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:14,147
Please take care of her.

300
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,888
I'm sure you can do it.

301
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,938
Please be her mentor, Rin,

302
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:23,784
so she can one day be the head of the team like you.

303
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,584
- A hard-working, talented man like you, Pak,
- Yes?

304
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:39,548
you will be promoted to a higher position for sure.

305
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:46,064
I'll celebrate your success again soon.

306
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:51,146
Thank you, and thank you on behalf of everyone in my team.

307
00:27:51,914 --> 00:27:55,565
Come on, take me to your table. Where is it?

00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:57,265

00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:27,472
I'll wait for Ji to send me a list and history of your clients' purchases,

311
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,407
then we can figure out what should be their gifts.

312
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,278
What do you think?

313
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,215
Okay, that's it for today.

314
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:40,152
Hey, Lita didn't attend the meeting with us or what?

315
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,361
Is she not working anymore after the announcement?

316
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:47,449
Mr. Jakchai, himself, introduced her to us this morning.

317
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:50,731
She should be our supervisor soon.

318
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,364
What?

319
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:56,074
But Rin is the head of this team.

320
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,480
Don't tell me that Lalita will be Rin's boss,

321
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,260
and Rin will be working for her!

322
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,293
That's crazy.

323
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,413
We've been working so hard.

324
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:09,420
It's not our fault that we can't choose to be born. So we won't be growing in our career?

325
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,740
This is not okay!

326
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,966
- Right?
- Hey.

327
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:16,106
It's not okay, right?

328
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:18,466
I don't like this.

329
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,593
Do you think Rin is angry at me?

330
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,304
Do you have to ask?

331
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:29,840
- Of course, she is.
- What?

332
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,536
Why didn't you warn me?

333
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,993
- I tried.
- I didn't know.

334
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:39,221
- I'm leaving now.
- What?

335
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:00,613
Rin?

336
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,730
Don't overthink it.

337
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:09,322
About what?

338
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,153
About everything.

339
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:14,430
About your work and whatever else too.

340
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:21,484
It's not that easy to not think about it.

341
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,377
I understand,

342
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:29,888
but something is out of our control.

343
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,394
If we can't do anything about it,

344
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,481
we can just let it go.

345
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:44,020
If you've done your best,

346
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,080
then it's fine.

347
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,661
In the end, you did nothing wrong.

348
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,834
You didn't fail at anything.

349
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:58,863
Don't think about it too hard.

350
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:22,290
I'm so hungry. She's so late.

351
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,600
Can we start?

352
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,629
- Go on.
- Do you think so?

353
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:36,695
Sorry, I'm late.

354
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,926
My dad called for me.

355
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:43,903
It's okay. We can wait. No one is hungry.

356
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:55,014
Please let me pay for this meal.

357
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:01,297
My dad would like to pay for it, as an apology for keeping a secret about me.

358
00:32:01,297 --> 00:32:02,933
You think it's a good idea?

359
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:05,980
Well, please thank him for us.

360
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,786
Is there anything that you can't eat? Can you take spicy food?

361
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:14,137
I can eat anything. I don't have the choice to be picky.

362
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:16,289
You should be picky.

363
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,868
Don't just eat it all.

364
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:28,441
That's right, Lita.

365
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,724
I've known you for a while.

366
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:40,725
I don't know if you have a boyfriend.

367
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,586
Do you have one?

368
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:51,824
If not, I can introduce you to someone.

369
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:56,313
P'Pak.

370
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:17,364
Do you know if Lita is dating someone?

371
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,351
I don't, Rin. How could I know?

372
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:38,298
Well, I see that you've taken care of her for such a long time.

373
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:40,729
You should know.

374
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,452
I don't have any boyfriend.

375
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:53,723
I'm fine being single.

376
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,733
Actually,

377
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,446
you're cute and you're sincere to everyone.

378
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,567
I think someone would have a crush on you.

379
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,884
Don't you think so?

380
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:19,866
Do you like someone?

381
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,629
Yes.

382
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,923
Her face tells all.

383
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:31,585
Our eyes are clearer than our words.

384
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,144
You're the daughter of the Vice President.

385
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:42,452
Someone who dates her would be fortunate, right?

386
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,341
I think so, too.

387
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:48,123
It's such a nice thing to date her.

388
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:52,563
I'd like to be born as a man to date you.

389
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:03,606
One more thing,

390
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:09,063
my dad would like to invite all of you to his house on Saturday.

391
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:14,386
He'd like to host a dinner party to thank you all.

392
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:23,432
Of course, we will be there, right?

393
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,367
Let's go there, Baby.

394
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,640
Let's go.

395
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,426
Shall we eat?

396
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:46,483
Good, I'm starving.

397
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:54,029
You should start first.

398
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:11,884
We've already finalized our clients' complimentary gifts,

399
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:14,672
but I'd like to discuss with everyone...

400
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:19,564
about the event for our top spenders.

401
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,661
I've prepared everything.

402
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:27,021
I think it would be better...

403
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:33,329
if Lalita could handle this job.

404
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:38,782
But this is huge.

405
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,683
We have to take care of many high-level clients.

406
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,355
Do you think Lita can do it?

407
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,110
If something went wrong,

408
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,665
our team would get a bad reputation.

409
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:54,678
I think Rin should take care of this.

410
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,078
It's fine.

411
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,967
P'Pak made the decision.

412
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:06,083
It means that he trusts Lita, right?

413
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,284
That is right.

414
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:20,071
Good.

415
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:24,845
Please take care of this event.

416
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:30,664
I'm sure you can handle it like I do.

417
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,924
That's good to hear.

418
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,061
The next item on the agenda

419
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:45,539
is about Christmas gifts for our VIP clients.

420
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:55,421
Lita scored a big project, just like that?
[Coffee]

421
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:57,361
That's right.

422
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:02,064
I really don't understand P'Pak. I don't know what he is thinking.

423
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,491
This is huge.

424
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:09,582
If a manager like Rin isn't taking care of it, then it should be someone experienced, like Meena.

425
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,640
I don't think Pak decided this on his own.

426
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,064
Khun Jakchai would like good achievements for his daughter.

427
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:19,311
If this is how they work,

428
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:23,271
- then who would want to work with them?
- I know.

429
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:27,618
I don't think Lita can handle this by herself.

430
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:31,845
We still need to help her out; otherwise, it would reflect badly on (disgrace) the team.

431
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:35,949
Wait, Ms. Meena, aren't you pregnant?

432
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:38,925
Don't you want to avoid overworking?

433
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,917
It's useless.

434
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:44,727
People will be praising Lalita, and do you know why?

435
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,012
She is the Vice President's daughter.

436
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,230
Unlike us, we have no choice.

437
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,316
We have to work even if we are pregnant, have babies or get sick.

438
00:38:58,316 --> 00:39:01,404
Then someone comes in and takes our work.

439
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:04,182
It's such a misfortune.

440
00:39:20,947 --> 00:39:24,988
Wait, Ms. Meena, aren't you pregnant?

441
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,915
Don't you want to avoid overworking?

442
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:30,545
It's useless.

443
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,019
Hello?

444
00:40:03,364 --> 00:40:05,264
It's Meena.

445
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,545
Can I come in now?

446
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:17,211
Thank you.

447
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:26,905
I'm here now.

448
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,784
Is Meena in the office?

449
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:31,521
Okay, thank you, thank you.

450
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,081
Where is she going?

00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:05,590
[Medical Clinic: Planned Parenthood Association of Thailand (PPAT) under Her Royal Highness, the Princess Mother's patronage]

[Services: Family Planning, Ultrasound Scanning, Birth Control, Pap Smear, General Medical Examination]

453
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:23,221
There are two options of abortion here:

454
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,719
If the pregnancy is under 7 weeks,

455
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,459
then we prescribe pills for you to take.

456
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:30,171
But if the pregnancy is over 8 weeks,

457
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,502
then we need to use the machine.

458
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:37,588
You should study this.

[Medical Termination of Pregnancy: Report Form]

460
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:55,937
It seems you're unsure about the abortion.

461
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,105
Yes.

462
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:08,288
This is a choice.

463
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,909
If you can make your own decision,

464
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:15,036
then I'd encourage you to consider it carefully.

465
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:18,822
You'll be the one who has to face the consequences.

466

00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:25,858
you can return anytime.

00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,738
Okay.

Thank you.

470
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:50,721
You're thinking of having an abortion?

471
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:58,746
You'd do that because you're carrying Pak's baby, right?

472
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:03,431
Stop with this nonsense now.

473
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:06,052
This is your baby!

Whom do you think I am?

00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,246
If this is my baby, then why would you consider it?

476
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,313
Meena?

477
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:18,721
If this is our baby, then it's your baby, too.

478
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:21,918
Stop being so dramatic.

479
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,718
Hey!

00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,621
I haven't decided yet.

Meena?

482
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:38,051
You will keep the baby, won't you?

483
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,181
I'll think about it.

484
00:43:43,274 --> 00:43:45,165
You can't do that, Meena!

485
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,901
You can't hurt the baby!

486
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:51,998
You said this is our baby, right?

487
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:53,380
Then it's my baby, too.

488
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,089
I'm the father. I want to see her face.

489
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:58,785
You can't do that, Meena!

490
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:01,766
You can't have an abortion!

491
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:08,361
It's easy for you to say.

492
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,861
You don't have to live with it like I do.

493
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,717
Even if you promise me that you will be a good father,

494
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:23,161
so what?

495
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:27,881
I have to handle everything on my own.

I must breastfeed the baby.

498
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:40,958
I'll need maternity leave.

And I must sacrifice many good opportunities in my life.

A man like you doesn't have to lose anything.

501

This is my womb.

502
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:09,804
I'll decide what to do with it.

503
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:32,051
I think you went over the limit on this one.

504
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:35,002
If you let Lita work on this,

505
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:39,353
it's like you don't care about others or your team.

506
00:45:43,594 --> 00:45:46,065
But I have to.

507
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:48,902
I must please Mr. Jakchai.

I know that you and Rin aren't the same anymore.

509
00:45:54,893 --> 00:46:00,063
But Rin is still in your team, and you have to work with her.

510
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:03,030
A talented working woman like her

511
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,310
doesn't deserve to be treated this way.

512
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:10,817
You, of all people, should know about this better than I do.

Yes, Dad.

Lita, come closer to Grandpa quickly.

519
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:05,820
You look adorable.

520
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,403
She looks like your sister Nate when she was young.

521
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:12,820
- Is that so?
- Yes.

522
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,026
Just the same look of Nate is enough; don't copy her personality.

523
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:18,868
- Oh.
- Hello, Dad.

524
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:23,037
Well, you're right. Nate alone causes us trouble.

525
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:27,395
But Dad, I think

526
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:30,200
she is more like me. Look.

527
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,366
How is it?

528
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,013
Her face looks like you.

529
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:35,613
But it's better to act like me.

530
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:39,453
Dad, my daughter must be like me, of course.

531
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:41,451
Can you accept this one?

532
00:47:48,316 --> 00:47:50,319
- Dad.
- Thanks.

533
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,677
Give me some soup.

534
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:53,183
- Yes.
- Here.

535
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:55,083
It is okay.

536
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:01,060
Do you know what, Dad? Everyone in the VIP Team praises Lita a lot.

537
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,363
They said Lita is hard-working and humble.

538
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:09,578
And now she's in charge of important projects.

539
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:15,803
I think the VIP Team won't disappoint us no matter what, right, Dad?

540
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:21,635
I'm looking forward to seeing what you have in store next.

541
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:29,233
Lita.

542
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:31,915
Why aren't you eating anything?

543
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:40,733
Why don't you have something?

544
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:45,533
Or... are you afraid to dish the food? Come, I'll help you.

545
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:48,393
What do you like? I'll select it for you.

546
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:51,873
Here.

547
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,973
Thank you.

548
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,193
What do you want to have next?

549
00:48:59,193 --> 00:49:02,643
Your appetite will get better day by day.

550
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,907
It's usual for a newcomer.

551
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:11,340
After staying a little longer, she won't be shy anymore.

552
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,660
I was a little sad before.

553
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,120
Why couldn't Jak and Mon have children?

554
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,683
But now you have Lita as your daughter. I'm very relieved.

555
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:33,580
Have you solved what is on your mind yet?

556
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,520
That is my own fault.

557
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,783
I'm a little too impatient so it became a big deal.

558
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,523
So have you apologized to Lita yet?

559
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:53,683
It's okay. I don't mind at all.

560
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:56,623
The offender should apologize.

561
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:01,983
How I have upset you,

562
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,531
I'm sorry about that.

563
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:09,175
Say it willingly.

564
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:17,695
Good.

565
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:27,883
Because we are one family,

566
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:30,497
we should love each other.

567
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:36,714
Lita, eat. Eat more.

568
00:50:38,273 --> 00:50:43,006
You're eating very little today, Dad. Let me give you more food.

569
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,441
The abalone rice from this restaurant is delicious.

570
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,509
Sorry for making you wait.

571
00:51:03,203 --> 00:51:06,583
I'll have to practice apologizing to you in a little while.

572
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:12,673
Wait a minute.

573
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:21,963
If your mom recovers, you can bring her to live with you.

574
00:51:21,963 --> 00:51:25,103
I can take care of both you and your mother.

575
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,843
Please leave my mom alone.

576
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:33,643
I think we are better with our own life.

577
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:39,320
If Grandfather knows you don't actually mean well toward me,

578
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,713
he probably won't be happy.

579
00:51:41,713 --> 00:51:43,413
"Grandfather"?

580
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:46,327
Khun Chokchai?

581
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:52,024
You must think that he really loves you.

582
00:51:54,046 --> 00:52:01,043
You'll know soon how cruel the people you call "Grandfather" and "Dad"

583
00:52:01,043 --> 00:52:04,113
can be toward you.

584
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:07,942
You don't have to manipulate me.

585
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:11,866
I know you're just trying to make me uncomfortable.

586
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,487
Think whatever you want.

587
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:18,493
Soon you will know.

588
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:23,060
The world, where people are bound together due to benefits,

589
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,430
is a cruel one.

590
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,780
[Receipt]

591
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,600
[Mrs. Yuda Kusolcharoensuk]

592
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,187
P'Pak.

593
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:18,925
Rin.

594
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
Why are you here?

595
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:27,893
I'm going to clear things up with you.

596
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,823
Today, I let Lita lead instead of you.

597
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,730
It's due to Mr. Jakchai's order.

598
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,260
He wanted Lita to have some credit.

599
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,323
So it's like this.

600
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,309
And if it were you,

601
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,126
if you had the right to choose,

602
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:00,096
whom would you choose,

603
00:55:00,987 --> 00:55:05,010
between me and Lita?

604
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,606
Don't ask me,

605
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:12,426
because I'm not the one.

606
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:14,250
Khun Jakchai was the one who chose her.

607
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,253
I just want to know.

608
00:55:19,037 --> 00:55:22,406
Will you choose one, who experienced so much together with you,

609
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,780
or someone new?

610
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,953
Are you sure you're talking about work?

611
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:37,203
I'm here today...

612
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,203
I'm not here to fight.

613
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:47,790
Do you think something more is between me and Lita?

614
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:01,097
You are not answering.

615
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:05,243
That means you choose Lita.

616
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,806
Wait.

617
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,773
Come pick me up tomorrow.

618
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:32,693
Everyone in the company thinks we still love each other.

619
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:36,483
It's better if we go together.

620
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,923
You may go.

621
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,643
I'll pick you up then.

622
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:21,703
Did Rin see it?

623
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,074
Have you set the table well?

624
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:41,352
Yes.

625
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:46,615
Madam, Mr. Jakchai allowed me to ask if you would join the table?

626
00:57:47,432 --> 00:57:51,295
Of course, I am the madam of this house.

627
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:52,795
Yes.

628
00:57:56,378 --> 00:58:00,860
This is my order, Lita. I didn't ask for your opinion.

629
00:58:07,392 --> 00:58:10,132
I didn't want to interrupt you,

630
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:16,150
but I think if I take the position that Rin should have,

631
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,885
it's too disrespectful toward her.

632
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:24,625
I'm really not ready to accept that position.

633
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,625
And when will you be ready?

634
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:36,063
I'll make you the VIP Team leader no matter what.

635
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:42,015
And today, I'll announce it to everyone on the team.

636
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:51,397
The other day when P'Pak let me do the important job,

637
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:54,595
do you know how other people in the team looked at me?

638
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:59,536
Nobody believes that I can do it.

639
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,430
Even if I try harder,

640
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,490
others still see me as someone who got in by connections, anyway.

641
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:08,232
Then why do you care about those people?

642
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:12,072
They're just subordinates, not friends.

643
00:59:12,072 --> 00:59:15,895
Don't talk further; just do as I order.

644
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:37,758
Do you know now? When I warned you,

645
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:41,017
I didn't want to manipulate you.

646
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:46,945
Remember.

647
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:50,295
If you want to live in this world,

648
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:54,564
you need to learn how to step on other people's heads.

649
01:00:16,494 --> 01:00:19,212
I told you already that I have a party at Mr. Jakchai's house.

650
01:00:19,212 --> 01:00:21,245
You didn't read my text. You can't blame me.

651
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:23,275
Okay, okay.

652
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:26,132
I told you to find a girlfriend so you don't have free time like this.

653
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:29,565
Wow, we're mentioning a girlfriend. How good if it's that easy to find.

654
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:30,812
Darn.

655
01:00:30,812 --> 01:00:33,232
Why are you so shocked?

656
01:00:33,232 --> 01:00:35,998
It's not your business.

657
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:37,998
When did I get this?

658
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:43,717
It's so big! It probably got hit when someone was reversing.

659
01:00:44,732 --> 01:00:48,055
Does your car have a front camera? Check it.

660
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,870
[Please Insert Secure Digital Card]

661
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:06,374
What?

662
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,075
Where is the memory card?

663
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,725
Rin's car is not here.

664
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:09,498
Rin.

665
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:12,071
Where are you?

666
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:14,112
I left home already.

667
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:17,975
Oh, didn't you tell me to pick you up at home for Jakchai's party?

668
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:21,585
I just realized...

669
01:02:21,585 --> 01:02:24,525
I have something to discuss with Khun Jakchai first.

670
01:02:25,058 --> 01:02:27,545
What will you discuss with him?

671
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:32,039
You don't need to know.

672
01:02:34,763 --> 01:02:36,163
Right, Rin...

673
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,182
Did you get into my car?

674
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:41,718
Why?

675
01:02:41,718 --> 01:02:43,690
Well...

676
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,952
My dashcam memory card is missing.

677
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:48,836
- You're the only one who has...
- I have to go.

678
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:52,095
There's an accident ahead.

679
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:58,095
Hello? Rin? Rin?

680
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,305
Is Rin here yet? Did you see her?

681
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:18,292
Yes.

682
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:21,258
I thought you two would come together.

683
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,495
Meena, did you see Rin?

684
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:26,775
She's heading to Mr. Jakchai's office.

685
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:35,216
What's going on? Why does he seem in a hurry?

686
01:04:52,032 --> 01:04:53,432
Rin.

687
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,362
You came to see Mr. Jakchai.

688
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:00,585
What is the matter?

689
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:02,615
Why didn't you wait for me?

690
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:07,961
What could it be?

691
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:16,635
About Lalita.

692
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:21,555
"Lalita"?

693
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:32,605
What is the matter?

694
01:05:32,605 --> 01:05:34,825
Why can't I know?

695
01:05:36,218 --> 01:05:38,452
Don't worry.

696
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:46,662
You'll know after Mr. Jakchai knows.

697
01:05:53,692 --> 01:05:55,192
Rin, wait.

698
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:12,245
Lita, bring it to me.

699
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:23,239
Rin.

700
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:34,292
Do you want to talk to me about something?

701
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:35,792
Well?

702
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:43,815
What is it, Rin? Is there anything you want to discuss?

703
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:49,096
Yes.

704
01:06:49,096 --> 01:06:52,262
I think the time is...

705
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:55,531
- Shall we eat first?
- No.

706
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:59,915
I intend to tell Mr. Jakchai about this, no matter what.

707
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,445
I don't want to do this in front of you, Lita.

708
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:08,105
But since it's like this...

709
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:10,120
I have to do it.

710
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:14,705
Did I do something wrong?

711
01:07:14,705 --> 01:07:16,842
You will know.

712
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:20,879
It's something Khun Jakchai doesn't know yet.

713
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:35,481
- I'll open it for you.
- I can open it myself.

714
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:07,785
Lita.

715
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:44,650
