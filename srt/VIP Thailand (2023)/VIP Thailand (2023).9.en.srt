00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,170
The task may be too difficult for you.

9
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,843
Let's do something else instead.

10
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:09,557
What are you doing? Let go of me!

11
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,820
You're still in shape.

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,367
Help! Someone help me! Help!

13
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,582
What are you doing to my wife?

14
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,382
Swine!

15
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:41,220
What do you say?

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,220
What are you doing to my wife?

17
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,173
Jomphol, stop!

18
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,127
Stop now, that's enough!

19
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,060
You snake!

20
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,860
Stop now.

21
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,867
Are you okay?

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,987
I'll have you arrested, you scoundrel!

23
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,707
I'll get the police to arrest you, darn it!

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,270
Enough!

25
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,173
Let's go, that's enough!

26
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:08,573
Let's go.

27
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,650
I'll get rid of you all!

28
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:33,340
How are you? Are you okay?

29
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:42,580
How did you know that I was here?

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,017
I had dinner with clients,

31
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,997
and I saw you briefly.

32
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,067
I called but you didn't pick up.
[Darling]

33
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,617
Luckily, I heard a cry from that room.

34
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:04,627
You shouldn't have punched him like that.

35
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:06,807
Are you still worried about him?

36
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,220
He was going to rape you!

37
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,444
Anyway, we have to sue him!

38
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:15,074
Let's go... to the police station.

39
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,177
We can't.

40
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,214
If you report, I'll be fired for sure.

41
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:23,270
Danai is the Executive's subordinate.

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,327
I think if we sue him, we will be in trouble.

43
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,297
If we'll be in trouble, let it be!

44
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:37,380
And how did you get involved with him?

45
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,297
It's about work.

46
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,247
Let's go.

47
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:44,747
Meena!

48
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:50,054
What is that work?

49
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:57,694
Did Danai force you to do something?

50
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,194
If you have any problem, tell me.

51
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,694
Well...

52
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:06,347
I...

53
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,487
I'm the one who recorded the video.

54
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:12,969
I'm the one who's spying on the VIP Team for Danai.

55
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:16,912
I took the clip of Lita getting poured with wine.

56
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,777
I was wrong!

57
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,767
I...

58
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,957
I just want to progress. I didn't think it would be this extent!

59
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,327
And if he sues us,

60
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,940
then we both get fired.

61
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,180
We won't have money, jobs, and the children...

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,407
What will they do?

63
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,537
Calm down.

64
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:50,014
But... but... We have to get him anyway.

65
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:54,795
Even though he's an executive, even if he's Yutthachai's subordinate.

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:05:01,177
But... but we still have Mr. Jakchai as a power balance, right?

67
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:09,197
There... there was something else in that video clip.

68
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:16,657
Mr. Jakchai was rallying to dismiss the president.

69
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,140
I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't have taken a shortcut like this.

70
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,220
It's all right.

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,297
I shouldn't have betrayed the team.

72
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,899
Think carefully.

73
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,670
If we have a problem, we'll...

74
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,247
We'll figure this out together.

75
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:40,847
It's okay.

76
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:43,547
Calm down, don't cry.

77
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,530
[The Legend]

78
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,690
- Rin.
- If it's not about work, don't say a thing.

79
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:35,294
- I'd like to talk to you, please.
- I said be quiet if it's not about work.

80
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,174
Rin.

81
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,297
Can I talk to you, please?

82
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,187
Just say what you want to say.

83
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,480
But if you apologize to me,

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,658
I'm telling you,

85
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:17,478
I will never forgive you.

86
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,557
I know.

87
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,057
What I did was very bad.

88
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,973
I already knew when I sent the message,

89
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,424
you would look for that woman.

90
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:48,637
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

91
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:53,060
So you sent me that message?

92
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,460
Yes.

93
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,897
Did you intend to destroy my family, Lita?

94
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,820
Am I right?

95
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,909
Because I know I can't compete against you.

96
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:13,017
I already knew Pak would choose you.

97
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:18,337
I did something stupid.

98
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,497
I'm sorry about that.

99
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,457
I'll tell you one thing.

100
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:33,327
From the first day you entered the team,

101
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:38,607
when people said you had a connection as Mr. Jakchai's mistress, I didn't care once.

102
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:43,140
I helped you with everything. I taught you everything I could,

103
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,977
and is this how you repay me?

104
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,074
Now you took everything from me:

105
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,447
my job, my love.

106
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,097
You got everything, but I lost everything.

107
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,233
Do you think a word of apology is enough?

108
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,297
It's not enough.

109
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,137
You can be angry at me or scold me as much as you want.

110
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,917
I want you to know that Pak did nothing wrong.

111
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,757
It's me.

112
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,997
No one is right between you.

113
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,627
You two have no impulse control!

114
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,814
You knew it was a mistake, but you still did it!

115
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:32,057
Seriously, aren't you ashamed of the evil you've done?

116
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:36,317
We had an affair.

117
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,977
It's because of love and understanding.

118
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:50,274
In the past, P'Pak had carried so many burdens.

119
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,617
Do you know that?

120
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:58,437
But if you were there for him,

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,741
we probably wouldn't have crossed the line.

122
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,457
You're saying that being a mistress isn't wrong?

123
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:15,555
Having an affair with another's husband isn't wrong?

124
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,817
Do you think your affair is beautiful?

125
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:26,094
If he has a problem, but he chooses not to tell me, his wife,

126
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:28,277
how am I in the wrong?

127
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,466
And you.

128
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,459
You know he already has a wife, but you still want him!

129
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,929
You weren't wrong, were you?

130
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:43,294
I am wrong.

131
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,194
I know that,

132
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,214
but I love Pak, too.

133
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,494
Do you love Pak, too?

134
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:56,120
What kind of relationship has three people, Lita?

135
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,754
- I asked what you were thinking!
- Lita.

136
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:01,467
Calm down, both of you.

137
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,279
If you were me, would you calm down?

138
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,454
I have been calm a long time!

139
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:11,994
You committed adultery a year and a half.

140
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,820
Remember it.

141
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,037
Rin, Rin.

142
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,954
Hello.

143
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Yes, it's me.

144
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:51,677
Did Mom pass away?

145
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:02,697
P'Pak, they said that Mom passed away.

146
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,357
What should I do?

147
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:09,794
Hang in there.

148
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:12,014
It's not true, right?

149
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,717
This is not true.

150
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,294
Mom.

151
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:40,947
Please wake up and talk to me.

152
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,270
[Mortuary]

153
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:17,467
Lita. You haven't eaten anything yet.

154
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:28,207
I'll go to the temple. I'll wait for Mom there.

155
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,347
Lita!

156
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,034
What's wrong? Are you okay?

157
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,017
I'm sorry, Lita.

158
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,075
The others are busy and they sent bereavement money.

159
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,057
Thank you so much.

160
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,317
Excuse me.

161
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,417
Is everything fine?

162
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,519
Ji, do they let the public know now?

163
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,714
No.

164
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:19,167
Mr. Jakchai is busy and can't do the honors (host)

165
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,757
so Pak will do it instead.

166
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,214
They can't be in public eye now.

167
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,897
There's only a disadvantage.

168
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,040
Rin is lucky.

169
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,017
She doesn't have to witness this.

170
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,640
Come in.

171
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,637
I'm sorry that I was so busy I couldn't attend the funeral.

172
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,317
Don't worry too much, Lita.

173
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,277
She rests in peace now.

174
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,397
If she really rests in peace, that's good.

175
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,167
While alive, she had a very hard time.

176
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:38,020
She worked.

177
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,400
She also took care of me.

178
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,867
You and your mom are much stronger than I thought.

179
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,137
Of course.

180
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,717
We had only each other.

181
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:05,057
No matter how tough it was,

182
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,857
we had to get through it.

183
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:20,897
Until you let Pak take care of me...

184
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,063
P'Pak didn't just give me money you sent.

185
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,878
He took care of everything for me and Mom.

186
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,136
When Mom was seriously ill in the hospital,

187
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:41,717
P'Pak arrived before me.

188
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:51,337
Mom was happy for a period of time.

189
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,197
I think it was also due to Pak.

190
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,320
I feel you and Pak have a very strong relationship.

191
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:10,897
I heard he took care of you daily during the funeral, didn't he? (Thai funerals are 3-7 days.)

192
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,217
Lita, do you really love him?

193
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,371
- It doesn't matter.
- I asked if you really love him.

194
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,700
Yes, Dad.

195
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,217
I'll take care of it.

196
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,230
[Welcome, Baby!]

197
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:33,658
Are you sure you will really do this?

198
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:38,614
So I can move on finally.

199
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:51,214
I believe that one day you will be stronger.

200
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,294
I'm right here for you.

201
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:59,191
Thanks.

202

[The Legend]

203
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:45,894
Yes, check with the shop if these products are complete.

204
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,934
Is one of them missing?

205
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,534
I'll go get it.

206
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:56,857
Lita.

207
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:03,365
I'm sorry about your mother.

208
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,751
I'm sorry I didn't go.

209
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,814
It's okay, I understand.

210
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,855
Saint.

211
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:32,244
I have a meeting on Floor 22. Call me about any issues.

212
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,644
Yes.

213
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,984
Rin!

214
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:44,594
Aren't you going to work here anymore?

215
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,110
[Human Resources Manager]

216
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:53,091
Is Rin being transferred to Phuket (over 400 miles south)?

217
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:57,734
Yes, Rin's transfer order to the Phuket branch was released.

218
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:05,394
Being so far away from P'Pak, you will miss each other badly.

219
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,145
- P'Pak.
- Saint, what's up?

220
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:15,306
I think you've done too much.

221
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,611
Why must you mistreat Rin like that?

222
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:19,837
Did you ever love her?

223
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:22,061
I understand you're worried about Rin,

224
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,944
but I think between me and her is our private matter.

225
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,224
Others shouldn't be involved.

226
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:30,137
If it's really your private matter, why affect her job?

227
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,421
Why harass her to that point?

228
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,211
What did I do?

229
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:35,684
Rin is being transferred to Phuket.

230
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,641
- Was she ordered to move to Phuket?
- Yes.

231
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,932
You guys did this, right?

232
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,397
Sit down.

233
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:08,909
About the transfer to Phuket,

234
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:11,106
is that your order?

235
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:14,371
You probably think I'm harassing you, right?

236
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,864
It's not.

237
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:18,854
I see you've been through a lot lately.

238
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,564
I feel guilty

239
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:25,714
so I want to move you to a higher position in Phuket.

240
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:30,321
There, you will instantly be promoted to a director.

241
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,914
I don't want to go.

242
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:43,712
Sir, Mr. Pak would like to see you.

243
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,117
Come in.

244
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,774
Sir.

245
00:25:57,774 --> 00:26:00,271
If Rin doesn't want to go, I'll go there instead.

246
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:03,244
I'm transferring Rin to be Director there.

247
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,311
It's a career growth.

248
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:08,934
Hey, why don't you see things positively?

249
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:12,757
Do you dare to confirm

250
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:17,694
that I'm being moved there not due to Lita and P'Pak?

251
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:22,794
And how is it not good to you?

252
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:28,814
Moving there, you won't feel uncomfortable like you are here.

253
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:31,074
My team is here.

254
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:36,431
I insist I won't go anywhere.

255
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:39,982
Please, Sir. Let me go instead.

256
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:41,934
Quiet, Pak!

257
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,818
Rin, think about it carefully.

258
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:50,114
What advantage will you receive if you go there?

259
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,374
And you probably know that I can do what I want.

260
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,031
Rin, wait!

261
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,597
Rin.

262
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:15,511
Don't worry.

263
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:19,314
I will do everything so you don't have to go.

264
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,704
I really mean it.

265
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:26,574
I won't let you suffer again because of me.

266
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:29,884
If it was before,

267
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,951
to hear you say this,

268
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,594
I would have been glad the one I loved tried to protect me.

269
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:37,944
But now,

270
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:42,144
I can give you only disgust.

271
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,734
I hate that you pretend to be a good guy.

272
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,914
What I will do from now on,

273
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:50,614
I will decide it myself.

274
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:18,354
Did P'Pak not know about this?

275
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:22,197
What about Lita?

276
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,954
I'm not sure about her, either.

277
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,951
Did you know about Rin being transferred?

278
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:43,154
No. I just found out, too.

279
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:48,294
Are you sure you didn't tell Jak to move Rin away?

280
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,454
I didn't tell him to do it.

281
00:28:56,804 --> 00:29:00,644
In everyone's eyes, I look wicked.

282
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:02,597
But believe me,

283
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:05,617
there's no way I'll harass Rin.

284
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:07,974
I would have believed you

285
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:12,194
if you hadn't surprised us earlier.

286
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:32,254
You can park right there.

287
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,391
Are you okay?

288
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:45,924
Of course.

289
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:51,817
So... I'm getting out.

290
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,504
Lita!

291
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:48,297
Rin.

292
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,151
Lita!

293
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,004
Lita!

294
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:36,474
Are you okay?

295
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,611
I'm fine.

296
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,154
Why are you seeing me so late? What's wrong?

297
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,854
Dad.

298
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:05,375
The corporate restructuring, have you made up your mind?

299
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,697
Yes, of course.

300
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:09,457
I considered the capabilities.

301
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:14,994
Your brother and the VIP Team have the most outstanding performance,

302
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:20,471
but don't worry. If Jak becomes the board president,

303
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,517
I'll still take care of things from behind anyway.

304
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:27,717
All has to come from my decision as before.

305
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,206
Just don't bother your brother.

306
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,124
That'll be all.

307
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,611
Are you sure

308
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:38,174
that Jak wants you behind him all the time?

309
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:43,357
I think...

310
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,514
you should watch this video clip first.

311
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:49,604
Here.

312
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:56,974
At the next general meeting of shareholders,

313
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,634
I would like to request everyone's cooperation

314
00:33:00,657 --> 00:33:03,154
to remove Mr. Chokchai as President.

315
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,387
- Dad.
- Oh, hi.

316
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,690
- Yuth, are you free today?
- Yes.

317
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,803
- Sit down.
- Yes.

318
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,757
Don't you usually rest on Sundays?

319
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:36,424
Why did you call us to eat with you today?

320
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:39,604
I have just made my decision

321
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,834
so I wanted to tell you guys.

322
00:33:42,864 --> 00:33:45,114
What's the matter?

323
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:49,914
I have come to a decision about

324
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:56,054
who the next president of The Legend will be.

325
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:07,064
This person must be someone who knows our company very well,

326
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:12,774
someone with ability to make our company grow

327
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:17,454
and who dares to make decisions.

328
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:22,871
But the most important thing is

329
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:26,674
the position shall belong to the child I can trust the most.

330
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,817
That person is...

331
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,474
Treenate, your older sister.

332
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:02,074
Hello, everyone.

333
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,437
- P'Nate.
- P'Nate.

334
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:10,757
What? Why the shocked expressions?

335
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:13,617
Aren't you happy that I'm back?

336
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:15,884
Or are you shocked that I got prettier?

337
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,414
The doctor there is no joke (excellent).

338
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,864
Weren't you staying in the United States?

339
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:22,391
I've just landed.

340
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:27,794
When Dad said he will give me an important position, I hurried back.

341
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:37,474
Dad, I missed you so much.

342
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:42,264
Thank you for trusting me

343
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:45,254
to be President of The Legend.

344
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,951
I have already talked to all the shareholders.

345
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,471
Prepare to take the position tomorrow.

346
00:35:58,477 --> 00:35:59,911
Go sit down.

347
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,554
Since we're all here, let's eat.

348
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,224
Dad.

349
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,984
Yes?

350
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:28,574
Why did you call Nate back to assume the position?

351
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,824
From the qualifications I saw,

352
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,214
she is suitable for this position.

353
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,864
Then I'll be honest.

354
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,438
I thought you would give me this position,

355
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:50,611
since I and the VIP Team are always dedicated to the company.

356
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:54,271
Not like Nate, who lived overseas and never cared for our business.

357
00:36:56,771 --> 00:37:00,874
I actually intended to give the president position to you,

358
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,094
until I saw this video.

359
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:17,611
At the next general meeting of shareholders,

360
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,371
I would like to request everyone's cooperation

361
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,654
to remove Mr. Chokchai as President.

362
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:33,134
I was wrong, Dad. I'm sorry.

363
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,294
Don't apologize to me.

364
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:41,617
Since you were young, I taught you how to compete.

365
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,863
I taught you to be ambitious.

366
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,544
Although you'll beat me one day,

367
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:50,744
I have no regrets.

368
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:58,484
But this caused you to be removed from the candidate list.

369
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,904
You missed the mark (failed).

370
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,111
You were careless

371
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:06,734
and let it get to you.

372
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:10,684
If you want to apologize to anyone,

373
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:12,497
think about it again.

374
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:15,044
The person you should apologize to

375
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:19,114
is yourself, as you weren't careful enough.

376
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:33,634
Nate's return will be a valuable lesson to you.

377
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:25,187
I want everyone to believe in Treenate,

378
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:28,001
just like you believed in me.

379
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:34,911
And I believe that my daughter, Treenate, will act as the chairwoman of The Legend perfectly.

380
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:39,043
I've worked in the United States a long time.

381
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:43,363
When I entered the building, I felt the instant warmth

382
00:39:43,363 --> 00:39:45,697
because I played and ran around here as a child.

383
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:52,100
Dad scolded me, saying this place belonged to men, not women.

384
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:56,723
I thought that my father wouldn't let me work here,

385
00:39:56,723 --> 00:40:00,990
but actually, that was his test.

386
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,890
He wanted to push me to the outside world

387
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:09,260
and bring that experience back to make The Legend stronger.

388
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,043
Dad.

389
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,480
I won't disappoint you.
[The Legend]

390
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,650
Nate got the position of President.

391
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,440
Both you and Lita probably won't be promoted anytime soon.

392
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:50,157
I understand that, Sir.

393
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,060
Are you all right?

394
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,757
I'm fine for now.

395
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:03,622
But after this, I can't imagine it.

396
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:11,240
I'm ordering you two to be careful in what you do from now on.

397
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:15,300
Don't ruin this.

398
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,320
If Nate finds out about your relationship,

399
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,830
she will surely use this to attack me.

400
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,500
And if we make a mistake,

401
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,360
all we've done will be in vain.

402
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,990
Remember it.

403
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,200
P'Ji.

404
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,683
You really didn't know Ms. Treenate would take the position of President?

405
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,730
How would I know?

406
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,463
Previously, Mr. Jakchai was still confident

407
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:54,900
that if he became the President, he would promote some people.

408
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,650
But it is really weird.

409
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,790
Suddenly, the older sister, who was never part of the company's business,

410
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,783
has got the title of President.

411
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:07,483
Right.

412
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,560
It's very strange.

413
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,920
It seems Khun Chokchai is dissatisfied with Khun Jakchai.

414
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:21,657
But... Maybe it's a problem within their family that we don't know about.

415
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,310
Anyway, we have no idea what kind of person Ms. Treenate is,

416
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,237
what her management approach is, and the effects on the VIP Team.

417
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:34,937
We must be prepared to handle this.

418
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,710
I've unconsciously helped the enemy.

419
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,520
If you think optimistically,

420
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,217
Khun Treenate might not be as scary as Khun Jakchai.

421
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:55,477
She is a woman, anyway.

422
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:58,297
She doesn't know the business as much as Mr. Jak.

423
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:03,960
You still don't know my sister.

424
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,963
Among the three siblings,

425
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:11,758
Nate is the one most like my Dad.

426
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:15,410
Both Khun Yutthachai's Marketing Department and Khun Jakchai's VIP Team

427
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,030
haven't submitted the sales data of the latest quarter yet,

428
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,610
claiming to prepare the data.

429
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,877
It's only a few clicks away.

430
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:25,463
They didn't send it to me as they wanted to thwart me.

431
00:43:25,463 --> 00:43:29,374
My younger brothers are adults now, but they don't act like it..

432
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:33,850
Regarding the resignation complaints and the transfer of personnel,

433
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,630
I've asked HR department for the data.

434
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,260
Anything interesting?

435
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,600
An order to transfer Rinnara.

436
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:50,320
"Rinnara"? VIP Team Manager?

437
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,530
Here it is.

438
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,950
[For restructuring, we transfer VIP Manager, Mrs. Rinnara Yamonkan, to Department Director at The Legend, Phuket Branch.]

439
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,341
Well, then I'll finish eating and go see Prae.

440
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:18,741
Okay.

441
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:22,884
- The same menu, please.
- Okay.

442
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:30,657
It is my treat.

443
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:37,440
Hello, Madam.

444
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,570
Thanks.

445
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,517
Would you like me to order more food from outside, President?

446
00:45:05,517 --> 00:45:08,160
No, this is enough.

447
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:13,137
And one more thing, stop calling me "President."

448
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:16,393
Call me "Treenate" or "Nate."

449
00:45:17,263 --> 00:45:20,120
Do I look that arrogant?

450
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,217
I didn't mean that.

451
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:28,680
You're the President, yet you eat in the food court for employees.

452
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,380
No one thinks you're arrogant.

453
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,557
Customers are very impressed with the VIP Team due to your silver tongue (eloquence),

454
00:45:36,557 --> 00:45:39,840
and your team has the best performance.

455
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:43,760
I'll have to learn from you.

456
00:45:44,517 --> 00:45:49,020
It's me who has to seek advice from you.

457
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:56,727
And our team's great performance isn't my effort alone.

458
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:00,320
Everyone in the team is really talented.

459
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:04,798
You're a manager. You can take credit for yourself;

460
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:07,138
no need to praise the team.

461
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,530
Each one on the team truly helps me.

462
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,610
Credit goes to all in the team.

463
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,920
You love your team so much.

464
00:46:19,663 --> 00:46:22,840
Why do you want to move to Phuket?

465
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:29,270
I saw your transfer order so I was wondering.

466
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,660
Why would such a talent as you want to move there?

467
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:37,303
Even your husband is here.

00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:39,003

469
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:42,099
I can differentiate between work and private matters.

470
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,736
Won't you regret it since you've done a lot for the VIP Team?

471
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,023
Maybe it's time for me to prove myself...

472
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:52,950
that I'm not stuck in past successes.

473
00:46:57,603 --> 00:46:59,500

00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:02,523
Okay.

480
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,630
What did you discuss with Nate just now?

481
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:18,083
We talked about The Legend in general.

482
00:48:19,217 --> 00:48:21,037
Are you sure?

483
00:48:21,037 --> 00:48:24,020
You didn't betray me to cooperate with Nate?

484
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:28,460
Why do you think I would do that?

485
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:39,260
You didn't discuss the VIP Team with her, did you?

486
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,403
Khun Treenate is suspicious

487
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,920
about my move to Phuket.

488
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:52,530
She wonders... Why did you order to transfer me?

489
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:55,967
And what did you tell her?

490
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,957
I didn't tell her

491
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:03,457
I wasn't willing to be transferred.

492
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:07,480
But even if I didn't say a thing, Khun Treenate looked suspicious anyway.

493
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:12,657
Perhaps if she continues to dig further,

494
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:17,380
she may find evidence why I'm being transferred...

495
00:49:18,078 --> 00:49:20,728
because of your daughter.

496
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:32,383
If you don't want to, then don't move.

497
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:35,600

499
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,910
It seems Ms. Treenate becoming President of the company

500
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,980
benefits me more than you.

501
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,750
I'm warning you with good intentions.

502
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,760
Someone like Nate cannot be trusted at all.

503
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,970
She never really wished anyone well.

504
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,640
Don't worry about me.

505
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:14,320

A moment ago, Khun Jakchai called Rin to meet him.

510
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:14,803
He must have seen that you were with Rin at the cafeteria just now.

511
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:18,780
He's probably afraid of what Rin would tell you.

512
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,220
When I talked to Rin...

513
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:29,210
I knew that she was hiding something from me.

514
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,177
And if Jak wanted to talk to her,

515
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:34,857
it means this must be something about him.

516
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,660
We are proceeding correctly.

00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,774
How will I work?

541
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:12,734
In this case, for the virus to enter the computer, it means the owner clicked on

542
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:17,197
a pirated link, a pornographic link, or a psycho website.

543
00:54:17,197 --> 00:54:19,034
What do you mean? What do you mean?

544
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,094
What? I'm stating facts!

545
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,167
What's wrong? Are you crazy?

546
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,274
You didn't do your job properly!

547
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:28,620
What? You blame others for what you did yourself!

548
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,067
What happened?

549
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:33,787
I apologize on behalf of my subordinate, Mr. Danai.

550
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,837
You probably know that

551
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:41,220
the marketing director's computer contains files worth tens of millions of baht.

552
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,620
If they're gone, who will be responsible?

553
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,147
Today, you have to restore them all.

554
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:50,614
If you can't do it,

555
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:53,717
I'll sue your whole IT department.

556
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,497
You, quickly fix it.

557
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,277
Yes.

558
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,540
[VIP Management Team]

559
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:12,154
Meena.

560
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:17,840
I saw Danai bully Jomphol. He was heard throughout the IT department.

561
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,374
Really? H-How is Jomphol now?

562
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:24,280
I saw he was trying to argue back, but Danai didn't stop.

563
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,897
Until now, he had to work hard to fix it.

564
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,434
Wait.

565
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:33,554
Why is Danai bullying Jomphol?

566
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:37,804
Right. Normally, those two don't have any problems.

567
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:39,537
I don't know, either.

568
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,668
Excuse me.

569
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:09,717
I brought you coffee.

570
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:17,019
Thank you.

571
00:56:27,457 --> 00:56:29,230
Send that file to me.

572
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,770
Is it in the file server?

573
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,370
All right.

574
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:41,497
Done, Bro.

575
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,677
You haven't finished recovering files yet? It's late.

576
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:24,817
It's not even half of it yet.

577
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,167
But don't worry.

578
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,957
I told the nanny to stay late today.

579
00:57:31,654 --> 00:57:33,774
I'm not worried about our children.

580
00:57:33,774 --> 00:57:35,977
I'm worried about you.

581
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:54,927
Why are you so unlucky, turning into Danai's tool?

582
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:57,674
I'm not unlucky.

583
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:01,237
He intended to harass me.

584
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:04,897
I've checked already and didn't see any virus at all.

585
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,560
He must resent that I punched him.

586
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:13,173
You are harassed due to me.

587
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:16,234
Not at all.

588
00:58:16,234 --> 00:58:20,477
You didn't do anything wrong. That jerk is wrong.

589
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,777
I have to get even with him (revenge) one day.

590
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,867
Hey, I'm just joking.

591
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:41,040
How could we harm him?

592
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,647
I remember what you told me.

593
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:46,247
If we fight with him, we will be in trouble, right?

594
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:51,140
Hey.

595
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,287
I'm sorry.

596
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:57,884
Sorry that I'm your useless husband.

597
00:58:57,884 --> 00:59:00,604
I don't have a high position.

598
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,454
I can't protect you.

599
00:59:03,454 --> 00:59:06,034
I'm really sorry.

600
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:09,617
I'm the one to apologize to you.

601
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:16,160
If I didn't choose the wrong way, you wouldn't be in this position.

602
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,460
I'm sorry.

603
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,594
Are you tired?

604
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,854
I have to work.

605
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:55,884
Hey!

606
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,134
Why did you do that?

607
00:59:58,134 --> 01:00:01,894
What? Are you here to harass me?

608
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:04,187
Are you angry I did it to your husband?

609
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:06,532
Or are you angry about what I did to you?

610
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,757
Can you stop bothering us?

611
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:13,080
How can I do that?

612
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,167
Your husband punched me in the face, causing it to swell for several days.

613
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:20,094
I won't stop so easily. Just wait and see.

614
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:21,694
Hey!

615
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:29,754
I beg you.

616
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,257
Don't hurt Jomphol, please.

617
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,977
If you want to beg me...

618
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:41,167
there must be something in exchange.

619
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,085
What are you doing?

620
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:46,787
Let's continue where we stopped.

621
01:00:46,787 --> 01:00:48,094
- Let me go! Help!
- Wait!

622
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:49,594
Wait a minute!

623
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,340
Quiet!

624
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,047
- Be quiet! It will be over soon.
- Let me go!

625
01:01:02,047 --> 01:01:05,697
Help, someone help me!

626
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,847
Come here!

627
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,134
You make me use strength.

628
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:25,497
You're quite strong.

629
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,854
No!

630
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:31,754
Help me! Help!

631
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,907
- Darn it!
- Stop!

632
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:57,708
If you do anything to the people in my team, even a little,

633
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,694
you will be in trouble.

634
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,614
Put this on.

635
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:16,694
Are you okay?

636
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,760
Didn't I tell you to stay away from Danai?

637
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,880
Prae.

638
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,214
Now is not the time to blame her.

639
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:43,627
Meena, did he hurt you?

640
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:44,581
What?

641
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:47,207
He didn't do anything since

642
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:49,747
you two arrived first.

643
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:52,034
But if you two hadn't come, he...

644
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,634
Forget it.

645
01:02:56,174 --> 01:02:58,394
It's over.

646
01:02:58,394 --> 01:03:01,667
As long as you're okay, that's enough.

647
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:05,797
If I was with you, I wouldn't let him hurt you.

648
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:16,017
Thank you so much.

649
01:03:26,794 --> 01:03:30,537
You two are so good to me.

650
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,940
I...

651
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,937
I shouldn't betray you!

652
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:49,954
The leaked footage from the event...

653
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:53,077
It was from me.

654
01:03:53,077 --> 01:03:55,057
I am sorry.

655
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:58,287
I am sorry.

656
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,897
So the video of pouring wine and Mr. Jakchai's plan to remove his own father,

657
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:10,154
you secretly filmed all of it?

658
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,380
I was so stupid to believe him!

659
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,414
You two can punish me.

660
01:04:21,414 --> 01:04:24,537
I really made a mistake. I'm sorry.

661
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:28,077
I understand her.

662
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:32,022
When people are under strong pressure,

663
01:04:32,022 --> 01:04:35,105
they can do anything to make themselves prosper.

664
01:04:35,694 --> 01:04:38,497
And I think Meena has already repented.

665
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,197
Thank you, Meena.

666
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:48,180
Thank you for being brave to confess the truth.

667
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,020
Now on, if you have any problems,

668
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,157
talk to us directly so we can help you solve the problem, okay?

669
01:04:55,154 --> 01:04:56,807
Yes.

670
01:04:56,807 --> 01:05:01,217
We are on the same team. Do you think I won't help you?

671
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,900
I am sorry.

672
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:12,934
I'm very grateful to you two.

673
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:14,734
Thanks.

674
01:05:18,227 --> 01:05:20,200
But that beast Danai...

675
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,997
I don't think we can pardon him like this.

676
01:05:22,997 --> 01:05:25,067
He harassed Jomphol and he...

677
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:28,634
He has attacked you twice.

678
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:32,807
But Danai is Yutthachai's man.

679
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:37,077
These bad guys must have done a lot of evil.

680
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:40,107
We must find a way to deal with him.
