Rin,

00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,513
I'll go to work now.

10
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,153
Don't be scared.

11
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:41,313
I won't let him transfer you anywhere.

12
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:44,873
I'll talk to him today.

15
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:56,653
- Nice to see you.
- Yes.

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,613
Hello.

17
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,033
How are you? It's been a while.

18
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,053
You're here before me?

19
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,913
Good to see you.

20
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,280
Where is Rin? Isn't she here?

21
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,480
She isn't feeling well.

22
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,760
Not feeling well?

23
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
That's weird.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,580
You need to control yourself; his wife isn't here.

25
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,520
If Ji found out they won't just announce the best employee,

26
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
but nice food is served,

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,580
she would be upset she isn't here.

28
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,320
Can anyone reach Rin?

29
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,920
I can't.

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,240
She's been quiet since yesterday. She didn't even text me back.

31
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,280
She just sent me an "okay" emoji.

32
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,380
I know how to help her out,

33
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,520
but we need to work together.

34
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,760
Count me in.

35
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to help her in anyway that I can.

36
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,900
What's your plan?

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,840
He pushed her to resign

38
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,760
so I'll resign, too.

39
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,784
Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Ms. Treenate

40
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,544
to give a little speech to start the event.

41
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:53,993
Our company came this far because of all of you,

42
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:56,073
not only the executives.

43
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:59,393
Every employee plays a significant part.

44
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:06,353
In conclusion, let's be the best executives

45
00:06:06,353 --> 00:06:10,373
and the best employees for our customers.

46
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:49,333
You keep looking at him like that; why don't you go sit on his lap?

47
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:10,440
About Rin, she said she needed time to decide.

48
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:15,413
About my resignation letter, can you consider it?

49
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,273
You still can't help her even if you resign.

50
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,353
But…

51
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:22,793
How about if the whole VIP Team resigns?

52
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,833
What did you say?

53
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:34,333
Everyone, please don't be this way.

54
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,940
What the heck is wrong with you?

55
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,913
Why did you bring this up now? Let's talk later.

56
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:41,113
We need to talk about it now.

57
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,913
You can't mix your personal wishes with work

58
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:46,033
and frame your employee like this.

59
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,033
Why can't I?

60
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,640
What are you guys discussing?

61
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,213
It seems so tense. Is it about work?

62
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:54,873
It's about work. It's normal, and it's nothing.

63
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,200
It is.

64
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,113
There was a random inspection of our warehouse,

65
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,833
and two bags went missing.

66
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,673
Prae! Stop, right now.

67
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,473
Don't worry.

68
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,673
Go ahead, tell me.

69
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,993
What is it?

70
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:18,953
Pakawat?

71
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,593
Tell me, what's going on?

72
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
If you won't, then I'll say it.

73
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,366
Prae.

74
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,673
Dad.

75
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:15,813
Jak's beloved daughter is having an affair with Pakawat.

76
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,073
Oh my gosh!

77
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:31,033
Jak,

78
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:36,193
bring your daughter and Pakawat to see me now.

79
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,028

81
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,633
I'm sorry.

82
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:04,413
Why did you say that? It's not true.

83
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,213
Dad,

84
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,273
someone faked these photos. They're not real.

85
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,333
If he messed with my daughter for real, I wouldn't let him go.

86
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,153
You knew about this?

87
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Is this the first time you're seeing this?

88
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:30,713
You should ask your people about it first.

89
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,673
You never asked about it!

90
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,833
I… Someone threatened me.

91
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,793
They threatened to ruin my reputation.

92
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,593
They couldn't do it so they took it out on my daughter.

93
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:47,940
They took it out on Pak.

94
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,440
This is not true.

95
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,393
I'm sorry.

96
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,793
It's my fault,

97
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:04,593
but it happened out of love.

98
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,793
You need to shut up, Lita!

99
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:14,173
So you're having an affair with him, aren't you?

100
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:19,953
Fine.

101
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:23,533
It's your dad's fault.

102
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,073
If he had known better not to mess around,

103
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,713
his DNA would have been better than this!

104
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:41,113
Your daughter's scandal has ruined our reputation.

105
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,993
I really wanted you to take over the business,

106
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,433
but you let this happen!

107
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,773
How can I ever hand the business to you?

108
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,073
I'm sorry.

109
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,993
Nate is a woman, but she's better than you!

110
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:09,533
I told the team not to let this scandal out.

111
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:15,233
I promise this won't affect our company.

112
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:29,673
How is it?

113
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:34,913
How is it?

114
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:37,513
- Didn't she pick up her phone yet?
- No reply.

115
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:40,113
I don't think she wants to talk right now.

116
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,913
She will call us back. We've called so many times.

117
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:45,993
I like that she decided to do it,

118
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:48,693
but I worry things could get worse.

119
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:52,893
I think it can't get worse than this.

120
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,673
Her husband cheated on her.

121
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,113
She was framed for stealing bags.

122
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,873
Aren't these bad enough?

123
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,113
Someone like Mr. Jakchai,

124
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,433
when he was attacked like this,

125
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,833
he won't stay still for sure.

126
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:26,853
Rin,

127
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,873
you shouldn't have done that.

128
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,793
Are you ashamed of that?

129
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:38,993
I know I've done something bad to you.

130
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,953
I'm not ashamed you did it.

131
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,453
I deserved to be called out.

132
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,033
But you,

133
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:47,913
Jak's dad told him off.

134
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,673
Jak is furious.

135
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:52,213
What about what he did to me?

136
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,993
I won't be the only victim here.

137
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:01,113
Wait, if you wanted to take it out on someone,

138
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,513
let it be me only.

139
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:07,713
I won't do anything to you.

140
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:11,913
But if you attack others like this, I can't control them.

141
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:15,633
He pushed me and left me with no choice.

142
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:20,113
I fought with my back against the wall.

143
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:25,393
I can only tolerate this for so long.

144
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,453
You can ask other women except for Lita.

145
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,713
If they experienced the same thing,

146
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:37,093
would they just stay home and cry?

147
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:43,473
Jak asked you to take care of me, didn't he?

148
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,933
He wants me to announce that it isn't true, between you and Lita.

149
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,093
It's not like that.

150
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,673
He didn't ask me to do anything,

151
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,813
and I feared that the most.

152
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:00,273
If he takes care of it by himself,

153
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:02,073
it will be harsh,

154
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,773
- and it won't end easily.
- I'm not scared.

155
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,833
I'll fight him.

156
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,273
Wait.

157
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,153
Can you listen to me for once?

00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:32,120
Are you... the woman whom Pak chooses to love?

184
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,560
How dare you talk to me like that?

185
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You and Pak stomped on my heart,

186
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,420
and your dad harmed me over and over.

187
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,487
I am the victim here.

188
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,447
What did you expect me to do?

189
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,727
Accept whatever garbage thrown at me?

190
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,487
Is it fair for me?

191
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,487
I don't care what you do to me.

192
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,727
You can do more than this, and I'm fine with that.

193
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,007
For me, Pak is nothing like that.

194
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,807
I don't want anyone to look at him that way.

195
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,900
Please, I beg you.

196
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,500
For Pak's sake,

197
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,860
can't you do something?

198
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,980
Can't you say something about the scandal?

199
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,520
And I'll talk to dad about your suspension.

200
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,160
Please?

201
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,040
Excuse me, everyone.

202
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,691
Say it again, as you told me earlier.

203
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,700
Rin?

204
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
- Jakchai's daughter...
- Rin?

205
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,820
she asked me to say something about the her and Pak's scandal,

206
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,360
and she'd ask her dad to cancel my suspension.

207
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,300
We're done here. Let's go to another one.

208
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,700
[The Legend]

209
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,340
Your drinks are here.

210
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,620
Lita is weird.

211
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,140
She asked like she wanted to upset you more.

212
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,280
I don't know if she will run to her dad about it.

213
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,440
Jakchai will know about it soon.

214
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,220
How's the office?

215
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,380
People are talking,

216
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,840
and if the scandal goes out to the media, we're dead meat for sure.

217
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,260
Did Ms. Treenate call you yet?

218
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,020
I think she will want something from you.

219
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,700
She called me earlier, asking me to join her team.

220
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,780
I refused her offer because I don't want to break our team.

221
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,300
Let it be.

222
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,460
If we need to work for Mr. Jakchai,

223
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,080
I'd rather find a new job.

224
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,060
During the anniversary event,

225
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,800
we were all about to resign.

226
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,240
We haven't done so, but we'll talk to him today.

227
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,800
Hey, wait!

228
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,156
I don't want all of you to be in trouble for me.

229
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:21,420
Rin, this is about us, too.

230
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,900
It's not about you only.

231
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,640
He doesn't like you, and he framed you today.

232
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,540
We don't know if he'll do something like this to us later.

233
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,325
That's right.

234
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:34,500
We can't let this go easily.

235
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,620
We can't pretend to ignore this unjust treatment.

236
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,140
One day, it could happen to other employees.

237
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,600
The more we stay quiet,

238
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,500
we let him treat us the same.

239
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,020
He will see nothing wrong with it if we don't react.

240
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,560
In the end, he will do that to someone else.

241
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,380
I told our employees to keep their mouth shut about this scandal.

242
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,580
I ordered that if anyone leaked the photos,

243
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,780
I'd fire them and bring this to court.

244
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,900
Well thought-out plan.

245
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,820
If the scandal is leaked, the reporters will attack us.

246
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,820
Our shares will drop.

247
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,800
Our clients will complain.

248
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,380
It could be worse than Mon and Lita's fight.

249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,120
The pictures are so vivid.

250
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,160
It'll be hard to come up with excuses.

251
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,980
Why are you standing still?

252
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,240
You need to thank your sister.

253
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Thank you.

254
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,673
It's okay.

255
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,265
This is my job as president.

256
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,950
[The Legend]

257
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,580
Prae!

258
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,020
What's up?

259
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,620
Did you see this?

260
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,920
Who leaked the photos?

261
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,160
Ms. Treenate ordered us to not do anything about it!

262
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,560
It's more than that.

263
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,720
People keep calling out Lita and Pak.

264
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
They keep retweeting their scandal.

265
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,140
Do you think Rin did it?

266
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,780
[The Legend]

267
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,420
After the clips were leaked, our shares keep dropping.

268
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,472
Soon, it will affect our sales.

269
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,080
After Lita and Mon's clip leaked,

270
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,520
the wives banned our malls.

271
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,520
I'll find out who did this.

272
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,160
Don't you think you should do something?

273
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,220
I'm afraid I'll cause more damages if we say something.

274
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,000
If we keep quiet like this,

275
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
people will soon forget about it.

276
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
I hope so,

277
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,200
but if it doesn't end as easily as you think!

278
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,960
People keep confronting us! This will damage our company.

279
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,040
What will you do about that?

280
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,480
How is it?

281
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,628
Almost done.

282
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:16,760
I used a fake IP Address.

283
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,520
No one will find out who leaked it.

284
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,950
[The Legend]

285
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,653
Excuse me.

286
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:22,213
Did you take a picture of me?

287
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,920
I did not, I was just looking at myself from the camera.

288
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,713
But I was in there earlier.

289
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,893
I'm sorry that you felt that way.

290
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,353
I didn't mean it.

291
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:37,873
Please let me go.

292
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,593
How dare you? You wanted to be in the third clip?

293
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,873
You're too much.

294
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,993
I really didn't mean it!

295
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,553
Right.

296
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,130
[A shameless man, wanting to move up the ladder, has the executive's daughter as a mistress. I pity the wife with a bad husband.]

297
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,970
Rin,

298
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:31,113
- Pak!
- Rin?

299
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,533
Mom?

300
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:48,193
How could you do something horrible like this?

301
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:57,246
You know how hurtful it is

302
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,666
for a woman who was betrayed.

303
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:05,073
This is Rin.

304
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:08,713
You love her.

305
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:11,793
She wanted to spend her life with you.

306
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:16,953
She almost became the mother of your child.

307
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:22,433
How could you hurt her like this?

308
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,553
I'm sorry.

309
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:33,473
You don't have to say sorry to me.

310
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:35,793
You must apologize to your wife.

311
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:39,113
Even if you apologize to her,

312
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,233
you do it over and over.

313
00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:44,953
You need to apologize to her until the day you die,

314
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:48,593
and it won't be enough for breaking her heart.

315
00:30:57,513 --> 00:31:00,473
You shouldn't blame it all on him.

316
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,753
I was wrong, too.

317
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:17,753
- Mom?
- I apologize to you, Rin.

318
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,893
- Mom?
- Shut up, Pak!

319
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,393
I need to apologize to her!

320
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,960
It's my fault. I should have raised him to be a better man.

321
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,600
I never wanted this to happen to you.

322
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,320
It's my fault!

323
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:42,113
Mom?

324
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:52,153
I'm sorry.

325
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,153
It's not you.

326
00:31:57,393 --> 00:32:01,833
I love you like my own daughter.

327
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,273
Mom?

328
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:29,873
You promised me you wouldn't cheat on your wife,

329
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:31,673
but you still did.

330
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,313
I didn't mean...

331
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,046
for it to happen.

332
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,439
You sound just like your dad!

333
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:47,360
He said something like this to his family.

334
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,033
He said he didn't want to have me as a mistress.

335
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,779
When he was with me,

336
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:58,099
he said he loved me, that I was a nice lady.

337
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:02,113
He said he would leave them to be with me.

338
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:05,573
But I would never leave Rin.

339
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:08,473
The more you talk, the more you sound just like your dad!

340
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:13,452
I asked you...

341
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:20,113
not to hurt anyone, in the same way we were hurt.

342
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:24,753
But you still did.

343
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,233
Why is that? Why?

344
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
I really want to know. Why?

345
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,120
You won't forgive him no matter what, will you?

346
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:20,633
I know that Mom called,

347
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,240
and I know you went to see her in Chiang Mai (over 400 miles north of Bangkok).

348
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:35,913
I can't be like you.

349
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,513
I can't forgive

350
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:45,593
and... pretend like nothing happened.

351
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:48,993
I don't ask for you to forgive him,

352
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:53,553
but I don't want this to hurt your heart.

353
00:36:56,033 --> 00:37:00,093
Sooner or later, this will end.

354
00:37:01,793 --> 00:37:03,753
When it ends,

355
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:08,513
perhaps Pak won't care about your feelings anymore.

356
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:14,973
That woman won't see you anymore, either.

357
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:17,113
You will be the only one

358
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:21,673
who is stuck in this mess.

359
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:28,073
You'll ponder all these horrible things in your head

360
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:33,313
and hurt yourself over and over.

361
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:36,753
Rin,

00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,164
Now I feel better.

544
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:38,392
I'm glad that your love for her is still there,

545
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,960
but aren't you tired of being this way?

546
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:49,040
How will it end?

547
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,617
When?

548
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:15,177
Wow! He suspended both Pak and Lita.

549
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:18,600
Mr. Jakchai was willing to swallow his own blood?

550
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,981
It's because Rin never gave up.

551
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:23,896
And he needed to punish his daughter.

552
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:28,636
Well, I think we three will be in difficulty.

553
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:33,091
A director like P'Pak and a manager like Rin got suspended,

554
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,098
then we three need to work harder.

555
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,120
We have no one to help in making major decisions.

556
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,403
We can't blame anyone but P'Pak.

557
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:46,142
He didn't think it through. He cheated and it escalated so far.

558
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:56,745
Don't blame him.

559
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:00,834
It's all because of me.

560
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:05,877
I'm so sorry for causing you problems.

561
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:31,544
Yes?

562
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:36,322
Me? I'm putting beauty treatment on my hair.

563
00:53:36,322 --> 00:53:38,105
I think you should try it.

564
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:40,291
It can nourish your damaged hair.

565
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,714
I know. I won't be late.

566
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:46,169
It will take a few minutes.

567
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,966
[The Legend]

568
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:05,331
An announcement about a new appointment.

569
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:09,459
[The Legend would like to announce]

570
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:12,332
Ms. Rinnara Yamonkan

571
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,255
is no longer Manager of VIP Team.

572
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:22,821
[She will be appointed as Director of VIP Team instead.]

573
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:25,633
Please be informed.

574
00:54:32,374 --> 00:54:35,886
Did you know Rin would take over P'Pak's position?

575
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:40,605
Hey!

576
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,774
You can't promote or appoint anyone in my team!

577
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:25,159
Why can't I?

578
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,335
Dad appointed me President.

579
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:32,814
Pakawat was suspended until further notice.

580
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:36,627
The company needs a director to resume the work.

581
00:55:36,627 --> 00:55:39,733
I don't see anyone more suitable for this position than Rin.

582
00:55:39,733 --> 00:55:41,458
She is competent for the role,

583
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,065
and she knows VIP Team better than anyone.

584
00:55:45,518 --> 00:55:47,365
Why didn't you ask me first?

585
00:55:48,237 --> 00:55:50,294
You wanted to decide without me!

586
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:52,083
You wanted to insult me!

587
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,387
I didn't do any of that.

588
00:55:56,387 --> 00:56:00,200
What I did is helping you out.

589
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:03,626
If we didn't appoint a significant position to Rin,

590
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,094
she would be upset.

591
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,982
You would be in big trouble.

592
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,735
Well,

593
00:56:20,183 --> 00:56:22,143
stop whining already.

594
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:25,625
You raise your daughter right from now on.

595
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,360
The announcement is already out.

596
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,206
Rin will eventually become the new director of VIP Team.

597
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:40,177
A real man like you must feel so awkward

598
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:44,473
to see many powerful women, right?

599
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:09,507
Hooray!

600
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:13,086
Hooray!

601
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:14,477
Yes!

602
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,013
Welcome.

603
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:26,278
Let's go.

604
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,410
[Rinnara Yamonkan, VIP Director]

605
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:35,623
Congratulations, New Director.

606
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:46,629
Thank you for promoting me.

607
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,441
I know that

608
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:51,650
I am just one of your pawns, right?

609
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:56,718
I admit that I wanted to use you,

610
00:57:56,718 --> 00:58:01,165
and I want to transfer the VIP Team to be directly under me.

611
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:05,065
Can I ask why?

612
00:58:06,543 --> 00:58:08,368
You're a president.

613
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:11,394
You can find other talented people to work with.

614
00:58:11,394 --> 00:58:14,311
Why did you choose me and the VIP Team?

615
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:19,249
My president position is unstable.

616
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,200
In my dad's opinion,

617
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,628
Jak has more benefits over me.

618
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,943
He is a man.

619
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,805
But I... I'm a woman.

620
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,228
Dad never sees me,

621
00:58:32,693 --> 00:58:34,707
just like in your job.

622
00:58:34,707 --> 00:58:37,880
No matter how hard you worked,

623
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,483
Jak would see it still as Pak's work.

624
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,024
Therefore, we need to work together.

625
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,236
Women like us should unite to help each other.

626
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:56,260
I understand you,

627
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,008
but can I work independently?

628
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,138
I want to prove to everyone that

629
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,417
I can stand on my own.

630
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:13,366
Call me if you change your mind.

631
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,535
You are here?

632
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,146
Am I late?

633
00:59:33,146 --> 00:59:37,096
Well, you're 7.5 minutes late.

634
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,961
- I'm joking.
- Should we order drinks first?

635
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:44,490
Can I get one on the rocks (ice)?

636
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:56,116
- Khun.
- Yes?

637
00:59:56,116 --> 00:59:58,628
Did you call Pak?

638
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,490
Not really.

639
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:05,160
The last time I spoke with him, he seemed relieved that Rin's case was dropped.

640
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,942
After that, he has been quiet.

641
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:12,325
I texted him, and he just sent me an emoji saying he's fine.

642
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:14,424
I haven't talked to him in days.

643
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:18,937
He did something wrong,

644
01:00:18,937 --> 01:00:22,962
but I think he must feel really bad about it.

645
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:25,092
Right.

646
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:27,556
- Hey.
- What?

647
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:29,775
Can I ask you something?

648
01:00:29,775 --> 01:00:31,075
Speak.

649
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:34,623
You...

650
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:38,709
When did you know about P'Pak and Lita?

651
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,216
Since the beginning.

652
01:00:48,216 --> 01:00:50,231
Actually, I've known from the time it started.

653
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:52,632
Why did you help him?

654
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,595
Calm down, I…

655
01:00:55,595 --> 01:01:00,185
When I first knew, it was just that he was cheating on Rin.

656
01:01:00,185 --> 01:01:02,717
I didn't know it was Lita.

657
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:07,002
I decided to help him cover it up.

658
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:09,250
Why did you do that?

659
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,752
At first, I thought it was normal for married couples

660
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:16,580
to be in trouble or make some mistakes.

661
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,305
I thought if Rin didn't find out about it,

662
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:23,027
their relationship could continue.

663
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:25,063
Now I know I was wrong.

664
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:28,437
I didn't know that it would be this big.

665
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,275
I understand if you are angry with me.

666
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,669
I once did something wrong.

667
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:50,447
Then P'Pak and Rin forgave me

668
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:57,054
so I thought people should have a second chance.

669
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:03,831
Right?

670
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:05,641
I totally agree.

671
01:02:05,641 --> 01:02:08,743
I know you like to give people a second chance;

672
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:12,588
otherwise, you wouldn't have a drink with me.

673
01:02:31,188 --> 01:02:33,536
Let's play the staring game.

Congratulations on your new promotion.

676
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,863
Take good care of your team.

677
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,917
I built this up with my own hands.

678
01:03:07,592 --> 01:03:10,267
I hope you won't ruin it.

679
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:14,804
You know well that I've been through terrible things

680
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:20,361
in the past, but I still survived.

681
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:23,830
I can surely take care of the team.

682
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:31,011
But I don't think you called us here

683
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:33,374
just to celebrate, did you?

684
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,064

I'd like to improve our service system to be better.

687
01:03:44,952 --> 01:03:47,127
What do you have in mind?

688
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:50,700
Or would you like us to consider and present ideas to you?

689
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,539
It's nothing like that.

690
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:56,470
You already have much work to deal with. I don't want to burden you.
