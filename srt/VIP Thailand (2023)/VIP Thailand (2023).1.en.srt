🌟[VIP Thailand, Episode 1]🖤

8
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:06,316
With its outstanding customer service and wide selection of world-class brands,

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:12,019
The Legend has received good feedback all along.

10
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:19,437
This year, the mall has gained revenue of more than THB 13 billion (357 million USD).

11
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:24,176
It grew more than 45%.

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,680
[The Legend]

13
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:34,226
Next, please welcome Mr. Chokchai,

14
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:39,093
the president of The Legend, please give him a big round of applause!

15
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,019
Thank you, thank you so much.

16
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,966
I'm hosting this special event

17
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:18,656
because I see that all employees have been working hard for the growth of The Legend.

18
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:23,979
But there's one department that deserves my special praise.

19
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,246
This is a very significant department.

20
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,797
They're like an aorta (largest artery) of The Legend.

21
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:35,139
- They are...
- It must be our marketing team.

22
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,556
The VIP Team.

23
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,956
VIP Team won again.

24
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,193
This team doesn't take care of many customers,

25
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:08,459
but this team generates more than ฿2 billion ($55 million) annual revenue for our mall.

26
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,479
I'd like all of you to see this team as an example

27
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,039
in customer service and work dedication.

28
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,833
They give their all to the company.

29
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,921
Thank you so much.
[The Legend]

30
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:41,473
We gained high praise for our team.

31
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,586
It's because of you, Pakawat.

32
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:49,350
It's because all of us in the team worked hard.

33
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,253
We have talented, pretty ladies in our team,

34
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,833
just like super cars.

35
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,497
But the driver is the crucial part,

36
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,796
and you're my most trusted driver.

37
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:07,807
That's why I promoted you to be Team Director,

38
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,697
and you've never disappointed me.

39
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,616
Cheers to you all!

40
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,684
Hello, Ms. Mon.

41
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:22,096
Isn't Rin coming?

42
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,277
She's preparing to welcome Ms. Nicha, our VIP client.

43
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,250
She will visit tomorrow.

44
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,836
Is everyone ready?

45
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:48,696
Did no one tell you that we can't leak any photos from here?

46
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,010
Welcome.

47
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,793
What would you like to drink, Madam?

48
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,078
Don't you remember?

49
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,816
Hot green tea latte.

50
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,433
Are you ready?

51
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,416
I'll get a bigger size right now.

52
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,043
Actually, we prepared the regular size for you already.

53
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,186
Do you think I gained weight?

54
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:55,293
This brand's size runs smaller than others.

55
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:59,596
Are you saying that if I want to wear this brand, I need to lose weight?

56
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,656
I don't want it anymore!

57
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,596
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,836
Here it is, Madam.

59
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:17,996
I'm not wearing an S; it must be an XS.

60
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:25,286
♫ Have you ever seen an elephant? ♫

61
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:29,936
♫ It's huge with a long nose called its trunk ♫

62
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:49,019
Who said you could put this elephant song on when they complain about weight gain?

63
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,076
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,653
Let me ask you something;

65
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:57,113
must we really do this?

66
00:07:57,113 --> 00:08:00,046
The real deal is much tougher than this.

67
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,743
She's right.

68
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:05,646
Ms. Nicha is a perfectionist. Everything has to be in order.

69
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,136
Good morning, Ms. Nicha.

70
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,576
Play nice, okay?

71
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,019
You need to take good care of her.

72
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,419
Got it.

73
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:34,236
Welcome to The Legend.

74
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,562
Good morning, Madam.

75
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,070
What would you like to drink, Madam?

76
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,416
Your usual hot green tea latte with 25% syrup?

77
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,376
All done, Madam.

78
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,936
See you later.

79
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:21,196
Take this tip and share with your team.
[฿500,000 ($13,700)]

80
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:27,313
I'm so happy today.

81
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:30,533
The Legend always gives me a perfect time,

82
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,613
like nowhere else.

83
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,016
Thank you so much.

84
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,126
She was happy, but her face was emotionless.

85
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:52,219
I couldn't even picture her when she wasn't so happy.

86
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,739
Perhaps she just got Botox. Everything looked stiff.

87
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,136
You're here?

88
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,987
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello.

89
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,266
That must be Yuth.

90
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,536
Hello, Dad.

91
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:32,655
Hello, why did you drive by yourself this time?

92
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,549
Is someone here?

93
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,000
- Grandpa!
- Earng?

94
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,661
- Grandpa!
- Ohm! Come on up here.

95
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:45,002
You two are growing so fast.

96
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:48,349
- You're a lady now.
- I missed you so much.

97
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,783
When did you guys come back?

98
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,029
I saw you posted pictures in Boston this morning.

99
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,248
Dad told me to rush home to Grandpa during the break

100
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,694
because he could need my help with something.

101
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:00,777
Stay here and don't ever leave.

102
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:07,706
What about you, Mon?

103
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,363
When will you get pregnant and give me more grandchildren?

104
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,569
You've been married for years, haven't you?

105
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:22,269
That's right.

106
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,423
Let's go inside. Let's chat! Come!

107
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:28,883
Are you hungry? Did you miss Thai food?

108
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,783
One point for me.

109
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,926
- You had Thai food there?
- Not really.

110
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:54,206
I have a surprise for you.

111
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:13,383
I heard you said that you'd like to try food from Chef Gig.

112
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,343
I invited Chef Gig to be here just for you.

113
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,726
- He's here?
- That's right.

114
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,743
This dish is called Underwater Dragon.

115
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:26,845
A cold noodles dish: I used a special sauce of dashi (kelp, fish flakes) and sesame oil,

116
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:31,463
with seven-colored lobster from Phuket and caviar on top from Italy.

117
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:34,103
I also added ikura (salmon roe) from Hokkaido,

118
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:38,151
and three types of herbs, including Thai cilantro, dill, and culantro (coriander).

119
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,523
Enjoy Underwater Dragon.

120
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,567
Thank you so much.

121
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:48,823
I'm glad that you're taking such good care of Dad.

122
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:52,646
I'm so busy at work, unlike you.

123
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,664
About your job, you shouldn't take it too seriously.

124
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:59,865
We can't work all the time.

125
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,156
Got it.

126
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:06,100
Talking about work, how much revenue can the VIP team generate today?

127
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,573
About ฿10 million ($275,000) or more.

128
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:10,129
Ten million for today?

129
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,029
Yes, Dad.

130
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:16,463
What about your marketing team? How much revenue can you generate?

131
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:18,863
I...

132
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,183
- I...
- That's fine.

133
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:28,776
I didn't mean that. I forced you to work harder or do anything.

134
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,409
Yes, Dad.

135
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,276
- Come on, let's eat.
- Sure.

136
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,246
Smells so good.

137
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,853
Cheers!

138
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:07,616
I'm not even on the VIP team, but still, you invited me here. Thanks.

139
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,923
We're here in your house instead of a restaurant

140
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:13,666
so you can show how lovely you two are, right?

141
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,789
I've been wondering about this for so long.

142
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,423
Aren't you two tired of each other?

143
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:23,163
You're working together, and you're living in the same house.

144
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:27,749
If you have a nice guy by your side, you won't be tired of him ever.

145
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,643
Oh my goodness!

146
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:32,926
Let's chat with her.

147
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:35,415
You're blushing, aren't you?

148
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,914
It'd be nice if Jomphol was like this.

149
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:04,709
I think your husband is cute. He's fun to be with.

150
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:09,566
Pak takes things too seriously sometimes.

151
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,267
Do you want to switch?

152
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,883
Can we switch our partners just like that?

153
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,569
I was just joking.

154
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,091
Rin, I was joking, okay?

155
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:25,751
I started to think about it.

156
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,703
We haven't been to this house for such a long time.

157
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,714
Come on, let's gather up one more time.

158
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:34,463
To celebrate our cool performance and high revenue,

159
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:35,526
cheers!

160
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:39,497
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

161
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,737
Someone forgot something?

162
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:10,023
- Nont!
- Congratulations, my brother!

163
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,576
Why did you come so late? They're gone already.

164
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:15,329
It's okay. I just wanted to see you.

165
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,683
I'm here to congratulate you

166
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,749
because the VIP team received a compliment from Mr. Chokchai directly,

167
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,620
and your team exceeded the target.

168
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,009
I have to be here to celebrate with my beloved brother.

169
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,190
- Thank you.
- Nont?

170
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,417
- Rin?
- What?

171
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,326
- Who said I'd give it to you?
- What?

172
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:35,176
I brought this to celebrate with Rin, here.

173
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,237
- Wait, what?
- Congrats.

174
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,723
- What?
- It's mine.

175
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:39,956
Oh, come on.

176
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:44,936
When I worked with the VIP team, I had only my beautiful Rin mentoring me.

177
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:49,696
You kept following Mr. Jakchai around. You didn't even care about me.

178
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:53,109
How's your work in the PR department?

179
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,242
It's more than fine.

180
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:59,887
Actually, no one is more nagging, protesting, and annoying than the VIP Team Director.

181
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:01,763
It hurts!

182
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,487
Rin, help!

183
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:07,589
I took such good care of you. How could you forget?

184
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,089
No, you didn't.

185
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,769
Come on, let's open this bottle.

186
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,306
- Let's go.
- Wait!

187
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:18,764
I'd love to celebrate with you two, but I have early work tomorrow.

188
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,843
I just stopped by to congratulate you two.

189
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,403
- Another excuse?
- That's right.

190
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:28,463
- Come on, just a sip.
- I really can't stay, but congrats again.

191
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,484
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

192
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,984
Give me a hug.

193
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,062
- I'm leaving.
- See you later.

194
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:38,221
- Drive safe.
- Sure, thanks!

195
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:49,550
So many good things... have happened to us recently.

196
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:55,291
That's right. I want these moments to last forever.

197
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:07,031
Well, this can't go to waste. Let's drink some more.

198
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,000
[The Legend: Vice President]

199
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:54,222
Come in.

200
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,569
Pak.

201
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,230
Yes, Sir.

202
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,356
Please take care of Lalita.

203
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,047
Yes, Sir.

204
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,393
You can mentor her as well,

205
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:16,049
but don't let anyone know who she is.

206
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,616
Got it, Sir.

207
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,840
[The Legend]

208
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,161
Can I have your attention, everyone?

209
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:56,780
We have a new member joining our team.

210
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,401
Her name is Lalita.

211
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:02,503
Lalita, they're Rin, Meena, Prae, and Saint.

212
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:05,780
This is our VIP team. Why don't you introduce yourself?

213
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:10,080
Hello, everyone. I'm Lalita.

214
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,231
I'm transferring from the fresh produce department.

215
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,680
It's nice to meet you all.

216
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,710
How can you transfer someone from the fresh produce department here?

217
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:25,671
Meena, don't make her feel uncomfortable.

218
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,173
Yes! Wow!

219
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm so happy.

220
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,661
Why are you that happy?

221
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm so happy because I'm not the youngest in this team anymore.

222
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,490
Come here, come.

223
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,627
Welcome.

224
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,796
Please take care of her.

225
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:52,187
- Hi, hi!
- Wow, you look stunning today.

226
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,332
My new dress.

227
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,227
Hey!

228
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,992
Is she the new girl from the fresh produce department?

229
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,001
I think the rumor is real.

230
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,540
Suddenly, she just joined the VIP Team.

231
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,793
She must know someone from the inside.

232
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,033
What do you mean?

233
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:18,984
I don't think she's from a rich family or anything.

234
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,394
Maybe she knows someone not so big.

235
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:22,637
- "Not so big"?
- Yes.

236
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,351
Like this?

237
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:31,127
Why are you all so quiet?

238
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:33,558
No one wants to share some tea?

239
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,043
I do. What's the tea?

240
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:37,527
Saint!

241
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:41,107
Have you done searching for client's background?

242
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:42,507
No, I haven't.

243
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:43,960
Go on, work on that.

244
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,553
Well, she came in here and talked to me. I was so focused on working.

245
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:49,700
Hey!

246
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,921
- But you wanted the tea!
- Please go back.

247
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,402
- I don't want to know anymore.
- What?

248
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,290
You can sit there.

249
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
I'm Saint.

250
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,150
Good morning, this is the VIP Team. How can I help you?

251
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,973
What is that?

252
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:23,557
- Ms. Pojjanee would like to get...
- Chanel Ankle Strap Sandals with PVC in Black Satin.

253
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:25,500
But it was launched a long time ago.

254
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,260
How could we find one?

255
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,570
We have to. She's a client of Mr. Chokchai.

256
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,471
There's no limit on the budget,

257
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:39,031
but we need to find them before tomorrow noon.

258
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:42,020
It's even harder with a tight schedule like this.

259
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,247
What about this?

260
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:46,947
We need to contact the brand if they have stored some.

261
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:51,391
In the meantime, we can find similar pairs of shoes for her to select.

262
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:54,668
Got it. I'll contact the brand.

263
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:57,539
She can't go out this evening. I'll go to her house.

264
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,450
You can't. Rin has to go.

265
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,940
Why is that?

266
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,038
Rin is a manager. Her position is higher than yours.

267
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,875
If she doesn't show up,

268
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,090
Ms. Pojjanee can feel like we don't treat her well enough.

269
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,290
She's a VIP client.

270
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:20,864
Let's go. Let's get back to work.

271
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,847
None?

272
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,927
Saint!

273
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:32,294
Call our overseas branches. Maybe they have this pair and can send it to us.

274
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:35,307
Overseas what?

275
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,741
Don't you have the contact of the overseas branches?

276
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:42,813
How long have you been working here? You should know this.

277
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,926
I'm sorry.

278
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,667
- Here.
- Thank you.

279
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,538
You can't keep saving everyone like this.

280
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:53,407
You all need to learn this for yourselves.

281
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,364
Okay. I'm leaving now.

282
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:03,204
Lita, go help Prae.

283
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,060
You need to ask me questions.

284
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,998
You can't just stand still and expect me to tell you everything.

285
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:36,341
Why can't Ms. Pojjanee go out?

286
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:40,722
Rich people normally like to go out to shop.

287
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:44,076
Her name is Ms. Pojjanee Aksawasap-anant.

288
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,691
Ms. Pojjanee? The owner of a steel-manufacturing company?

289
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:49,815
Isn't she in jail?

290
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:53,427
I read in the news that she hit her husband with a car

291
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,034
because he had an affair.

292
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:06,038
Her case was finalized as an accident.

293
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,574
After she served 2/3 of her penalty, she was released,

294
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:13,294
but she must wear an EM (Electric Monitor) ankle bracelet.

295
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:15,725
On one condition...

296
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:22,304
I told you that I knew about the condition.

297
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:27,286
I'll get home before six tomorrow.

298
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:32,874
Your job is to get this stupid bracelet off me soon.

299
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,804
Got it.

300
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,604
Just go.

301
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,008
Rin?

302
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:53,690
I haven't seen you for such a long time. I was thinking of you.

303
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,780
Our team misses you as well.

304
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,854
Thank you for trusting us.

305
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:06,220
Because I know that you won't let me down.

306
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:12,441
You got the shoes that I asked you to, right?

307
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:17,581
At the moment, we still can't find your request just yet,

308
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,007
but we're looking for one.

309
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:24,847
In the meantime, I'd like to show similar pairs of shoes in black with the same quality.

310
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,224
They are comfortable as well. Please have a look.

311
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,374
Madam?

312
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,054
I'm really sorry.

313
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:07,327
Our team tried to get the shoes for you,

314
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,641
but we can't find one yet,

315
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:15,364
and I worry that we won't get one for you before noon tomorrow.

316
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:22,794
I don't want to hear your excuses anymore.

317
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:28,604
I have bought items from you for up to ฿10 million or more per month.

318
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:35,301
Is this the best you can get for The Legend's VIP client?

319
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:40,244
I guess I need to find another mall to do your job.

320
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,870
[Marketing Department]

321
00:28:55,877 --> 00:29:00,141
VIP Team is looking for Chanel's shoes for Ms. Pojjanee?

322
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,541
That's right.

323
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,764
We need to find it before the VIP Team.

324
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,960
But the shoes...

325
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,876
No buts.

326
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,487
There's no "but" in this.

327
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,921
I heard that she will spend more money on that.

328
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:23,481
This is a good chance for us to step ahead of the VIP Team.

329
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:26,421
You can't miss this.

330
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,067
Got it?

331
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,814
Yes, Sir.

332
00:29:29,814 --> 00:29:31,214
Good.

333
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,230
[VIP Management Team]

334
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:58,884
I checked with all the branches. That model is old, and they have none left.

335
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:02,614
The overseas branches also got back to me. They didn't have one, either.

336
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:07,104
It could be off the database. They could be stored in the warehouse.

337
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,824
Can we get in?

338
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,867
[The Legend: Warehouse]

339
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,668
We're from the VIP Team. We called earlier.

340
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:24,875
Please wait a minute.

341
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,547
There's a stronger security system in this warehouse than others.

342
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:33,794
We can't get in by ourselves; the staff need to escort us in.

343
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:38,334
Before we get out, they will check if we took anything from the inside.

344
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,984
Thank you for this info.

345
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:01,265
I need to take this call. Excuse me.

346
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:10,487
It's so late. Who called her?

347
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:13,274
It could be her children.

348
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,175
But they're in preschool.

349
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:18,429
They should be in bed by now, her children.

350
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,201
I need to take this call, too.

351
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:28,155
Who's calling? Your boyfriend No. 3?

352
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,966
It's my boyfriend No. 4.

353
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:44,907
Hello?

354
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:51,877
You can't let anyone in the company know about this.

355
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:56,667
I know. I'm trying to be patient about this.

356
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,901
If that's what you want, I don't think ฿80,000 is enough.

357
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,981
I need ฿100,000 ($2,750.)

358
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,581
Fine.

359
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,664
I have to go.

360
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,601
Meena?

361
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,841
Is everything okay?

362
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:21,017
Yes, I just talked to my family.

363
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:23,614
We're going inside now. Are you coming?

364
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,214
Let's go.

365
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,970
[Warehouse]

366
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,530
[Warehouse]

367
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,374
We've been searching every corner and we found nothing.

368
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:46,760
What if Ms. Pojjanee was furious and used service from others?

369
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,547
We could be in big trouble.

370
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:52,201
That's right. It's almost one in the morning. What should we do?

371
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,787
Danai?

372
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:02,540
What are you doing here?

373
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,687
I heard the VIP Team is searching for a pair of shoes for Ms. Pojjanee.

374
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:08,587
I'd like to offer you my assistance.

375
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,437
That's not a job for the marketing team.

376
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,457
We're in the same company. We need to help one another.

377
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:23,387
I can't let the VIP Team be in trouble all by themselves.

378
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:24,887
Isn't that right?

379
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,327
You're such a good man.

380
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:31,007
You care for others and want nothing in return.

381
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:34,859
Our company is so lucky to have someone like you.

382
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:38,389
Less talking, more working, shall we?

383
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,960
Let's go find some shoes.

384
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,431
We just went in earlier, but...

385
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:48,106
But we will take a break.

386
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:50,771
Then we will go back in there again.

387
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:59,047
Good, then my team will go in and help you look.

388
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,234
My team will take a break.

389
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:05,200
If you'd like to check, please do so.

390
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,100
I will have...

391
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:10,774
a guy from my team help you.

392
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:14,597
Sure, let's go inside.

393
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,900
The Marketing Team tries to steal our mission again.

394
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,997
They deserve to be fooled like that so they will learn.

395
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:41,797
Lita, you need to think before talking to other teams.

396
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:45,700
You think you got this job easily

397
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,630
so you don't know what we've been through.

398
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,891
Prae, calm down.

399
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:55,364
Lita just started working with us. She didn't know that team very well.

400
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,620
Lita,

401
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,667
work is a competition.

402
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,598
You need to be more careful next time,

403
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:06,400
and you need to ask us first if you're unsure about something.

404
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,737
Understood, I'll be more careful.

405
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,540
Danai, I haven't looked over there yet.

406
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,508
Right there, in the back.

407
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:43,477
Keep searching, and you'll find nothing.

408
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:47,014
You're still here.

409
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:49,114
Everyone, we are so lucky.

410
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:51,125
Khun (term of respect) Bum, a reseller I know,

411
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,788
just texted me that she has the shoes we want.

412
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,251
What is a reseller?

413
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:07,247
A reseller is a person who hoards luxury brand items to increase prices.

414
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,380
They have both brand-new and second-hand items.

415
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,457
Some resellers have more items than the store.

416
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:17,840
She is calling.

417
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,540
Hello?

418
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,657
Right. Got it. Thanks.

419
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,227
What is that?

420
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,397
It's fine. I'll pick it up myself.

421
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,467
Her shop is in Sikhiu, Nakhon Ratchasima,

422
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:38,623
but she has no one to deliver the item.

423
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:45,157
But it's fine; I'll drive there myself. We still have time.

424
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:48,168
It is almost morning.

425
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:50,020
You can't make it.

426
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,166
But we have no other choice.

427
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,280
It takes six hours to go back and forth.

428
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,184
The car will be stuck in traffic on the way back.

429
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:06,579
It would be better to ride a motorbike there.

430
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,268
- Here it is.
- Thank you so much.

431
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,817
How is it?

432
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,657
Yes? You got the shoes?

433
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:23,463
Okay.

434
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:26,910
I have a meeting with Khun Jakchai in a minute. I'll call you back when I'm done.

435
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:29,627
Wait.

436
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:32,420
You did a good job.

437
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,718
Our team would have been in big trouble without your help.

438
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,239
Drive safely; I'll see you.

439
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,907
Is she not here?
[See you soon.]

440
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:46,707
Not yet.

441
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,038
I'm here! I'm coming!

442
00:39:56,431 --> 00:39:57,729
What is this?

443
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,227
Champagne. I prepared enough for everyone.
[See you soon.]

444
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:03,658
We don't know if we have enough time.

445
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:06,634
Of course, we do. It's Rin we are talking about.

446
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:10,277
Don't be stressed. Come on, let me pour you a glass.

447
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:13,638
Fine, I'll stop.

448
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,437
There she is! She's here!

449
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,355
You had my heart beating so fast.

450
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:36,565
I always make it.

451
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:49,287
How are you? Are you okay after searching for a pair of shoes until morning?

452
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,519
Don't be so cocky!

453
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,461
Hello? Ms. Pojjanee's secretary?

454
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:13,544
I have the shoes she wanted. Should I send them to her house?

455
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:27,887
Rin?

456
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:32,204
Is everything okay?

457
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,986
I'm sorry about your loss.

458
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:36,787
- Hello.
- Hello.

459
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,574
Rin and I would like to give our condolences.

460
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,557
Thank you so much.

461
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:49,614
I heard that you met my grandmother yesterday?

462
00:42:51,714 --> 00:42:53,440
That's right.

463
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,695
That's nice.

464
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:57,295
I...

465
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:02,557
I'd like to see her for one more time as well.

466
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,460
This is life; it's uncertain.

467
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,078
She was healthy, then she had a heart attack.

468
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:29,276
Does it mean that what we tried to search for,

469
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,626
it's all for nothing?

470
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:35,087
This is our job.

471
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:38,307
We have to serve spoiled millionaires,

472
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:41,047
although the tasks don't really make sense.

473
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:45,625
It's not entirely for nothing.

474
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:57,459
"Kind and steel-hearted lady"?

475
00:43:59,147 --> 00:44:01,937
That was her nickname.

476
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,689
Ms. Pojjanee liked to wear the shoes since her first day of sending her grandson to school.

477
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:11,118
And she wore the shoes to charity events all the time.

478
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:14,734
After she got out of jail, she'd been looking for the pair

479
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:17,555
before she met her grandson one more time.

480
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:22,294
She wanted her grandson to remember her as a good grandmother,

481
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:25,197
not just a person who killed his grandfather.

482
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:28,125
It is too bad.

483
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,437
She deserved one more chance to meet her grandson.

484
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:38,634
No matter how wealthy you are,

485
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,097
family is still the most important thing.

486
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:50,115
Everyone.

487
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:04,377
Please follow me to the service.

488
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:54,785
We didn't sell shoes this time,

489
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,402
but I saw all of your efforts.

490
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:08,455
Thank you for your hard work.

491
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:24,518
You all must be exhausted.

492
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:26,745
You should go home and rest.

493
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,245
See you tomorrow.

494
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:31,075
Drive safely.

495
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,192
Are you tired?

496
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,392
You barely slept last night and you needed to attend the service today.

497
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,538
Not at all.

498
00:47:13,812 --> 00:47:15,212
Let's go.

499
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:50,695
I'm pregnant!

500
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:56,119
Rin!

501
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:11,285
Don't give up.

502
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:15,436
I can't feel the heartbeat. You need to have a C-section (Cesarean delivery).

503
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:35,996
How is our baby?

504
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,883
The baby isn't with us anymore.

505
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:41,035
That's not true!

506
00:48:57,618 --> 00:48:59,118
Rin!

507
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:16,095
Do you still think about that?

508
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:20,978
No.

509
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:23,675
It's long ago now.

510
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:10,792
[I miss you.]

511
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:48,542
How is working with the VIP Team?

512
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:56,805
There is a lot for me to learn.

513
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,777
My team teaches me many things.

514
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:05,895
Thank you for your kindness.

515
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:41,531
Did you get it all?

516
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,519
Thanks.

517
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:09,238
I have some gossip about Lita.

518
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:11,712
I'd like to confirm the rumor.

519
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,235
I saw her take off her badge earlier.

520
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:19,192
She walked out of Vice President Jakchai's office.

521
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:22,172
Do you know what she did? She adjusted her clothes.

522
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,325
What do you think she was doing inside?

523
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:28,298
- You saw that?
- I saw it!

524
00:52:28,298 --> 00:52:32,219
No wonder she got in this team.

525
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,626
- Speaking of which.
- What?

526
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:35,923
- I went to the service yesterday.
- And?

527
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:39,553
I saw how Khun Jakchai looked at Lalita.

528
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,263
- It's like they hid something from us.
- You saw that?

529
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,352
Saint!

530
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:51,252
Did you finish your work that I said?
- Not yet.

531
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:53,662
- Go on.
- Fine.

532
00:52:56,852 --> 00:52:58,305
- P'Ji. (P' means Older)
- Yes?

533
00:52:58,305 --> 00:53:01,085
Let's get back to work. Don't waste time gossiping.

534
00:53:01,085 --> 00:53:04,896
This is solid evidence. It's not a waste of time, trust me.

535
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,446
If she could join the team because she knew someone,

536
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:14,318
then our hard work meant nothing.

537
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:17,512
I thought so; it meant nothing.

538
00:53:24,928 --> 00:53:26,378
Let's go back to work.

539
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,652
I'm here to get something.

540
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:31,615
Come on, let's go back to work.

541
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:34,118
Which one?

542
00:53:34,118 --> 00:53:35,918
Right there.

543
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:16,912
Rin?

544
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,992
You heard what they said about Lalita, didn't you?

545
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:28,335
What is the real story?

546
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:32,792
You're working closely with Mr. Jakchai. You should know something.

547
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:37,277
I don't want to know everything about him.

548
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,401
You shouldn't pay too much attention to this.

549
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:44,798
Here.

550
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:56,055
One more thing,

551
00:54:57,285 --> 00:55:01,456
do you have to go somewhere after work?

552
00:55:02,978 --> 00:55:04,065
I...

553
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:10,996
We haven't had dinner at home for such a long time.

554
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:13,838
Sure.

555
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,490
[Darling]

556
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,867
What is it? I'm working.

557
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,567
Hello, Babe.

558
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,091
Mick and Max keep fighting all day. They won't stop crying.

559
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,050
Let me talk to them.

560
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,080
Mick, your mom wants to talk to you.

561
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,560
Honey, it's me.

562
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,720
Stop crying now, or I'll have your dad cook for you all week.

563
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,791
Tell Max for me, okay?

564
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,540
Hello?

565
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,673
What did you say to him? He stopped crying.

566
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:44,923
You can't handle this simple thing?

567
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:48,213
I've handled this since early morning.

568
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:50,273
When will you be home?

569
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,744
I'll be home late; I have a meeting.

570
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,480
"A meeting"?

571
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,614
I called Saint, and he said there's no meeting today.

572
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:01,427
A meeting with another team, you don't need to know. I have to go.

573
00:57:01,427 --> 00:57:02,727
What?

574
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,752
[So pretty. Fine, I'll give you ฿100,000.]

575
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,750
[Can I get ฿200,000?]

576
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,470
[Deal.]

577
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,311
[Hurry back home.]

578
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:33,523
[Are you still in your office?]

579
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,271
[Can I come?]

580
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:29,606
I'm sorry, can you turn your car around and go back to The Legend?

581
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:32,297
Didn't I tell you... that we shouldn't be meeting like this?

582
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,200
Surprise!

583
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,420
Oh my!

584
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:47,417
Oh my!

585
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:50,780
Did I interrupt something?

586
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:57,030
No, you didn't. This is normal for us.

587
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:02,256
Isn't my son home yet?

588
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:07,291
I'll be right back.

589
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,270
Be careful!

590
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:48,907
[Please hurry home.]

591
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:51,055
[Your mom is at our home.]

592
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:02,367
You changed?

593
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,400
Here.

594
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,340
I brought all of these supplements for you.

595
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,167
These herbs too.

596
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:14,370
Elle's daughter couldn't get pregnant until she tried these,

597
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,860
and now she is pregnant.

598
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,090
So I want you to try them.

599
01:04:20,013 --> 01:04:21,743
Thank you.

600
01:04:21,743 --> 01:04:24,780
Don't give up.

601
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:28,860
Get enough sleep, okay? Both of you.

602
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,940
You'll get stronger.

603
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,507
And you'll get pregnant eventually. Okay?

604
01:04:35,507 --> 01:04:36,907
Okay.

605
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,573
Let's go.

606
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,730
My son should be home soon.

607
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,307
I'd better leave.

608
01:04:46,307 --> 01:04:47,704
- Take care.
- I will.

609
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:49,884
Check your house's doors and windows.

610
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:04,190
Rin, Honey?

611
01:05:06,638 --> 01:05:08,035
Where is Mom?

612
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:10,218
She left.

613
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:16,860
Did you eat anything?

614
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,053
No, I didn't.

615
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:22,854
I can fix something for you. Come here.

616
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:51,920
I need to check what the lucky day is.

617
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,750
Just checking my ovulation day isn't enough.

618
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,300
Right,

619
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,787
your mom brought lots of herbs for us.

620
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:10,340
I thought you canceled your meeting already.

621
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,033
Why are you home so late?

622
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:18,030
Mr. Jakchai wanted me to do something personal for him.

623
01:06:19,933 --> 01:06:22,420
You must be exhausted.

624
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,430
You need to get lots of sleep tonight.

625
01:07:28,168 --> 01:07:33,808
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

626
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,950
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

627
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:16,981
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

628
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:56,460
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

629
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:04,000
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

630
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,980
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

631
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,520
♫ Please understand again ♫

632
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:22,120
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫
