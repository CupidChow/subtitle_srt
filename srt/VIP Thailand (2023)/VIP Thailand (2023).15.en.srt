00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,392
No, I don't.

183
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,770
It's just that this customer doesn't usually live in Thailand.

184
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,221
She stays abroad.

185
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:49,580
Let's have both VIP and Privilege Teams skip this customer.

186
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,499
No need to contact her.

187
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:55,590
Saint, proceed to the next customer.

188
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:17,407
Wait a minute, Pak.

189
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,167
Can I have the contact information of Miss Kawita?

190
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,150
I tried to find it, but really couldn't do so.

191
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,953
Didn't I tell you not to pay attention to this customer?

192
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,043
She must be abroad.

193
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,747
But her purchase amount each time is tens of millions,

194
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,330
and my team currently has almost no list of customers.

195
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,453
Are you afraid

196
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:45,647
that my team will beat yours?

197
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,340
It's not like that at all.

198
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,920
It's really hard to get in touch with her.

199
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:52,773
Wait.

200
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,230
Let me ask you frankly.

201
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,870
Why have I never seen this customer's name before?

202
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,927
Since you took up the director position,

203
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:09,157
you sent me all customers to let me take care of them.

204
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:14,388
Except... customers who are really close to Mr. Jakchai. You took care of them yourself.

205
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,327
Rin.

206
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:22,739
This customer... others already took care of her,

207
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,033
but they weren't interested.

208
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,947
So just don't pay attention to her.

209
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:30,060
It's hard to keep contact with her, and she's a bit demanding.

210
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,013
You'd better find other customers.

211
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,613
Trust me.

212
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:50,393
She should be a VVIP long ago based on her purchase amount.

213
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,980
But why have we never seen her face before?

214
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,650
From what I've checked, Kawita has never been here to receive special benefits from VIP Team.

215
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,560
I think she's keeping a low profile,

216
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,307
no data about her.

217
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:06,287
She doesn't want anyone to know her.

218
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,773
Seeing Pak's strange behavior today,

219
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:13,707
I'm sure there must be something.

220
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:28,500
Now our Privilege Team completed the list of customers who will attend the Black Diamond event.

221
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,532
Everyone has been our long-time top spender.

222
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,947
After they are served well by Privilege Team,

223
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:39,259
I'm sure the amount will skyrocket until...

224
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,842
Someone must be jealous.

225
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:46,597
How about your VIP Team?

226
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,998
- They have a little problem.
- Oh my, what?

227
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:55,654
You already acquired the strongest team of The Legend, but you still have a problem?

228
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,340
Gosh, Sis.

229
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,997
I doubt you're going to have a long rest.

230
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,537
Put that matter aside.

231
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:07,957
Do you know a woman named...

232
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,697
Kawita?

233
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,114
What is it?

234
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:16,758
Who is Kawita?

235
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,727
Right? I want to know, too.

236
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,720
A woman named Kawita...

237
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,097
Lertsupakijanan.

238
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,067
Who is she?

239
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:32,212
I heard she's been a VIP customer for a long time,

240
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:34,620
but our employees don't know her,

241
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,497
and she keeps a low profile.

242
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:41,487
Jak.

243
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,387
Don't you know her?

244
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,550
Our department store is huge with many customers...

245
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,674
How am I supposed to remember everyone?

246
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:53,214
That's right.

247
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,967
If you recall, tell me.

248
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,040
Because this customer could be

249
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,670
a game-changer for the VIP Team.

250
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,844
What?

251
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:18,737
Did Rin ask about this woman in the meeting?

252
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,767
Yes. She wants this woman to attend the Black Diamond event,

253
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,977
but Pak stopped her.

254
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:29,474
I didn't know she would keep searching for her until Aunt Nate knew of this.

255
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,007
We can't let her know Kawita.

256
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,140
Why?

257
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,274
Who is this woman?

258
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,207
Why do you and Pak not want anyone to mess with her?

259
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,547
You don't need to know.

260
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:46,867
Just know that if someone proposes this name again, you must remove it!

261
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:51,584
No matter who, regardless of the teams, don't get to know Kawita.

262
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:54,504
Otherwise, we're in trouble.

263
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:07,840
You don't know Kawita, either, do you?

264
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,234
How could I know her? I never interfered with Jak's work.

265
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:15,957
The customers that I know are all my friends.

266
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,900
Jak said he couldn't remember.

267
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,397
Do you think he's lying?

268
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,407
As someone who has been married for a long time,

269
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:34,517
I think you should know Jakchai better than anyone else.

270
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,434
If I knew him that well,

271
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:43,567
I would have been a better wife than this.

272
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,837
Has he ever thought of you as his wife?

273
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,627
Other than the marriage certificate,

274
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:55,401
I have never seen you two as husband and wife.

275
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,114
When you go out,

276
00:23:57,114 --> 00:24:01,060
you can't even pretend to be in love.

277
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,847
Then what am I supposed to do?

278
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:07,314
I got married because my dad and Jak have mutual interests.

279
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:11,760
He doesn't love me, but I had no choice.

280
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,068
But you love him, right?

281
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:21,294
I can tell that you've endured this

282
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,917
not because of the benefits.

283
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:29,397
You have to ask yourself.

284
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,210
[The Legend]

285
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:22,834
Kawita.

286
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:01,037
Which collection would you like to see? You can let me know, Madam Kawita.

287
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:06,677
Do you know me?

288
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,460
I'm Rin, the new director of VIP Team.

289
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,220
We know all important customers so we can be ready to serve them.

290
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,029
If you need anything, please call me.

291
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:26,940
[Pakawat]

292
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,614
Yes.

293
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:38,547
Mr. Jakchai asked you to leave that shop instantly.

294
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,320
Did he say that?

295
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,020
Right now.

296
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:44,177
Okay.

297
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,914
Excuse me.

298
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:50,213
D-Do you want me to see you out?

299
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:52,903
It's okay, don't follow me.

300
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,327
P'Pak.
[Privilege]

301
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,408
You just did that, didn't you?

302
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,627
What are you talking about?

303
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:22,583
You're not good at lying as before.

304
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:27,014
I have seen it all.

305
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:30,177
You were the one who called Kawita just now.

306
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,687
Why do you have to do this?

307
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,585
Who exactly is this woman?

308
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:37,685
I think you misunderstood.

309
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:41,567
I didn't do anything, and I didn't call her.

310
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:45,020
I'm sure you know this woman.

311
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,637
You're hiding something.

312
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:51,370
You don't have to know about this.

313
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:00,377
I'm warning you because I wish you no harm.

314
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,858
Lita.

315
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,687
If you know anything more than this, you might be in trouble.

316
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,020
You said this.

317
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,057
It means that you admit this woman is important.

318
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,867
And you dare to threaten me;

319
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,397
this must be a very big deal.

320
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:21,733
No.

321
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,877
You're misunderstanding.

322
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:26,107
How do I misunderstand?

323
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:28,207
Tell me.

324
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:36,627
I'll look for the truth myself,

325
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:39,117
and I must know it.

326
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,377
You shouldn't have said that.

327
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,777
It made Rin even more suspicious.

328
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,157
So it's my fault, is it?

329
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:57,997
Do you think I want Rin to know about it?

330
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,577
I said this because I want to help you.

331
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:09,847
- But...
- Why don't you see my good intentions?

332
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,134
I'm sorry

333
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:20,937
that I'm not as smart as P'Rin.

334
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,894
Wait, Lita.
[Privilege]

335
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,654
I'm sorry.

336
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:38,497
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

337
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:41,227
I'm sorry.

338
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,327
I was just stressed.

339
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:48,060
Because if this leaks out,

340
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,540
Mr. Jakchai will be in big trouble.

341
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:54,217
Besides us two,

342
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,220
Mr. Jakchai wouldn't let anyone else

343
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,933
go easily who knows about this.

344
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,017
You're worried about Rin, right?

345
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,557
Whatever you do, you always think of her.

346
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:18,737
Although you know this woman wants to only hurt you

347
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:21,220
and is ready to insult you.

348
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,608
Forget it.

349
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,531
You know that no matter what,

350
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:34,659
I choose to be with you.

351
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,360
[The Legend]

352
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,746
Have you found it?

353
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:56,980
Why is this woman so mysterious?

354
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,080
Will we be able to find any info about her?

355
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,833
Since Lita said what you told us, it will be worth it to find out.

356
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,833
Hey there!

357
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,660
Saint.

358
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,733
If you tell us to eat ice cream again, I'll kill you.

359
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,820
Don't scold me.

360
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,963
Well... I found Kawita's Instagram account.

00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,860
I've been searching for a long time, but I couldn't find it anywhere.

But suddenly, the algorithm showed me this.

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,460
Very accidental.

I think it's a good clue

Last night, Saint and the gang looked after you for a long time.

592
00:53:51,493 --> 00:53:54,733
But you haven't recovered yet so I told them to go home.

598
00:54:30,193 --> 00:54:34,010
I am very lucky to still be alive.

599
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,407
I fell down the stairs.

644
00:59:37,146 --> 00:59:38,460

Kawita is the fifth shareholder.

652
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:10,986
That means she's holding over 20%.

What is this?

654
01:00:12,867 --> 01:00:16,963
At first, I thought Kawita was only Mr. Jakchai's mistress.

655
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:23,743
But why is she suddenly both a shareholder and director of The Lavish department store?

656
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:27,553
Khun Jakchai let his mistress hold shares in The Lavish on his behalf.

657
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:31,320
She's also a director. This is significant.

658
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,373
Khun Jakchai is a director of our department store,

659
01:00:33,373 --> 01:00:35,986
but he has a representative as a director of our competitor.

660
01:00:35,986 --> 01:00:37,513
This is illegal.

661
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:38,913

It's Khun Chokchai who matters.

There is no time to rest.

691
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,265
It seems Madam Treenate is pursuing this matter.

692

I tried contacting her, but I couldn't reach her.

693

01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,586
You already left the hospital?

697
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:46,866
Why didn't you tell me so I could pick you up?

698
01:03:48,343 --> 01:03:50,903
I'm okay now.

Wait, don't worry about your work.

700
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:03,423
Tell everyone that if the VIP Team is dissolved,

701
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,853
I will try to help the team continue to work,

702
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:11,321
maybe in another department or something.

703
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:14,326
Though the positions won't be better,

704
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:16,795
at least they won't be worse,

705
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,843

Yes, Sir?

720
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:47,313
Pak, the proceeds from the Black Diamond Auction...

721
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:50,146
Let the VIP Team take care of them.

722
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,993
Let them decide where to give donations.

723
01:05:52,993 --> 01:05:54,996
Think of it as their last job.

724
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:58,196
Cleanse the bad luck before we dissolve their department.

725
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:01,353
Okay?

726
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:04,126
Yes, Sir.
