8
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:03,278
I don't want to do this in front of you, Lita.

9
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,106
But since it's like this...

10
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,561
I have to do it.

11
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:09,361
Did I do something wrong?

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,413
- I'll open it for you.
- I can open it myself.

13
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,405
Lita.

14
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:40,307
You're a lot better than I thought.

15
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:50,700
I want you to see customer feedback to the event Lita organized.
[Satisfaction Summary]

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,187
A lot of customers praised her

17
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:57,077
and increased the sales for our team significantly.

18
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:00,220
I didn't tell Lita beforehand because

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,183
I wanted to tell you first so you could compliment her as her father.

20
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,982
You're good. Well done.

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,860
Yes.

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,536
Lita is very talented.

23
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:28,683
I believe that soon she will have more surprises for you.

24
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:55,077
Rin, wait.

25
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,709
What exactly are you planning to do?

26
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:07,038
What am I doing?

27
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,966
I discussed work with Mr. Jakchai.

28
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,721
You are the one acting weird.

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,183
Have you something to say to me?

30
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:25,983
Wait, Rin.

31
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,264
The memory card from my car,

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,043
did you take it?

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,402
Why would I take it?

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,083
Was there anything I shouldn't see?

35
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,287
This receipt

36
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,223
was on my desk, in our house.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,305
Rin, did you take it?

38
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,203
Yuda.

39
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,043
Who is she?

40
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:30,357
Why didn't you want me to see it?

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,450
Why are you asking me about the dashcam and this stupid receipt?

42
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:41,047
Or is it related to the woman you're hiding?

43
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,963
If there's something, let's talk at home.

44
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,903
Rin, Pak, Mr. Jakchai wants you in the dining room.

45
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,886
If I have that memory card with me,

46
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:33,916
what do you think I will do with it?

47
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,901
Wait, Rin.

48
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:07,143
Today, in addition to this party to thank everyone for taking care of Lita,

49
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,674
I have something important to tell you.

50
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:18,500
With regard to the company restructuring,

51
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,163
Pak will become an executive for The Legend.

52
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,323
Congratulations.

53
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:30,629
You really suit this position.

54
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,286
And when Pak becomes an executive,

55
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:41,770
the director position should be passed on to the right person, right?

56
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,700
And I saw...

57
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,363
that our VIP Team now needs ideas from the younger generation.

58
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:59,753
Therefore, the person who will become the director after Pak is...

59
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Lita.

60
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,880
What?

61
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,853
By doing this, aren't you humiliating Rin?

62
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:20,433
Also, this position should be given to Rin because she's more appropriate.

63
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,193
Rin probably didn't overthink this like you.

64
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,366
Right?

65
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:32,837
I know that you are the best, but I just want Lita

66
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:38,057
to be the director for a while, before becoming an executive.

67
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:44,219
And after that, I promise that a talent like you will definitely get this position.

68
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:04,432
I'd like you all to drink for P'Pak and Lita.

69
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,483
Congratulations.

70
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:18,846
Everyone, pick up your glass. Let's drink to Pak and Lita.

71
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,546
Come on.

72
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,166
Drink.

73
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,926
I won't worry about this, Sir.

74
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,365
Because, honestly, I have to say that Lita is really good.

75
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,203
I must say she's not only good at work,

76
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,566
but other things too.

77
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:50,933
It's good that Mr. Jakchai announced the news of P'Pak and Lita today,

78
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:55,083
because I have a special gift for both of them.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,233
I assure you,

80
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,733
it's suitable for the promotion.

81
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,353
What gift, Rin?

82
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:41,220
This is a gift from my heart that I want to give to P'Pak

83
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,403
and Lita.

84
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,833
A year and a half ago,

85
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,903
I had a miscarriage.

86
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:31,003
It was the worst time in my life,

87
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,980
but it was also at the same time

88
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,043
that Pak was ordered by Mr. Jakchai to take care of Lita.

89
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,496
And this is what he did behind my back.

90
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:52,853
The man whom I entrusted my life to,

91
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:56,640
the one I loved, respected, and trusted,

92
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,023
he betrayed me.

93
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,983
How is it, Sir?

94
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,123
The man you want to be an executive,

95
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,933
and your daughter, who is getting this position, not me...

96
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:30,140
are their performances impressive?

97
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:41,166
You really didn't disappoint me, Rinnara.

98
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,160
This is the time to celebrate!

99
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,766
Raise your glasses.

100
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:50,000
Cheers.

101
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,103
Pak, you swine!

102
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,913
What have you done? Hey?

103
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:58,663
Did you know what you've done? Hey?

104
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,430
- Don't do this.
- Don't intervene!

105
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,672
You're the tramp!

106
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:07,940
How could you do this?

107
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,063
Have you ever cared about my reputation?

108
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,965
- Please take it easy, Sir.
- Let go!

109
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,883
Everyone, leave first.

110
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,283
Did you have to do this?

111
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,780
All this time, I gave you the chance to tell me the truth,

112
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,458
but you kept lying to me.

113
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,215
You deceived me, and you're still making me look like a fool.

114
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:36,300
You have made the ten years that we've been together

115
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,904
a nightmare for me.

116
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,293
But what you've done...

117
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,018
didn't just destroy me and Lita.

118
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,623
It has hurt you as well.

119
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:58,083
There's nothing that can hurt me as much as you have already done!

120
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:04,623
Before, I felt I was the only one who was living in torture.

121
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,063
Let's all go to Hell together.

122

[Ochalit, Thai Restaurant and Cafe Bar]

123
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:47,470
I can't believe that a family man like Pak

124
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,150
and an innocent girl like Lita...

125
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:54,254
could do such a thing.

126
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,340
[Don't tell anyone about what happened today.]

127
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,860
P'Pak said not to tell anyone about what happened today.

128
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,980
Did you get the message, too?

129
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:26,095
If I wanted to expose this, I would have done it long ago.

130
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:31,715
Wait. Did you know about this before?

131
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:34,895
For a while.

132
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,503
Rin suspected that a team member was Pak's mistress.

133
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:41,435
We had a small misunderstanding; she thought it was me.

134
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:45,645
But we understand each other now so I know all about this.

135
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,333
Actually, I've known about this for a while now.

136
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,620
Since Lita first joined us,

137
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,970
I saw those two together.

138
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:01,381
Oh, so you two knew this already?

139
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,150
Had I known, I would have talked to you long ago.

140
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,607
I had to keep it to myself. It's been so frustrating for days.

141
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,240
Hey!

142
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,407
So you already knew about this, too?

143
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:19,413
Yes, on the day of the auction, P'Pak asked me to put his notebook away.

144
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,710
I accidentally found a video of Lita leaning on his shoulder in the elevator.

145
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,146
And you say that I am nosy!

146
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:32,197
I'm the last person to know about this!

147
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,513
Hey, shall we put others' business aside first?

148
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,425
I don't know how Rin is now.

149
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,270
Shouldn't we be worried about her?

150
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:21,654
It was something you and Lita deserved.

151
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,067
Lita.

152
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,310
Stay strong.

153
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,910
Why are you cheering each other up now, hey?

154
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:08,510
I'm so disappointed I trusted a man like you!

155
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,093
This...

156
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:14,373
Lita has nothing to do with it. I was wrong, Sir.

157
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:16,760
Dad, it's my fault.

158
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,370
Are you still showing off your love here?

159
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,067
I'm asking you.

160
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,934
Can't you find a better man than this one?

161
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,354
Aren't you ashamed to have an affair with him?

162
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:43,633
What happened between me and Lita is over, Sir.

163
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:46,653
Over? So what?

164
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,640
What is the use of your statement now?

165
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,933
When there is solid evidence like that!

166
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:56,522
Do you know what will happen if that footage is leaked?

167
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,378
I might not get to be Chairman for The Legend!

168
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:04,126
As for you, don't dream of being an executive here,

169
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,141
because of you,

170
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,250
you and your stupidity!

171
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,486
I assure you the footage won't leak out.

172
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,503
What are you talking about?

173
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,828
How can you control it?

174
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,030
Look what your wife did today.

175
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,690
If she goes crazy again, I'm ruined!

176
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,920
Hey.

177
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,146
Hello?

178
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,877
I really want to make a toast to you.

179
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,090
Excuse me.

You are as good at keeping secrets as your mother.

182
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,357
Your mother kept the secret of you being Jak's daughter for 20 years.

183
00:21:55,357 --> 00:22:01,467
You've kept secrets about your affair with another woman's husband for over a year.

Good job.

185
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,397
I really want to know,

186
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:14,570
what if I whisper in your bedridden mother's ear?

187
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,227
How will she feel?

188
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:20,537
She may not be able to respond,

189
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:23,147
but she understands everything, right?

190
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,767
Don't mess with my mom, please.

191
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:36,577
So scary.

192
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:39,144

I definitely won't let that footage leak.

Not because it's an order from Mr. Jakchai, or you, not because of anyone!

How can you be sure that it won't?

You and my daughter stabbed her in the back like that.

Rin loves the VIP Team very much.

213

If it's something that will affect the team,

214
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,903
she surely won't do it.

215

She loves her job so she won't take revenge on you and Lita, right?

216

I saw you coming out of the elevator with Danai.

What did he do?

Nothing, why do you ask that?

We are organizing her children's birthday party.

243
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:26,966
The daughter suddenly wanted to change the birthday theme.

00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,039
I thought that you would take leave today.

The more Rin acts like nothing happened, the more I worry about her.

The customer's daughter wants to change the theme.

She wants to have a party at a farm with many kinds of animals,

254
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,541
since she wants to play with animals, like a zoo.

There's a nice farm in the suburbs. I took my children there once.

- Good.
- Okay.

00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:41,886

You go in.

00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:00,116
Yes.

360
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:19,589
Teddy, when I grow up, will everything be better?

361
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:23,029
Being a child is the best.

362
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,796
Don't grow up.

363
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:28,296
Teddy, please tell me.

364
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,866
Who is the most beautiful in the world?

365
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:31,849
I am, right?

366
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,229
All girls are pretty.

367
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:37,103
You're not very smart.

368
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:38,823
He didn't answer the question at all.

369
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:40,423
Let's go.

370
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,789
What are you looking for?

371
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:50,706
Where's my mobile phone? I want to take a photo (Chinese).

372
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:59,706
Can you speak Thai? I don't understand it.

373
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:02,749
It's here.

374
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:11,689
What should I do? My cake is all messed up.

375
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,583
What do you mean?

376
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,903
I want a new cake. Go buy it now.

377
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:19,363
Can you speak Thai?

378
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:25,406
Stop, please stop.

379
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:31,763
- That's enough. I'm hurt.
- Children, stop. Please stop.

380
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:34,116
Hey, calm down.

381
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,916
Please stop.

382
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:38,886
Children.

383
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:41,546
Listen to me.

384
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,483
Oh, that's enough. Stop, that's enough.

385
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:49,406
What happened?

386
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,776
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

387
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:56,763
I messed up my cake.

388
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:59,843
I want a new cake. I told her already.

389
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:02,943
I told her that I want a new cake, but she didn't get it.

390
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:04,743
She's lousy.

391
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:09,916
She likes to practice talking Mandarin all the time.

392
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:13,226
Isn't she in your VIP Team?

393
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:16,786
Yes, she's in my team.

394
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:21,646
I'll get you a new cake.

395
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:23,943
Okay.

396
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,846
Meena, bring me new cake.

397
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:35,123
You're lucky that Rin is here.

398
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:38,089
What's your name? Are you in the VIP Team?

399
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,536
Why can't you speak Mandarin?

400
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:45,632
How could you guys accept someone like her into the team?

401
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:50,883
Hello, Mrs. Wan.

402
00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:54,695
- Oh, Mr. Jak. Hello.
- Hello.

403
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:56,543
I didn't think you would come.

404
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:59,876
This place is far so I didn't tell you.

405
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:03,326
It's your party. I have to take care of you.

406
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:08,506
Oh, Lita. Did you pay respects to Mrs. Wan, Baby?

407
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,349
"Baby"?

408
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:13,109
Yes.

409
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:18,409
Oh, she's your daughter, the one who recently made the news.

410
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:20,343
She looks pretty in person.

411
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,376
I'm sorry.

412
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:24,536
Lookkade has ruined your clothes.

413
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:26,596
Lookkade, come here.

414
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:32,716
Apologize to Lita.

415
00:43:32,716 --> 00:43:34,216
I'm sorry.

416
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:36,889
It's okay.

417
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:57,655
Your new cake is here. Do you like it?

418
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,355
Yes.

419
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:02,965
All right, I'll put it here for you.

420
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:06,485
A big round of applause.

421
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,903
Come on, let's take some pictures.

422
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,366
- Please, let's get closer.
- Come on, Children. Come in.

423
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,115
- Come on, this way.
- Excuse me.

424
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,552
Can you take a photo for us?

425
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:25,328
It's okay. Are you going to use your phone?

426
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,805
I'll let my staff take a picture for you.

427
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:29,402
Okay.

428
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,703
Take a picture for me, Rin.

429
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:53,808
It's okay.

430
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,845
I'll do it.

431
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,635
Come, everyone.

432
00:44:57,635 --> 00:44:59,445
Smile.

433
00:45:00,308 --> 00:45:03,065
One, two, three.

434
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:05,645
Are you having fun?

435
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:07,364
Yes.

436
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:11,622
This sister is the party organizer. Isn't she the best?

437
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:14,185
Yes.

438
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:30,322
Thank you so much, Ms. Lita. Today's party was very impressive.

439
00:45:30,322 --> 00:45:34,185
I thank you, too, Mr. Jakchai, for taking care of us yourself.

440
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,615
I want my daughter to learn on the job.

441
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:42,305
Lita is very talented, as expected from your daughter.

442
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:48,422
Rin.

443
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:51,575
My birthday party was perfect because of you. (Chinese)

444
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:55,165
You're so different from that girl.

445
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:04,025
Thank you very much. I'm very happy today.

446
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,568
Thank you.

447
00:46:08,568 --> 00:46:11,155
I wish you happiness every day.

448
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,905
Thank you.

449
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:16,334
Thank you again, everyone.

450
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,034
Let's go.

451
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:32,342
Write a report summary of today's event for me.

452
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:33,942
Let's go, Lita.

453
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:04,135
Stop making that face.

454
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:06,805
Keep your chin up.

455
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:10,975
We have the power and privilege.

456
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:14,785
Use it so we can be above others.

457
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:19,645
If you don't have knowledge, learn more.

458
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:22,225
Start with Mandarin first.

459
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:25,205
And remember,

460
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:28,718
don't embarrass me like today again.

461
00:47:35,778 --> 00:47:37,525
We worked so hard.

462
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,970
In the end, the person who got credit was the boss' daughter,

463
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,020
so privileged (lucky).

464
00:47:43,408 --> 00:47:45,895
Complaining doesn't change anything.

465
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:48,725
We have to work under her anyway.

466
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,905
I'm sorry, Guys.

467
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:57,605
If it weren't for me, things wouldn't have turned out like this.

468
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,168
Mr. Jakchai definitely wouldn't have done this to the VIP Team.

469
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,825
Are you crazy? Why are you apologizing?

470
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:08,288
You guys are very tired due to this job. Your work should be praised, not like this.

471
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,187
Rin.

472
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:13,515
We have worked with the VIP Team a long time.

473
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:17,745
We daily see people who have privileges.

474
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:20,545
Right.

475
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:25,686
Even if you're the leader, you shouldn't take this insane pressure all alone.

476
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,175
I...

477
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:55,215
Rin.

478
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,702
Rin.

479
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,302
Rin, wait.

480
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:02,065
Rin, can we talk?

481
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:05,588
Rin.

482
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,915
Are you here to ensure I won't release the footage of you and Lita?

483
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,062
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

484
00:49:22,282 --> 00:49:24,525
I'm sorry, Rin.

485
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,785
I'm really sorry.

486
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:36,705
I don't agree... with what Mr. Jakchai did.

487
00:49:40,262 --> 00:49:42,745
But it's all due to me, I know.

488
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,542
Yes.

489
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,625
It's all because of you!

490
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,445
Our family is ruined by you!

491
00:49:58,025 --> 00:50:01,422
And my job is being ruined due to you.

492
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,332
If I could go back in time...

493
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,093
I wouldn't let such a thing happen.

494
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,285
Because you're the only good person

495
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:27,671
who came into my life.

496
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,845
But I couldn't keep you.

497
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:37,085
I don't want you to be like this.

498
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:44,605
I... I...

499
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:53,985
Don't pretend like you wouldn't do this if you could turn back time.

500
00:50:57,175 --> 00:51:00,325
If I could turn back time,

501
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:03,145
I wouldn't have a baby with you.

502
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:10,985
You were unfaithful to me on the day that I had a miscarriage.

503
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,685
It was the worst time in my life, but you still did that.

504
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:23,484
How could you do that?

505
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:26,158
How could you do that?

506
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:31,125
Do you love her that much?

507
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:36,965
Do you still love her?

508
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:52,650
♫ If I were to love someone, I would never hurt my heart ♫

509
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:58,170
♫ Whomever I love, I’ll love only him ♫

510
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:06,080
♫ So why did you cheat? Why didn’t you stop yourself? ♫

511
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:43,638
Can you listen to me, too?

512
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:06,678
Tell me what you're worried about.

513
00:53:13,215 --> 00:53:15,618
Why am I talking to a toy?

514
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:19,228
Say it first.

515
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:22,871
An AI has feelings, too.

516
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:28,468
When you have a problem, I think sharing it with others can help.

517
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:40,568
I...

518
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:46,498
I lost something.

519
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:53,738
What have you lost?

520
00:53:57,656 --> 00:53:59,659
A man.

521
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,281
No.

522
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:11,958
It's a memory actually.

523
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:21,340
I used to be very happy.

524
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:26,321
I had a husband who loved me and

525
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:28,638
a good job.

526
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:35,688
Everything was amazing for me.

527
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:37,288
But...

528
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:45,778
Nothing is the same now.

529
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,268
I...

530
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:55,907
I feel like my whole world...

531
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:00,928
has collapsed in front of me.

532
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:04,208
And only wreckage is left.

533
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:08,293
I don't even know...

534
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:13,208
what my future will be like after this.

535
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:18,048
I'm not going to comfort you by telling you to look at others

536
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:22,802
who have bigger problems than you, then you can feel better.

537
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:26,438
But I want you to look back at yourself.

538
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:29,021
Think about your old self carefully.

539
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:32,318
What were you like before?

540
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:34,960
I think...

541
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,303
Even though things around you have changed,

542
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,940
I believe that...

543
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,328
if you stay true to yourself,

544
00:55:45,328 --> 00:55:48,198
you will surely get through it.

545
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,101
How about this?

546
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,458
Wait a moment.

547

I could see you in the future.

550
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:12,330
You might get stressed out,

551
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:16,120
and bad things could happen in your life,

552
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:19,352
but don't worry about it.

553
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:23,320
You will surely bounce back to your old self.
