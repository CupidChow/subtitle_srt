00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,208
or should I get physical?

- Help!
- Hey!

11
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:11,157
Do you need me to film a clip

12
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:16,075
to blackmail you later so you cooperate?

13

You perverted son of a dog!

Last year

was the hardest year for me.

61
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm sure it was the hardest year for other victims.

62
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,448
I can't stand seeing another victim from this.

63
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:40,597
Therefore, I'd like to go public about this.

64

How did you keep this to yourself for so long?

73

Why didn't you tell us?

74
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:25,040
I didn't know what to say.

75
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,005
I was scared back then.

76
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:32,548
You kept this horrible story to yourself this long?

77
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,330
I thought I was asking for it.

78
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,604
That's why it happened to me.

79
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:46,696
You did nothing wrong. You can't blame yourself.

80
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,153
You did nothing wrong.

81
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:49,715
Danai is a monster.

82
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:52,650
This is sexual assault (intentionally sexually touches another person without consent).

83
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,508
That's right.

84
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:59,093
Now I know that if I fear him like before,

85
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,308
my life will get worse.

86
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,375
Now I feel relieved.

87

I was framed!

103
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,855
Back then, she wanted a job.

104
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:27,246
She wanted to grow in her career. She wanted to join our team, but I wouldn't let her.

105
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,676
So she framed me.

107
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:41,624

Danai.

117
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,476
You know that if you can't find the proof,

118
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,109
you must be responsible for this, don't you?

119
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,261
Tell everyone I'm not working today.

120
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,818
Tell our clients too,

121
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:39,222
and don't call me again.

122

I have something to talk to you about.

123
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:49,153

126

Now you want to run away?

127
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,915
My friend was assaulted, but she is braver than you.

128
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,834
Nonsense!

129
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,362
Your friend slandered me.

130
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:13,076
Your friend wanted a promotion

131
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:15,397
so she approached me first.

132
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,010
Do you think your friend is innocent in this?

133
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,260
She had already slept with many men.

134
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,122
It didn't matter if one of them was me.

135
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,919

No matter how many men she slept with,

139
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:40,555
if she didn't give you consent, it's sexual assault!

140

I'll help Prae to punish you, watch me.

00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,311
I'll walk you up.

187
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,337
I'm okay.

188
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,474
I'm feeling better.

189
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,304
Hello?

190
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,787
What?

191
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,089
Was Lita hit by a car?

192
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,711
Which hospital?

193
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:03,246
Okay. I'm on my way.

194
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,147
P'Pak.

195
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,767
Are you okay?

196
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,505
Lita.

197
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,105
Are you okay?

198
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,713
Thank you,

199
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:38,862
and I'm sorry to have troubled you again.

200
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:43,539
The nurse asked for a number, and I didn't know whom to call.

201
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,299
It's okay.

202
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,922
I'm glad... you're doing better.

203
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:52,722
Come on.

204
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:56,432
Easy there.

205
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,299
Dad!

206
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,936
Mr. Jakchai.

207
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:18,022
How did you get here?

208
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:21,757
If I did not get here, would I see you two in love like this?

209
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,840
It's not like that.

210
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,537
I was grazed by a car so I just asked him to pick me up from the hospital.

211
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,505
Did anyone see you two?

212
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,147
There's nothing going on.

213
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:42,176
She got grazed by a car so I picked her up from the hospital.

214
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,257
That's all.

215
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:44,920
The damages were already done!

216
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,594
That's why we're stuck in this ugly loop.

217
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:54,487
I don't care what sort of horrible things you did.

218
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,312
I'm worried people could see you two.

219
00:20:56,312 --> 00:21:00,539
If my sister found out about this, I'd be in big trouble!

220
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:04,736
Dad.

221
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,055
He picked me up from the hospital as he worried about me. That's all.

222
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,961
This isn't time to show your love, Lita!

223
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,959
People have watched the VIP Team since Prae's scandal.

224
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,738
What if people found out about you two?

225
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,558
Have you ever thought of that?

226
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:28,015
Give me her key card.

227
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,513
And you two can't do something stupid like this again.

228
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,950
You can leave now.

229
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,847
Call me if something like this happens next time, not him!

230
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,647
I'm your father!

231
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,378
Your team sticks up for each other, right?

232
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,993
Fine.

233
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:22,189
I'll take care of snobby witches like you.

[Again? She keeps on coming back.]

240
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:02,863
[She's good at luring men.]
[Where are your morals?]
[You're so picky? You're aiming for money.]

241
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,779
[Not worth a baht.]
[I feel bad for people around her. Such a tramp!]

242
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,493
[She's such a tramp!]
[She can't think of anything better.]

243
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,021
[She keeps sleeping around. Stay away from my man.]
[She's hot but her personality is so bad.]

244
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:15,260
[I don't want to see her. Such a narcissist.]
[How can she live like this?]

245
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:19,174
[I'm glad I'm not pretty like her.]
[Someone stop her, please.]

246
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,413
- Is that her?
- I think so.

247
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,678
[Such a tramp! She's asking for it, yet she said she was raped?]

248
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:27,266
[Think before you say anything.]
[She will be bored once she gets him.]

249
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:29,506
[So many people like her.]
[She should get going. Why did she lie?]

250
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,186
You're asking for it.

251
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,782
What is it? Let me see.

252
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:35,830
Take a look.

253
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,720
Here's your pretty lady.

254
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:41,928
Wow!

255
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:45,157
Her name is not Prae,

256
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,931
but she is... sleazy Prae?

257
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:49,029
Disgusting!

258
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,070
Don't you think it's harsh?

259
00:23:57,497 --> 00:24:01,815
There's just air in this cup, but it got your attention, didn't it?

260
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,292
Just like your nasty words.

261
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:08,747
You keep throwing rocks with your untrue words, yet you hurt people.

262
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:13,046
What if I said you stole from the company?

263
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:14,331
Or you are being a mistress?

264
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:15,889
But I'm not!

265
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,489
That's right.

266
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:22,370
So my friend isn't, but you're making fun of her.

267
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:26,218
I see why horrible men would say something like this.

268
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:28,475
They don't understand women.

269
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,756
But what about us women?

270
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:34,646
I wonder why.

271
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:38,344
You're so jealous of Prae that aren't you a human anymore?

272
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,839
I don't think they know how to be humans.

273
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,728
They badmouth people like this.

274
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,564
Keep on barking.

275
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:48,088
People like you

276
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:51,732

277
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,981
Your words can kill people.

278
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:58,823

What if something happens to me one day? I have only you.

282
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,718
Please keep it.

283
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,413
There's chaos in our team,

284
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,964
and you two sneaked out to meet like this?

285
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,338
Didn't your dad scold you last night?

286
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,334
How did you know?

287
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,451
- You told him?
- That's right.

288
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:04,109
I told him.

289
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:14,129
Lita got into an accident so her dad should go to her, right?

290
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:16,101
Why did you do that?

291
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,633
Don't say it like you're a victim here.

292
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,612
I should be the one asking you for a reason.

293
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,375
You two sneaked out to meet in a dark corner.

294
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,811
You're happy, aren't you?

295
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:34,571
You should be ashamed.

00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:57,701
Rin, wait!

301
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,109
You've got it all wrong, Rin. Can you listen to me?

302
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:01,609
Listen to me.

303
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:04,535
Don't say anything.

304
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:09,576
I know. I know how well you take care of her,

305
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:12,278
and I get it.

306
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,312
She is family of the company's owner.

307
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:20,117
You must do anything as a shortcut for your career.

308
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,917
That's weird.

309
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:25,679
Men say women use their bodies as a ladder.

310
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,300
Yet when they see a chance, they do it as well.

311
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,898
Rin, please listen to me.

312
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:34,918
I'm not doing any of this for me.

313
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:37,449
This has nothing to do with my job at all.

314
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,218

The more you say, the worse you look.

You are a bad guy since the first day you betrayed me.

317
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:55,944
You get worse when I ask you about it, and you keep lying to my face.

318
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:59,326
You are the worst

319
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:02,091
when you chose to go back to her.

320
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,848
Save your excuses!

321
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:07,501
It won't make you look any better.

324
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:37,450
A woman who shared her story in public is in your VIP Team.

325
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,482
And the man who caused it is in your marketing team.

326
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:48,392
Our shares dropped due to people in your teams!

Why can't you control your people?

328

People are calling to say they will boycott our malls.

00:28:56,193 --> 00:29:00,050
But Dad, that woman's record isn't exactly one of a nice lady's.

330
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,277
She slept with many men.

331
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:05,790
Honestly, my guy was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

332

Why don't you try saying that to the public?

333
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,777
This is a sensitive subject.

334
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:18,406
I don't care who's wrong here, but we need to end this promptly.

335
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:21,260
If they keep exposing one another like this, our malls will be in big trouble.

336
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,508
- Darn it.
- Hey, Jak.

337
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:27,945
Something like this happened before with our competitors.

338
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,606
Do you know what they did?

339
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,742
They pushed that employee to resign.

340
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:35,537
That's it, easy solution.

341
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:36,823
This is a mess.

00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:38,516
So then?

Revenue has dropped, and it keeps dropping.

344

It's easy to blame a female employee,

345
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,239
but we can learn from the lesson.

346
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,192
I speak as an executive,

347
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,863
not as a woman.

348
00:29:56,155 --> 00:30:01,043

00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:14,550
I think we need to speak the truth and hold a press conference to apologize.

364
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,804
We need to address the problem directly.

365
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:22,193
If the media uses this, our image will be destroyed.

366
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,142
It won't be.

367
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:26,187
People are watching us.

368
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:32,434
They'd like to know how the company will handle the situation when we find out about the truth.

369
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:36,322
We can take care of a sexual assault problem.

370
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:41,707
I'm sure that everyone will see us taking control of the problem, bringing justice,

371
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:45,765
and that we won't take sides with people who hold a higher position.

372
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:48,865
I totally agree.

373
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:54,361
The company's reputation could be ruined by just one person.

374
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,345
I think Rin's suggestion is the best way.

375
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,867
Your relationship looks good to me.

376
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:14,080
Is it your mutual agreement that kept you two together this long?

377
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:36,229
I'll find a lawyer for Prae.

378
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:41,362
Thank you on her behalf.

379
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:44,609
I just want the best for her.

380
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,823
I know that...

381
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,439
As your lover,

382
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:56,010
I have no integrity in your eyes.

383
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,797
As a leader,

384
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,690
I have to protect my team.

385
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,867
Thank you.

386
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,970
[The Legend]

387
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,526
Hey, you...

388
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:44,786
I...

389
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,879
Oh my!

390
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,806
Actually, I've circled around this many times,

391
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,638
but...

392
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:56,494
I don't know how to start.

393
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:05,832
I'd like to talk to you. May I?

394
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,263
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,460
Now I realize why

396
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,160
you pushed me away from the start when I pursued you.

397
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:30,452
I feel really bad for acting like a jerk to you.

398
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:34,764
I thought it was an old funny joke.

399
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:42,959
I had no idea what you had been through.

400
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:51,033
When I first saw you, I already judged you as...

401
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:53,927
a wild girl.

402
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,567
I'm sorry.

403
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,382
It's okay. I understand.

404
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:08,215
Actually, no woman should experience what you went through.

405
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:15,397
What you did is the right thing.

406
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:18,818
You dare to stand up,

407
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:23,658
to protect and to fight for every woman.

408
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,667
I truly admire you.

409
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:39,625
That's... what I wanted to say.

410
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,425
Thank you so much.

411
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,405
You make me

412
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,949
feel so much better.

413
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:01,403
I gave you a thumbs-up (approval),

414
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,674
and you smiled like this.

415
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:07,349
You would smile from ear to ear if I gave you two thumbs-up.

416
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:56,687
Rin.

417
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,165
Are you hungry?

418
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,125
I bought you Pad Thai (rice-noodle stir fry),

419
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,373
the one you like.

420
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,169
I'll put it on a plate for you.

421
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:17,064
I ordered it the way you like,

422
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:21,539
with no greens and extra mung bean sprouts.

423
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,089
After you finish your work, you should eat it before it gets cold.

424
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,190
Here is your food.

425
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,964
- Hooray!
- Thank you.

426
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,452
Number 12? Hold on a second.

427
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:50,897
Do you see how many people are here?

428
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:53,574
It's no surprise you like this place.

429
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,384
Take one.

430
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:58,084
Thank you.

431
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,365
Wow!

432
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,536
It's so tasty.

433
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,655
I think it will taste better if I feed you.

434
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,455
Open wide.

435
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,140
This is such a small bite.

00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,138

and they won't help us.

452
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,965
From our list, there are four people who will help us.

453
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:23,665

454
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,459
including me.

455
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,313
Or...

456
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:34,923
I should resign.

457
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:37,988

No matter how many victims are willing to help us,

461
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:54,251
I think just using people as witnesses won't be enough to stop him.

462
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,819
Right. Wait.

463
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:59,282

The "Me Too" movement is serious,

519

and our department store is against sexual harassment of all types.

520
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,130
This particular incident has clear evidence.

00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:43,970
even if he holds an executive title.

525
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:09,133
She announced that herself suddenly, without calling a board meeting first.

526
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:12,590
Does she think she is right about everything?

527
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:16,373
But I think Khun Treenate did the right thing this time.

528

I mean she did the right thing to restore the company's reputation.

529
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,150
But like you said, she should have called a meeting first.

530
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,250
And as President,

531
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:33,567
I will take good care of all employees.

I will find a lawyer to sue Mr. Danai to the end.

- That's the way it is, right?
- Yes!

541
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,867
- The beast deserves it!
- Yes!

542
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:28,947
- Get him out!
- Get him out!

543
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:36,240
Nate is power-crazy now.

544
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,080
Does she think she can do whatever to my team?

545
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,851
[The Legend had accepted Mr. Danai Piyamas in the Marketing Director position.]

546
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:01,728
[Now, we announce the termination of Mr. Danai Piyamas.]

547
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:03,743
[He has committed serious offenses against employees of the Company.]

548
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,925
[Date: December 13. Signed, Ms. Treenate Thanaraka]

549
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:18,360
Thanks to you, a bad guy is now gone.

550
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,540
That's amazing.

551
00:49:28,347 --> 00:49:30,610
Do you think it's over?

552
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,280
Do you think you can easily get rid of me?

553
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,513
I never give up. I'll come back for you!

554
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:39,873
You shameless devil!

555
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:42,680
You don't only harass her, but you also dare to insult her?

556
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,787
Yes, last week you accused me of wearing a short skirt to provoke you.

557
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:46,656
Jerk!

558
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:48,773
- Shut up!
- Stop it now.

559
00:49:48,773 --> 00:49:50,958
You've done enough evil things.

560
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,833
You don't want an additional charge, do you?

561
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,440
Just wait and see.

562
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,050
I don't die easily.

563
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,813
Good.

564
00:50:02,993 --> 00:50:04,710
Don't die too soon.

565
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,280
Yes, don't die soon.

566
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,890
You must first pay the price for what you did.

567
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:14,547
Once you're gone, don't return!

568
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:16,150
Go away, Dirtbag!

569
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:19,527
Scum!

570
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:40,990
I let my secretary report on the social trends after I did the press conference, Dad.

571
00:50:41,973 --> 00:50:46,435
The journalists praised our department store for resolving the problem very well.

572
00:50:46,435 --> 00:50:50,720
Helping female employees and not siding with the offender,

573
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,990
even though he's senior management.

574
00:50:56,087 --> 00:51:01,282
The Twitter trends cursing our mall in the past are likely to subside.

575
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:07,067
I did this, but I want to say that the incident is an individual problem.

576
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:10,540
Our department store does our best without being indifferent.

577
00:51:11,187 --> 00:51:13,497
We help the victims.

578
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:18,330
This affects the value of our stock.

579
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,225
Wait and see, Dad.

580
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:24,262
Tomorrow, our stock will certainly rise.

581
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,420
You two should see her as an example.

582
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,210
Just being smart and talented isn't enough;

583
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,587
you must dare to make a wise decision.

584
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:48,390
And the important thing is to win the hearts of our customers.

585
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,050
But no matter how it could win our customers' hearts,

586
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,180
Nate arbitrarily fired my subordinate.

587
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,967
Who will work instead?

588
00:51:56,967 --> 00:52:00,290
Don't worry. Nate can handle things like this.

589
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,560
What's going on, Lita?

590
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,360
P'Pak.

591
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,330
How are you?

592
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,913
I saw Dad called you to talk that day.

593
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,990
Are you okay?

594
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,710
Did he say something about us?

595
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,533
No.

596
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,813
So...

597
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:11,310
You... returned to your house.

598
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:14,990
Which room do you sleep in?

599
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,713
Do you sleep in the same room as Rin?

600
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:20,413
Lita.

601
00:53:24,628 --> 00:53:27,050
I'm sorry.

602
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:31,980
Since you returned home, I can't help thinking about it.

603
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,060
I keep thinking about what you two will be like when you are together.

604
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,140
Will you sleep together? Or will you get back together?

605
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,750
And if you two get back together, what will I do?

606
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:46,450
But even if you do so,

607
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:51,000
I won't mind at all.

608
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,650
I ask for only one thing:

609
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,490
Can you not leave me?

610
00:53:59,327 --> 00:54:01,127
Lita,

611
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:06,245
Rin and I won't get back together.

612
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:11,050
Rin won't take a bad guy like me anymore.

613
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:17,030
She's doing this since she wants to punish me, that's all.

614
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,187
So do you want me to help?

615
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:24,550
Do you want me to talk to Rin or apologize to her again?

616
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,850
Lita, listen to me.

617
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,660
If you really want to help,

618
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,587
stay still. Don't do anything.

619
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:52,220
Rin, Prae and Meena are at the restaurant. Do we reserve tables now?

620
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,287
- Yes.
- Okay, book it now.

621
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:57,730
This restaurant gets crowded; reserve the table!

622
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:02,182
Do you eat this much?

623
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,220
Pak.

624
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,927
Lita.

625
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,887
We are having a hot pot party.

626
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:32,530
Do you want to come? I've booked it.

627
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,413
That's all right. I'm not feeling well today; I'll go home to sleep.

628
00:55:39,413 --> 00:55:41,413
Enjoy your meal.

629
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,870
Thank you, but Dad just asked me to eat with him.

630
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,913
Let's have delicious hot pot.

631
00:56:08,913 --> 00:56:10,513
Let's go.

632
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,780
[Marketing Department]

633
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:27,687
Come in.

634
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:33,147
Nate.

635
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,127
What's the matter?

636
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,987
This is Ms. Paweena, Sir.

637
00:56:40,987 --> 00:56:45,047
She will be the Marketing Director instead of Mr. Danai.

638
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:47,570
A pleasure to work with you.

639
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,627
You found a replacement quickly.

640
00:56:51,627 --> 00:56:53,340
When was this prepared?

641
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,420
Don't worry,

642
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,530
I have tons of positions on standby.

643
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,113
If it's about marketing,

644
00:57:03,113 --> 00:57:05,580
you can report it to me directly.

645
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,433
Yes, Ma'am.

646
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:09,913
You can't do this to me.

647
00:57:09,913 --> 00:57:12,630
The Marketing Department is mine!

648
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,593
Control yourself.

649
00:57:19,593 --> 00:57:22,050
The Marketing Department belongs to the company.

650
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:24,787
It's not yours.

651
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,167
Everyone in the Marketing Department, listen to me.

652
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:42,067
Get up!

653
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:48,535
Now the Marketing Department is undergoing change.

654
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:54,504
Anyone who wants to continue working with me, gather your personal items and go with me now.

655
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,270
If any chair is vacant,

656
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,610
I will replace it with my new employee.

657
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,233
We are finished here.

658
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:32,933
What are you looking at? Keep working!

659
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:44,467
Have you seen what my sister is capable of?

660
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:46,750
Yuth's Marketing team made a few mistakes.

661
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,960
She targeted him.

662
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:51,970
We can't be careless.

663
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,533
Yes, Sir.

664
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,727
Don't be too kind.

665
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:01,213
We men must be in control.

666
00:59:01,213 --> 00:59:03,870
Women have many tricks,

667
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,600
especially those who fake-cry for sympathy; they are the worst.

668
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,621
If we don't realize and fall for it, we are doomed.

669
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:17,480
You mean... Lita?

670
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,670
Yes. She's a woman; it's all the same.

671
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,872
You have to be in control.

672
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:28,993
And about you three...

673
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,410
Don't mess up again.

674
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,090
[Fulu]

675
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,120
Guys, thank you so much.

676
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,924
Otherwise, I would have been in pain alone a long time.

677
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:58,987
Hey, I and the women in the company need to thank you.

678
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:00,645
If you didn't speak openly of this issue,

679
01:00:00,645 --> 01:00:04,987
nobody would know about the women who were harassed, too.

680
01:00:04,987 --> 01:00:10,327
Right. When women are harassed by words, we don't dare to complain.

681
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:14,200
We're afraid of some statements like, "You think too much," or "It's just a joke."

682
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,450
And when we really get angry,

683
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:21,003
men usually make us feel we deserve it since we dress like this.

684
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:22,987
Hey, is that right?

685
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:26,240
Guys really are terrible.

686
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,001
Wait, Ji.

687
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:30,423
- What?
- Isn't that too much?

688
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:32,307
A good man is sitting right here.

689
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:34,587
Don't you see it?

690
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,093
Not everyone, right?

691
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:39,187
Look at Pak. He was good before. How is he now?

692
01:00:39,187 --> 01:00:41,287
Trash!

693
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,613
It's okay, go on.

694
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,250
It's true like you said.

695
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:56,690
Someone is nice today. Who knows what he will be like in the future?

696
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,530
That's right. Look at us, still gossiping about men.

697
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:07,380
But not all men are trash.

698
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,113
There are some good ones, too.

699
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:13,040
You speak very well. I'll love you for one day.

700
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:15,937
So give me some vegetables.

701
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:17,337
Okay.

702
01:01:20,547 --> 01:01:24,193
Girl, is your husband calling?

703
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:26,650
Answer it; go on.

704
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,987
What?

705
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:30,867
Say hi to the aunties first. Quickly.

706
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:33,120
- Hello.
- Say it quickly.

707
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,493
Hi.

708
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:37,147
Hi.

709
01:01:37,147 --> 01:01:40,320
Okay, I'm still fine. I'm not dead yet.

710
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,890
Jomphol,

711
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,880
thank you for helping me find the evidence.

712
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,667
You're welcome.

713
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,846
It's my pleasure.

714
01:01:51,477 --> 01:01:53,847
Let me handle these two first.

715
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,850
Have fun. I'll take care of the children.

716
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,500
Okay, bye bye.

717
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,870
Meena, here is another good guy.

718
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:06,380
Prae didn't mean the guy who just called us, right?

719
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,133
She meant another one.

720
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:13,430
What? Seeing your friend with a warm family, do you want one, too?

721
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:22,760
Did you order this?

722
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,660
- Hello.
- Hey, Nont.

723
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,680
What? I'm here at the table already, before you say hi?

724
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,250
Here, I bought you some snacks.

725
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,100
Oh, it's so nice of you. Is it really for me?

726
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,180
Yes.

727
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,146
Is this really for me?

728
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:37,550
Why don't you talk to Chanont?

729
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:40,854
He rushed here after his meeting to see you.

730
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:51,226
Give yourself the opportunity now.

731
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
Wait a minute.

732
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,880
Go.

733
01:03:12,287 --> 01:03:13,787
Hi.

734
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:16,207
Hi.

735
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:20,730
Have you eaten anything yet? If not, then...

736
01:03:23,793 --> 01:03:25,293
Please.

737
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,630
Thank you.

738
01:03:28,713 --> 01:03:32,770
Is this the nice guy she's talking about?

739
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,860
What are you discussing?

740
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,933
♪ My good man is right here ♪

741
01:03:39,933 --> 01:03:42,637
He bought something for you, too.

742
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:45,527
The butter cake that you like, for you only.

743
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:47,074
He gave it to me, too.

744
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,600
Lita.

745
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:01,527
Lita, how did you get here?

746
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,080
It's raining.

747
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:08,870
Let's talk inside.

748
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:14,793
Lita,

749
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,823
how did you arrive here?

750
01:05:19,533 --> 01:05:23,887
I heard that you weren't feeling well so...

751
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,627
I cooked Chinese herbal medicine for you.

752
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,250
Thanks.

753
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:44,573
Drink it all and go to bed quickly

754
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,602
so you'll get well soon.

755
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,080
Excuse me, I'm going home.

756
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,980
Wait.

757
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,650
It's raining. How will you go home?

758
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:04,987
I can call a driver through the app.

759
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:07,593
I'll wait outside.

760
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,670
It won't be appropriate if someone sees us.

761
01:06:22,247 --> 01:06:24,760
Please go inside.

762
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,990
The car will arrive soon.

763
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,420
Lita.

764
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,673
Wait inside the house.

765
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:41,990
Can I go in?

766
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,793
Come in.

767
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,613
Rin.

768
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:01,733
How is Pak?

769
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:05,067
I called him before coming here.

770
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:08,210
His voice didn't sound so good.

771
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,527
I'm not feeling well today; I'll go home to sleep.

772
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,427
Enjoy your meal.

773
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:21,287
Sorry for ruining the atmosphere.

774
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,290
Rin, what are you looking at?

775
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,370
What are you watching?

776
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:56,420
Do you have any problems?

777
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,980
The signal is weak here.

778
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,640
I can't watch anything. There seems no signal.

779
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,547
Try walking over there.

780
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,859
The internet signal is good there.

781
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:17,336
I just called my mom. The signal is perfect, very clear.

782
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,410
Is the signal better?

783
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:54,660
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

784
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:02,190
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

785
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:09,240
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

786
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,820
♫ Please understand again ♫

787
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:20,880
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫
