[The Legend]

9
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:22,673
Come in.

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,860
Sit down.

11
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,980
Would you like something to drink?

12
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,780
No, I'm fine.

13
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:45,623
I heard that you want to move to the marketing team.
[The Legend]

14
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:52,406
We have a position vacant for a deputy marketing manager.

15
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,003
I would appreciate it if you moved to our team.

16
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,486
I think you would be very helpful to our team.

17
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,903
Thank you.

18
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:07,470
So let's talk again later after you transfer here.

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,639
What do you mean?

20
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:14,693
Instead of moving here right now,

21
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:20,303
I have a job for you to do while you're still in the VIP Team.

22
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,183
I will do my best.

23
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,726
Good.

24
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:32,060
As a smart woman like you,

25
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,658
I know that you can handle it well.

26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,500
[The Legend]

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,980
You know we have a meeting; you should be early.

28
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,313
I'm not that late.

29
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,943
The meeting hasn't started yet.

30
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,273
I wasn't speaking to you. I'm talking to Saint.

31
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:21,258
I'd like the VIP Team to help present these products to our VIP customers.

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,423
Our team is preparing for a diamond auction right now.

33
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,940
We're busy enough.

34
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,043
One more thing, this type of product is home decoration.

35
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:45,223
We don't normally recommend this kind of product to VIP customers anyway.

36
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:57,319
But these home decorations are leading brands.

37
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,780
They look luxurious enough for our customers.

38
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,123
Perhaps the customers will be satisfied if we provide more services.

39
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:11,193
It would be good if the VIP Team had more people like Meena:

40
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,587
knowing how to adapt,

41
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,186
not being stubborn, not daring to do anything challenging

42
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,663
until missing a good opportunity.

43
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,503
You should learn this, Prae.

44
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,126
A selfish guy like you wouldn't say something like that.

45
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:32,450
Actually, what you mean is the marketing team wants to increase sales without using your efforts.

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,433
Thus, you're using our team. Let's be honest.

47
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,093
Our team won't accept this job.

48
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:42,282
If you want to get all the credit, learn to do it yourself.

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,117
Talk to me nicely!

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,980
My position is higher than yours anyway!

51
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,970
I can get you out of the company at any time!

52
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,183
Try it.

53
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:51,093
That's enough, Prae.

54
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:59,103
I apologize on behalf of Prae for her harsh words,

55
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,263
but what she said is true.

56
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,619
If the marketing team wants to get the credit, you need to do it yourself.

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,243
Do you think we'll help you?

58
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:29,580
You can't take Prae out of the company.

59
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,460
She alone

60
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,020
could make more money for the company than all of you combined.

61
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,033
Rin, you were very cool just now.

62
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,213
You really upset Danai.

63
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,543
Prae, you're very lucky to have a friend like Rin.

64
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:15,683
Rin is always like this; she likes to be a heroine helping others.

65
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,680
If you hadn't spoken so strongly, I wouldn't need to do that.

66
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,506
So what did you want me to do?

67
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,493
Just sit still like you?

68
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,940
I don't know how to do that.

69
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,740
"Sit still"?

70
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,233
I just sat still because there was a better way

71
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:35,186
to make the marketing team retreat without having to clash like that.

72
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,627
Do you really think I'd take that project?

73
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,434
Just trust me, Prae.

74
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,216
What about you?

75
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,488
Do you trust me, Rin?

76
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,513
Do you two have any problem?

77
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:08,163
You've been acting weird since morning.

78
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,333
What is this check for?

79
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,393
I took out a low-interest employee loan for you.

80
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:36,725
I know you can't borrow it yourself.

81
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,886
Take it,

82
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,162
and when you have the money, just return it.

83
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:47,385
Before you help pay your mother's debts, you first need money for yourself.

84
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,866
See.

85
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,963
You're always like this.

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,460
A heroine riding a white horse to help everyone who is in trouble.

87
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,460
The more you do this,

88
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,163
the more worthless I feel.

89
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,294
But you wouldn't understand,

90
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,640
because you're perfect.

91
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,343
Your life is good in every way.

92
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,063
Prae.

93
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,742
Take it.

94
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:24,225
I really want to help you.

95
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,520
You want me to take this check so much since you don't want me to mess with P'Pak, right?

96
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,594
Do you still think that I'm having an affair with him?

97
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,940
In the past,

98
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,903
other people saw me as

99
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,350
an easy girl,

100
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:55,331
a mistress.

101
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,023
I never cared.

102
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,873
But this is you.

103
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:09,182
You are my friend. Why don't you trust me?

104
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,233
If you still think that I'm having an affair with P'Pak,

105
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:18,325
I have nothing to say to you. Keep imagining what you want.

106
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,725
Prae.

107
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,743
P'Pak had an affair.

108
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,303
I'm not imagining it.

109
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,403
He really cheated on me.

110
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:46,484
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

111
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:53,923
Do you know whom is the sender?

112
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,783
No, but it was sent from my work computer.

113
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,341
P'Pak told me

114
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,880
that it was all over,

115
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,483
but I don't know if I should believe him.

116
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,693
Do you know what?

117
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:26,603
When I got that crazy message,

118
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,530
I felt everything was falling apart right in front of me.

119
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:39,543
P'Pak had an affair, and the woman is in my team.

120
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:43,903
I don't know whom I should trust anymore.

121
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:47,090
I feel stupid and lonely.

122
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,893
I don't know what to do.

123
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,220
[The Legend]

124
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,584
I'm going home now.

125
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,464
I'm leaving, too.

126
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,244
[Dad]

127
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,141
Yes, Dad.

128
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,888
What?

129
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,071
Let's go.

130
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,431
No, Rin.

131
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,264
Let's go home.

132
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,301
When does Mom ever want us?

133
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,694
She is sick.

134
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:16,324
And how did you find her?

135
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,901
Did she ask you for money again?

136
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,641
I'll give Mom the money.

137
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,634
I'll pay for her medical expenses. You don't have to stay here to take care of her.

138
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,027
Let's go.

139
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,727
Khun.

140
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,478
Take Rin back. I can stay here alone.

141
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:37,544
See that?

142
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,421
She didn't want us.

143
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:44,381
Otherwise, she wouldn't have left us for another man!

144
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,644
Rin!

145
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,414
Stop being angry with your mom.

146
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,627
It's been a long time.

147
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,614
It's because it has been a long time.

148
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,864
I remember growing up without her care and attention.

149
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,507
She is seriously ill.

150
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,394
So what do you want me to do?

151
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:16,174
She really does love you.

152
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,467
Don't be angry with her.

153
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,124
Do you think I want to be angry with Mom?

154
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,024
Do you think I always wanted to live feeling like this?

155
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:32,234
I wanted a warm family like others, too.

156
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:35,144
But I never got it, Dad.

157
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:23,284
Hello? When you left, was Rin still at the company?

158
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:29,627
I'll see you.

159
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,114
P'Pak.

160
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:09,987
Rin.

161
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,835
How did you know I was here?

162
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,761
Dad, hi.

163
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,361
Hi.

164
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,764
Did you tell Pak we were here?

165
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:29,874
No, I didn't.

166
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,344
How did you know?

167
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,924
Prae.

168
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:49,081
Prae told you, right?

169
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,681
Yes.

170
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:54,407
It's good that you're here. Follow me.

171
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,907
Yes.

172
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:43,441
- Pak.
- Yes?

173
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:48,761
Are you free? Can I leave Mom with you for a while?

174
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,874
I'm going to run an errand with Rin.

175
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:52,387
Okay, sure.

176
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,874
Okay, thanks.

177
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,474
Let's go.

178
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,741
By the way, please take care of Mom.

179
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:05,024
Okay, don't worry.

180
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,054
Thank you.

181
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,927
Mom.

182
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,901
You can call me.

183
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,294
Here's some water.

184
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,627
I don't want to be a bother.

185
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:42,301
Actually, you don't have to stay with me or anything. I'm fine.

186
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,204
Thank you.

187
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,767
Are you feeling better?

188
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,067
Yes.

189
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,494
- Pak.
- Yes?

190
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:00,541
I have something to ask you.

191
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,706
Sure, what's the matter?

192
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:09,004
Can you take care of Rin forever?

193
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:14,644
She has been in pain for a long time due to me,

194
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,624
but she was lucky to meet you.

195
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:25,824
I'm at ease now that a good guy like you is with her.

196
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,798
Please take care of her.

197
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,324
Okay, I promise you.

198
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,164
Thank you.

199
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,861
Yes.

[Meena]

202
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,967
Hello?

203
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:26,121
P'Pak.

204
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:29,904
I want to talk to you tomorrow.

205
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,321
Okay.

206
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:38,425
Thank you.

207

[The Legend]

208
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,603
What's the matter? Why did you see P'Pak early this morning?

209
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,723
We discussed the auction.

210
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:31,693
Yes.

211
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,906
Thanks a lot.

212
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:41,743
What did you talk to Meena about just now?

213
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,863
About work in general.

214
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,923
I can't believe someone like you, who isn't good at lying, could cheat on Rin.

215
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,466
Yes, I know about it,

216
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,659
that you cheated on Rin.

217
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,153
I'm very disappointed in you.

218
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:07,193
Rin has always been by your side at work and at home.

219
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,705
How could you betray her?

220
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,583
Marriage is complicated.

221
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,478
I didn't want it to happen, either.

222
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,926
How did it happen?

223
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:24,153
Are you saying it was an accident?

224
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,403
Or did Rin upset you until this happened?

225
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:28,003
No.

226
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,261
Rin did nothing wrong.

227
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:37,523
I'm the one in the wrong. It is I who is the jerk.

228
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,193
Everyday...

229
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,369
when I look at Rin's face,

230
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:53,062
I want to apologize to her a million times.

231
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,404
I want to do everything...

232
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,900
to return to how it was before.

233
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,883
You should stop contacting that woman.

234
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,723
No matter who she is,

235
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,523
you should stop seeing her.

236
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:24,926
Because if Rin knows that you're still lying to her,

237
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:27,764
she won't let you and that woman alone for sure.

238
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:01,713
Do you want this?

239
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,120
If I eat it

240
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,684
will you smile

241
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,093
like this?

242
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,460
Of course.

243
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,430
Don't cry, okay?

244
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,983
I'll be right back.

245
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,706
Hello.

246
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:14,306
Lita, where are you?

247
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm with my mom.

248
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,900
Don't worry.

249
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,406
No one knows that I'm here with her.

250
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:25,943
Hurry back.

251
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,283
Don't make me wait too long.

252
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,413
Yes.

Mom.

255
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:00,707
Mom, Mom.

256
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,473
Mom.

257
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:11,826
- Mom.
- Auntie.

258
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,260
Does it hurt?

259
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,160
Lita.

260
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:25,995
Are you hurt?

261
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,500
Get up.

262
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,354
- Are you okay?
- Be careful.

263
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,533
Are you hurt, Mom?

264
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,787
Is she your mom?

265
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,687
Yes.

266
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,910
She is my mom.

267
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,170
Thank you so much.

268
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:16,427
If there's any way I can help, let me know.

269
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:21,187
If you want to take leave or leave work early to take care of your mother,

270
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:24,230
you can tell me. Don't be embarrassed. Okay?

271
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:28,590
Thank you so much.

272
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,800
Take care of your mom, and don't forget to take care of yourself, okay?

273
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,010
I'm rooting for you.

[Liver cancer]

275
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,954
Is it a referral form?

276
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:11,677
So my mom isn't receiving treatment from here anymore?

277
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,820
Mom.

278
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:23,653
Where are you going? Why won't you receive treatment here?

279
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,770
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

280
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,473
You're okay, Mom?

281
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,627
I know about it,

282
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,813
that you have cancer.

283
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,693
That's why I'm going to have surgery in Chiang Mai (northern city).

284
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:46,753
Don't worry.

285
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:49,270
I won't let myself die.

286
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,947
And the cost of receiving treatment over there is cheaper

287
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:54,447
so I won't have to bother you and your dad.

288
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,650
Why do you care now?

289
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,490
In the past, did you ever worry about me and Dad?

290
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,400
You left me and Dad for another man.

291
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,070
But when it's about your life, you start to care about our feelings?

292
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,170
You're receiving treatment in Chiang Mai,

293
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,354
because you want me to feel guilty, right?

294
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:26,227
You want me to be hurt. You want me to blame myself, right?

295
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:29,070
That I am an ungrateful child,

296
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,787
to blame myself that I couldn't take care of my Mom.

297
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:33,687
That's enough, Rin.

298
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:42,118
You can't blame your mom alone.

299
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:47,858
My family was at fault, too, for putting pressure on her.

300
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:53,460
She had to be a good wife, a good daughter-in-law, and a good mother.

301
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,290
I was not on her side.

302
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:03,515
Honestly, I should have protected her more than that.

303
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,990
Hey, Rin.

304
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,090
Your mom just wanted to have her own life,

305
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,680
but not everyone understood her.

306
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,410
They thought that what she did was so wrong...

307
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,020
that she didn't dare to face you because you would be ashamed to have a mom like her!

308
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:28,873
And she didn't abandon us.

309
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:34,540
She has always asked me how you are doing.

310
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,640
Khun.

311
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:38,367
That's enough.

312
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,047
Come on.

313
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:43,230
I'm at fault, too.

314
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,990
Rin.

315
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,826
You don't have to forgive me.

316
00:31:56,826 --> 00:32:00,836
You can be angry and hate me,

317
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,940
but I beg you.

318
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,230
I ask just one thing of you:

319
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,758
From now on,

320
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:28,098
have a happy life, Baby.

321
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:30,187
Today, I talked to my mom about many things.

322
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:33,150
I understand her a lot better.

323
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,930
I just realized that...

324
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,997
when I know the whole story,

325
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:47,274
it's like unblocking the feeling that I was imagining for a long time.

326
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:49,590
I felt very relieved.

327
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,170
I think you and your mom will understand each other better from now on.

328
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,530
So it made me think about us.

329
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:17,200
It made me realize that I need to stop my mind from imagining things.

330
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:23,561
If you really love me, you should tell me what exactly happened.

331
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,607
In the past, it felt like I carried everything alone.

332
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,100
I had a fight with my friend.

333
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,630
I'm not in the mood to work because I keep thinking,

334
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,750
"Who exactly is that woman?"

335
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:44,070
You told me that...

336
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,370
I don't know that girl, right?

337
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:01,812
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

338
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:05,890
Do you still stand by your words?

339
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,790
I've tried so hard to forgive you.

340
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,030
But I really can't forget about it.

341
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,860
And since I can't forget it, I made a decision.

342
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,170
I need to know about this woman.

343
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,930
Who is she?

344
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,150
I'm asking you who she is!

345
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,127
Rin.

346
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,453
It's over now.

347
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,240
It's really over.

348
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,830
You won't tell me anyway, right?

349
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:57,013
Rin.

350
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,034
Rin, wait.

351
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,400
Wait, Rin.

352
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,120
Rin. Talk to me first. What are you doing?

353
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,607
Rin, no.

354
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,707
Rin, listen to me.

355
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,707
Since you chose not to say anything, I will no longer stay here.

356
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:23,427
That's enough!

357
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:26,020
Calm down.

358
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,630
Rin, talk to me first. Let's talk.

359
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,350
Why would you still choose not to say anything at a time like this?

360
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:37,190
Do you know how much I'm hurting?

361
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,707
I keep thinking of you hugging her... and kissing her.

362
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:43,921
You probably told her you loved her and not to me.

363
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:45,967
It's over.

364
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,835
It's better not to know.

365
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:49,885
How is it better?

366
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,213
You're not saying anything.

367
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,920
You don't care about me.

368
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,530
You just want to protect her.

369
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,820
That message...

370
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,410
Is it true?

371
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:10,127
No, it's not like that.

372
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,710
Can you just stop lying to me?

373
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,421
I recently found out the message was sent from the computer on my desk at work.

374
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,467
So what now?

375
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,210
Will you still lie to me shamelessly?

376
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:42,033
It's fine if you don't say anything.

377
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,710
After all, it must be someone in my team.

378
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:49,613
Let me tell you.

379
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,990
I won't stop here.

380
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,678
I have to find out whom it is.

381
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:03,587
Rin. Rin.

382
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,975
You don't have to go.

383
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,167
Don't go anywhere.

384
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,133
I will leave.

385
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,507
Meena, your job is really good.

386
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,514
You get to taste a lot of wine.

387
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,821
So I got lucky as well.

388
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,507
In fact, other departments can't come to taste it.

389
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,687
You must be a member of the VIP Team only.

390
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,221
So don't tell anyone. Only we two can know about this.

391
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:46,467
I promise you. On the day of the diamond auction,

392
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:51,154
no matter what the VIP Team orders me to do, I will do it like a slave.

393
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:53,004
Bring me here often, please.

394
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,521
Hello, Meena.

395
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:00,161
We have prepared Château Pichon Longueville Baron wine today.

396
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,861
I heard there will be both meat and lamb menus on that day.

397
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:09,407
This wine goes well with the food because of its long finish (aftertaste).

398
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:16,167
It is made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes fermented in oak barrels for...

399
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,524
Eighteen months, right?

400
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:19,174
Yes.

401
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:22,474
Meena is the sommelier of the team.

402
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:27,454
She has the most expertise in wine. The origin and fermentation time,

403
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,720
the menu to pair it with, you can ask her anything.

404
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,040
She is a real expert.

405
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:37,053
- Then I'll let you taste it.
- Okay.

406
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:55,007
Take it first.

407
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,234
- Ji.
- What?

408
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:58,704
- You have to hold it like this.
- Am I doing it wrong?

409
00:41:58,704 --> 00:41:59,854
Like this?

410
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:02,566
I had been doing it wrong the whole time.

411
00:42:03,784 --> 00:42:05,384
Thanks.

412
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,960
Let's drink.

413
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:25,607
Meena. Meena.

414
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:27,241
What's wrong?

415
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,081
Meena!

416
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,761
What's wrong? Do you want to see a doctor?

417
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:47,484
It's okay. You taste the wine first.

418
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,881
Are you sure? You're okay, right?

419
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:52,564
Yes, go on.

420
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,780
[The Legend]

421
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:44,314
You still have work to do, right?

422
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:47,264
You can go; I have an appointment.

423
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:57,584
Is Prae leaving?

424
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,744
You look so happy.

425
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,521
How many bottles of wine did you finish?

426
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:08,947
Many because I tasted them alone.

427
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,324
Didn't you go with Meena?

428
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:15,147
Yes, but when we were tasting wine,

429
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:19,484
she suddenly had to throw up and ran to the toilet.

430
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,007
It's strange.

431
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,744
Meena is usually good at tasting wine.

432
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:26,434
That's right.

433
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:31,881
Think about it. She was so sick that she couldn't continue tasting the wine

434
00:44:31,881 --> 00:44:34,508
and had to go home first.

435
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:38,476
I didn't want to stop her

436
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:43,159
because I know she has some good news which she hasn't told us yet.

437
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,094
What good news?

438
00:44:45,094 --> 00:44:49,234
Look at her condition.

439
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:52,004
I think Meena is definitely pregnant.

440
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:58,101
Though Jomphol seems a nerd, he has something good.

441
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:01,161
Now the third child has arrived.

442
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:04,124
That's amazing. Is Saint here?

443
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:07,141
I have to tell him.

444
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:18,247
I'm so busy these days, look.

445
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,821
I have to take care of children and work.

446
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,644
Where is your wife?

447
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:24,727
- "My wife"?
- Yes.

448
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:26,547
Hi, Auntie Rin.

449
00:45:26,547 --> 00:45:28,264
Mick and Max.

450
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:31,827
She asked to stay in an apartment around here.

451
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:35,414
She said that it would be convenient to commute to the office.

452
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:38,147
Does she not go home at all?

453
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:40,127
No.

454
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:43,584
I think it's weird. She usually goes home.

455
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:46,484
Don't you think it's strange? Not going home at all.

456
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:50,267
This is just my theory, but is she having an affair?

457
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:52,701
Are you crazy? What affair? You're insane.

458
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,717
Cool it. Calm down; I just assumed it.

459
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:57,695
- No, don't say that.
- I'm just joking.

460
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:04,984
Isn't your mom coming with you?

461
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:09,727
Dad said she went to work out of town.

462
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:12,024
She will come back next month.

463
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,874
It's me.

464
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,074
Where are you going? Do you want a ride?

465
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,752
It's okay, I can go by myself.

466
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,427
Wait.

467
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,721
Hey.

468
00:46:41,721 --> 00:46:44,872
It takes a while to reach the main road. You'll get tired walking.

469
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:49,632
Besides, it's hard to find a taxi now. Let me give you a lift.

470
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:12,948
The whole company knows about you insulting Mr. Danai.

471
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:19,041
But a guy like him deserves it.

472
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,901
He likes to pose and act like an executive.

473
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:24,401
Right?

474
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:28,827
Hey, Prae.

475
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:32,474
If there's something you find uncomfortable,

476
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,544
or you need to talk to someone,

477
00:47:37,184 --> 00:47:39,217
you can share it with me.

478
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:53,784
Thank you for your kindness.

479
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:56,621
But I don't want it.

480
00:47:56,621 --> 00:48:00,021
If you don't want it, that's fine. I'm willing to give it to you.

481
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:06,074
I think I'd better turn on the music for you.

482
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:09,407
Perhaps it will make your mood better.

483
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:12,274
I usually listen to this song when—

484
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:20,694
It's not this song. I was planning to play another song, but...

485
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:25,537
I listened to this song previously. I have to say this melody is good too.

486
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:28,924
It should make you feel better. Have you heard it?

487
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:36,885
Come this way.

488
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,634
Follow me.

489
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:48,614
Here, the fourth floor.

490
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:52,830
It made you a bit tired, but it suits the price.

491
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,434
The owner of the room will move out at the end of this month.

492
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,307
I heard she will live in a luxurious condo near her workplace.

493
00:49:01,307 --> 00:49:04,464
I think she has a rich boyfriend.

494
00:49:05,247 --> 00:49:08,464
Oh, she's here.

495
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,041
P'Prae.

496
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:23,447
Do you know each other?

497
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:26,094
She will rent this room after you.

498
00:49:26,094 --> 00:49:29,294
Then please talk among yourselves.

499
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:52,624
You can take a look.

500
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:11,224
You must be wondering, right?

501
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:14,459
Why is someone like me

502
00:50:15,384 --> 00:50:18,104
looking for a room in this place?

503
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:24,864
My family went bankrupt.

504
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:28,380
I'm having a hard time.

505
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:32,624
My life isn't as glamorous as everyone thinks.

506
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:40,107
A talented woman like you can get through it for sure.

507
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:44,901
Thanks.

508
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:54,013
The landlady said you will be moving to a condo near the mall.

509
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:57,604
The condos in that area are expensive.

510
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:04,244
It seems our destinies have switched.

511
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:08,704
No, Prae.

512
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:15,804
My destiny may not be as good as you think it is.

513
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:24,781
I don't know... if the office gossip is true,

514
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,057
but I just want to tell you to be more careful.

515
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:34,150
Don't let anyone take advantage of you, especially men.

516
00:51:53,057 --> 00:51:56,544
I think it's weird. She usually goes home.
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

517
00:51:56,544 --> 00:52:00,064
This is just my theory, but is she having an affair?

518
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,280
[The Legend]

519
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,173
Rin.

520
00:52:42,173 --> 00:52:44,032
Meena won't be coming today.

521
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:48,556
What's wrong? She never skips work unless it's a serious matter.

522
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,019
Rin.

523
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:20,764
The day you got the text about P'Pak,

524
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,110
I came back to get the documents.

525
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,240
[21:46 (9:46 p.m.) May 10]

526
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,916
Sorry, could you please go back to The Legend again?

527
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,850
[VIP Management Team]

528
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:45,776
I saw P'Pak with another woman.

529
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:09,576
But I couldn't clearly see her

530
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:13,826
so I waited in front of the mall to see who exited.

531
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,873
Who was it?

532
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,439
Meena...

533
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:41,576
and Lalita.

534
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,076
Why did you tell me this only now?

535
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:57,936
I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the message you got.

536
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,386
Hi, Rin and Prae.

537
00:55:07,386 --> 00:55:10,956
Why do you look stressed in the morning?

538
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,679
I have a surprise for you.

539
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:22,339
Here is the missing contract we signed with Lavish. I found it.

540
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:24,426
You've been working for a year now, Saint.

541
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:27,166
Be careful next time.

542
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:30,559
So how did you find it? It's been missing for almost a month now.

543
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,576
Yesterday, I went to the CCTV room.

544
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:36,213
At first, I thought they deleted the footage every week.

545
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:40,166
But it turns out they keep a backup for up to six months.

546
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:44,433
Six months... So just tell me if you want to find anything.

547
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:47,056
I'll find it for you.

548
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:49,116
I'm good, am I not?

549
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:56,176
Rin. Rin.

550
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,563
Rin, where are you going?

551
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,413
I'm going to ask to see the CCTV footage on May 10.

552
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:04,631
So I can find out who sent me that message.

553
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:08,273
I thought all the footage was deleted. I just realized there's still a backup.

554
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:10,173
Let's go.

555
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:16,733
You want to see CCTV camera footage on May 10, from 8:00 p.m., right?

556
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:18,739
Yes, well...
[Information Technology Department]

557
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:22,253
I lost my document so I want to know where I put it.

558
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,906
Why?

559
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:25,153
There's no data anymore.

560
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:29,656
You haven't checked yet. Why do you say no?

561
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:33,439
Rin. Prae.

562
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:36,086
You came down to the IT Team. Can I help with anything?

563
00:56:36,086 --> 00:56:39,166
They want that footage.

564
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:41,536
On May 10?

565
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:44,173
Oh, Khun Pak came here and took it.

566
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:46,273
He repeatedly asked to delete it at once.

567
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:49,396
He said it was an order from Khun Jakchai.

568
00:56:50,226 --> 00:56:52,219
Did P'Pak take it already?

569
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:53,819
Yes.

570
00:56:57,173 --> 00:57:00,956
Did you watch it?

571
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:03,173
I wouldn't dare to watch it.

572
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:06,733
Khun Pak emphasized I must hand it to him and not let anyone else touch it.

573
00:57:06,733 --> 00:57:10,456
So I thought it may be a secret. I didn't dare watch it.

574
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:13,206
Is anything wrong?

575
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:15,316
You look stressed.

576
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:19,736
Nothing. We just lost our document so we came here to check.

577
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:44,975
You go upstairs first.

578
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,870
I would like to talk to you.

[The Legend]

580
00:58:20,993 --> 00:58:22,293
Rin.

581
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:25,937
Do you really have to protect that woman like this?

582
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:30,170
You even went to the IT Department to delete the CCTV data!

583
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,170
I shouldn't have told you about that message.

584
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,147
I want us two to start over in a way that...

585
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:42,710
we don't mention this matter again.

586
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,127
Is it really that easy?

587
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:48,890
It's that simple, isn't it?

588
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,940
You didn't explain it clearly.

589
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,627
You never expressed your sincerity!

590
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:57,398
And now you're protecting her at all costs.

591
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:59,390
I'm not protecting her.

592
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,722
I'm protecting you.

593
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,514
If you learn about it...

594
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,193
you'll get hurt.

595
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:14,666
I don't want you to get hurt.

596
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,470
I've been hurting for a long time now.

597
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:24,110
It's so painful that I don't even know how to explain it in words.

598
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:29,850
The only thing that will make me feel a little better now...

599
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,510
is hearing the truth from your mouth.

600
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:45,526
I understand that, but...

601
00:59:46,613 --> 00:59:48,900
can you just let it end here?

602
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,600
It's over.

603
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,700
Let it end.

604
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:02,607
I made my point clear, but you still choose to use this method.

605
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:09,247
The more you do this,

606
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:12,230
the more curious I get about that woman.

607
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,390
And I will find out.

608
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,540
[The Legend]

609
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,087
Hello.

610
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:54,190
I already know you're the one who texted Rin.

611
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:56,987
Why did you do that?

612
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,450
Rin has been hurt enough.

613
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:04,380
Didn't I tell you already that she can't know it was from you?

614
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,350
If she knew...

615
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:12,210
it would wound her for the rest of her life. Do you understand?

616
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,720
And I already told you that

617
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,290
our story... is over.

618
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,180
I beg you.

619
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:35,950
Can you not do this?

620
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,710
Don't cry.

621
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,320
I'll pick you up.

622
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:59,535
But this is the last time...

623
01:01:59,535 --> 01:02:03,018
that we two will meet like this.

624
01:02:30,063 --> 01:02:31,633
Don't cry.

625
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:33,533
I'm here.

626
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:36,953
I'm not angry.

627
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,689
Who gave you a ride?

628
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,000
How did you get here?

629
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,807
Don't change the topic.

630
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,930
Who gave you a ride?

631
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,800
The guard said that a man drove here to pick you up.

632
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,200
Who is it?

633
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,553
So do you think I'm having an affair?

634
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,153
That's right.

635
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:33,953
If not for an affair, then why would you live by yourself?

636
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:37,644
Are you crazy? It's for work.

637
01:03:37,644 --> 01:03:40,240
- Just go back now.
- M-Meena.

638
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:44,030
If it's about work, we can talk.

639
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,140
You really have someone else, don't you?

640
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,539
Meena.

641
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:00,282
Why are you...

642
01:04:00,282 --> 01:04:03,607
Why are you doing this? Are you really going to leave me and the children?

643
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:07,643
I said it isn't true. Do you not have a brain?

644
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,753
If you won't try to understand now, let's break up!

645
01:04:10,753 --> 01:04:13,447
No, I won't! Meena!

646
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:16,320
I won't break up.

647
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,350
I am sorry.

648
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,750
Please think about our children. I won't break up.

650
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:31,318

- No, I won't.
