14
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:59,207
How did she get here?

15
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:00,760
I don't know, either.

16
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,260
I sent her myself; I don't know how she got here.

17
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,293
It's surely not a coincidence.

18
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:25,830
With so many foundations, why did they choose Kawita's?

19
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,010
Ask Rin if she knows anything.

20
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,110
Yes, Sir.

21
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
Rin.

22
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,170
Is it about Kawita?

23
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,011
As I told you already,

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,970
VIP can't end with the Black Diamond event.

25
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,363
I know that she is Mr. Jakchai's mistress,

26
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,693
and I also know

27
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:05,013
that she holds shares in a rival company on his behalf.

28
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,780
More importantly,

29
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,520
she is a director for a competitor.

30
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,400
Go and tell Mr. Jakchai to fix this and make things right.

31
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,300
And most of all,

32
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,773
tell him to stop bothering VIP Team.

33
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:29,690

Sir.

37
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,287
What did Rin say?

38
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:14,590
Rin already knows who Kawita is,

39
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,173
and she knows what Kawita does for you.

40
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:21,080
Are you sure she didn't threaten you?

41
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,210
Rin didn't,

42
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:36,793
and if Kawita hadn't answered the calls, I think...

43
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,550
I won't let it end like this.

44
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,548
Does Pak know about this?

45
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:53,152
P'Pak is the one keeping all the secrets.

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,290
If Jakchai is punished, P'Pak has to be, too.

47
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:02,185
And who else knows about this?

48
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,013
Hello, Dad.

49
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,480
Oh, what about Nate and Yuth?

50
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
I thought you would invite them to eat together.

51
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,330
I called you alone.

52
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,387
Okay.

53
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,367
Yes.

54
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:36,960
I think Nate would feel embarrassed about losing in the Black Diamond Auction.

55
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:43,170
If you do give me the position of President,

56
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,473
don't humiliate her, Dad.

57
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,430
Please find something to comfort her. I pity her.

58

- Yes?

59
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,406
You know I love you, right?

60
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,587
Yes, Dad. I've always known that.

61
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:08,630
So I did everything to show I could inherit The Legend from you.

62
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,510
And is this the kind of love you give me?

63
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,310
This?

64
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,197
Is this what you call love?

Listen to me first.

67
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,287
I just needed...

68
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,448
I needed security, Dad.

69
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:50,018

70
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,473
Did you do anything else behind my back?

71

72
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,790

73
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
You never gave me any stability!

75
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,267
After one small issue, you called Nate back to be President.

76
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,900
You threatened me!

77
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,930
How could I be sure I would inherit The Legend?

78
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:27,070
All this time, I thought you were smart,

79
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,940
but in fact, you're an idiot!

185
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,321
But it turned out that...

186
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,323
I feel more lonely when I'm actually with you.

187
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,552
So it made me think,

188
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,783
if it's going to be like this,

189
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,102
it would be better not to have you.

190
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,346
I have made a decision, P'Pak.

191
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,643
I will go abroad as Dad said.

192
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,063
I'll start a new life.

193
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,233
I'm happy for you.

194
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,403
Do you not want to stop me at all?

195
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,183
I'm saying this...

196
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,063
I'm telling you,

197
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,800
I won't see you anymore.

198
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,550
Will you be okay by yourself?

199
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,473
Even if I'm not,

200
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,423
I have to do it, right?

201
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:39,683
You never loved me at all.

202
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:44,663
You never once...

203
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:50,010
looked at me with other feelings than pity.

204
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,280
I...

205
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,083
I'm sorry once again.

206
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:13,833
I don't know how uncomfortable I must have made you feel in the past.

207
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:21,623
From now on, I'll become stronger.

208
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,098
You must stay strong.

209
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:34,003
Look after yourself.

210
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:39,743
I wish you all the best.

211
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:13,483
May I talk to you?

212
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,640
Thank you for agreeing to talk to me.

213
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm leaving,

214
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,736
but I'd like to tell you something.

215
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,692
You're the woman that I want to be.

216
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,860
I want to be competent like you.

217
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,472
I want to be great like you.

218
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,880
I really wanted to hate you,

219
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,598
but when I got to know you,

220
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,880
you treated me kindly.

221
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,045
You did many good things for me,

222
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,440
then I realized that

223
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,020
I hated myself.

224
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:29,447
I'm really sorry, P'Rin.

225
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm regretful about everything.

226
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,700
I'm guilty that I hurt you.

227
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,260
I hope I can forgive you one day.

228
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,380
Best of luck.

229
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,840
Thank you, P'Rin.

230
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,320
I've known P'Pak since I was in college.

231
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,651
I thought I knew him well.

232
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,700
I had no idea he could be like this,

233
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,875
both in his work and love life.

234
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,495
I was super stunned.

235
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,517
But Rin was more stunned than I was.

236
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:54,380
I can't believe he would end up like this.

237
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,800
I know, right?

238
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,600
I felt bad, too.

239
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,000
I never thought that they would break up.

240
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,120
I used to think that love was a delusion.

241
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,941
P'Pak and Rin were the only couple who made me believe

242
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,178
that love was real.

243
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,220
I used to look down on people in love,

244
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,239
but deep in my heart, I hoped

245
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,291
it could happen to me one day.

246
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,219
Believe me, love is real.

247
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:53,320
What's this? Why are you holding my hand?

248
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,681
Well, I wanted to create a mood. Won't you fall for me?

249
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,060
Look at them; they didn't end up well.

250
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,820
But it's not everyone.

251
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,238
If you don't believe me,

252
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,940
you can try by dating me.

253
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,980
If you really want to date me,

254
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,900
tell me all of your secrets.

255
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,550
It won't be a secret if I tell you.

256
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,360
I was just joking.

257
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,773
Everything?

258
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:42,580
I can think of one thing,

259
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,630
but you must promise me that if I tell you,

260
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,291
you won't make fun of me later.

261
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,040
Yes.

262
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,326
Okay.

263
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,466
When I was a little child,

264
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,520
I used to weigh a lot.

265
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,880
I looked like this.

266
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:05,357
I told my secret; now it's your turn.

267
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:09,077
You have to tell me yours, no cheating.

268
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,900
I...

269
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
was the same.

270
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,340
Same about what?

271
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,260
Really?

272
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm so glad we have a chance to talk.

273
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,400
I have a lot of plans for developing The Lavish,

274
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:10,898
but...

275
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,520
which department do you want me to manage?

276
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,060
The more I get to work here,

277
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,210
the more benefit it would be for The Lavish.

278
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,349
I know you well.

279
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:25,400
I know that you were like the brains for The Legend.

280
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,740
I talked to the board about you.

281
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,680
They all agreed that you shouldn't manage The Lavish.

282
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,080
Why is that?

283
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,834
I hold enough shares here to manage the place.

284
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,966
I know it well.

285
00:29:46,966 --> 00:29:52,120
I tried to talk to the board about it, but they're worried.

286
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:54,920
They didn't feel right about it.

287
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Excuse me.

288
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
What are they worried about?

289
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,335
If I worked here, I would be a benefit to this place.

290
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,901
I need to be frank with you.

291
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:11,011
We worry you would betray us like you did The Legend.

292
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:13,580
Everyone said that you could even

293
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,140
betray your own father and family.

294
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:22,818
We all agreed that we couldn't take a chance on you.

295
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:24,720
Excuse me.

296
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,256
Pak, you need to call the other executives of The Lavish.

297
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:46,178
There must be someone who can be bought.

298
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:55,071
Why are you standing there? Make a call. Let's get this over with!

299
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:57,080
I think that's enough.

300
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,000
I can't do it anymore.

301
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,380
I'm done.

302
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,573
What did you say?

303
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,373
In the past,

304
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,840
I always followed your orders,

305
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:17,144
no matter how horrible they were.

306
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,490
Still, I never blamed you.

307
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,320
Hey, Pak.

308
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,400
There's no point in realizing those mistakes.

309
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,413
The past is done.

310
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:29,167
We need to move on!

311
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,600
Then I need to move on...

312
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,840
on my own terms.

313
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
Thank you very much.

314
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,157
Pak, you can't leave me!

315
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,640
I won't let you!

316
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Look at me!

317
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,920
This is my order.

318
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,417
While I was working with you,

319
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,321
I never disagreed with your orders, not once.

320
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,820
But this time...

321
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,080
I have to.

322
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,280
Good luck.

323
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,240
Pak... Pak.

324
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,040
Pak!

325
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,300
You can't do this to me, Pak!

326
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,920
You can't leave me like this!

327
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,720
Fine! Go ahead! Go!

328
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,320
Get out of my face, Traitor!

329
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,328
You're drinking a lot.

330
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,180
Shut up. Stop whining.

331
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm here to ask if you have enough to drink.

332
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,760
I can order some more for you.

333
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,236
When I'm not around,

334
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:47,840
you'll have more than enough to drink.

335
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,461
Where are you going?

336
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,100
Are you going on vacation?

337
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,250
I was beat like this, and you're thinking of taking a vacation?

338
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,620
What a wife!

339
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,760
I'll be staying at my father's.

340
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,840
Why is that?

341
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,900
I'll send a lawyer to talk to you next week,

342
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:21,245
and we can settle our divorce.

343
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,640
Wait!

344
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,400
What?

345
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,600
Are you divorcing me?

346
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,460
Are you divorcing me?

347
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,210
Fine!

348
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,725
Go ahead, get a divorce!

349
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:44,320
I've tolerated you enough!

350
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,870
You're so boring and annoying.

351
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,880
All you did was yell and be spoiled!

352
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,580
You're super boring.

353
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,760
A woman like you does nothing

354
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,740
but have her head in the clouds all day.

355
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,380
You think you're above everyone.

356
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,944
Let me tell you something.

357
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:05,074
You can be this way because of your dad's money!

358
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,613
Otherwise, I would have kicked out a useless woman like you!

359
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:09,988
Oh, yes?

360
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:12,248
"A useless woman"?

361
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,800
Let me tell you!

362
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
A useless woman like me

363
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,800
was the one who put you in this situation!

364
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
That's right.

365
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,940
I did it.

366
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,180
What the heck did you do? What?

367
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,500
- How could you this to me?
- Let me go!

368
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm your husband!

369
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,120
How could you do this to me? How?

370
00:35:57,294 --> 00:36:01,660
It's because I have wanted to

371
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,880
divorce you for a long time,

372
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,780
but I couldn't as long as you were useful to my dad!

373
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,100
I couldn't divorce you.

374
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,220
That's why I had to do that.

375
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,540
You have nothing.

376
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,040
You can't bring anything to my dad anymore. You're useless to us.

377
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,700
You're crazy.

378
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,681
You must be so proud...

379
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:35,869
that your lawful wife and mistress...

380
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:39,339
worked together to take you down.

381
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:45,280
But don't worry.

382
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,940
Look on the bright side.

383
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,715
You're still alive, aren't you?

384
00:36:56,507 --> 00:37:00,047
- Stop. You can't just leave me here!
- Let me go.

385
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,887
- You can't leave me like this.
- No!

386
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,220
Let me tell you something.

387
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:18,919
I was once...

388
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:22,293
in love with you.

389
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,300
But... not anymore.

390
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,533
Good luck.

391
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,867
Bye bye.

392
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,720
Let's have some chicken, then we can go to school.

393
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,000
- Chicken!
- Good.

[The Legend, Resignation Letter]

396
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:47,780
Do you want to resign?

397
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,060
If you've thought this through,

398
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,160
you can embrace being a mother.

399
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,540
We're rooting for you.

400
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:03,224
I'll come back to visit.

401
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,260
You can't.

402
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,645
Why can't she come back here?

403
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:15,020
This is not her resignation letter.

404
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,060
[I, Jomphol Meeboonprom, intend to resign from my position.]

405
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:23,652
"Jomphol"?

406
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,700
Jomphol.

407
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,532
What do you mean by this?

408
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:36,040
Why did you change the name on the letter? What trick are you pulling?

409
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,400
Can we talk later? Let me take these to the boys.

410
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,720
This is huge. Let's talk about it now.

411
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,420
Right, the red ones are for Mick, and the green ones for Max.

412
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,140
Don't make a mess.

413
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,240
- Eat up!
- Apple!

414
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,620
Jomphol, wait.

415
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,510
Hey.

416
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,990
I meant to switch the letters.

417
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:14,740
I know you love your job, and it's part of you.

418
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,700
You should continue working.

419
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,540
I don't want you to quit your job,

420
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,060
just because you're a mother and my wife.

421
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,944
You shouldn't have to.

422
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:36,249
I told you that I...

423
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:39,560
You understood me, and that's enough.

424
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,680
It's not.

425
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,340
You should keep your job.

426
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,360
Ms. Treenate is running the company...

427
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,939
and you have a supervisor like Rin.

428
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,860
You must be happy working there.

429
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,940
You're making good money with great benefits.

430
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,770
Don't worry.

431
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,060
I can be a freelancer.

432
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm learning to cook.

433
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,542
So I can work and take care of our boys at the same time.

434
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:22,180
But you're working so it must be exhausting.

435
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,600
Thank you.

436
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
I just want to see you happy.

437
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,820
Why are you crying again?

438
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,580
I'm pregnant (hormones).

439
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,880
Hey, are you hugging?

440
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,100
Let me in.

441
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,500
- Come on... be careful.
- Calm down.

442
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:10,140
You worked at The Legend for such a long time.

443
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,744
Don't you have any other experience?

444
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:14,015
No.

445
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:17,940
But I've tried many things while working at The Legend. I've learned a lot there.

446
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,700
I'll get back to you.

447
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,980
We will contact you later.

448
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,420
I'll get back to you.

449
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:02,107
It's been weeks. Has no one called you?

450
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:04,687
Not yet.

451
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:07,507
I get it.

452
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:11,577
After the scandal at The Legend, no one would want to recruit me.

453
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:14,457
My record is ruined already.

454
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:18,607
Setting the scandal aside,

455
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:23,527
you have done many outstanding projects to show you're good at your work.

456
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:26,807
Someone will hire you.

457
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:28,017
Here you go.

458
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:29,617
Thank you.

459
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,295
Thanks.

460
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:34,967
I'll keep trying. I won't give up.

461
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:41,567
I have some financial plans ready.

462
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:43,727
Just like with my watch,

463
00:43:43,727 --> 00:43:47,107
I sold all of my valuable items.

464
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,474
I'll store money, in case of an emergency.

465
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:53,980
I don't know when I'll get a new job.

466
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:58,087
I understand you.

467
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,927
What about the car?

468
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:04,847
You gave the car to Rin, but how can you live like that?

469
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,407
I wanted to compensate her with something.

470
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:14,687
It's not a lot, but it's what I can give.

471
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:26,427
How is she now?

472
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,607
Cheers!

473
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:33,671
We need to go somewhere after this,

474
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,721
to celebrate the VIP Team's highest sales in 18 months.

475
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,857
Please?

476
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:43,847
Sure, but you must treat (pay) the next round.

477
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,807
What? It should be your treat. How could it be mine?

478
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:51,000
You hit the target,

479
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,847
and the clients rewarded all of you.

480
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:56,247
I'm so jealous.

481
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:58,967
This meal is on me.

482
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:04,487
I would like to celebrate keeping my job.

483
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:08,847
And I want to thank you for your exceptional work planning,

484
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:11,687
which allowed us to generate high revenue.

485
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,927
This is not all about me.

00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:17,407
It's team effort.

00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:20,127
You're the key.

Jomphol said to keep this job

489
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,010
because I have a supervisor like you.

490
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,807
Well, from now on,

491
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,400
let's take VIP Team to the top,

492
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,900
in both revenue and a happy workplace, shall we?

You grew 80% in the last quarter?

Well done.

500
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:08,310
At first I thought

501
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:14,530
that granting menstrual leave would reduce work efficiency.

502
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:16,673
Look at this.

503
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,653
The performance is even better.

504
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:25,393
If we show them we care, they are more willing to work with us.

505
00:46:25,393 --> 00:46:28,653
I can take care of the company,

506
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:32,933
and you should go on holidays or rest.

507
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,275
It's so boring to travel such a long time.

508
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:41,755
I think I should help with work. What do you think?

509
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:46,673
Do you want to help me or find flaws?

510
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:51,973
You're really my daughter. You know me too well.

511
00:46:53,853 --> 00:47:00,273
Well, you can try very hard to find the flaws.

512
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:07,161
But no one can take care of The Legend better than your daughter.

513

I don't want this gift.

- Oh, no!
- That hurts.

- What?
- Hey...

Is this what I think it is?

543
00:49:18,983 --> 00:49:22,523
That's right. I need to tie my shoe laces.

00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:43,086
then I like it.

549
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:49,034
Look at you. Do you like this necklace more than my good intentions?

550
00:49:49,034 --> 00:49:51,703
- I'd better go.
- I'm joking.

551
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,138
You're the best gift... for me.

552
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,813
- This is too sweet.
- What was that? Did you hear?

553
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:04,037
Tell me one more time.

554
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:06,103
- You gave me the gift.
- What?

555
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,008
- It's for me, right?
- Yes.

556
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:11,173
Thank you.

557
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:14,213
So sweet.

558
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:18,585
I have more than one good news today.

559
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,453
Do you remember what day it is?

560
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:22,153
"Today"?

561
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,653
Jomphol?

562
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:31,273
So chubby.

563
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:36,052
Say hi to your aunts and uncles.

564
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:40,453
Jomphol and Meena, your daughter is so lovely.

565
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,343
Her son!

566
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:45,503
- See? You shouldn't.
- Meena just said it.

567
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:50,493
Look at you, Beautiful Mommy.

568
00:50:50,493 --> 00:50:52,956
I just want to look good on a day like this.

569
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:56,266
Thank you for covering my work. I'll go back to work soon.

570
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,716
Don't worry, Meena.

571
00:50:57,716 --> 00:51:00,776
Take your time. We can handle it.

572
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,573
Can I hold him?

573
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:12,393
Her house will be in huge chaos.

574
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:29,346
I think happiness is easy to create.

Come on in.

580
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:28,633
What is it?

581
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:31,973
I want to give you these reports.

582
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:39,833
It's no rush. Look at them when you're free.

583
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,294
I'm quite busy.

584
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:44,169
Is it urgent?

585
00:52:44,169 --> 00:52:45,629
Not really.

586
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,573
- Not urgent.
- I need to go.

587
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:56,337
That was weird.

00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:00,804
Thank you for mentoring me on the work.

591
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:06,258
I'm a manager, but some things are new for me to learn.

592
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:08,333
Please guide me to know new things.

593
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,413
You can tell me about it. Don't be shy.

594
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:15,653
Sure, but I heard you used to work in a big mall.

595
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,946
Why did you change your field?

596
00:54:17,946 --> 00:54:20,619
Something happened.

597
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,810
I made personal mistakes,

598
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,650
and I didn't want to return to the same spot.

599
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,753
Thank you so much.

600
00:55:24,247 --> 00:55:28,060
Rin, are in the neighborhood?

601
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,495
That's right. I had to drop something off for my clients.

602
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,280
P'Pak, did you move here?

603
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,820
That's right.

604
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,037
I have to go. I need to finish work.

605
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,020
I'm coming.

606
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,820
Mom. Hello.

607
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,180
Here.

608
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,340
Why didn't you say you'd come?

609
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,320
I was at the market and bought you something.

610
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,620
Rin came to see me.

611
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,640
She's still nice to me.

612
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:03,740
She said that if you're too busy,

613
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,720
I could call her up, and she would take me out.

614
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,796
It's quite shameful.

615
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,840
It's my fault.

616
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,509
I ruined everything...

617
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,148
with my own hands.

618
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,980
It's too late...

619
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,700
to fix anything now.

620
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:45,105
She asked me to give you this.

621
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,280
She said it's money from selling your car.

622
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,460
Hello, Rin.

623
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,260
Yes, P'Pak?

624
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:47,620
Mom gave me the check.

625
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,680
Thank you for thinking of me.

626
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,720
But I want you to keep this.

627
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,800
I said I would give you the car.

628
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,620
Well, it's your car.

629
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,772
You don't have to feel bad or think of it too much.

630
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:09,082
- But...
- It's for my own peace.

631
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,060
I need to hang up now. A client is calling.

645
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:23,120
he mentored me and was so kind to me.

646

It's a new field for me.

01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:33,920
I heard VIP Team achieved a better performance than when I was there.

662

You're skilled at this.

all I could recall were the awful things you did to me.

674

675
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,740
that we had so many good memories together.
