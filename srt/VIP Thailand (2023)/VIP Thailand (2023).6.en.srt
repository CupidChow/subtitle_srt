[Baby]

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,926
Hello? Rin?

10
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:29,766
Are you free tomorrow morning?

11
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:34,249
I have something to tell you.

12
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,272
Sure.

13
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:44,872
Of course.

14
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,711
Did P'Rin call?

15
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:12,226
You seem fine.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,100
I should go.

17
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:40,058
Please don't leave me.

18
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,319
Please don't go anywhere.

19
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:49,477
I know that I shouldn't do this.

20
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:55,187
I know how nice Rin is.

21
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:16,614
I've never wanted anyone else's man before in my life,

22
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:20,759
but I never want to lose you.

23
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,280
Please don't go anywhere.

24
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,183
There's nothing wrong, correct?

25
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:48,226
She's doing better now. The doctor let her stay here so she's safe now.

26
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,424
- Thank you.
- Of course.

27
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,306
Meena?

28
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,106
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

29
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,343
I'm okay.

30
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,060
I...

31
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,160
About your pregnancy...

32
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,980
Okay, okay.

33
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,041
We'll talk later. Let's just calm down.

34
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,604
I'll get a doctor for you.

35
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,025
You can push the call button here.

36
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,934
At the next general meeting of shareholders,

37
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:04,571
I would like to request everyone's cooperation

38
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,380
to remove Mr. Chokchai as President.

39
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,852
Did you have to move in here?

40
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,554
I think this has gone too far now.

41
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,713
You asked me to lie to P'Rin for you last time.

42
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:40,966
I thought you had handled it already.

43
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,003
Are you out of your mind, Hia (Older Brother)?

44
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:47,813
Don't tell me that you'll take that woman for real this time.

45
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,843
It's nothing like that.

46
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,366
So?

47
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:56,240
What is it, Hia?

48
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,866
I know that people make mistakes,

49
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,826
but there has to be a better solution than this.

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,483
What did you see in her? Why did you become like this?

51
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,466
I'm dropping Lalita off, Sir.

52
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,266
Don't worry.

53
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,300
Hello?

54
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,626
What did you say?

55
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,293
Come and say goodbye to Dad.

56
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,366
What the heck are you doing here?

57
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:56,426
You told him?

58
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:59,793
Get out of here! Go!

59
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,054
Calm down.

60
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:07,286
My family was ruined due to you and your mother.

61
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,719
My mother was in pain because of your mother!

62
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,326
You shouldn't have been born!

63
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,770
- Stop it! Calm down!
- Let me go!

64
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,263
Stop! Please stop.

65
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:22,969
Our dad is dead. At least, let him say goodbye.

66
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,226
Dad is dead; is this the end of it?

67
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:28,163
Will our family be free from sorrow?

68
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:34,066
A mistress' son like you should never have been born!

69
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,300
Get out of here! Go!

70
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,586
Get the heck out of here!

71
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,717
Go away, you swine!

72
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:42,744
Get out of my sight!

73
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,426
I think you should go inside.

74
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,443
You could get sick.

75
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,686
If you want to talk to someone,

76
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,963
you could talk to me.

77
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:29,093
I'm here for you.

78
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,846
Every time

79
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,903
someone asked me about

80
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,506
my father,

81
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:54,384
I would tell them

82
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:00,825
that my dad was dead.

83
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,288
The truth is...

84
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,768
I'm the son of his mistress,

85
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,649
just like you.

86
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,603
I've never told anyone about this,

87
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,383
not even my wife.

88
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,650
Rin has no idea about this.

89
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:43,696
I've always thought

90
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:48,163
that if something happened to my father,

91
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,736
I wouldn't feel anything.

92
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:00,233
When the day came,

93
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,903
and something really did happen to him,

94
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,866
I...

95
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,003
I'm here.

96
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,400
I think...

97
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,064
everyone has a secret they don't want to share, Hia. Everyone has one.

98
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:55,504
If one day they decide to share that secret or tell someone about it,

99
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,414
I think that person should be their wife,

100
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:01,543
not their mistress.

101
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,103
I think we need to talk.

102
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,493
I can't live like this.

103
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:38,680
You have to tell me the truth.

104
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,523
I think we need to talk about this, too.

105
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,663
Let's start with you.

106
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,100
Who's that hussy?

107
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:50,783
She's a pitiful person.

108
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:57,048
Her life has been a struggle since she was young.

109
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,866
So you just pity her?

110
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,920
That's right.

111
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,863
It started that way.

112
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,063
I don't know

113
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,933
how it turned out this way.

114
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,233
Rin,

115
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:24,926
when I met you for the first time

116
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:28,526
and when we spent our lives together,

117
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,863
I was very happy.

118
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:35,223
I miss...

119
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,744
our future of growing old together.

120
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,866
That was so wholesome.

121
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,583
I was very happy,

122
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,923
but I destroyed it all.

123
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,503
I am the one destroying it all.

124
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,107
Rin...

125
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,926
I think...

126
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,700
we...

127
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,183
we should end this.

128
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,583
Are you breaking up with me?

129
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:49,490
Are you breaking up with me?

130
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,743
Why?

131
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,633
I'm really sorry.

132
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,133
I...

133
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,566
I...

134
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:23,346
It's...

135
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,666
You...

136
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,606
You're breaking up with me to be with her?

137
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:35,186
- Is that right?
- Listen to me.

138
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,506
Is that right? Why would you do that?

139
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:39,583
It's not like that.

140
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,713
Stop!

141
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,333
Stop it!

142
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,741
I realize that you know

143
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,492
what I did...

144
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,583
is so dreadful.

145
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,633
I know that you can't accept it.

146
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,584
It's like a broken glass.

147
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:33,305
We can't fix the broken glass, no matter how hard we try.

148
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:37,104
It won't be the same.

149
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,896
I'm the only one getting hurt from the glass, not you!

150
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:47,198
Don't you think I wanted to say that? I really wanted to, but I couldn't!

151
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,640
Because I love you!

152
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,493
I thought I could get through this!

153
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:56,444
I thought of our good times together over the past years.

154
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,244
What about you?

155
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,778
How dare you break up with me?

156
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,747
Am I not good enough? Am I nothing to you?

157
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,602
No. You're the most important person to me.

158
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,664
I know how lucky I am

159
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:16,545
to have I met you...

160
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,425
that I fell in love with you.

161
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:24,245
It's me.

162
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,063
I'm ruining it all.

163
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,506
So you wanted to break up with me?

164
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:42,681
I will be the one to decide if we break up.

165
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,781
You have no right to do it.

166
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,502
Tell me.

167
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:54,403
Who is that witch?

168
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,306
Just tell me already!

169
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,344
Please calm down, Rin.

170
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:16,273
Rin, Pak! What are you two doing?

171
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:17,600
Hi.

172
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,647
Mom?

173
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,324
I brought lots of food.

174
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,540
I...

175
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,945
I'm here.

176
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,500
This is stewed black chicken in Chinese herbal soup.

177
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,806
Rin, you need to eat more.

178
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:49,747
I cooked a lot of it. I put some in the fridge too.

179
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,280
You will have plenty ready.

180
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,180
And then,

181
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:58,326
you can drink the Chinese herbs after this.

182
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,506
People said that after drinking this,

183
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:06,146
your blood will flow, and you'll get stronger.

184
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:07,733
You need to drink this

185
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:12,083
so you can get stronger and give me a grandchild.

186
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,820
Let's dig in.

187
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,807
We need to eat it while it's hot.

188
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,846
- Sure.
- Let's eat.

189
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,226
Mom, I have something to ask you.

190
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,926
Tell me.

191
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,003
What do you do if someone you love has betrayed you?

192
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:40,923
Rin, why are you asking me this all of a sudden?

193
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:50,423
It's about my friend, my best friend.

194
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:54,293
- It's not me.
- Oh my.

195
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:57,998
You gave me a heart attack. Look at my goosebumps.

196
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:00,755
You need to clarify earlier next time,

197
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,193
if it's not about you but your friends.

198
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:06,128
Oh my, I was about to have a heart attack.

199
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,638
What happened to your friend?

200
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,068
Her husband is having an affair.

201
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,384
She was staying because she hoped it would get better,

202
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:24,096
but when she confronted her husband,

203
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:29,033
he said he wanted to break up with her.

204
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,935
How about this?

205
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,980
You should tell your friend

206
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,440
that when people hurt us,

207
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,363
Karma will come and get them later.

208
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:50,944
Do you think that he would be happy with another woman?

209
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:55,585
Do you think he'll be happy every day for the rest of his life?

210
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,506
I can tell you that it won't happen.

211
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,423
It's going to be okay. Just talk to your friend.

212
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,352
So I was thinking...

213
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,888
what if it happened to me?

214
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:15,666
Hey!

215
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,286
There's no way it will happen to you.

216
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,190
My son...

217
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:26,224
won't cheat on you for sure.

218
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,620
Isn't that right?

219
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,066
Hey.

220
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:38,785
You need to promise me right now that you won't cheat on your wife.

221
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:47,177
Say it so your wife will be happy.

222
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:51,813
Sure.

223
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,424
I won't make

224
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,983
her unhappy.

225
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,904
Did you hear that?

226
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,818
- Yes.
- If one day my son

227
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:11,126
ever cheats on you, then you need to tell me.

228
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:14,865
I'll take care of him!

229
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,863
You'll see.

230
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:22,503
Come on, don't be sad. We need to cheer up to eat.

231
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:27,026
You need to eat more and drink some Chinese herbal tea.

232
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,760
It's not going to happen to you.

233
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,880
Thank you.

234
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,367
Let's eat. I hope it won't be too cold.

235
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,424
Here, have some.

236
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:48,666
- Pak.
- Yes?

237
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,744
I think you both look too stressed.

238
00:23:57,013 --> 00:24:00,340
It's about work. It's nothing much.

239
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,674
Can't you just let it go?

240
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,313
About your work and your office?

241
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:09,403
You need to forget about work when you're at home.

242
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:12,013
I'll try.

243
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:20,166
Earlier, when your wife talked about being betrayed by loved ones, I was stunned.

244
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,583
I thought you did something to make her upset.

245
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:31,723
You didn't do anything like your dad, did you?

246
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,017
Hey,

247
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:45,974
your dad used to promise me that he would break up with that other woman.

248
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,603
And he never did it.

249
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,866
I...

250
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:58,484
was labeled as a mistress my whole life,

251
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,911
until I gave birth to you.

252
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:11,803
You should understand this feeling well.

253
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:17,523
How much it would hurt if you were cheating on someone.

254
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,186
Mom,

255
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:35,694
I don't want to make mistakes... like Dad.

256
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:43,760
I'd like to see you build a good family

257
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
and a happy one.

258
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,163
Don't make any mistakes like me.

259
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,640
Got it.

260
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,450
[Receipt]
[Date: April 25]

261
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,500
[Yuda]

262
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:04,284
"Yuda"?

263
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Who's that?

264
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,073
Ouch! It hurts.

265
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,473
Pain!

266
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,500
Mom?

267
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,103
It hurts so bad.

268
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,273
How did you get here?

269
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:57,161
Is this your new room? How could you live here?

270
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,583
I can walk by myself.

271
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,493
What are you doing here?

272
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:05,473
You don't have to do that.

273
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,833
Stop that.

274
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,386
Let me do it.

275
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,386
Mom!

276
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,943
Oh! Mom!

277
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,334
You're here to ask for money, aren't you?

278
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:21,444
I have no money for you! I'm completely broke!

279
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:26,960
Do you know how exhausted I am?

280
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,801
I had to give all of my hard-earned money to you.

281
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:31,364
It's gone. It's all gone!

282
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,126
Do you know...

283
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,493
how exhausting my work is?

284
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:41,240
I almost got fired!

285
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,340
Do you know why?

286
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,033
I stole something from work.

287
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:50,600
I wanted to sell it, to give you the money!

288
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,503
Do you understand now?

289
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,760
I...

290
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:59,705
- You had to do that.
- That's right!

291
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:04,846
I warned you already about your stupid overseas market trading!

292
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,866
It's a new type of Ponzi (fraud) scheme.

293
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:09,109
I warned you. I warned you!

294
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,009
How did it turn out?

295
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:12,751
Look what you did.

296
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,540
You caused all of this!

297
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,143
If you're not going to help me with anything,

298
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,220
and you're only here for money, then leave.

299
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't have any. I can't give you any more money. It's gone.

300
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,503
It's all gone. There's nothing left!

301
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,523
Actually,

302
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:44,713
I just wanted... to see you

303
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:47,364
and help you unpack today.

304
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,223
I wanted to see how you were living.

305
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:56,024
I wasn't here to ask for your money.

306
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,065
I'm sorry...

307
00:30:21,376 --> 00:30:24,144
for putting you in this mess.

308
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,620
From now on,

309
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:33,823
I won't cause any more trouble.

310
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,243
Take care.

311
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:47,306
Wait.

312
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:02,207
I'm sorry.

313
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:06,558
I'm sorry about the way I talked to you. I'm sorry.

314
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,477
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,886
Where's the patient who was admitted yesterday?

316
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:41,726
What's her last name?

317
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:43,586
It's Meena Meeboonprom.

318
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:45,951
"Meena Meeboonprom"?

319
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,803
She didn't spend the night. She left last night.

320
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,733
Are you sure?

321
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:58,433
I'm sure.

322
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:02,547
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

323
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:07,161
I heard that you just got out of the hospital.

324
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,784
Yes, but I'm okay now.

325
00:32:14,953 --> 00:32:17,059
Did you get the clip?

326
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:22,123
If you give me the clip,

327
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,560
you'll be promoted.

328
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,403
You could earn more money as we discussed.

329
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,800
It won't be traced back to me, right?

330
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,258
You don't have to worry about that.

331
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:42,906
No one will know that you recorded this.

332
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:44,903
I'll take care of you.

333
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,013
You need to think hard about your future.

334
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:53,895
A lady with great potential like you can still grow.

335
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,939
You can send me the clip now.

336
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,160
I already did.

337
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,730
[The Legend]

338
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:05,664
Everyone?

339
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:08,946
I heard some shareholders left the party, is it true?

340
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,328
What really happened?

341
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,046
Don't keep quiet.

342
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:18,820
Come on, reveal it. I won't tell anyone for sure.

343
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,561
I don't think you should know about this.

344
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,966
Why is that? Share with me, please.

345
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,833
- Rin.
- Yes?

346
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,560
Can you get some product info from the reseller for me?

347
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,570
I have an urgent meeting.

348
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,464
- Lita.
- Yes?

349
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:40,034
You ought to go with Rin in case she needs your help carrying something.

350
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,483
I can go instead of Lita.

351
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:48,613
How can you? You still need to finish the task I gave you.

352
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,740
But it's due tomorrow, isn't it?

353
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,033
Let me help Rin for today, please.

354
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:56,893
Besides, you said we may need to carry things.

355
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm a man. I should be doing this job instead of Lita.

356
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,183
I don't think it would be that heavy. Lita could do it.

357
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,615
- But...
- Saint!

358
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,480
Meena is on sick leave today. You should stay here to help her.

359
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,520
Lita can come with me.

360
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,020
Let's go.

361
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,446
Saint.

362
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:22,946
Yes?

363
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,280
Okay.

364
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:50,156
Why did you want to go out so bad?

365
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:53,706
Normally, you wouldn't be this eager. You complained about the hot weather.

366
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:56,646
I thought it should be a man's job.

367
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:59,586
I thought Lita wouldn't be fit for this task.

368
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,852
Are you sure about that?

369
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,686
Are you hiding something from me?

370
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:05,653
It's nothing more.

371
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,153
Saint!

372
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,066
You're hiding something from me.

373
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,940
I can tell.

374
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,960
You have a crush on Lita, haven't you?

375
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,663
You don't seem too eager to help anyone but her.

376
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,140
You have a crush on her, right?

377
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:40,083
Do you know whom she is?

378
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:43,900
You do? And you still have a crush on her?

379
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,463
Oh my! I can't believe you.

380
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,546
You're way overthinking.

381
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:54,693
Don't worry about that. It won't happen, that's for sure.

382
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:59,443
Someone like me won't have a crush on someone like her.

383
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:08,123
I should get back to work. Talk to you later.

384
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:39,863
Lita, come on.

385
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,353
Lita!

386
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:46,503
Are you okay?

387
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:48,706
Let me see.

388
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,183
Sit down. Let me see your wound.

389
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,951
- I'm fine.
- It's okay.

390
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,240
Does it hurt?

391
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,866
I'm sorry, P'Rin.

392
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:19,477
I shouldn't have done that.

393
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
You're sorry?

394
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,704
About what? You didn't do anything, Lita.

395
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:33,204
I mean...

396
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,480
I should have been more careful.

397
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,723
You're not talking about your fall, are you?

398
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:48,240
If it's the auction, it's over now.

399
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,626
It's already over so let it go.

400
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:53,966
But you can't let it happen next time.

401
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:57,609
Montira must have been really hurt so she reacted like that.

402
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,546
Actually,

403
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,506
you shouldn't have confronted something like that.

404
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,940
Let's go.

405
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,349
I'm sorry.

406
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:17,903
About what?

407
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:22,468
Let's go. Let me help you.

408
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,966
Hello?

409
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:39,839
What happened to Mom?

410
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,400
Mom?

411
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:47,485
Why did her condition get worse?

412
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,085
There's high pressure in her lungs.

413
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:53,805
So her condition's getting worse. She needs to be monitored closely.

414
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,192
Will she get better?

415
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:59,648
I can't promise you that.

416
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,864
Excuse me.

417
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,360
Mom?

418
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,536
Please be okay.

419
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:24,069
You need to get better...

420
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,831
and stay with me.

421
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,953
Please?

422
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:53,873
I think you should stay here and take care of your mom.

423
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:56,493
I can take care of this task myself.

424
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,304
It's okay.

425
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:03,950
The doctor will be monitoring my mom anyway.

426
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:09,332
I forgot to bring my stuff. I'll go and get it quickly.

427
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,627
[Mrs. Yuda Kusolcharoensuk]

428
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,930
I'm holding this party today because I'd like to request cooperation from everyone.

429
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:41,710
At the next general meeting of shareholders,

430
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:45,011
I would like to request everyone's cooperation...

431
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,640
to remove Mr. Chokchai as president.

432
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,412
Is this necessary?

433
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,679
Does my brother really want to remove my dad?

434
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,790
There's more.

435
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:08,796
He wanted the chairman to be removed, and he brought his mistress to the event.

436
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:12,866
Mr. Jakchai isn't as smart as I expected.

437
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:17,299
Watch your mouth.

438
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,870
He's still my brother.

439
00:42:22,113 --> 00:42:24,367
He did something bad,

440
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:27,395
and he needs to learn his lesson.

441
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:36,291
Both my brother and the VIP team will be ruined for sure.

442
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:53,310
- Can you please sign here?
- Sure.

443
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:07,140
Saint?

444
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,021
- Yes?
- Is something bothering you?

445
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:11,601
I caught you watching me so many times.

446
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:13,822
What's going on?

447
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:17,398
I respect you so much.

448
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:24,270
Did you know that you're one of the reasons I wanted to be part of this team?

449
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,260
You're good at your job, good with your team,

450
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,680
and a nice husband.

451
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,260
You said these compliments.

452
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,034
What do you want?

453
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,695
I just wanted to tell you that...

454
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:48,040
I don't want you to destroy my good impression of you.

455
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,041
One more thing:

456
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,770
I don't want you to hurt your wife.

457
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:58,130
What do you mean by that?

458
00:43:59,164 --> 00:44:01,250
Did you hear something?

459
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:07,756
I think you know what you've done.

460
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
P'Pak?

461
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,440
What's going on?

462
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,467
Rin?

463
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:48,368
I feel like everyone is giving us weird looks, don't you think so?

464
00:44:54,517 --> 00:44:56,317
Hello? Prae?

465
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,591
How did it leak?

466
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:12,860
It smells like garbage.

467
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,830
Designer brand clothes like these don't suit you.

468
00:45:26,628 --> 00:45:30,769
But it's not the aroma of the wine, it's your scent.

469
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,058
Come on, let's drink.

470
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:56,927
Hello?

471
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:59,200
Did you leak the clip?

472
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,279
You need to calm down, Meena.

473
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:04,061
How could I? People are sharing it around.

474
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,429
They will search for the person who leaked it.

475
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,580
I told you that you won't be in trouble.

476
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,010
You need to trust me, Meena.

477
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:33,570
Khun, do you want to drink wine with me?

478
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,629
What the heck are you doing? Do you have any idea what is happening?

479
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:43,483
Of course, I do. That's why I bought this 1987 Château Margaux for you.

480
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:45,993
Many people are sharing the clip.

481
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:49,119
I'm afraid this wine would be in high demand.

482
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:53,033
Aren't you ashamed to have done that?

483
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:54,404
Why would I be?

484
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:58,107
People praised me for being cool and brave.

485
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,330
I did what any lawful wife would do.

486
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,430
Did you leak the clip?

487
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,707
I would have loved to, but it wasn't me.

488
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:17,967
When you find out who leaked the clip, don't forget to tell me.

489
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,487
I'll reward them generously.

490
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,509
Hello?

491
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:40,259
Yes?

492
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:42,160
I got it.

493
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Right. I'm sorry.

494
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,714
We can't say anything right now.

495
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,277
Right. I'm sorry.

496
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:54,193
- Saint?
- Yes?

497
00:47:54,193 --> 00:47:55,167
How is it?

498
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:59,172
I don't know how it started. It has gone viral already.

499
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:03,575
We couldn't find the source.

500
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:07,393
All of our VIP clients called to cancel their appointments as well.

501
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:10,270
I have no idea how this will end.

502
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:18,317
Our VIP clients are mostly lawful wives. I don't think they're pleased with this.

503
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:39,967
Lita, you can go home now.

504
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,580
If anyone calls or reporters try to contact you,

505
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,292
don't say anything, do you hear me?

506
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,207
Okay.

507
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:11,850
I'm sorry about this, truly.

508
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,292
I'm leaving now.

509
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:35,047
All right, let's get back to work.

510
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,613
We need to solve this.

511
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,120
It's not just the clip.
[The Legend]

512
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,921
People edited the wine-splashing footage to make memes (trends) on various sites.

513
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:54,993
They're digging into who Lalita is and where she comes from.

514
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:57,632
How she became Mr. Jakchai's mistress.

515
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,763
Mr. Jakchai got called out as well.

516
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:05,688
They blamed him for hiring his mistress to work closely with him,

517
00:50:05,688 --> 00:50:07,967
and his wife found out about this.

518
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:10,501
If his scandal keeps trending,

519
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:14,353
the shareholders will soon pressure my brother to resign from his position.

520
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:16,993
This is to maintain the company's good image.

521
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,321
When should we leak the clip where Mr. Jakchai...

522
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:28,578
mentions the removal of Mr. Chokchai from the president position?

523
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,873
Hold that thought.

524
00:50:34,873 --> 00:50:37,907
There should be an organizational restructuring soon.

525
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:42,793
My brother will do whatever it takes to become president.

526
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,285
When that time comes,

527
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:47,177
when he reaches his highest point,

528
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:54,108
I'll be the one to push him down

529
00:50:54,108 --> 00:50:56,671
and wake him up from his sweet dream.

530
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:27,188
Have a seat.

531
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:34,750
Tomorrow will be the first time in many years

532
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,150
that I'll see The Legend's shares in the red (losses).

533
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,560
I'm really sorry.

534
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,653
I'll fix it soon.

535
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:50,486
I promise you that all will come back to normal.

536
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:53,670
Do you think a man who can't control his woman

537
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,990
will be able to succeed me?

538
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:02,893
That's fine.

539
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:08,814
I'll watch you fix it.

540
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:15,956
Oh, I almost forgot.

541
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,226
I have one question.

542
00:52:19,226 --> 00:52:23,166
Why was there a party for shareholders after the auction?

543
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:26,016
And why didn't I know about it?

544
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:31,410
It was just a small party. It's nothing.

545
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,627
So I didn't tell you about it.

546
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:38,733
Many shareholders bid for diamonds so I hosted a party to thank them.

547
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:44,325
Are you sure that there was nothing more?

548
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:48,516
There was really nothing more.

549
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,598
[A furious lawful wife pours wine on the mistress' head.]

550
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:25,633
[A woman, who prefers leftovers, deserves it.]

551
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:29,904
[Both of them are trash. They're meant for each other.]

552
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:33,343
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

553
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,043
Come here!

554
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,993
- Good.
- A mistress like you deserves this.

555
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:46,213
- That's right.
- It's what you get for being a mistress!

556
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,846
Hi! Hi.

557
00:53:51,846 --> 00:53:54,960
Can I get a picture?

558
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:58,756
- Did you get it?
- I'm filming it.

559
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,930
- What it is each month, do you understand?
- Yes.

00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:36,966
Hello, Ms. Nonthaphorn, what can we do for you?

561
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:40,414
There was a viral clip of wine being poured on someone.

562
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:42,003
Do you know about it?

563
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:46,176
How could your team send someone like her to take care of us?

564
00:54:47,373 --> 00:54:51,914
I'm a shareholder's wife, and you know that, right?

565
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:54,864
Where is that girl?

566
00:54:56,786 --> 00:54:58,586
Hello.

567
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:05,462
I'm glad that you're here. Where is the girl?

568
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:07,333
She was suspended.

569
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,653
We're deeply sorry for what happened.

570
00:55:10,653 --> 00:55:12,527
Was she only suspended?

571
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,793
She should have been fired!

572
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,667
If this is how it is,

573
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:20,651
and you still support that girl,

574
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:24,456
then I won't shop here anymore.

575
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,090
[The Legend]

576
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,699
Come on in.

577
00:55:46,629 --> 00:55:48,026
Rin?

578
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:49,339
Can I have a word with you?

579
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:50,541
Sure.

580
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:54,249
This morning, a shareholder's wife came here and yelled at us

581
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:57,223
for sending Lita to tend the party.

582
00:55:57,223 --> 00:56:00,033
She said we should fire Lita.

583
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:03,396
I think it's time to mention it to Mr. Jakchai.

584
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:30,542
You should get the call.

585
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:45,093
Hello?

586
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:47,962
Can you come to see me?

587
00:56:57,544 --> 00:57:00,330
Trends come and go on social media all the time.

588
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,996
Don't worry about it.

589
00:57:08,253 --> 00:57:10,726
Are you at the hospital?

590
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:13,196
Can I talk to the nurse?

591
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,013
Hello? That's right.

592
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:22,594
I'd like to know about Mrs. Yuda's condition.

593
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:24,694
How is she?

594
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,530
[Receipt: Description]

595
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,239
"Yuda"?

596
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,070
[Name: Yuda]
[April 2023]

597
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:50,070
There must be something more...

598
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,653
In P'Pak's car.

599
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:36,033
We have a new member joining our team. Her name is Lalita.

600
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:39,418
Hello, everyone, I'm Lalita.

601
01:00:39,418 --> 01:00:41,746
You heard what they said about Lalita, didn't you?

602
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:43,573
What is the real story?

603
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:47,713
You're working closely with Mr. Jakchai. You should know something.

604
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:52,177
If there's any way I can help, let me know.

605
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:59,046
You're breaking up with me to be with her? Is that right?

606
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:02,298
- Why would you do that?
- It's not like that.

607
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:06,836
I'm sorry, P'Rin.

608
01:01:06,836 --> 01:01:09,196
I shouldn't have done that.

609
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:12,361
You're not talking about your fall, are you?

610
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:50,357
Lalita?

611
01:01:50,357 --> 01:01:53,123
The girl who got splashed with wine in the clip, right?

612
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:56,140
Is she Pak's mistress?

613
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:04,123
He told me that I wouldn't know his mistress.

614
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,830
He told me that it's over already.

615
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,450
I started to suspect P'Pak was lying to me.

616
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:13,580
When I saw the dashcam clip,

617
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,549
it hurt so bad.

618
01:02:20,822 --> 01:02:23,006
I've always liked that girl.

619
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:27,377
I didn't care if she was called out as the vice president's mistress.

620
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:30,007
I didn't care about all that.

621
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:31,963
Wait.

622
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:36,350
Pak is having an affair with the vice president's mistress?

623
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,370
What a mess!

624
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,408
I'm not sure about that.

625
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:46,289
But I'm sure that...

626
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:49,758
he's cheating on me with that girl.

627
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,700
How could she do that to me?

628
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:57,580
She acted as if nothing happened, right in front of me.

629
01:02:58,517 --> 01:03:04,521
How could she betray me behind my back?

630
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:15,297
You can't drive back home like this.

631
01:03:15,297 --> 01:03:17,090
I'll give you a ride.

632
01:03:17,683 --> 01:03:20,043
I understand that right now...

633
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:22,283
you really need something like this.

634
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,590
Rin?

635
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,616
But you know that...

636
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,402
when you sober up and regain your mindfulness,

637
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,482
your pain will return.

638
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:45,590
You need to choose if you want to keep living like this...

639
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,209
or end this relationship.

640
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,440
I'll talk to them both.

641
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,583
So it can come to an end.

642
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,958
End it.

643
01:04:18,276 --> 01:04:19,676
End it.

645
01:05:26,203 --> 01:05:29,290
Meena, are you back to work?

646
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,877
You never returned any of my calls.

647
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:32,790
You didn't even text me back.

648
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,770
It's weird that you acted this way.

649
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,660
I told you that I'm not having an affair with P'Pak.

650
01:05:40,956 --> 01:05:45,021
I forgot something in the office the other day. I came back to get it.

651
01:05:55,357 --> 01:05:59,564
Then I saw P'Pak and Lita together.

652
