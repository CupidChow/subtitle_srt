00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:15,100
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:22,260

[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

8
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,570
Thanks, Babe.

9
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:22,370
Last night, someone sent you a text.

10
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,887
Yes?

11
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:33,730
Did it wake you up?

12
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:42,450
Maybe they're selling something.

13
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:49,400
Do you want to have a look?

14
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:16,090
Did you set up a password for your phone?

15
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,760
Someone at the shop did it for me.

16
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,227
I never knew that you had a password for your phone.

17
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:29,637
What's the password?

18
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,390
It's 0000.

19
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:02,870
Do you remember your promise when we decided to spend our lives together?

20
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,404
Of course, I do.

21
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:14,447
Let's go over there.

22
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,159
What are you holding?

23
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,191
Let's go. Where do you want to go?

24
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,210
What are you holding?

25
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,830
Actually, I prepared a speech for you,

26
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,171
but I forgot it all.

27
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:48,052
I know I shouldn't say much since I don't have a lot to offer you.

28
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,462
But I promise you,

29
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:55,890
no matter how hard our lives are, I won't let go of your hands.

30
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,107
The only thing I can give you is my love,

31
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:09,670
and I promise you that I will cherish our love

32
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,810
until death do us part.

33
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,867
Will you spend the rest of your life with me?

34
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:24,927
I would love to!

35
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:45,530
Time flies; it's been years now.

36
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,653
I'm so glad

37
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:52,075
that everything is still the same.

38
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,760
Is it the same?

39
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,500
You're right.

40
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:00,370
It's still the same.

41
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:05,093
Let's eat.

42
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,020
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

43
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,137
Hey, Rin!

44
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,970
Rin!

45
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,140
Rin!

46
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,632
Hey, watch out!

47
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,527
Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,330
Stop your bike! Stop!

49
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,247
What's going on?

50
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,903
I've warned you so many times.

51
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:38,260
One mistake and a crash could happen.

52
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:42,155
I'm sorry.

53
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,679
I've told you so many times that if something is bothering you,

54
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,882
don't get on the motorcycle.

55
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,988
What is it?

56
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,830
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

57
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:09,587
Please don't tell my dad about it.

58
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:12,127
Of course not. Why would I?

59
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,627
So?

60
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,213
What did he say?

61
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,910
I didn't ask him; I didn't dare.

62
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,293
I-I'm not sure if it's true.

63
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:26,233
It could be some dirty trick at work because other departments aren't big fans of my team.

64
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,627
They could have sent this text to mess with my head,

65
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,993
hoping that it would affect my work.

66
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:34,604
It's good that you didn't tell Pak about it.

67
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,887
Perhaps someone did want to mess with your head.

68
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,527
This could lead to a big fight, right?

69
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,711
Good thinking.

70
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,727
How is your husband?

71
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,970
He's working hard as usual.

72
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:55,968
It's so normal that I couldn't help but think

73
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:59,188
he might be bored of this.

74
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,810
This is the place where I decided to spend my life with him.

75
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:17,130
My feelings back then and now are totally different.

76
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
Rin,

77
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,807
nothing can stay the same forever.

78
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,730
Things change over time,

79
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,480
including you.

80
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,033
Remember,

81
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:41,291
you don't even know if this is true.

82
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,230
I'm scared.

83
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,986
I'm scared that it could be true.

84
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,130
Everyone whom I've ever loved

85
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,790
has left me.

86
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:05,453
Do you think he will leave me?

87
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,543
If this were the case,

88
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,470
what should I do?

89
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,187
What about this?

90
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,727
Do you remember Chet?

91
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,389
He's my friend's nephew. He's good with IT (Information Technology).

92
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,133
I'll ask him to check the number that sent you this text.

93
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,310
We can figure out who sent it.

94
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Stay strong.

95
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,860
Smile.

96
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,960
[Your man's mistress is in your team.]

97
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,775
Meena?

98
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,648
P'Pak?

99
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:44,009
Where are they?

100
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,457
It'd be nice if Jomphol was like this.

101
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,099
I think your husband is cute.

102
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,215
Do you want to switch?

103
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,562
I need to take this call. Excuse me.

104
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,248
It's so late. Who called her?

105
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,288
It could be her children.

106
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,122
But they're in preschool.

107
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,585
They should be in bed by now, her children.

108
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:44,042
Saint, I'm going out for the meeting with our reps (representatives).

109
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,282
- Okay.
- Call me for anything important.

110
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,782
Got it.

111
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,686
I thought the meeting was tomorrow.

112
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:01,119
Rin, I'll have a meeting with the ads team. I need to go.

113
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:23,905
There is no meeting today.

114
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,733
Prae, I need to run some errands.

115
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,497
Follow that car.
[Taxi]

116
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,570
When is my mom coming?

117
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,802
I called your mom; she will be here soon.

118
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,012
Mick! Max!

119
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,995
Here she is. Your mom is here.

120
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:22,575
There, there. Come here.

121
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,822
Come on, please sit down.

122
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,535
Tell me, you're the older brother.

123
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,255
Why are you crying like your little brother?

124
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:33,662
I didn't want him to cry alone so I cried with him.

125
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,728
You're late.

126
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:40,002
Then be angry at your dad; it's his turn to pick you up.

127
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:43,045
I need to talk to him when he gets here.

128
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,993
Auntie Rin?

129
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,885
- Hello.
- Hello.

130
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,674
About my purchase, please keep this...

131
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:34,455
I understand, Sir. This will be confidential.

132
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:40,105
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

133
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,482
Phol was supposed to pick them up this week,

134
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:58,323
but his car broke down, and our babysitter wasn't available.

135
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,702
So I needed to pick them up before I finished my work.

136
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,202
Rin,

137
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,582
I'm sorry. Please don't tell anyone about this.

138
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:13,175
It's not a problem. Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,715
I...

140
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,035
People think my workload is lighter than everybody else's

141
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:20,526
and that I only care about my family.

142
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,213
What are you doing here, by the way?

143
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,105
Were you secretly following me?

144
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:38,475
I happened to be running some errands in the area.

145
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,853
- Mick, Max, my children!
- Dad!

146
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,075
Hello!

147
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,281
Daddy!

148
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:50,188
Let's go. Why are your clothes so messy like this?

149
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,917
We just had ice cream.

150
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,373
Rin.

151
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,925
I'm here.

152
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,955
Are you angry?

153
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,016
I'm sorry.

154
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:06,142
Please, don't be angry.

155
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:09,636
Let me carry it for you.

156
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,570
Let's go home.

157
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,309
Well,

158
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:16,035
my car broke down. I didn't mean for it to happen.

159
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,250
You didn't mean for it to happen?

160
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,342
I told you to get it fixed so many times.

161
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:24,068
Now it's not working when you need it.

162
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:26,395
She is nagging me again.

163
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,252
Come on, let's go home. We can talk later.

164
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,455
Please, let's go.

165
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,355
See you later.

166
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,905
Let me carry it for you.

167
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,325
My car isn't working.

168
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,798
Let's go.

169
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,328
Let me help you with that.

170
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:16,399
Otherwise, you'll say I didn't help out.

171
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,453
Should we take a look at a dishwasher?

172
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:23,357
They are not too expensive.

173
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:25,440
Then you don't have to keep doing this.

174
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,510
I bought something for you.

175
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,481
I heard you kept complaining about it.

176
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,740
Here you go, your new iron.

177
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,127
You said that the old one didn't work very well

178
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,440
so I got you a new one.

179
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,250
This is the newest version; it works really well.

180
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,653
- A new iron?
- That's right.

181
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:04,080
You look exhausted.

182
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,450
When you're exhausted, you get a moody face.

183
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:13,647
Do you want to quit your job?

184
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:16,707
I can work for both of us,

185
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,997
and you can be a full-time mom.

186
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,233
Then you won't be this exhausted anymore. What do you think?

187
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,880
You're better at taking care of them than I am.

188
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,020
I think our children would like it.

189

Excuse me. Please wait for me.

Thanks.

196

I'm Chanont. You are...

Are you dating anyone?

201

I think you are because you're so hot.

202
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,904
That's okay. Can I have your number?

203
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,434
You think I'm dating someone, yet you still want my number?

204
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:53,694
What kind of person are you? You're messing with someone's girlfriend.

205
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,572
Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:01,623
I'm sorry. I thought that you forgot your wallet and I...

207
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:05,381
Do you think I forgot my wallet just to flirt with you?

208
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:06,859
I think you've watched too many dramas.

209
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,927
I didn't say you were flirting with me.

210
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:12,161
Even though you weren't flirting with me,

211
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:14,744
I still want to get to know you.

212
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,856
Can I have your number?

213
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:25,134
Please? Just your number.

214
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:27,207
Think of it as...

215
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:31,481
a reward for the good guy who returned your wallet.

216
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,081
Please?

217
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:41,704

I don't want Rin to be hurt anymore like this.

226
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:05,584
We shouldn't keep meeting like this.

Can you take a look at this?

00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:44,284
Why did Mr. Jakchai need you last night?

230
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:47,421
Was it something urgent?

231
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,847
It's nothing special.

232
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:53,384

Nont is calling.

236
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:11,861
I forgot that I need to talk to him about work.

237
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,484
You can take your lunch break now.

238
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:43,274
Nong May, can you tell P'Nont that my team's papers are here?

239
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:47,204
Sure, but it will take a few days for him to take a look.

00:30:47,204 --> 00:30:48,564
Why is that?

241

He is going to Singapore.

Is he going to Singapore?

243
00:30:56,997 --> 00:31:00,267
Yes, he went last night.

He should be back in three days.

- Yes?

- Have you seen P'Pak?
- Yes, he just walked out a minute ago.

I'm okay. I-I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry.

You weren't?

252
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:11,654
Staring at your phone isn't safe.

Mr. Jakchai asked me to meet with a new client.

257

He seems to call you for work all the time lately.

258
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,977
I know. I think he must be busy.

259

What about Nont?

260
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,317
Is he back from Singapore already?

261
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:21,117
I went to his department, and they said he just went to Singapore.

262
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,087
That's right.

You shouldn't keep thinking about this. Someone could have sent you that text to mess with you.

00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,338
I'll be back.

365
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:09,114
Here.

366
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:11,980
I picked up a wallet for you last time,

367
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,227
and this time, I got your binder.

368
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:18,838
I think you should give me something in return.

369
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,894
Thanks.

370
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,617
Is that it?

371
00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:33,435
Do you want my number again?

372
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:37,445
No, I don't want it anymore. You'll mess with me again.

373
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:39,245
This time, I'd like...

374
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:41,507
Hello.

375
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,348
Your Line ID.

376
00:42:43,348 --> 00:42:45,200
Hey!

377
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,541
Wait for me. Please?

378
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,467
Just your Line ID.

379
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:53,760

00:42:58,027 --> 00:42:59,940
Don't use that as an excuse.

383
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,660
You should send me emails if it's about work. My Line account is for personal use only.

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,337
Do you think you can do anything to women just because you're a man?

385
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:13,818
Why are you angry at me?

386
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:20,587
It's okay.

387
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:23,038
They will fix it.

388
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,979
- Help!
- Hey!

389
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,026
- Help! I'm stuck in the elevator!
- Calm down.

390
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:36,946
- You need to calm down. They'll fix it.
- Don't touch me!

391
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,880
Are you okay?

392
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:49,895
Can somebody hear me? I'm stuck here!

393
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,495
Hey.

394
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,647
Hey. Are you okay?

395
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:20,747
Hey.

396
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:24,164
Are you okay? You're fine, right?

397
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,238
Hey.

402
00:44:42,754 --> 00:44:44,154
Hey?

403
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,303
I got you something from Singapore.

404
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,994
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

405
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:05,714
You shouldn't have. You were on a business trip.

406
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:10,334
You didn't tell me when you would be back.

407
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,720
Oh, come on.

408
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,537
I really wanted to, but I was so busy. Everything was a rush.

409
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:18,258
I didn't have time to tell you.

410
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:23,079
You couldn't tell me, but you could tell P'Pak?

411
00:45:24,814 --> 00:45:26,964
Are you angry?

412
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:31,127
Fine, you're his favorite "brother."

413
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:33,947
You two have been so close since you started working.

414
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,407
You are so close to him that if my husband had any secrets,

415
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:42,538
you would help him cover up, right?

416
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,235
What are you talking about? What secret?

417
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:51,742
Your husband wouldn't dare to keep anything from you.

418
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:55,720
I guess you're right.

419
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:59,426
If I found out, I would be so angry.

420
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:02,406
You know that...

421
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:06,277
I hate to be betrayed the most.

422
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:11,597
I know it. I know it well.

423
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,147
Right,

424
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:19,774
are you close with Prae?

425
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:21,695
What is she like?

426
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,538
She seems so upset all the time.

427
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,587
She's a serious person just like that.

428
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:29,737
Just don't get on her nerves (irritate).

429
00:46:31,394 --> 00:46:33,760
I didn't.

430
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,991
I just asked for her Line ID.

431
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:43,943
Perhaps she was upset at me because I asked for her number when she was at a hotel.

432
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,797
"A hotel"?

433
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,774
It's not like that.

434
00:46:52,774 --> 00:46:55,334
I went to the hotel to give something to my friend.

435
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:58,634
And I saw her.

436
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:03,077
She's hot and cute so I talked to her for a bit.

437
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,492
How many days ago?

438
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:11,635
Two nights ago, I think.

439
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:13,335
Why do you ask?

440
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:25,187
Where's Prae?

441
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:29,097
She's on a "mstery shopper" mission.

442
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,620
What's a "mystery shopper"?

443
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,500
It's when we visit the store, acting as a client,

444
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,654
to check on shop assistants as they're working,

445
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:43,814
to see if they treat clients like we expect them to.

446
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:08,007
We have VIP cards so we don't have to wait in line.

447
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:10,607
Don't you think we would stand out too much this way?

448
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:13,134
That's why we have to dress like this.

449
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:17,397
The sales assistants would see us as the client's followers (personnel) anyway.

450
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,494
Excuse me.

451
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:05,840
This dress costs ฿250,000 ($6,900).

452
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,577
You have to be more careful when touching it.

453
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,971
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

454
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:30,274
Excuse me, a follower needs to be more careful than this.

455
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:32,654
Don't make any noise and disturb other clients.

456
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:34,414
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

457
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:35,800
Good afternoon, Ma'am.

458
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,791
I'll pay for it. I'm sorry about that.

459
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,640
It's totally fine.

460
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,714
It's nothing. I'll ask someone to clean this up.

461
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,705
Okay, thanks.

462
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:46,405
Are you sure that you're fine?

463
00:49:49,956 --> 00:49:56,107
Excuse me, I heard of a special bag for VIP card holders, is that right?

464
00:49:56,107 --> 00:49:57,614
Do you still have it?

465
00:49:57,614 --> 00:49:59,015
We don't offer that anymore.

466
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:00,794
Can I have the special bag?

467
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:03,195
- Sure, how many?
- Just one.

468
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:05,395
I'll get it for you; I'll be right back.

469
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:08,255
Well, this is a limited offer.

470
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,434
We offer the bag to our clients only.

471
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:12,982
The bags are not for followers.

472
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:18,127
But the condition clause says that any VIP card holder can get one.

473
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:19,954
This must be your first time here.

474
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:22,515
You're welcome to take a look around.

475
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:24,496
But don't disturb our clients.

476
00:50:24,496 --> 00:50:29,127
If you don't plan on buying anything, please leave.

477
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,697
Do you think that I don't belong here?

478
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:40,431
I'm sorry, you're just someone's follower.

479
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:43,696
You shouldn't talk back to me and disturb our clients.

480
00:50:43,696 --> 00:50:45,296
Wait.

[The Legend: Assistant Manager, VIP Team]

482
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:57,440
I received a report that a sales assistant at this branch often looked down on clients.

483
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,341
I received the report a few months ago,

484
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,280
right after you were hired to work here.

485
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,691

487
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:16,380
Did you know that the client who dropped the glass...

488
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,337
is our Black Diamond VIP client?

489
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:24,938
Your disgusting behavior caused tremendous damage to our company!

490
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:31,278
No matter what, you should have treated all our clients equally.

491
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:35,227
Got it.

492
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:39,277
I'll write another report to the head office about your behavior.

493
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:54,154
Thank you.

494
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:02,440
Your conversation with that shop assistant earlier...

495
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:06,125
was so cool.

496
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,260
"Cool"?

497
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,445
I felt pathetic talking like that.

498
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:16,997
I told her to treat all clients equally.

499
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,966
The truth is that...

500
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:23,991
I just protected the VIP clients with high-spending volume.

501
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:28,994
There's no such thing as equality.

502
00:52:33,674 --> 00:52:35,702
This is not something new.

503
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,206
Money is the most important thing.

504
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:47,497
I started working when I was in high school.

505
00:52:49,455 --> 00:52:52,186
So I had to save up.

506
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:57,117
I mostly ate instant noodles.

507
00:53:01,342 --> 00:53:07,559
One day, I fainted while at work.

508
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:14,713
The doctor said I was suffering from malnutrition.

509
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:19,919
The only thing I could think of...

510
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:24,646
was how I could earn money for my treatment.

511
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:30,600
So money is most vital to me.

00:53:34,248 --> 00:53:35,701

Are you sure that's what's on your mind?

518
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:07,280
What kind of coffee maker is she? Why do her clothes have so many stains?

Do you think she would dare to come out and tell us off?

00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,714
We were speaking truth.

524
00:55:22,714 --> 00:55:24,894
But she knows Mr. Jakchai.

525
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:28,267
I dare her. I'll tell Mr. Jakchai's wife about her.

526
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:30,860
I'll tell her what's going on in the company.

00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:25,625
[Should we meet today? I need to talk to you.]

543
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:09,678
[Okay.]

544
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,492
P'Pak, can you come with me?

545
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,813
Rin, where are we going?

546
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:22,796
Babe?

547
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:25,679
It's office hours. Where are we going?

548
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,285
Why did you bring me here?

549
00:59:57,502 --> 01:00:01,291
Our VIP client, Mr. Phongsak,

550
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:04,076
used his discount privilege to book this hotel many times.

551
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:09,762
I checked, and it turns out the guest wasn't him but a woman.

552
01:00:09,762 --> 01:00:12,242
He also booked this restaurant.

553
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:18,625
I'd like to confirm if Mr. Phongsak really used the service here.

554
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:21,999
I don't want anyone to take advantage of our client.

555
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,700
Okay, why didn't you tell me beforehand? Let's go.

556
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:42,049
I checked.

557
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:45,456
There's proof of his reservation here.

558
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:47,496
It's the table over in the corner.

559
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:01,637
It's not Mr. Phongsak.

560
01:01:03,156 --> 01:01:06,573
Is she trying to use his special service here, or is she his secretary?

561
01:01:06,573 --> 01:01:08,762
She is not.

562
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,181
I have met his secretary.

563
01:01:19,402 --> 01:01:21,429
Mr. Phongsak is here.

564
01:01:49,153 --> 01:01:51,780
He spent time with another woman here.

565
01:01:52,682 --> 01:01:55,816
His wife is a really nice woman.

566
01:01:55,816 --> 01:02:00,697
If she found out her husband cheated on her, she would be in deep sorrow.

567
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:05,647
I don't know what I would do if it happened to me.

568
01:02:06,482 --> 01:02:09,260
I don't know if I could handle it.

569
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:19,907
Let's go home together. You don't have to get your car from the office.

570
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:22,967
- Let's go.
- I need to meet Mr. Jakchai.

571
01:02:26,936 --> 01:02:28,922
Right now?

572
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:31,566
That's right. You should go home.

573
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:36,339
Go to bed if you are tired. It's okay. Don't wait for me.

574
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,299
Let's go. I'll walk you to your car.

575
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,319
Drive safe; I'll see you at home.

576
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:32,159
[I'm on my way.]

577
01:04:18,196 --> 01:04:19,696
Hello?

578
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:22,596
Where are you?

579
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:39,356
Hello, Rin?

580
01:04:39,356 --> 01:04:41,642
What's up, Babe? Is everything okay?

581
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:43,494
Where are you?

582
01:04:45,162 --> 01:04:48,916
I'm with Mr. Jakchai in a restaurant.

583
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:51,890
Are you still with him?

584
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:54,995
That's right.

585
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:59,238
He had too much to drink. I think I need to give him a ride.

586
01:05:00,536 --> 01:05:03,919
If it's too late, you should go to bed first.

587
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,310
Hello?

588
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:10,981
Babe?

589
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:27,110
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

590
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:34,370
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

591
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:41,570
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

592
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:45,170
♫ Please understand again ♫

593
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:52,520
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫
