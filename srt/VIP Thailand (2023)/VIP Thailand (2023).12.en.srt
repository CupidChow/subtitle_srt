[Driver is on the way, 11 minutes]

00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,625
Thank you for letting me change clothes.

11
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,840
You're still burning up.

12
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,087
Let me prepare the herbal medicine for you.

13
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,520
It's still warm.

14
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:29,160
Thank you for making me the medicine.

15
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,744
It's okay.

16
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:41,824
In the past, when I was sick, my mom also prepared Chinese medicine for me.

17
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:47,207
It wasn't just the medicine,

18
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:50,584
it was the care that she gave me as well.

19
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,807
The driver I called must be here

20
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:12,464
so I'd better go.

21
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,307
Let me see you out.

22
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,594
Rin.

23
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,721
Please come in.

24
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:58,284
Sir.

25
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:08,524
What am I supposed to do with you guys?

26
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,334
I forbade you. I scolded you.

27
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:16,201
I took your condo key card, yet you still meet each other here?

28
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,341
Really?

29
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,574
Why, Lita?

30
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,501
Are you so horny that you can't resist it?

31
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:22,954
Why are you so shameless?

32
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:25,594
Sir, it's not like that.

33
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:28,934
I wasn't feeling well so Lita brought me medicine,

34
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:32,539
but it's raining so her clothes got wet.

35
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,314
I just let her change the wet clothes.

36
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,744
It's not lust as what you think.

37
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:46,731
The love and care for P'Pak really came from my heart.

38
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,531
Stop talking.

39
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,844
You are shameless.

40
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,754
You're saying you love P'Pak while standing in his wife's house,

41
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:04,264
and his wife is standing right here.

42
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,344
I knows it's wrong,

43
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,712
but when I was sick lately,

44
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,815
did anyone take care of me besides P'Pak?

45
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:19,887
If P'Pak is sick,

46
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,354
I just want to help him the best I can,

47
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:26,124
the same way that he did for me.

48
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,804
Even if people think that I'm a tramp,

49
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,741
I don't care.

50
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,794
What?

51
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,694
You don't care?

52
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:41,524
Don't you care? Come here. Come here.

Wake up!

56
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,907
- Sir, don't do this.
- Do you have sense, now?

57
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:04,247
Wake up, Lita!

58
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,947

59
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:09,284
You too, Pak.

60
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,727
I've already told you, haven't I?

61
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:14,564
Control your women!

62
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,844
Let's go home. Come here.

63
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,581
Let's go.

64
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,261
Go.

65
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,804
Have I told you before?

66
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,581
No matter how much you love each other,

67
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:44,124
you should go to Hell together.

68
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,674
Rin.

69
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,224
I didn't ask her to come here.

70
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:54,681
I didn't really bring her here.

71
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,164
You look a lot better.

72
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,181
I was told you were sick

73
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,854
so I was worried about you.

74
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:06,924
I checked the CCTV camera. I worried if you were okay home alone,

75
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:12,844
but Lita's medicine is really good. It made you look so much better.

76
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,004
Rin, can you listen to me?

77
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,904
I didn't bring her over here.

78
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,384
I really didn't tell her to come.

79
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:25,984
I know.

80
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,524
You weren't the one who brought her here,

81
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,704
but how did she enter this house?

82
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:39,244
You opened the door for her to come in.

83
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:43,924
Just like you let her enter our relationship!

84
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,164
Clean it up...

85
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,807
like you used to take care of Lita.

86
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,005

Come in.

89
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,667
If you want to discuss yesterday, I've already dealt with Lita.

90
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,687
This kind of incident won't happen again.

91
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,487
No.

92
00:08:56,527 --> 00:09:01,177
I have other matters that I need to bother you with.

93
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
What?

94
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,487
I don't think the company is being responsible enough regarding Prae.

95
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,654
Danai has already been fired.

96
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:21,020
Nate will find her a lawyer. What else do you want?

97
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,017
Prae should receive compensation.

98
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:30,115
Don't forget that when Prae was harassed, it occurred in the workplace.

99
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:35,697
The company should be responsible for how she was treated.

100
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,727
Wouldn't that be a bit too much?

101
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,657
It's too little actually.

102
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:44,477
Compared to what Prae encountered, and the sorrows she's been carrying for a year,

103
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,320
I think the company's employees will also see that

104
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,170
we truly care to solve problems.

105
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:58,347
There is another thing too.

106
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:06,420
I'd like you to increase the welfare for all female employees,

107
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,043
the right to take menstrual leave.

108
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,987
Look, every employee is eligible for 30 days sick leave a year.

109
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:18,347
If you have menstrual pain, just take sick leave.

110
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,254
Why would you ask for more leave?

111
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,004
This is clearly unfair to men.

112
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,387
Well, men don't have uteri.

113
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,100
If you permit it,

114
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,737
people will see that our company really understands women,

115
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:37,527
but if you think that I'm asking too much,

116
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,852
I'll talk to Ms. Treenate instead,

117
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:42,414
about everything.

118
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:45,054
Are you threatening me?

119
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:46,520
No.

120
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,260
I just want you to know that even without you,

121
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,590
I still have another way.

122
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,967
Wait, Rin.

123
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:26,697
You shouldn't threaten him like that.

124
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:34,577
Mr. Jakchai does whatever he wants. He doesn't care about anyone.

125
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,665
Thank you for your concern,

126
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,250
and thank you for having an affair with Lita

127
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,870
so I can threaten Mr. Jakchai with that.

128
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,354
Thank you.

129

Adding maternity leave.
[Special Policies for Women on the VIP Team]

133
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:11,798
There's menstrual leave too.

134
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:16,585
If you have postpartum depression (after childbirth), you can consult a psychiatrist for free as well.

135
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:20,534
The VIP Team piloted (led) it. How great!

136
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,457
I'll have my department submit the request, too.

137
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,297
It must be Rin who presented this to Mr. Jakchai.

138
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,347
It's probably her.

139
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:32,234
But it is strange.

140
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,677
Why was it implemented so quickly?

141
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:37,494
Come on.

142
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:40,347
The company is aware like this.

143
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:46,280
I think in the future, they should add a gender equality policy, not just men or women.

144
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,827
The LGBTQ+ staff in my department aren't few.

145
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:54,500
Right, I think this is good for the company.

146
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,914
When employees are physically and emotionally fine,

147
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:01,177
they'll perform better at work.

148
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:03,767
I've thought about it.

149
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:08,302
Guys who take care of their girlfriends with menstrual pain must have a hard time.

150
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:11,477
It must be stressful for them.

151
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:15,934
You spoke so well. Do you have a girlfriend already?

152
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,547
Just a crush on someone.

153
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,594
Don't say it. Others will know your secret.

154
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,197
Stop it.

155
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,147
Come in.

What's the matter?

158
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,807
I want to praise you.

159
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,200
I saw your new policy for the VIP Team.

160
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,020
Other departments are interested in this and asked to do it, too.

161
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,994
Who proposed it?

162
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,394
Rin?

163
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,437
It's my team. Can I not figure it out myself?

164
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,368
Why are you being so nosy?

165
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:03,861
A good policy and a good attitude toward women?

166
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,724
Is this to your credit?

167
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:10,167
Although you know a lot about women,

168
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:15,317
you'll never understand a woman's heart.

169
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,517
Are you being pressured by women from the VIP Team?

170
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,527
I was once oppressed by men.

171
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:31,437
I felt like an idiot.

172
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:37,621
I would like to see men being treated that way, too,

173
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,681
to see how they'd feel.

174
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,937
Perhaps it's like

175
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,247
being castrated. Am I right?

176
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,967
- Nate.
- Yes, it is.

177
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,357
Rin pressured you, right?

178
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,516
So why did you do it?

179
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,797
Or is it due to Lita?

180
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,037
What do you mean?

181
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,937
Nothing.

182
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:13,147
I see you have a daughter.

183
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,747
Maybe now you understand the heart of a woman, that's all.

184
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,680
Why?

185
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:23,037
Is there something more?

186
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Nothing.

187
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,537
What are you doing here?

188
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:53,920
This way.

189
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,502
Go ahead. Take care of it.

190
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:13,240
What are you doing?

191
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,021
I can't let you stay here by yourself anymore.

192
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,514
Hooray! We're finally under the same roof, Lalita.

193
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:37,907
I should celebrate this special occasion. Whom should I call?

194
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,732
What about Rin?

195
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,934
I heard you two have been getting closer lately.

196
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,227
You went to the man's house, right?

197
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:46,248
Wait, did I get the wrong term?

198
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:49,189
I should call it shameless.

199
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,944
I didn't ask for you to love Lita,

200
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,701
but can you just leave her alone?

201
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,892
I won't touch her.

202
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:02,958
I want to know how a father like you would raise

203
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,617
his own child.

204
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,220
Your room is next to mine

205
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,141
so I will know when you go out.

206
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:23,022
Is it that necessary?

207
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,213
And why might it be?

208
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,344
Don't say you're about to sneak out to see Pak again.

209
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:29,816
You can't control yourself, can you?

210
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,553
Do you miss him that much?

211
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,436
I tell you, don't do anything stupid.

212
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,367
Just control yourself!

213
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,437
Wait until Rin is out of the picture.

214
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,704
- Prae?
- Rin.

215
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,220
I brought you something.

216
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,999
What's that?

217
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,451
Human Resources Department told me they're working on compensation for my assault case.

218
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,911
Is it because of you?

219
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:24,071
Did you do that for me? And the menstrual leave?

220
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:28,217
It must have been you who went to Mr. Jakchai.

221
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:29,748
That's right.

222
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:35,330
You know what he's like.

223
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,991
He wanted to move you to Phuket.

224
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,002
What you did...

225
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:45,255
I'm so happy to see it.

226
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:49,066
If not for you, I would have resigned due to Danai.

227
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:53,158
Mr. Jakchai has never done anything as our leader.

228
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:56,139
He deserved it.

229
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,710
I can't help it.

230
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,201
Someone like him deserved it.

231
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,514
But you should be careful.

232
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:10,115
You should take me along next time, do you hear me?

233
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:14,817
I want to see how he reacts.

234
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:19,897
Let's go to work.

235
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:22,388
- Sure, I'll be there.
- Let's go.

236
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,420
Thank you.

237
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,130
[The Legend]

238
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:02,880
I want to throw this away; you don't have to follow me.

239
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,781
It's Mr. Jakchai's order.

240
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:08,092
We need to follow you until you're home.

241
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,524
Why did my brother order something like that?

242
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:20,014
Why did your father order someone to watch you so closely like this?

243
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:22,206
Is everything okay?

244
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:30,596
He must be worried about my safety.

245
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,400
Worried about you?

246
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,739
He made you move suddenly too.

247
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,914
How are you feeling?

248
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:44,415
Did Mon do anything to you?

249
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,856
You can tell me, Lita.

250
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,952
You can tell me anything.

251
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,171
It's okay.

252
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:55,934
I can talk to Dad about some of it.

253
00:20:55,934 --> 00:21:02,379
You know your father doesn't care about anyone but himself and his needs.

254
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:10,815
It's your life, Lita.

255
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:13,061
You need to decide.

256
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,560
I understand you the most.

257
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,120
No one understands a daughter like her dad.

258
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,627
She's my daughter. I take care of her.

259
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:30,558
If you'd like to take care of someone, find a husband and have children.

260
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,418
Although, I think it might be too late since I doubt any man could stand you.

261
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,680
Right.

262
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:45,100
Women desire different things in life.

263
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,897
I don't need a husband or child to fulfill me.

264
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:56,153
What can truly fulfill my need is to know that everything at The Legend

265
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:59,000
belongs to me.

266
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,074
Lita.

267
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,556
Let's get out of here.

268
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,130
[The Legend]

269
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,534
I think this blazer suits you well.

270
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:38,014
You could wear it to the company's anniversary.

271
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,307
This blazer is perfectly fitted.

272
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,754
It can make you look stylish.

273
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:45,755
It's a good combination of masculine and feminine.

274
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:49,236
You can see the glittery fabric.

275
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,502
When worn, it shines in the light.

276
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,290
This would make you look outstanding.

277
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,481
I really like it.

278
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,722
Few people know me this well.

279
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:08,057
I'd like you to work by my side.

280
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:13,159
Thank you for the opportunity,

281
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,680
but I'm busy with my work in the VIP Team.

282
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,571
You know what I mean.

283
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:23,418
I'd like you to leave your team.

284
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:31,861
I can tell that between you, Pak, and Lita,

285
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:35,398
something is going on, right?

286
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:42,817
I...

287
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,747
I can handle my own matters.

288
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:51,009
Don't forget that if something happens,

289
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,860
my brother will take his daughter's side.

290
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:58,081
If you're here with me,

291
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,443
when you tell me that you have a problem, I can help you.

292
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,997
I...

293
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,985
I'd like to stay with my VIP Team.

294
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,623
To protect him?

295
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,236
No, Ma'am.

296
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:20,725
I love my team.

297
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,094
No matter what happens,

298
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,582
I won't leave them.

299
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:33,320
Are you going to be my enemy?

300
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,203
I have to be on a different side.

301
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:45,810
You're quite something.

302
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,035
I really admire you!

303
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:07,651
Rin?

304
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:16,897
What did you say to my aunt earlier?

305
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:21,414
Why?

306
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:25,905
I...

307
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:29,579
Please don't tell her anything.

308
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,040
Her intentions toward you aren't good.

309
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,060
Whose intentions are good then?

310
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,671
Yours?

311
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,782
Thanks for your suggestion.

312
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,251
Seeing you so jumpy like this

313
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:55,253
makes me really want to know what would your aunt do

314
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,086
if she found out about your affair with my husband?

315
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,047
Please, I beg you.

316
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,618
Please don't tell her.

317
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,579
Please?

318
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:12,750
This is not just about me.

319
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,501
I don't want Pak to be in trouble.

320
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:19,522
Can you do this for him, please?

321
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:23,263
The more you act this way,

322
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:26,464
the more I want to tell your aunt.

323
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:35,375
Wait.

324
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:40,290
You are saying the VIP Team got menstrual leave

325
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,770
because Rin asked Jakchai for it?

326
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,573
She wanted every female employee to get the same thing.

327
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,574
She just needed to start with this team first.

328
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,511
Rin pushed Mr. Jakchai about this,

329
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:58,897
but what if he tries to get back at her?

330
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:11,093
Your one and only daughter told you, didn't she?

331
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:12,754
Rin.

332
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:15,117
What did you say to my sister?

333
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,863
Whatever I said,

334
00:27:19,176 --> 00:27:20,857
do you really think I'd tell you?

335
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:22,654
I'm not your playmate!

336
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:24,461
I was joking.

337
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:30,356
I know what to say and what to keep to myself.

338
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,800
You're a smart woman.

339
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,611
You should be smart enough not to betray me.

340
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,562
Do you want to work for my sister?

341
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,967
I know I'm a smart woman.

342
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:45,918
I'm wise enough not to stay with anyone who treats me unfairly over and over.

343
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:52,084
But if someone annoys me enough,

344
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,397
I could do something about it.

345
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:36,608
Rin didn't say anything to my aunt, did she?

346
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:40,770
- Why did she say?
- If she really did, she wouldn't tell us.

347
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,680
If you didn't tell your aunt, I don't think she would know.

348
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,686
I really didn't say anything to her.

349
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:57,771
I just talked to her briefly before you came in.

350
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,601
I know.

351
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,953
You're stupid about dating Pak,

352
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,145
but you aren't stupid enough to tell my sister.

353
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,499
You may say that P'Pak and I are stupid, but for me, it's love.

354
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,364
"Love"?

355
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:18,010
You watched too many dramas.

356
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,315
Stop saying dumb things like this. It's so annoying.

357
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,957
It's a good thing that you and Pak are dating.

358
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:32,600
Pak knows a lot about me.

359
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:41,858
Now, he must follow my orders.

360
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,760
The problem is Rin.

361
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,560
Rin, wait.

362
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:33,594
Mr. Jakchai told me to give you this.

363
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,490
[Ms. Rinnara Yamonkan: ฿1 million ($28,000)]

364
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,925
Did he want to buy me off?

365
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:57,745
I should have said the amount so I could get more.

366
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,920
What? Are you surprised that I asked for money?

367
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:07,920
I've been hurt enough.

368
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,780
I should, at least, get compensation.

369
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,082
What are you trying to do?

370
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:23,671
Call Lita and tell her to come here and see you.

371
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:29,954
You two should take your sweet time so I can earn more.

372
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:40,952
Rin.

373
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:47,956
Are you really happy doing this?

374
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:54,157
Do you worry about my happiness?

375
00:31:58,055 --> 00:32:02,752
Let me know if you need your cut from the check.

376
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:28,953
- Here.
- Thanks.

377
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:38,458
I know you feel bad about it.

378
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:43,380
Rin was being sarcastic all day; how could you handle it?

379
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,920
It's more than that, Hia (Older Brother).

380
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,021
Deep down, you wanted to go back to her, return to the way you were.

381
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:05,488
I don't know if we can go back to the way we were.

382
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,005
But it would be so great, wouldn't it?

383
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,521
If that's not possible,

384
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,578
and Rin just wants to torture me, then I'm fine.

385
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:24,879
I'll let her do whatever she wants; I can take it.

386
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:29,980
I know that you can, Hia.

387
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:33,448
But for how long?

388
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:37,582
How long do you two need to be like this?

389
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,883
I don't really know,

390
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:47,078
but I need to stay by her side right now.

391
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,759
I need to protect her.

392
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,930
[The Legend]

393
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,630
[VIP Warehouse]

394
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:31,967
Why are they inspecting our warehouse now?

395
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:36,045
As per the schedule, they were to be here in the next few months.

396
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:39,683
Perhaps they want to check everything before the event.

397
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:43,960
Our team takes good care of things. I don't think we need to worry about it.

398
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,660
I see.

399
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:05,548
Excuse me, can you take a look here?

400
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,200
What is it?

401
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,380
The bags on the list have gone missing.

402
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,678
After inspecting VIP's warehouse,

403
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:23,640
we found that two Hermès Himalayan Birkin bags were missing.

404
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,395
They are valued in the millions of baht.

405
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:32,130
No way. We constantly check the inventory,

406
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,590
and all items are waiting to be delivered.

407
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:36,393
They can't go missing.

408
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:40,678
You need an employee ID card to get in.

409
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:43,569
We can check who entered and exited.

410
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,580
We checked that as well.

411
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,979
There was one person who entered the warehouse at 11 last night.

412
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,887
They unlocked the item's safety system.

413
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,795
That person is...

414
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:55,840
Mrs. Rinnara.

415
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:22,747
I didn't take anything from the warehouse.

416
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,483
There is something abnormal about this.

417
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,089
I can also confirm Rin didn't do it.

418
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:32,649
She stayed until late, working overtime.

419
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,940
How can you be so sure?

420
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:40,082
You joined me in visiting a client at that time.

421
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:48,704
You seem to precisely know where he was last night.

422
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:55,110
Rin, I know you're smart,

423
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,966
and you've been working for VIP and The Legend for such a long time.

424
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:05,568
But the evidence points to you taking those two bags.

425
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:08,223
But I didn't do it.

426
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:10,494
If you don't believe me,

427
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,902
we can check the CCTV footage.

428
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,556
Then we can find out who did this.

429
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:19,457
Calm down. We don't need to go through that.

430
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:21,501
I trust you.

431
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:25,279
That's why I'm keeping this a secret.

432
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,202
So the other executives won't find out about it.

433
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,771
But I don't know how long I can cover up for you...

434
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:37,552
because the client will want to receive the bags soon.

435
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:39,543
And this will be investigated.

436
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:41,834
Even if you say that you didn't do it,

437
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:44,775
before the process is finally over,

438
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:47,796
you could be suspended...

439
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:51,580
and you could be fired.

440
00:37:55,428 --> 00:37:57,960
Fire me?

441
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:08,371
What about this? I can help you out.

442
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,912
But you need to transfer out of the city branch.

443
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:17,227
In the meantime, I'll clear everything here.

444
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:18,827
Does that sound good?

445
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,498
I really can't give you access.

446
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,929
Why is that?

447
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:38,650
Why can't I check the footage from yesterday?

448
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,782
There's a new policy requiring a letter from the executive to grant access.
[Information Technology Department]

449
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,034
Hold on, when was this policy issued?

450
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:50,122
The other departments asked to check the footage the other day, and they were allowed.

451
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,462
Mr. Jakchai just issued the new policy.

452
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:55,883
I'm sorry, but I can't grant you access.

453
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:57,383
Excuse me.

454
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,974
Hey!

455
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:07,461
I'll try to check it.

456
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:15,468
It's not her for sure.

457
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,871
Rin didn't steal anything.

458
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:23,052
The sudden inspection

459
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:26,721
and Rin's name appearing on the log-in sheet,

460
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:30,182
I think someone is trying to sabotage her.

461
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:36,143
The only ones who can do this discreetly...

462
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:40,647
are top executives.

463
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:43,629
Which executive wants to sabotage her career?

464
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,875
You tell me.

465
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,967
It's you, isn't it?

466
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,001
You did that, didn't you?

467
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,902
You want to get her out of the way.

468
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,883
To solve what's going on...

469
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:31,548
between me and Lita.

470
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:35,408
It's all my fault.

471
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:39,245
Rin has nothing to do with this.

472
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:43,007
In the past,

473
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:46,080
I made her cry.

474
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,105
She has been hurt enough from me.

475
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,879
Please, Sir.

476
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:58,620
I don't want her to face something terrible like this.

477
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:03,479
Let her go, please.

478
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,140
Please let her go.

479
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:27,357
If you had controlled your women,

480
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:30,508
none of this would have happened.

481
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,616
Rin?

482
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:56,737
Rin?

483
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,442
Rin?

484
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:04,569
How are you feeling?

485
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:07,379
You knew about it, didn't you?

486
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,500
You knew Mr. Jakchai did it.

487
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,501
I asked to see the CCTV footage today,

488
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:19,683
and they denied my request, saying it's Mr. Jakchai's order.

489
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:21,984
He wants to frame me.

490
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:25,284
Did you know about this?

491
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,785
I had no idea, really.

492
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,133
I swear that I didn't know.

493
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:36,093
I didn't know.

494
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:37,987
If I had known,

495
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:42,039
I wouldn't have let Mr. Jakchai do something like that to you.

496
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,882
You know that...

497
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:51,561
I dedicated myself to work to get to this position.

498
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:55,342
Now my hard work is crumbling down.

499
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:59,744
It all started when you cheated on me with Lita.

500
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,465
What do you think I should do?

501
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:08,333
You don't have to do anything.

502
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,225
I'll take care of this.

503
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:15,128
I won't let him do anything to you again.

504
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,012
What will you do?

505
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:22,640
What's your plan?

506
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:27,201
I don't believe you anymore.

507
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,330
♫ If I were to love someone ♫

508
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,850
♫ I would never hurt my heart ♫

509
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,140
♫ Whomever I love, I’ll love only him ♫

510
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,350
♫ So why did you cheat? ♫

511
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:28,600
♫ Why didn’t you stop yourself? ♫

512
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,200
Dad?

513
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:35,263
If this is how you want to help me,

514
00:44:35,903 --> 00:44:38,371
I don't want it.

515
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:43,915
I don't want anyone to be in trouble due to me ever again.

516
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,654
Do you really think the world revolves around you?

517
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:51,035
I can't let Rin work here with us anymore.

518
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:54,069
Sooner or later, she will cause me trouble.

519
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,096
And I won't let that happen.

520
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:59,201
But she didn't do anything wrong.

521
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:02,673
I don't want to hurt her.

522
00:45:02,673 --> 00:45:05,923
You've already hurt her by having an affair with her husband!

523
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:11,194
Stop pretending to be a nice person...

524
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:14,365
and think about this. If I hadn't done it,

525
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:17,119
could you have beaten her?

526
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,478
You never think first.

527
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:22,815
Did you get that from your mom?

528
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:25,409
Stop that.

529
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,820
You can't say that about Mom.

530
00:45:33,574 --> 00:45:35,933
She was a good person.

531
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:39,342
In the past,

532
00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:44,015
no matter how hard we had to struggle,

533
00:45:44,015 --> 00:45:46,424
she never left me,

534
00:45:47,842 --> 00:45:49,906
unlike you.

535
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:53,126
What did you say?

536
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:57,818
I couldn't raise you

537
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:01,389
because your stupid mom got pregnant and didn't tell me.

538
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,470
She thought she could raise a child by herself.

539
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,996
Look what she did.

540
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,080
She raised her daughter to be someone's mistress.

542
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,461
[I can't talk right now. Send me a text.]

543
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:03,780
You are fighting with your dad and not eating dinner.

544
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,222
Such a childish act.

545
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:09,524
Do you think your dad would beg you to eat dinner?

546
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:13,005
You really don't know him.

547
00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:18,845
I'm not in a mood to fight with you today.

548
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:23,106
I'm too tired.

549
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:30,043
Lita.

550
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:41,908
Do you know what kind of person is the most pathetic?

551
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,300
It's a person who can't design her own life,

552
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,918
who places her happiness in someone else's hands.

553
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,645
It could be her man...

554
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:59,844
or her father.

555
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:08,220
Are you telling me I'm pathetic?

556
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,579
I'm not talking about you.

557
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:14,899
From one woman to another,

558
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:19,660

559
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:24,261
Don't be like me.

560
00:49:58,189 --> 00:50:02,040
I created a record of Rin logging into the warehouse.

561
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:06,977
What about the CCTV footage?

562
00:50:06,977 --> 00:50:09,002
I'll delete everything from that night.

563
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:11,919
Rin can't get away from it for sure.

564
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:16,229
I'll let you take care of it.

565
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:17,629
Yes, Sir.

[The Legend]

567
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:41,355
I know Jak is trying to sabotage you.

568
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:43,335
What will you do?

569
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:52,051
I have no idea.

570
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:58,468
Did Pak not help you with that?

571
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:03,419
I don't want to trouble him with it.

572
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:08,601
And I don't think he could help me much.

573
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:12,657
If he really wanted to, he would do it.

574
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:16,643
They both know each other really well.

575
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:20,343
Pak is the one helping out...

576
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,304
Jak with his mistresses.

577
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,264
See for yourself.

578
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:45,288
I hired someone to follow them, and I got these.

579
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,692
Since P'Pak has been Director,

580
00:51:50,742 --> 00:51:53,322
he has been taking care of this.

581
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:57,483
When Jak decides to keep someone,

582
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:01,619
Pak sends them money.

583
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:05,299
If Jak decides to get rid of someone,

584
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:11,160
he uses money to shut them up.

585
00:52:13,306 --> 00:52:15,502
Pak knows everything about Jak,

586
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:18,856
including his work and personal life.

587
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:22,899
There is so much more that we don't know.

588
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:28,298
Pak slept with Jak's daughter,

589
00:52:28,298 --> 00:52:31,739
yet Jak keeps him close. What do you think?

590
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:36,493

591
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:42,001
Where did you get these photos from?

592
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:49,123
Is this why...

593
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:53,073
you're having an affair?

594
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,611
Is this why you dared cheat on me?

595
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:02,872
You think all of this is normal.

596
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:09,273
I can't believe you're helping Mr. Jakchai with his women.

597
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,694
You found places for them to stay. You gave them money.

598
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,355
When he decides to get rid of someone,

599
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:21,869
you're responsible for giving them money to shut them up.

600
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,919
You're living with it. Is that normal?

601
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,782
That's why you did this to me.

602
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:33,615
It's not like that.

I didn't like it.

606
00:54:45,473 --> 00:54:47,453
I was never happy about it.

607
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:50,673
I felt bad every time...

608
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,234
I had to face his women.

609
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,610
I had to pay them off.

610
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,648
I had to tell them to go away.

611
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:04,388
I had to break up with them for him.

612
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:08,606
I never wanted to do it.

613
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,460
Why did you do it?

614
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:13,414
Why did you?

615
00:55:19,558 --> 00:55:22,935
I have to, I need to.

00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,440
How so?

617
00:55:29,923 --> 00:55:33,669
I'm so grateful to him.

618
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:40,174
I have a stable job

619
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,990
and hold a high position.

620

Last night, my husband got the warehouse's access sheet.

00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:22,772
We saw that the access log didn't come from your employee ID card.

719
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:14,633
If you were me, would you do it?

720
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:30,273
So Mr. Jakchai told someone to fabricate something to hurt Rin.

721
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:33,293
Can he do that?

722
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:34,733
Sure, he can.

723
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:36,933
The daughter took her husband,

724
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,013
and the father wants to transfer Rin.

725
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:44,893
Someone like her won't give up easily.

726
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:48,893
What can she do about it?

727
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:52,661
She was pushed so hard.

728
01:05:54,013 --> 01:05:56,296
We can't just stay still.

729
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:58,654
I think...

730
01:05:59,513 --> 01:06:02,193
we need to fight back for her.

731
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:26,573
People can say anything about my daughter.

732
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:31,013
I can ship her off to study overseas. They'll forget it all in a few years.

733
01:06:31,013 --> 01:06:32,822
But you...

734
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,693
If you don't transfer like I suggested,

735
01:06:34,693 --> 01:06:36,733
I won't let this case go.

736
01:06:36,733 --> 01:06:39,153
It'll be in your record for years.

737
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,485
Rin?

738
01:06:48,293 --> 01:06:49,593
Rin?

739
01:07:00,573 --> 01:07:02,576
I called for you...

740
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:04,393
and you got quiet.

741
01:07:04,393 --> 01:07:06,430
So I came here to check on you.

742
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,625
I wanted to tell you not to worry about it.

743
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:16,433
I'll take care of it.

744
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:18,973
I'll resign.

745
01:07:19,893 --> 01:07:21,693
For what?

746
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:24,513
I...

747
01:07:26,413 --> 01:07:28,113
Tomorrow,

748
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:32,290
will you be at the anniversary event?

749
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:37,829
Please let Mr. Jakchai know...

750
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:42,178
I'll give him my answer soon.

751
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,040
Please.

752
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:45,740
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

753
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:52,830
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

754
01:08:52,830 --> 01:09:00,170
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

755
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,750
♫ Please understand again ♫

756
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:11,330
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫

757
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:17,380
