00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,850
How could you do this to me?

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,900
How could you lie to me?

10
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,640
Why aren't you saying anything?

11
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,739
You're not saying anything.

12
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,620
That's your answer, right?

13
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:57,180
I love you so much.

14
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,000
I remember everything about you.

15
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,980
And I sense if you are lying.

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,280
You become silent like this.

17
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,300
Say it!

18
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,880
Why did you come here?

19
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,560
You're here to see your mistress, right?

20
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,547
You're really having an affair, aren't you?

21
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:36,616
If you deny this, I'll believe you.

22
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,920
Just deny it.

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,620
Deny it.

24
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,940
I'm ready to believe what you say.

25
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,690
Rin.

26
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,817
I…

27
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,660
But it was the past already.

28
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,320
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

29
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:39,120
I can't believe this.

30
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,280
You're really cruel!

31
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,143
- Wait.
- Don't touch me!

32
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,443
Rin!

33
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,923
Rin!

34
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,940
Rin, open the door.

35
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,890
Rin.

36
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,443
Can you listen to me first?

37
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:18,043
Let's talk.

38
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,630
Open the door, please.

39
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,483
Listen to me first, okay?

40
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:23,783
Rin.

41
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:27,240
Rin, Rin.

42
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,870
This is Rin, who will join our team.

43
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,050
Let's get to know each other.

44
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,260
Rin, if you have any questions, ask Pakawat. He's the team director.

45
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,977
Please take care of her.

46
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:25,900
Please take care of me.

47
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,957
You two know each other?

48
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:37,340
We attended high school together.

49
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,240
I love you because you are a hard worker.

50
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,760
You're a polite man.

51
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,940
A calm guy.

52
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,700
You may not look like a kind person,

53
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,080
yet you have a warm personality.

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,050
Our VIP concept is to take care of VIP customers.

55
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,183
You have to contact the PR department.

56
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,303
So you won't make a mistake, I prepared the information for you here.

57
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,740
Didn't you write it down?

58
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,130
I won't repeat it.

59
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,897
You want me to talk to the PR team for the event.

60
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,063
I've done this before so I know the process.

61
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:43,820
I'll follow the same plan and see if there's an error.

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,890
Oh, that's not all.

63
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,560
Does your girlfriend like this kind of event?

64
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,560
Why do you ask?

65
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,520
Well, women are our target

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,900
so I want your opinion.

67
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,010
Well…

68
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,180
You don't have a girlfriend.

69
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,370
At that moment,

70
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,760
I fell in love with you.

71
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:31,483
It is useless now! You printed the wrong date.

72
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:36,880
I'll use the sticker to cover the wrong date.

73
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,763
Let me help. Come on.

74
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,397
Sorry.

75
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:06,140
I'll help you so it won't be too late.

76
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,680
I think right now...

77
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,400
you're falling for me.

78
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,423
What?

79
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,950
Right?

80
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,550
Hey.

81
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,290
I'm not.

82
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:33,497
Then why are you embarrassed?

83
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,180
I'm working right now.

84
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:40,343
The only thing I can give you is my love,

85
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:44,817
and I promise you that I will cherish our love

86
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,060
until death do us part.

87
00:08:53,710 --> 00:09:01,160

Rin.

94
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,677
Rin. Let's talk.

95
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:02,790
- No!
- Rin.

96
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,380
No, I'm not ready yet!

97
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,963
- Rin, Rin.
- Don't follow me!

98
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:09,857
Rin. Please listen to me.

99
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,283
The sound is okay now.

100
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,553
Okay, thanks a lot.

101
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,490
Okay, I'll go write a report for this.

102
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,590
Yes.

103
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,070
Rin. What happened?

104
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,600
It's all right. I'm here.

105
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,850
It's okay. I'm here for you.

106
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,548
Just cry it out.

107
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,640
I don't want to believe this.

108
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:44,680
I don't want to believe that P'Pak could do this to me.

109
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:51,420
I don't want to believe that he really has another girl.

110
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,537
It hurts so much.

111
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,520
It hurts so much that I'm almost going crazy.

112
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,957
I shouldn't have followed him.

113
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,095
If I didn't go after him, I wouldn't know he lied to me.

114
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,480
Rin.

115
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,980
Prae, who's like a sister like you, the relationship will break one day.

116
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:27,457
I don't know what to do next.

117
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,640
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

118
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,840
Okay, I'll find out where the text message came from for you.

119
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,480
But if you…

120
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:45,477
If you know the truth, you have to be prepared.

121
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,820
There are only two choices for you:

122
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,570
The first one is

123
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,160
to stay in that painful relationship,

124
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,300
and I don't know how long it will last.

125
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,880
The second choice is to move on.

126
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,500
End the relationship.

127
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,410
But I don't know

128
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,240
which kind of pain you can endure more.

129
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,840
Guys, have you heard about Jack?

130
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,773
His wife caught him having an affair.

131
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:44,703
She went to the ICU already.

132
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:55,453
Isn't Saint here? I've no gossip buddy today.

133
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:59,360
The point is his wife didn't do this,

134
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,210
but it was the mistress herself.

135
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,680
She was angry that the husband and wife didn't get divorced.

136
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,026
Excuse me. Flower delivery here.

137
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:19,713
May I know which one is Ms. Rin?

138
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:21,113
Here!

139
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,433
Thank you.

140
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,403
This is from Mr. Pakawat.

141
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,260
Look, it's your anniversary again.

142
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,363
Pak is so romantic.

143
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,383
That's so sweet.

144
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:07,846
I'd like you all to prepare information about the next project.

145
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,546
We'll have a meeting.

146
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,867
What's wrong with Rin? Why is she acting strange?

147
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,210
Did she tell you something?

148
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,440
What?

149
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,346
And why did she put down the flowers like that?

150
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,383
Isn't she happy this year?

151
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:42,993
Or does she feel bored already?

152
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:47,343
Like getting the same flowers every year, and she wants something else.

153
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:52,621
If you are so curious, why don't you ask Rin yourself?

154
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:56,960
Stop it! Who would dare ask her that?

155
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,340
If she wants to tell us, she will say it herself.

156
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:04,633
Or did she have a fight with Pak?

157
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,533
That's possible.

158
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,293
Right?

159
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,323
Meena, what's wrong? Are you okay?

160
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,060
I'm okay, nothing is wrong.

161
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,123
I just got a little drowsy.

162
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:19,963
I can't believe that we have to be at a company party like this on our first anniversary.

163
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,580
Yes,

164
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,320
and it looks like they won't stop singing anytime soon.

165
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,923
I feel a bit better after walking.

166
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,206
Pak!

167
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:19,743
Have you kept this in your bag all along?

168
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,146
Yes, but...

169
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:24,363
it's all ruined now.

170
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,323
It's okay.

171
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,073
Happy anniversary, Rin.

172
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,573
Yes.

173
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:38,263
Next time, I'll buy you prettier flowers.

174
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:43,653
It's fine, P'Pak.

175
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,263
This is beautiful already.

176
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,060
It smells nice too.

177
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,163
Do you really like it?

178
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,500
Oh, aren't you going home yet?

179
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,720
I just got back from the meeting.

180
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:31,560
Flowers.

181
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,531
So pretty and they smell nice too.

182
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,750
Did P'Pak give you these?

183
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,790
Perhaps the flattened flowers would be better.

184
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:53,960
Rin.

185
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm not nosy in your matter or anything.

186
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,920
I don't know what problem you're having right now.

187
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,363
No matter what kind of flower it is,

188
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:08,463
it belongs to you alone at the end of the day.

189
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,960
I want you to think well if you still have feelings for him.

190
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,423
It might be worth it enough for you to love him.

191
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,363
So excuse me.

192
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,926
Rin.

193
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:40,643
Remember that if you have any problems, you can always call me.

194
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,743
Don't go home late.

195
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:07,100
[Thank you.]

196
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,840
[Let's continue to support each other in the future.]

197
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,983
How did it happen?

198
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:16,263
When did it happen?

199
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,863
Everything that happened

200
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,010
was an accident.

201
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,643
And it's really over.

202
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,634
You don't need to know.

203
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:39,243
It's useless; you would hurt even more.

204
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,443
When you did it,

205
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,446
you didn't even care about me.

206
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,123
And you're just now thinking about my feelings?

207
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:55,643
Was it someone I know?

208
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,223
No.

209
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:10,903
I want both of you to die together right now.

210
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,423
I know I have no right to say such a thing,

211
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,843
but I'm truly sorry.

212
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:40,283
Can I spend my whole life

213
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,651
paying for it to you?

214
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:51,346
Rin. I'm deeply sorry.

215
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,323
Please give me a chance.

216
00:23:57,386 --> 00:24:00,423
I can't lose you like this.

217
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,603
You already lost me.

218
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:08,123
You already lost me!

219
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,983
You said it ended already.

220
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,090
You said it was someone I didn't know.

221
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,493
Is there anything else I should know?

222
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:22,623
Is there anything else that would hurt me more?

223
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,961
No more.

224
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,961
Really.

225
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,730
Are you sure?

226
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:36,631
Or I won't forgive you again.

227
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:45,033
Yes. I assure you.

228
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,060
From now on, we will not talk about this again.

229
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,263
I'll try to forgive you,

230
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:07,303
but I don't know if I can do it or not.

231
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,153
It may take a lifetime of effort,

232
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,053
but I'll do it.

233
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:20,483
I'll trust you for the last time.

234
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:34,571
Don't betray me ever again.

235
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,723
I'm really sorry, Rin.

236
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,420
I'm remorseful.

237
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,163
And thank you

238
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:01,023
for giving me a chance.

239
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:03,546
I'm full of regret.

240
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:27,735
So you... are getting back together.

241
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,960
Yes.

242
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,230
I'll start all over again.

243
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Uncle, Uncle!

244
00:26:42,947 --> 00:26:44,633
- Uncle.
- What?

245
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,047
I found the location of the person who texted Rin.

246
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,047
I'll write it down.

247
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,960
Here you are.

248
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,193
It's over.

249
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,160
You make it clear.

250
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,293
Uncle, it took me a long time to get it.

251
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:15,820
Don't get upset. I'll buy you food.

252
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,993
Go, go. Let's eat.

253
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:20,884
This opportunity is rare. Should I change my mind?

254
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,850
- But…
- Go, go.

255
00:27:57,637 --> 00:28:03,310
[VIP Department, The Legend]

256
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:09,910
It was sent from my computer

257
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:24,250
so someone from my team sent it?

258
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,427
Good morning.

259
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:38,567
Why do you look sleepy today?

260
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,067
I'll go get some coffee for you.

261
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,950
How was Lita?

262
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,193
Good.

263
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:26,647
Everyone in the VIP team is coaching her.

264
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,970
She gets along well with everyone.

265
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,197
You really helped me with everything.

266
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:36,420
What should I pay you with that is worthy of your ability?

267
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:44,407
So how is the preparation for Tifóne's Diamond Auction going?

268
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:48,880
Right now, the VIP team is checking the list of guests who will be attending.

269
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,116
In summary, it's good overall.

270
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,053
About catering, we're currently negotiating with the chef,

271
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,753
but everything else is fine.

272
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:01,060
I guarantee that our guests from Tifóne will be satisfied.

273
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,840
Don't forget to invite all of the shareholders.

274
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,610
What's the matter, Sir?

275
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,771
This company was operated by the old generation a long time.

276
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,110
It's time to make a change.

277
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,253
After the diamond auction,

278
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,630
I will nominate you for the board of directors.

279
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:46,573
Khun (courtesy title) Jakchai, thank you very much.

280
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,540
There is another job I want you to do.

281
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,890
You know that I trust you the most, right?

282
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,870
Don't worry, Sir.

283
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,390
- Get it done.
- Yes.

284
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,647
Let's go. Get in the cart.

285
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:33,853
Hello.

286
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:39,827
Why are you here?

287
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:42,447
I made an appointment with Mr. Jakchai, not you.

288
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,040
Mr. Jakchai wants to break up with you.

289
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,740
I won't.

290
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,753
I'll expose him too.

291
00:32:56,753 --> 00:33:02,050
You know his father doesn't like scandals,

292
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,153
especially a scandal about an affair.

293
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,100
If I leak it,

294
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,510
let's see what the shareholders have to say?

295
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,000
You go back and tell him.

296
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,557
If he dares, let's do it.

297
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:23,704
All your friends at work probably think you have a normal relationship.

298
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:28,804
No one knows you are having an affair with another person's husband.

299
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,533
So what?

300
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,727
I don't care.

301
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:36,087
If you don't care about your friends,

302
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,440
I think…

303
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,145
If your mother knew,

304
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,947
she would be shocked,

305
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:48,281
and her condition could worsen.

306
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:56,270
This is a contract.

307
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,939
[Non-Disclosure Agreement]

308
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:02,070
Please sign it.

309
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,553
Yes, Khun Jakchai.

310
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:53,147
How was it? Finished?

311
00:34:53,147 --> 00:34:54,887
Yes.

312
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,787
Everything is fine.

313
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,693
Great.

314
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,630
You've done a good job.

315
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:04,953
Hey, Tifóne called me today.

316
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:07,556
They complimented your VIP Team too.

317
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:10,693
If the diamond auction goes well,

318
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:14,110
you can immediately prepare to be the youngest executive.

319
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:17,493
Yes, Sir.

320
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,650
[The Legend]

321
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,510
Hello, this is Ms. Rin's desk.

322
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,750
No one is here presently.

323
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Me?

324
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,240
Yes, I'm from the VIP Team.

325
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:30,150
Okay, I'll hurry downstairs.

326
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,327
So it's you.

327
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:36,710
VIP Team support.

328
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:39,650
No one is here

329
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,290
so I have to come.

330
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:50,490
What do you think about my dress?

331
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,450
Will my husband like it?

332
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:01,647
Why are you quiet?

333
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,390
I really don't know.

334
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:19,010
Look in the mirror at your clothes.

335
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,790
Do you want to put my dress on?

336
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,580
You have a diamond necklace?

337
00:38:58,514 --> 00:39:00,757
Did my husband buy you this?

338
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,293
Knowing it's me, you still dare to come?

339
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,740
Go.

340
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:20,893
Go away!

341
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,370
Lita.

342
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:31,047
I'll handle this. Go now.

343
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,490
I'm very apologetic.

344
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:54,030
I thought that girl would get slapped just now,

345
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,227
Khun Montira was so angry.

346
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,570
So it's probably true. That girl was rumored to be the vice president's mistress.

347
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,470
If it were you, what would you do?

348
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,630
Would you forgive your husband?

349
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:31,830
Pretend to act like nothing happened?

350
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,450
Will everything end?

351
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,197
I'd hope both of them rot in Hell.

352
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,210
But it won't happen.

353
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,770
I can only deceive myself that…

354
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:52,630
Whatever happens turns out for the best.

355
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,190
So you would forgive him.

356
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,350
Of course,

357
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:08,590
it's not about you. That's easy for you to say.

358
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:13,530
Pakawat is not like Jakchai.

359
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, not necessarily.

360
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,867
Yes.

361
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:25,753
Pakawat is my husband's favorite person.

362
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,630
"Birds of a feather flock together" (very much alike).

363
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,910
Perhaps these two

364
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,890
might do something behind our backs (secretly).

365
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,887
Let's be honest.

is normal for men.

He has one; he can break up with her, too.

369
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,504
But what follows after that…

370
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,890
It might consume us for the rest of our lives.

371
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:06,450
Every night, I can only think about

372
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:12,810
what else he secretly does behind my back.

373
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:17,310
Is it really over?

374
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,690
Will he hurt me again?

375
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,130
Or is there something more?

Wait!

380

If you have any discomfort, you can talk to me.

I think I've made it clear.

386
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,130
I rejected you last time. You probably understood.

387
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,230
So intense. That's your charm.

388
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,460
If you still flirt with me,

389
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,500
I will sue you for sexual harassment in the workplace.

390
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,500
If you don't want to be embarrassed, stop harassing me.

391
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,430
Wait, Khun.

392
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,945
I didn't harass you. Khun, wait.
- Let go!

393
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:53,450
You two, what's going on? You're in an office.

394
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,693
It's good you're here.

395
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,620
Prae is misunderstanding me.

396
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,287
What misunderstanding?

397
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:02,120
Well, you misunderstood me, saying that I harassed you at work. It's not—

398
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,553
- Isn't it true?
- It's not like that.

399
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:07,353
Okay, maybe you don't like a guy who approaches you first.

400
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,547
But I like you.

401
00:44:08,547 --> 00:44:12,390
Bro, can you confirm with Prae that I am a good guy?

402
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,067
Even if you are a good guy, I still don't like you!

403
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,513
All right.

404
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:20,930
I think for now, don't bother Prae.

405
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,493
Hey, I asked you to help me, not side with Prae.

406
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:27,563
I'll ask Rin for help.

407
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:31,160
The more you do this, the more Prae is uncomfortable.

408
00:44:33,013 --> 00:44:36,373
When we were in school, someone came to flirt with her like you did.

409
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,200
Following her like this, like you.

410
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,433
In the end, she didn't like that guy.

411
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:43,260
In school?

412
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,787
Oh, then…

413
00:44:44,787 --> 00:44:48,810
Don't tell me that you two went to the same school?

414
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,907
Yes.

415
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:00,940
Why didn't you tell me about this?

416
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,080
But that's okay; I'm not one of those guys.

417
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,970
I'm a good man; please assure her.

419
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:19,557

shouldn't you listen to me, too?

457
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:02,423
It all happened because…

458
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:06,910
My mom's business went bankrupt.

459
00:50:09,313 --> 00:50:12,133

No, it's not like that.

00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:21,123
Listen to me.

464
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:29,843
It was a large debt so I needed to find money.

465
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:36,163
Why haven't you ever told me this?

466
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,743
Do I need to tell you everything?

467
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:45,923
Look at my life now. It's at my lowest.

468
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:49,803
So low that I had to do something crazy like that.

469
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,033
Do you know what?

470
00:50:55,393 --> 00:50:58,913
I brought all my brand name things out for sale one by one.

471
00:50:58,913 --> 00:51:02,213
The bags, the necklaces.

472
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:05,473
But no matter how much I sold, it wasn't enough to pay off the debt.

473
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,893
Until I saw Mr. Poj's brand-name products

474
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,703
in the customers' storage room.

475
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,333
He passed away, but his stuff was still there,

476
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,503
not returned to his family.

477
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:26,523
And his family didn't know what he ordered before he died.

478
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:29,826
So I secretly picked it out.

479
00:51:29,826 --> 00:51:34,733
But every piece of jewelry is embedded with a security microchip of the department store.

480
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:39,166
So I had to write a petition to unlock that microchip,

481
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:43,943
and I used P'Pak's computer to authorize and unlock the chip.

483
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:50,683
Then P'Pak found me.

What are you doing?

00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:06,927
Are you stealing the customer's stuff?

00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:08,920
What are you thinking?

487
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,076
Why are you doing such a stupid thing?

You're not someone like this.

492
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:23,080
This is stupid.

493
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,343
You're smarter than this.

494
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,973
Okay.

495
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:34,766
That request, cancel it.

496
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:37,940
Delete all the records.

497
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,383
Because if it still exists, you won't get away.

498
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,027
I didn't want to end up like this.

499
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:47,827
It's shameful.

500
00:52:49,506 --> 00:52:54,286
Now I feel like I'm at the lowest of my life.

501
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,863
Calm down.

502
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,173
And it turned out like what you saw.

503
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,543
Am I that much of a bad friend to you?

504
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,940
That's why you rarely tell me anything.

505
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,540
You need to be the heroine riding a white horse all the time, right?

506
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:29,266
You need to know everything.

507
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:32,106
You have to help everyone, and people like you.

508
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:34,423
It's always been like that.

509
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,600
Then what was that now?

510
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:46,403
Do you think I'm having an affair with P'Pak?

511
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:51,353
You had better ask yourself.

512
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,803
Who exactly is a bad friend?

513
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,846
So what do you want me to think?

514
00:53:58,846 --> 00:54:01,226
You used to study at the same school as P'Pak.

515
00:54:01,226 --> 00:54:04,103
You know each other and are very close.

516
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:07,843
But you never told me that, Prae.

00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,803

00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,483
But it's nothing.

522
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,373
"Nothing"?

523
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:38,263
If there's nothing, why did you hide it from me?

524
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,523
Shouldn't I know this?

525
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:47,290
I don't want to be a heroine riding a white horse.

526
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:53,423

535
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,373
It's not Prae.

00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,087
Honey, what is wrong?

546
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:02,587
I'm fine.

547
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,334
Are you vomiting?

548
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,027
Open the door, please.

549
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,077
Honey, what is wrong?

550
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:27,934
Are you sick?

551
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:29,980
Come on, let's go sit down.

552
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,480
If you're sick, just tell me. So I won't attend a party with the department people.

553
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,380
All those crazy people can curse me if I don't go.

554
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,740
Sit down.

555
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,577
Luckily, we left Mick and Max at Grandma's.

556
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,134
Okay?

557
00:57:50,727 --> 00:57:52,687
Hey.

558
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:55,734
You're not feeling well lately.

559
00:57:55,734 --> 00:57:58,887
Are you working too hard?

560
00:57:58,887 --> 00:58:01,527
So how about you quit?

561
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:03,457
Ask to quit tomorrow.

562
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,107
Why?

563
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:10,607
Why do I need to quit? Why can't it be you?

564
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:12,727
My salary is higher.

565
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,634
I have to continue my job.

566
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:19,296
You're a woman.

567
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:23,264
Even if you overwork to fatigue, you won't advance as fast as a man.

568
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:25,317
I'm honest.

569
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:30,847
But I'm more talented.

570
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:37,135
If I work hard, I'll get a raise and get promoted.

571
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:42,107
Rin is also a woman. Why can she do it?

572
00:58:42,107 --> 00:58:44,880
Why didn't P'Pak let her resign?

573
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,694
They don't have children.

574
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:50,437
She can work as much as she wants.

575
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:53,914
Hey, Baby.

576
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:56,597
Listen, seriously.

577
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,620
Just be a good wife

578
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,667
and a good mother; that's enough.

579
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,090
I'll make money for you.

580
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,587
I can do more. I'll sacrifice.

581
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:14,637
Go take a bath and go to bed.

582
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:17,714
"Sacrifice"?

583
00:59:18,474 --> 00:59:23,180
I can continue to work and labor harder.

584
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,337
You stay home so you won't be tired.

585
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:35,297
You told me to quit and said you were sacrificing yourself?

586
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:37,927
Well...

587
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:48,787
Okay.

588
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:57,377
I can't stand it anymore; I'm leaving this place!

589
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,637
Where are you going?

590
01:00:09,827 --> 01:00:12,107
Oh, where are you going?

591
01:00:12,107 --> 01:00:16,697
Nonsense. Are you on your period (menstruating)? What's wrong?

592
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,187
I'm a person.

593
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:22,980
I'm not just a wife or a mother!

594
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,730
I have my own needs.

595
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:28,210
I have things I want to do, and I want to work.

596
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,970
Then what?

597
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:34,340
You want to only work and not care about being a mother and wife. Right?

598
01:00:35,854 --> 01:00:38,517
I've been asking myself this all along.

599
01:00:39,614 --> 01:00:44,390
And I hate that I have such selfish thoughts.

600
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:48,547
So I endured all this time. I did everything.

601
01:00:48,547 --> 01:00:51,680
Doing household chores, caring for our children, plus working.

602
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,480
Instead of sympathizing with me and lightening my burden,

603
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,277
you told me to quit!

604
01:00:57,277 --> 01:01:01,720
No, I told you to resign as I was trying to help lighten your burden.

605
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,654
I'm finding a solution for you.

606
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:05,694
You can quit a job,

607
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:08,934
but you can't quit being a mother or wife, right?

608
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:12,837
I'm quitting now from being your wife.

609
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:16,810
Let's separate for a while.

610
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,670
I'm going somewhere else as of tonight.

611
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,374
No, no.

612
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:24,300
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

613
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,900
Hey.

614
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,154
Please, tell me what you want.

615
01:01:29,154 --> 01:01:32,337
Tell me, what did I do wrong? Let's talk.

616
01:01:32,967 --> 01:01:34,977
You're not wrong.

617
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:40,057
And I don't know how to fix it.

618
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:46,247
You're a husband like many men are.

619
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,537
But it must be my fault.

620
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,814
And…

621
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:56,397
And I don't know how to deal with all this anymore.

622
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,530
Can you calm down? Where are you going?

623
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,900
What will you tell our children?

624
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,627
Tell them I'm going to work in a branch out of town.

625
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:07,120
No, no, please!

626
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,267
Please don't leave. Let's talk about it first.

627
01:02:11,267 --> 01:02:12,700
No.

628
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,367
Hey.

629
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,527
Don't do this.

630
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:18,657
Please don't go.

631
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,657
Please.

632
01:02:31,987 --> 01:02:34,277
Then I beg you, too.

633
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,897
Let me go.

634
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:45,954
Take care of our children.

635
01:02:45,954 --> 01:02:47,774
No, wait.

636
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:51,537
Wait, don't go. Let's talk.

637
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:55,280
Let's discuss it.

638
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,187
Wait, don't go. No!

639
01:02:57,187 --> 01:03:00,437
Can we talk first? Please?

640
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:19,090
♫ If you want to love her, do not love me. Do you understand? ♫

641
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:25,970
♫ Go and be with anyone you want. You don't have to care about me ♫

642
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:33,230
♫ Because I will never share my lover with anyone ♫

643
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:36,720
♫ Please understand again ♫

644
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:44,250
♫ If you're still a cheater, then there will be no "us" ♫
