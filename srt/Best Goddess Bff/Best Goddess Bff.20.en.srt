1
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,800
You.

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,490
Familiar, isn't it?

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,040
Weren't you a Didi driver?

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,640
I thought you had mended your ways.

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,480
What do you mean by this?

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,140
What you're doing is illegal.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,120
I've come this far.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,640
Do you think I'm afraid of breaking the law now?

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,100
You're truly beyond help.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm not interested in these photos.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,120
As long as you help me get something back from Bai Xiaofei,

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,180
retrieve one item.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,800
I can give you all of these.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,060
What do you want to get?

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
I won't let you harm Xiaofei.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
You young people,

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,340
you all really speak in the same tone.

18
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,600
What do you mean by the same tone?

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,330
Don't worry.

20
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,120
I have no intention of hurting Bai Xiaofei.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,640
It's just that

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,720
my ex-wife had Bai Xiaofei

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,800
collect a lot of information about me.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,860
She's suing me now,

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,080
trying to leave me with nothing.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,720
You know,

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm getting old.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,520
I don't want to go through all that trouble anymore.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I won't be coming back again either.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,380
I just need you to get the stuff back and give it to me.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,740
Then we'll be even.

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm just protecting my legitimate rights.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,759
Your legitimate rights?

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,640
Do you men think that when you do something wrong,

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,300
you don't need to be punished?

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,360
You're not a judge.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,700
It's not for you to pass judgment.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,440
What you need to do is to get those things,

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,370
bring them back and give them to me.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
Otherwise,

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
I can't guarantee these photos

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,330
won't fall into someone else's hands.

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
Maybe that little boyfriend of yours, what's his name again?

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Xu.

45
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,090
He might be interested.

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
How despicable.

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,760
Adults only talk about benefits,

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,160
without distinguishing right from wrong.

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Really?

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,210
Just take those?

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
That's all I want.

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,440
I have nothing to do with anything else.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,570
Alright.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,450
You're back.

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
Didn't you say

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,640
you'd stay for two more days?

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
At Xiao Yang's place,

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,880
I still felt it wasn't very convenient,

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,120
so I thought it'd be better to come back.

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,810
You're not angry anymore, are you?

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Sis,

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
you were just looking out for me.

63
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,800
How could I be angry when I have such a good sister like you?

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Wouldn't I be a big fool if I were?

65
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Besides,

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
that Xu Yue is such a jerk.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,380
I don't want him at all.

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,690
You've come to your senses.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,680
There's hope for you yet.

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Well then,

71
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,040
Xiaofen,

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm going to take a shower first.

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,370
Go ahead.

74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
I've already drawn the bath for you.

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,579
You knew I was coming back?

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Xiao Yang already called me.

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Looks like I'm just a little monkey

78
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
who can't escape

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,360
my sister's Buddha's palm no matter where I go.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,480
Go on then.

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,280
All you need to do is

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,960
bring those things back to me.

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,180
Otherwise,

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,840
I can't guarantee

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,770
who these photos might end up with.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
Qingqing.

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,480
Qingqing.

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,740
Mr. Bai is calling for you.

89
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
What's wrong with her today?

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,450
I don't know.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,930
She's been like this since she arrived this morning.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Sis,

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
you called for me?

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,780
Organize these materials again.

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
What's this?

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,320
These are the records of previous misconduct towards you,

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,800
all of Dean Wei's affairs,

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,460
and evidence of his malicious asset transfers.

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,280
After you've organized them,

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
take them to Zhongxin Medical Group

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,890
and give them to Wang Na.

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,880
Is that his ex-wife?

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
These materials are very important.

104
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't lose them under any circumstances.

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Okay.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,920
Here.

107
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
It's all here.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
That's right.

109
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,210
This is everything.

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,090
Bai Xiaofei is really capable.

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,420
She managed to investigate my affairs thoroughly.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,000
It's all here.

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,500
It's all there.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,890
I didn't keep anything.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,260
Why would I keep it?

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,050
Well,

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
are all the USB drives here?

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,090
Don't worry.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,080
People...

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,490
are just greedy.

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,920
Don't they have enough?

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,520
They want,

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,000
they get,

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
and they still want more.

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Their desires are insatiable.

126
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,280
Didi Wei,

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
you know what I think?

128
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,480
Running a Didi business was good enough for you.

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,740
Why did you have to cause so much trouble?

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,320
You're still young.

131
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,360
You don't understand.

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,800
When you get to my age,

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,050
you'll understand.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,060
It's all just a transaction, really.

135
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,650
Didn't you two break up?

136
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Last time you were so desperate.

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,880
What's going on?

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,410
Oh, you two are here as well.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Now we're out in the open.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
The enemy is hidden.

141
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,700
It's a very dangerous situation.

142
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,010
We don't know his whereabouts.

143
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,840
we need to find a way

144
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,700
to draw him out.

145
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,120
Qingqing,

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
are you willing to take the risk?

147
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,640
Xiaofe,

148
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
if it weren't for you,

149
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
I might not be here today.

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,880
Let alone now.

151
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,940
Just tell me

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
what you want me to do.

153
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,120
Your situation with Xu Yue is an opportunity.

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
You need to have a big fight with Xu Yue.

155
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,240
The more people who know about it, the better.

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,800
You need to do it in front of everyone,

157
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
have a big argument in my office.

158
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,000
If you can't have love,

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
does that mean I can't have it either?

160
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,570
Brother, how was your performance today?

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,460
Let me tell you,

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,480
my performance today was

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
heart-wrenching,

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,730
gut-wrenching,

165
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,480
but

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
also very restrained.

167
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
I hate you all.

168
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,980
I'm getting old, getting old.

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,130
it seems I've really grown old.

170
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,810
I can't keep up with you young people anymore.

171
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Give it up.

172
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,640
Stop messing around.

173
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,320
So,

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,539
you've known her identity all along.

175
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,600
No.

176
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,450
She just told us on the way here.

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Well.

178
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,330
Those materials we just burned

179
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,600
were all fake?

180
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,540
They were all real.

181
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
All of them were real.

182
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,800
This is the settlement agreement from Wang Na to you.

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
The key content in it

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,800
is that you'll split the marital assets equally.

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,460
Wang Na has already signed it.

186
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
As long as you sign it,

187
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,420
the contract will take effect immediately.

188
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
She agreed to settle?

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,400
There's not a single woman in this world

190
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,000
who would willingly put her husband

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
of over twenty years,

192
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,120
with whom she's shared a bed, in mortal danger.

193
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,930
These were all hard-fought by President Bai.

194
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,720
Very well.

195
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
Taking a step back gives us more room to maneuver.

196
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,520
You've all gone to such lengths.

197
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
I have no reason to refuse.

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,880
However, there's one thing

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
I need to clarify.

200
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,240
About your arson incident last time,

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,560
you need to come with me to the police station to explain the situation.

202
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,960
Then,

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
we'll see if we can reach a settlement

204
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,360
with the affected residents and the property management.

205
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
At the same time, the corresponding punishment

206
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,200
you should bear, you still have to bear.

207
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Arson?

208
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,600
I didn't do it.

209
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
It wasn't you.

210
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,840
I

211
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,650
It really wasn't me.

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,080
I just wanted to get my share of the property back.

213
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
Why would I commit arson?
