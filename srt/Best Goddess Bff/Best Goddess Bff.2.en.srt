1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,040
Xiaofe.

2
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,240
Is this your boyfriend?

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,280
Yes.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,840
I am her boyfriend.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,800
Xiaofe.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,120
I didn't expect to come see you so soon.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,900
The elevator's here. You go in first.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,610
Which floor?

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,170
Little girl,

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
why do you keep staring at me?

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,080
It's nothing.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm just curious.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
I think,

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,120
you must have some special qualities.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,400
Otherwise,

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
how could my Xiaofe be interested in you?

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,440
After you.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,490
Call security quickly!

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,200
Security!

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,160
Come up quickly! There's a criminal!

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,680
Don't move!

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Security!

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't move!

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't move!

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,079
What's the situation?

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,120
This person is robbing with a knife.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,450
Don't move! Don't move!

29
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,480
Get up!

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,140
Let go of me!

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,880
Let's go!

32
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,880
Let go of me!

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Behave yourself!

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,079
Bai Xiaofei, you're tough.

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,880
Let's go!

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,440
Let go!

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,160
Let me go!

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
Contact the police immediately.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,320
Okay.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
You're awake.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,410
You're quite the sleeper, aren't you?

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,120
Mr. Zhang,

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
what's the meaning of this?

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,720
What do I mean?

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
I want to ask you what you mean.

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Bai Xiaofe,

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,360
I asked you to help me with crisis management,

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
but instead,

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,960
you completely exposed me.

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,900
Now a bunch of old men and women

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,079
have surrounded my company, not letting anyone through.

52
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,280
Even the economic investigation unit is after me.

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,010
Look at this.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Look at what you've done.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
Come on, look.

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,440
Look, just look.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,600
Mr. Zhang,

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,040
your company's business was illegal to begin with.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
It was only a matter of time before it blew up.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,320
We in crisis management can only do our best.

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,050
Do your best?

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,730
What kind of effort is that?

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,800
I gave your company internal documents,

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,200
and you immediately handed them over to the media.

65
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,860
Boss Zhang,

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,680
I think there must be some misunderstanding here.

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,640
As PR professionals,

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,570
how could we casually give information to the media?

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
If not you, then who else could it be?

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,440
Only my wife had the original copy of this document.

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,080
I just made a copy for you.

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Boss Zhang,

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
some things,

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,570
if you don't want others to know, don't do them yourself.

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,400
You know very well

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,800
that the money you raised with high interest rates

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
you can't possibly pay back.

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,440
Have you thought about those old men and women you deceived?

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
That's their life savings.

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,700
What does it have to do with me?

81
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
It's their own greed.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,900
If they weren't greedy, could they be deceived?

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,840
They just wanted to increase their wealth a bit.

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,170
What's wrong with that?

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,290
If it were your parents,

86
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
would you deceive them too?

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
Bai Xiaofe,

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
don't give me this useless talk.

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm telling you, I'm at my wit's end now.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,760
My accounts have all been frozen.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,720
If I get desperate,

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,640
I'll even deceive myself,

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,560
let alone them.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
I need to go into hiding for a while.

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
You give me two million first.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,800
Otherwise, I'll make you go down with me.

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,600
Old Zhang,

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
don't make another mistake.

99
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,620
Turning yourself in is your only way out now.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,000
Turn myself in?

101
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,600
What do you mean turn myself in?

102
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
I was living just fine out there.

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,880
It's all because of you.

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm telling you, if you don't give me the money today,

105
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm capable of anything.

106
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
Alright, alright,

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,820
don't get excited.

108
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,240
Two million is not a small amount.

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,440
My company's account might not even have that much money.

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,770
Don't try to fool me.

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
Your company

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,880
makes at least ten million in profit every year.

113
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,610
Is what I'm asking for too much?

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Nowadays, it's all bank transfers.

115
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,720
Even if I had two million, do you have an account to receive it?

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,130
If you really want to use money,

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
here's what we'll do.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
My company

119
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,540
has 300,000 in petty cash.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,440
I actually

121
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,410
can lend it to you first.

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
Okay, let's go now.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
Let's go.

124
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,090
When did you notice something was off?

125
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Just as we entered the elevator.

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,560
Secondly, with your taste, Xiaofe,

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,760
how could you possibly be interested in such a pig?

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,130
My father always told me

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,159
when something seems off, there's usually a catch.

130
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,600
So there must be something fishy going on here.

131
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,040
I didn't expect you to be so observant.

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,960
Of course,

133
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,640
I studied human anatomy at medical school.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Anatomy?

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,370
This really overturns my perception.

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,940
And that thing you did,

137
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
the spin move?

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,810
I learned that from online videos,

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,020
for self-defense.

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
I never would have guessed,

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,640
you're quite talented in many areas.

142
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Of course! I have many talents.

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,400
I can even dance.

144
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
How about I show you a move?

145
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,640
Stop, stop.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
You...

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,060
You got fired by Old Chen, didn't you?

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Wasn't it just a matter of time?

149
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
So,

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,090
what are your plans now?

151
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
Sister Xiaofe,

152
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,320
can I work with you?

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,970
You just saw what happened.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
It's not safe here with me.

155
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,500
It's okay, I'm not afraid.

156
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
I've even learned some self-defense.

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,640
Look.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
Is that self-defense?

159
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,410
That's more like a criminal's warm-up punch.

160
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,280
Sister Xiaofe, don't make fun of me.

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,920
Anyway, I'm just not afraid of danger.

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
And

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,600
I can even protect you.

164
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,280
I believe you.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,060
That's exactly what you did just now.

166
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
Thank you, Qingqing.

167
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,900
Sister Xiaofe,

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,480
don't say that.

169
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
You're making me feel embarrassed.

170
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,480
Ms. Zeng Qingqing,

171
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,640
I am now officially representing Pudu Public Relations

172
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
to invite you to join us.

173
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Would you like to?

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Can... can I really?

175
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,159
Xiaofe.

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,039
Thank you.

177
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,320
Remember,

179
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,700
you're not alone anymore.

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
You have me.

181
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,520
Xiaofe.

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Some people you've known for a long time can still feel like strangers,

183
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
while some people you've just met

184
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
can feel like you've known them for lifetimes.

185
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Perhaps this is what we call fate,

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,200
the best encounters that life gives us.

187
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,240
Sister Xiaofe,

188
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,160
are you sure?

189
