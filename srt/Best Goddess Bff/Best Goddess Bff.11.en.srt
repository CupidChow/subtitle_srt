1
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,160
So this is the third thing you wanted.

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,970
What did you think I wanted?

3
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,140
I heard from my brother

4
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
that Miss Bai is a rare talent.

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Most of the people in our Shengqiang Company are straight men.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,640
We really need someone like Miss Bai who can soften our approach,

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,360
someone who is both fluid like water and sharp like a knife.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
A female partner.

9
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,570
Aren't you the same?

10
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,690
It's different.

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,920
I've had my brother's protection since I was young.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
In the end, I always have someone to rely on,

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
so I tend to be more casual in my approach.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,720
Too willful.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,780
Unlike you,

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,080
who has fought your way up on your own,

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,740
and developed a suit of armor.

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,770
You're expecting too much from me.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,530
I'm afraid I might let you down.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,200
The most important thing in business is finding the right people.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,560
As long as Miss Bai is willing to join our Shengqiang,

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,890
you can name your terms.

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Additionally, this 5% equity stake

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
is our welcome gift.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,040
And for your Pudu PR,

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,010
we're willing to fully acquire it for 30 million.

27
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,600
It will become our subsidiary,

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,660
still under your direct management.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,560
The terms you're offering are truly tempting.

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,240
However,

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,520
I need to wait for a year

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,650
before I can give you an answer.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,600
A year?

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Because

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,780
I still have a very important thing to do.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,079
Well,

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,690
that's not impossible.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,280
After all, the eco-city project

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,940
will take at least a year to begin construction.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,079
Xiaofe,

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,079
you're in love.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,880
No, I'm not.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,079
Look, from your face,

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,960
to your neck,

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,480
to your waist,

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,040
and down to your legs.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,360
You're the dream of so many men.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,079
Alright,

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,170
stop teasing me.

50
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,520
Xiaofe,

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm just worried you might get bullied.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,600
Oh, you.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
You should worry about yourself instead.

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,760
What?

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
Who dares to bully me?

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
Let them try.

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm not the same person I used to be.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,480
If anyone tries to bully me now,

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll show them

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,380
what it means to make their dreams come true.

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,520
Good morning, President Bai.

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,159
morning.

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,980
President Bai,

64
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,890
here are the documents you requested yesterday.

65
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,340
Have they arrived?

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Yes, they have.

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,680
So, what's the matter?

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,610
Why are you in such a hurry to see me?

69
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,700
Did you miss me?

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
Are you going to

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,780
go to Myanmar with Wu Yuxuan soon?

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm leaving in a few days.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,400
Could you help me find someone when you get there?

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Who?

75
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,200
This girl

76
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,340
looks somewhat familiar.

77
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,600
My cousin.

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,080
Is she the one who used to bully you when you were young

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,340
and then disappeared?

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,159
She's been in northern Myanmar for four years.

81
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,960
She hasn't been in contact with her family since.

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,280
Then why are you looking for her?

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Isn't it better that she's gone?

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
My aunt was hit by a car

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
while searching for her.

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,620
Alright, forget I said anything.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,320
When we get there,

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,840
I'll see if we can use the film crew's connections

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
to help search for her again.

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
We can try to look for her,

91
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
but don't get your hopes up too high.

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,840
You know,

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
those who are tricked into going there,

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
anything could have happened to them.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
The chances of finding her

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
are extremely slim.

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Just do your best.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Is this why you called me here today?

99
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Alright then.

100
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
I actually have something to tell you too.

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,280
Go ahead.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,010
Well, here goes.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,740
Promise you won't get angry after I tell you.

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
Yu Xuan and I are getting engaged next month.

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,820
On the day of his tenth anniversary concert,

106
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
you know,

107
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,210
the connections in this world are truly miraculous.

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,480
Sometimes you chase desperately,

109
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
yet it never comes.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Sometimes when you no longer want anything,

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
it suddenly appears.

112
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,400
Yu Xuan,

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,280
tell me,

114
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,370
will we be this happy for the rest of our lives?

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Of course we will.

116
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,880
Will you marry me in the future?

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,520
Of course,

118
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,780
who else would I marry?

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
After graduation,

120
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,120
as soon as I achieve my dream,

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,580
I'll marry you right away.

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,540
What if your dream doesn't come true?

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
I'll still marry you.

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Everyone knows that I, Wu Yu Xuan,

125
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,380
love beauty even more than power.

126
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
Let's go eat.

127
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,760
Senior,

128
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,360
are you waiting for someone?

129
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,880
Yes.

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,940
What's wrong with you?

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,140
My stomach doesn't feel well.

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,120
It's okay.

133
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
Why don't you go back and rest?

134
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,650
What are you doing here?

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,280
Fei Fei,

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,600
I was practicing music with my buddies,

138
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
and lost track of time.

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,040
It's alright,

140
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
we still have fifteen minutes before the movie starts.

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,210
We can still make it if we go now.

142
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Yu Xuan,

143
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,170
my stomach hurts today.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
I probably can't watch the movie.

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
What's wrong?

146
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,480
Why did your stomach suddenly start hurting?

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,940
Did you eat something bad?

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Senior,

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,440
this can't be your boyfriend, can it?

150
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
He doesn't even know this basic knowledge.

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Who are you?

152
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,320
What do you mean by 'doesn't even know this basic knowledge'?

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
This is my junior,

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Xu You You,

155
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,380
two years younger than me.

156
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,020
What's really wrong with you?

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
My stomach really hurts.

158
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,480
I need to go back to the dorm first.

159
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,000
I see.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,460
You You,

161
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
can you watch the movie for me?

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

163
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,679
This doesn't seem right.

164
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm leaving now.

165
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Senior!

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,290
What's going on?

167
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,400
What's wrong with her?

168
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,440
It's menstrual cramps.

169
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,120
You idiot.

170
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,160
Want some?

171
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,980
Only a fool would refuse food that's right in front of them.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
It's okay, it's okay.

173
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,280
It's a new product!

174
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
What is it?

175
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,400
You...

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
My legs...

177
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,120
I can't...

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't...

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,400
Help!

180
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
You're so skinny, you should eat more meat.

181
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,360
Xiaofei.

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,040
Youyou.

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,690
Come.

184
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,480
No, thanks. I'd better sit over there.

185
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,280
Why do I run into you everywhere?

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,610
I insist on sitting here today.

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Why are you two acting like enemies?

188
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
you start arguing as soon as you meet.

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,240
What's wrong?

190
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,140
Didn't you like the movie?

191
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,010
Maybe our zodiac signs are incompatible.

192
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
I think it's our values that don't match.

193
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
Hey, you.

194
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,480
Yuxuan.

Xiaofei.

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,840
You won't

199
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,340
blame me, will you?

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
It has nothing to do with you.

201
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,490
I thought he was a horse,

202
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,740
but it turns out

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,720
he's a camel.

204
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,260
Then it's settled.

205
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,690
Let bygones be bygones.

206
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,820
You must come when the time comes.

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
Whether he's a camel or a horse,

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,140
we'll always be good sisters.

209
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,290
Don't worry,

210
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll give you my blessings.

212
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,680
