1
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,360
I come here often.

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,320
How come I've never seen you before?

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,850
I've never seen you either.

4
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,610
How long have you been back?

5
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,780
You don't recognize people anymore?

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
It's not that.

7
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,820
I'm feeling a bit out of place.

8
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
You've got someone on your mind now?

9
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Have you forgotten how you got hurt?

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
In life,

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
you should be more carefree,

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
don't be so naive.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,720
Soup's ready!

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Ten-ingredient nourishing seafood soup.

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,640
Let me tell you,

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,440
there are large shrimp in here,

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
scallops,

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,560
and octopus too.

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,300
Try it quickly.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,090
It's delicious.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Sister Xiaofe,

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,079
Qingqing,

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
I have something to tell you.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
In your eyes, what kind of person

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
is Xu Yue?

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Well, he's

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
sunny,

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
kind,

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,920
carefree,

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
loves freedom,

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,410
and gets along well with everyone.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,650
But he's not very committed when it comes to relationships.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,200
And then,

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,880
for some reason I don't know,

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
I just inexplicably like him very much.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
What if one day

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
you discover

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
he's not the person you imagined him to be?

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
What would you do?

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,700
I've actually thought about this question.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
But I've realized

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,440
that if you truly like someone,

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,780
you don't even think about these things.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Oh, you,

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,380
you really are a romantic.

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Sister,

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
you're teasing me again.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,730
I really don't want you to get hurt.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,060
It's okay, sister.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,640
Even if one day

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
I really do get hurt,

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,140
it will be my own doing.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
I'll accept it.

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,600
Here, sister,

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,260
let me pour you some more soup.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,160
Xiaofe.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
How come you have time today

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,180
to have coffee with me?

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,400
Actually, I've always been grateful to you and Youyou

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,060
for taking in me and Qingqing.

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Oh, it's nothing.

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,520
You are Youyou's sisters,

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
so you're my sisters too.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,400
It's just a small gesture.

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,079
I believe if there's a day

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,800
when I have nowhere to live,

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,329
you would do the same for me.

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,160
But Xu Yue,

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,330
even though you're Youyou's brother,

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,640
there are some things

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,080
I still hope you have a sense of boundaries.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
You mean

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,410
about what happened between me and Qingqing?

74
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
It's my fault.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
That day,

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I acted on impulse

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
and so...

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Your moment of weakness

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,840
might have caused Qingqing harm

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
that could be fatal.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Isn't that a bit extreme?

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,960
We're all adults here.

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
The reason you say this

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
is because you haven't seen Qingqing

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
on the rooftop.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,930
As for Qingqing,

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,280
she is a very simple

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,010
and straightforward girl.

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Many times,

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
she doesn't imagine things

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,130
to be so profound and complicated.

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,650
She also hasn't weighed the pros and cons.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
There's nothing wrong with that in itself,

94
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,800
but the biggest problem is

95
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,280
when she doesn't have enough energy and tolerance

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,010
to bear certain consequences,

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
the blow it brings to her

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,280
could be fatal.

99
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,140
You're just worried that I'll let her down, aren't you?

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,400
When a man can't give,

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,570
he shouldn't mess with her.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't know what your

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,010
definition and understanding of love is.

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,210
Actually, I've always had a question I wanted to ask you.

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,900
Do you think love needs to be weighed?

106
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,120
Yes, it does.

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,260
Is it still love after being weighed?

108
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,700
Love is like a bouquet of flowers.

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,440
It can only

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,000
bloom more beautifully in a relatively safe environment and suitable temperature.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,040
bloom more beautifully in a relatively safe environment and suitable temperature.

112
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,700
Otherwise,

113
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
it's just a fleeting moment.

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
I've been shooting and gathering inspiration for years.

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,920
I've seen countless types of flowers.

116
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,560
Actually, the most beautiful flowers

117
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,680
often bloom on steep cliffs.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,600
So, are you the cliff

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,120
or the precipice?

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,280
Neither.

121
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,610
At most, I'm just a gust of wind.

122
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,060
Is there a possibility

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,000
that you've confused wind with trash?

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
If you put it that way, it's serious.

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
I still like Qingqing very much.

126
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,530
You're stalking me.

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
No,

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,520
the wind blew by

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,480
and I took a photo in passing.

130
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
You're really funny.

131
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,570
Anyway, things are not as you saw them.

132
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
It doesn't matter what it's like.

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,080
What's important now is,

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,960
Xu Yue,

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,880
I still hope you can leave Qingqing as soon as possible.

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,000
How to do it specifically,

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
I believe you can handle it well.

138
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,450
Do you really need to worry about this?

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm her sister.

140
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
It's my duty to worry.

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
As for you,

142
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,080
just do what you need to do.

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,160
You're paying today.

144
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Next time, it's on me.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Hello?

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,960
Youyou.

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,700
Are you available now?

148
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
I need to tell you something.

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
I met your brother today.

150
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,600
You're not asking him to leave Qingqing, are you?

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,280
Correct.

152
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,280
Have you talked to Qingqing about this?

153
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,010
She's too emotional right now.

154
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
there's no point in asking her.

155
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
You're becoming more and more like

156
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,680
those rich mothers-in-law in TV dramas who break up young couples.

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,960
Compared to a human life,

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,880
it's worth it.

159
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,320
Alright.

160
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,380
So what do you want me to do?

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,370
What should I do?

162
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
What should you do?

163
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay.

164
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,120
I understand.

165
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,530
I'll take care of it.

166
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,480
You're home early today.

167
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Brother,

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,040
come here.

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,120
What's up?

170
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,409
Is this some new yoga pose you've learned?

171
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,970
Brother,

172
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,360
I want to ask you something.

173
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,159
Do you love me?

174
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,140
You don't have a fever, do you?

175
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,919
Of course he doesn't have a fever.

176
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,780
I'm asking you,

177
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,640
do you love me?

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,740
Why are you asking such nonsense?

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
I'm your brother.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,260
If I don't love you, who else would I love?

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Alright then.

182
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,300
Now there's an important choice in front of you.

183
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,850
You need to make a decision.

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
What choice?

185
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Why so serious?

186
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,920
Between me and Zeng Qingqing,

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,250
you can only choose one.

188
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
If you choose her, you can't have me.

189
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,640
If you choose me, you can't have her.

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,920
We're incompatible.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Make your choice.

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
This is Bai Xiaofei's idea again, isn't it?

193
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,800
Wrong.

194
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,520
It's my idea.

195
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
Go ahead and argue with her.

196
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm tired. I'm going to take a shower.

197
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,720
Xu Yue, stop right there.

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,880
This is not a joke.

199
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,280
No.

200
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,760
You.

201
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
You... put it down.

202
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
Are you going to choose or not?

203
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,280
Choose, choose, choose.

204
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,840
I...

205
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
Okay, I promise you.

206
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,800
I'll stay far away from Zeng Qingqing.

207
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
I'll never go near her again.

208
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,890
Is that okay?

209
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,650
Is that good enough?

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,100
Put the knife down.

211
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Don't say I forced you into this.

212
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,840
I said it.

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
Are you free tonight?

214
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,840
Let's go for a late-night snack.

215
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I just took a shower and I'm a bit tired.

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I'm about to rest.

217
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,000
Alright.

218
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,160
Then you get some rest.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
I asked you to come today

220
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,900
mainly to ask if you're willing to come back to work at the company.

221
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Xiaofe,

222
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
you still trust me?

223
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I've reconciled with Boss Zhang.

224
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Everything is in the past now.

225
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,240
If you're willing to come back,

226
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,500
you're still welcome.

227
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,290
Xiaofe, you're so kind.

228
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,880
It's not that I'm being kind.

229
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
It's mainly because the company

230
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,040
can't find

231
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,920
a suitable receptionist at the moment.

232
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,400
You're familiar with reception work,

233
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,120
and I need someone experienced.

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,520
I'd be more than happy to.

235
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Alright then.

236
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,280
Go to work then.

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,360
Now?

238
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
What else?

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Did you need time to mull it over?

240
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm going now.

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm back.

242
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,320
That's great.

243
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,440
I've been going crazy covering for you these past two days.

244
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Leave it all to me.

245
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,640
Qingqing,

246
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,680
what are you thinking about?

247
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,440
Nothing.

248
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,920
You look distracted.

249
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,320
Hey.

250
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,170
Do you have time now?

251
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,520
Let's go downstairs for a cup of coffee.

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay.

253
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,960
Wait for me.

254
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
I need to go downstairs for a moment.

255
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
if Sister Xiaofei looks for me,

256
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
remember to call me immediately.

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,500
I'll be right back.

258
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,650
Take it easy.

259
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Why did you come here?

260
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,040
