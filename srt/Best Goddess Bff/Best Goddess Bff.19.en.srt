1
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Is your Manager Bai in?

2
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,960
Yes, Manager Xu.

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
This way, please.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,340
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,980
I've been waiting for you.

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,640
You don't mind if I bring him along, do you?

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,080
Why would I mind?

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
It's best to keep things in the family, right?

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,560
That's great.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
That's why we say Teacher Bai has a broad vision.

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,280
You're destined for great things.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,880
I'll cut you first, you know.

13
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,039
Let's not do that.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,680
There's no need to trouble yourself with that.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,360
Let me do it.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,740
You two are really arch-enemies.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,760
My biggest regret is not disabling him before he went abroad.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
I should have crippled him first.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
Otherwise, how could he have had the chance to mess with both of us?

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,280
Let's not say anything more.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,480
Let's first toast with a fragrant pear.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Fragrant pear, parting ways.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,039
Love leads to separation.

24
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,759
It's quite fitting, actually.

25
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,560
I forgive you.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,759
Teacher Bai is generous.

27
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,039
Peel an apple for me, please.

28
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,700
As you wish.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,000
Xiaofei,

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
let's get back to the main topic.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,120
Tomorrow, Yuxuan and I are going to Myanmar for filming.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,380
It'll be about a month.

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
About the favor you asked me last time to help find your cousin,

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,400
I've already inquired with the contact person there.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
When we get there,

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
we'll search thoroughly.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
However, I still advise you not to get your hopes up too high.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
She's a constant worry for my second uncle.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
Perhaps if we find her,

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,460
my second uncle's illness will improve.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,360
Your second uncle treated you like that.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,840
I really don't understand.

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,970
Even food can't stop you from talking.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,700
No matter what,

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,440
let's try our best to search.

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
Maybe there will be a miracle.

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Okay.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Leave it to me.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Oh, by the way,

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,530
how's Qingqing?

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
She's doing fine.

52
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,280
She stayed at a colleague's place last night.

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
I gave her two days off

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
to let her get some rest.

55
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,290
Is it a man or a woman?

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,480
At our receptionist Xiao Yang's place.

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,040
However,

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,040
my brother has indeed been a bit different lately.

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
But I can't put my finger on what's changed.

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
Men's thoughts,

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,520
don't try to guess.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,490
Once they get an idea in their head,

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,120
they can be even more complicated than women.

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,880
If anyone dares to have any ill intentions this time,

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,140
I'll keep that in mind.

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
After withdrawing the money, quickly deliver it to them.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Okay, got it.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
Driver,

69
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
why do you keep looking at me?

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,360
You're so young, yet your memory is so poor.

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
Have you forgotten who I am?

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Green reeds grow in rows,

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,769
we two swim in the water.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
I really like you.

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,200
Why are you here?

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,650
What do you want?

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,930
Let me out of the car!

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't be nervous.

79
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
What do you think I want to do?

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm driving for Didi now.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,320
You're driving for Didi?

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,770
It's all ruined because of you.

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,530
My ex-wife kicked me out again.

84
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
I lost my job.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
So I had no choice but to drive for Didi.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,450
We didn't want things to turn out this way either.

88
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,650
It's not your fault.

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I blame myself for having evil thoughts.

90
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,840
It's what I deserve.

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
At the last drinking party,

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,159
didn't they say you graduated from Fudan University?

93
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,720
Can't you do something else?

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,760
I'm getting old.

95
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
I don't want to bother anymore.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,850
This job is quite flexible.

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm just living day by day.

98
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't be nervous.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
Feel free to sit back.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
There are cameras all over this car.

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,540
I promise to get you safely to your destination.

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,180
We're here.

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
Thank you then.

104
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,480
No problem.

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
Remember to give me a good rating.

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,690
Call me again next time you need a ride.

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
They'll be doomed sooner or later.

108
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,440
Bad people never come to a good end.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,810
they'll be doomed sooner or later.

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Bad people never come to a good end. They'll be doomed sooner or later.

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
Bad people never come to a good end.

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,520
Grandpa Qian,

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,920
I've come to see you.

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,880
Here,

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
your favorite White Rabbit milk candy.

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
White Rabbit is good.

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
White Rabbit doesn't bite.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,060
Please, have some.

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
White Rabbit is good.

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
White Rabbit is good. White Rabbit doesn't bite.

121
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Director.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
Qingqing is here.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,560
Director.

124
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
This is this month's

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
living expenses from Sister Xiaofei for the elderly.

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
I happen to be off work today,

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
so I withdrew it and brought it over right away.

128
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,040
President Bai is spending money on us again.

129
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,840
It's our duty.

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Oh, Director,

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
how is Sister Xiaofei's second uncle doing recently?

132
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
It's strange,

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
since you last visited,

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,130
he hasn't run out even once.

135
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,840
He just sunbathes and plays cards every day,

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,640
and he's been quite well-behaved.

137
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,370
That's good.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,200
Just don't let him run out and cause trouble for Sister Xiaofei again.

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
Don't worry.

140
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,490
What are you doing here?

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,020
If my boss finds out, I'll lose my job.

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm bored.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
I wanted someone to have lunch with.

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Why can't it be any other time?

145
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Does it have to be now?

146
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,890
And right outside my office building too.

147
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
Having lunch with my own daughter.

148
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Do I need to schedule a time for that?

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Keep your voice down.

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,940
When you abandoned my mother and me in Shandong,

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,460
why didn't you come for us?

152
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
Now that your new family has fallen apart,

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
you suddenly remember you have a daughter, right?

154
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,860
Did you get what I asked you to?

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,260
I can't take it.

156
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I won't let you do anything to harm Xiaofei.

157
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,010
Did I say I was going to hurt her?

158
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,180
I don't care, I just can't take it.

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Alright, I'll leave first then.

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
But there's one thing you need to remember,

161
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,610
your surname is Wei.

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,760
Xiao Yang.

163
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
There's a bunch of men's skincare products behind your mirror.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
Whose are they?

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
That guy surnamed Zhang.

166
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,280
He's already gone, and you're still keeping them?

167
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,810
I wanted to throw them away.

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
I've been too busy these past couple of days.

169
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,820
I'll throw them out later.

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't waste them.

171
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,220
Save them for the next one.

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,740
You're making fun of me again.

173
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,700
Keep them for your boyfriend.

174
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,620
Forget I said that.

175
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,080
But Qingqing,

176
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,260
I think you're quite strange.

177
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,520
How am I strange?

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,020
Your ability to heal yourself is really strong.

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,980
It's only been a day, and you're acting like nothing happened.

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,120
Well, I...

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,200
It's called 'come fast, go fast.'

182
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,800
Love passionately,

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
break up quickly.

184
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
Do you understand?

185
