1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,680
Whose house is this?

2
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,520
How did it catch fire?

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,680
How careless!

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,200
Look,

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,320
it even burned part of the downstairs.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
Fortunately, the firefighters arrived in time.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,720
Otherwise, the whole building would have been destroyed.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,580
Excuse me, please let me through.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,040
How could it have caught fire?

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,360
Did you forget to turn off the stove?

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,280
No, it wasn't me.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,000
I left the house with you today.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,060
And I didn't even use the stove today.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
Manager Chen,

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,920
how did our apartment catch fire?

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Miss Bai,

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,760
it's not your apartment.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
It's the resident above you.

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
The balcony caught fire,

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,960
causing damage to your apartment and the two below

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,360
to varying degrees.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,720
Upstairs?

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,160
Upstairs,

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,800
I remember that apartment wasn't renovated.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,130
No one even lives there.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,020
How could it have caught fire?

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,440
It couldn't be your second uncle, could it?

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Impossible.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,320
Although Second Uncle is eccentric,

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,980
he wouldn't go as far as arson.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,800
The police will be here soon,

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,039
along with the fire department to investigate thoroughly.

33
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,700
We'll need your cooperation.

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,759
Looking at the situation,

35
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,400
it won't be habitable for a while.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Why don't you stay at my place for a few days?

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:39,920
No need,

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,240
we can stay at a hotel.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
Don't waste money.

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
I have two empty rooms at home.

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,800
It's perfect timing.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,479
Yuxuan and I are going to Myanmar for a shoot.

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
If you'd like, you can stay for a month.

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,050
You can help me watch the house.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Sister Youyou,

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,479
then I'll thank you on behalf of Sister Xiaofe.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,039
Let's go.

48
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,300
My beloved concubine,

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
come, come, come.

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Come in.

51
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,900
Sister Youyou,

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,600
I didn't know your house was so big.

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,690
It's much bigger than Sister Xiaofe's house.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I didn't realize you were so wealthy.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
My parents are abroad most of the year,

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
to make it convenient for my brother and me to work.

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
It was bought for us to live in years ago.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
You have a brother?

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,180
Is he your biological brother or cousin?

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,280
Biological.

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
He's a year older than me.

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,960
Does he live here too?

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,400
He likes photography.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,079
He's often away on photo shoots.

65
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,920
We rarely see him.

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
He seldom comes back.

67
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,920
Qingqing,

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
you can stay in my brother's room for now.

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,050
What about Xiaofei?

70
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,880
She can stay in this large secondary bedroom.

71
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,320
Okay.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,760
Youyou,

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,250
are you sure we won't be bothering you?

74
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,980
My beloved concubine,

75
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,450
I have been missing you for more than just a day or two.

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,300
Feel free to stay here.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Qingqing, let me show you to your room.

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,210
Let's go.

79
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,540
This will be your room.

80
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,740
Your brother is quite a big boy, isn't he?

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,500
He must be fun to be around.

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,620
I'm not sure if he's fun or not.

83
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,800
but I can tell you this,

84
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
I've been bullying him since we were kids.

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,440
I can see that.

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Why don't you get settled in?

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll go make you something to eat.

88
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,100
Sister Youyou,

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
let me handle dinner tonight.

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,720
When I was staying at Sister Xiaofe's place,

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,280
she always cooked for me.

92
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,120
I never had a chance to show off my cooking skills.

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,680
So today, let me do it.

94
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
Are you sure?

95
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,200
Absolutely sure.

96
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Alright then.

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,360
You mean

98
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
someone deliberately set the fire?

99
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,600
But there's no need for them to set fire to the floor above your apartment.

100
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,079
Wouldn't it be better to go directly to your place?

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,940
I've made quite a few enemies over the years doing crisis management.

102
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,240
I knew the floor above was unoccupied,

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,970
so I've been using that address

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
for all my deliveries.

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,300
You're really cautious, aren't you?

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,460
It's a good thing you were so careful.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Do you have any suspects in mind?

108
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,930
I'm not sure.

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
I think

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
you should stay here with me for a while longer.

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,640
Let's wait until the matter is thoroughly investigated.

112
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,570
Dinner's ready!

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Not bad!

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
It smells good.

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,250
What's this?

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,200
Ta-da!

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,400
You can make this too?

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,280
Pretty good, right?

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,540
Now take a look at this.

120
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,920
Noodles again?

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,920
How is it?

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,740
This is Korean kimchi fire chicken noodles.

123
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,840
Don't tell me this one is noodles too.

124
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't think we can escape it.

125
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
Of course.

126
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
But you two guess first.

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,410
What kind of noodles are these?

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,450
We've had Thai noodles.

129
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,980
We've had Korean noodles.

130
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
So this one...

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,610
Could it be Japanese ramen?

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
No, that's not it.

133
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
Xiaofe, you guess.

134
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,360
I guess it's not...

135
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,480
What?

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Lanzhou noodles.

137
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
You're both wrong.

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
It's Chongqing noodles.

139
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,850
I really didn't guess that.

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
Xiaofe,

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
I made this bowl of noodles especially for you.

142
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,159
You're from Sichuan and like spicy food.

143
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,880
I know that Chongqing and Sichuan people's favorite

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,140
is Chongqing noodles.

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,520
So,

146
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,810
this bowl of noodles

147
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,560
is to specially thank you for taking care of me.

148
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,890
Let you taste the flavor of your hometown.

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,440
Thank you.

150
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,000
It's nothing.

151
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,080
Here, Youyou,

152
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
try this Thai Tom Yum Kung shrimp noodles.

153
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,210
Thank you, dear.

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,540
Then this bowl of spicy chicken noodles is mine.

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,240
So, let's...

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,450
...show off!

157
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,840
Show off!

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
Yu Xuan.

159
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,290
Why are you here?

160
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,280
Who were you drinking with this time?

161
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,610
It was just Yang's group of clients again.

162
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,530
Try to drink less in the future.

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
What's wrong?

164
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
There's someone at home.

165
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,770
Don't try to fool me.

166
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,570
I saw your Moments post.

167
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,640
Your brother is still in Yunnan.

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Give me a kiss.

169
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Yu Xuan.

170
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,120
No.

171
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Why are you here?

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
Yu Xuan is drunk.

173
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
I thought no one was home.

174
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,680
so...

175
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,660
Why is she here too?

176
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
Their house caught fire.

177
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,140
They're staying at my place for a couple of days.

178
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,159
Is this free to watch?

179
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,450
You've been sitting there the whole time?

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,040
What did you see?

181
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,400
That's exciting.

182
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,250
It's almost beyond my comprehension.

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
You guys talk.

184
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,380
I'll just watch the drama unfold.

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,610
Alright, I'll tell you.

186
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
I, Wu Yuxuan,

187
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,600
used to be quite a jerk.

188
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
I let down my classmate Bai Xiaofei.

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Now,

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm with Bai Xiaofei's best friend.

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,280
And then,

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,419
I don't know how to explain it.

193
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,799
Anyway,

194
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,490
the point is, I'm a jerk.

195
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,580
I'm telling you, girl,

196
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes, yes, yes,

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,130
he's just a jerk.

198
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,120
In short,

199
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
Just a jerk.

200
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,050
You don't have to put yourself down like that.

201
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Many things at different stages

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,130
have different interpretations.

203
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,290
You had your helplessness before,

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,250
now you have your pursuits.

205
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,800
There are no wrong people in this world,

206
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
only wrong timing.

207
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
The order of appearance in life is quite magical.

208
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,970
Actually, no one will always be with someone.

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,280
What we need to do

210
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
is just to face it calmly,

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,280
face everything this world has given us.

212
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Magnanimous.

213
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
So magnanimous.

214
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,690
Did you see that?

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,040
You, girl, don't just focus on eating.

216
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,560
Learn from others properly.

217
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,760
What is perspective?

218
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
This is perspective.

219
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,820
The melon is really sweet.

220
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,770
Fen Zhuanlu.

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,260
All you know is eating.

222
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Yu Xuan,

223
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,080
you should go home and rest today.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Drink less in the future.

225
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
I'll talk to Manager Yang later.

226
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,400
You'd better not attend this kind of gathering anymore.

227
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Alright.

228
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,960
Well,

229
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,740
sweet dreams to you three.

230
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I'll be going now.

231
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Wait.

232
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
There's one thing I hope you can promise me.

233
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
The thing you told me during the day,

234
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
I'll handle it for you when I get to Myanmar.

235
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,690
Not that one.

236
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,400
What is it?

237
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,440
Let her speak.

238
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,280
I hope you can give Youyou

239
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,400
everything you missed before.

240
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,240
It's also to make up for my regrets.

241
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
If you can't do it,

242
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,880
please stay away from us.

243
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,980
Our love can't withstand your childish antics.

244
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,280
Xiaofe,

245
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,080
Yu Xuan,

246
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
can you do it?

247
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
What I've missed,

248
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,180
I will make up for all of it.

249
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,770
This time, even without power and wealth,

250
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,120
I will choose love.

251
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,690
I'm leaving.

252
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,520
Why are you always so silly?

253
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,920
President Bai,

254
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
This is all the property management can show us.

255
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,440
Technically, they shouldn't be showing us this at all.

256
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
Do you know this old lady?

257
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
Sister Xiaofe,

258
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,520
we have no grudge against this old lady.

259
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
It's definitely not targeted at us.

260
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,800
Could it be that you're overthinking this?

261
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,280
I think it's possible that this old lady

262
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,560
might have some mental issues.

263
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,760
I believe they'll investigate and clear this up sooner or later.

264
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,200
Why don't you head back to the company first?

265
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,530
I'll report to you immediately if there's any development.

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,920
Qingqing.

267
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
just now,

268
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,370
did you feel that figure looked familiar?

269
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
Familiar?

270
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,530
I didn't notice.

271
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
Find Xiaozhi today

272
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,720
and retrieve our business case closures from the past year.

273
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,850
I want to take a look.

274
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,450
Okay.

275
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,640
Come in.

276
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,040
Sister Xiaofe,

277
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,130
you're still looking at it?

278
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,760
Yes.

279
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,120
My stomach is a bit uncomfortable today.

280
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
So I'll go back and rest first.

281
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,850
Alright.

282
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,650
You go ahead.

283
