1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're pregnant.

2
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,620
This child, not coming early or late,

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
chooses to come at this time.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,760
It's fine.

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,000
There's no turning back now.

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
I guess it's a way to push ourselves.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,720
Xiao Hua,

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,100
take good care of yourself

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,660
and have this baby.

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,090
Don't worry,

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,519
I'll definitely take good care of you.

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,000
Kun'er.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,000
You saved me.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
From now on, whether we're rich or poor,

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm yours.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,960
What?

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
He's been caught.

18
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,440
It's only been one night.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
How did he get caught so quickly?

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,240
Well,

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,160
what about the order for 300 vehicles?

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,640
Forget about the order.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,479
Remember,

24
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,920
we've never been in contact.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,780
Act like we don't know each other.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,930
Brother,

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,160
how's it going?

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,289
Can we get the money?

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,760
We've selected everything on our end.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
we're waiting to start work.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,720
The money won't come through.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,400
It's stopped.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Everything's stopped, I guess.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,400
You can't be serious, brother.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
How can the money just disappear like that?

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
We've already signed the contracts here.

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,380
Everything's been arranged.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,000
If we go back on our word,

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,320
these people are not to be messed with.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm not one to be messed with either.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,360
What can I do if the money's gone?

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,280
No.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,980
How's it going on your end?

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,560
Everything's been arranged.

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,200
Well...

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
that payment...

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,079
It'll arrive later this afternoon.

48
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,560
Um...

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,530
I'm going to head back for a nap.

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
I got up too early this morning.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm feeling a bit tired.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Why don't you rest here for a while?

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,880
No, no, no.

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
I have trouble sleeping in unfamiliar places.

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Then I'll go back and take a nap first.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,840
This afternoon, I...

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,300
I'll come back a bit later.

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,980
Take care then.

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,650
Okay.

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Um...

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,460
Why did that person leave?

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,960
He said he didn't sleep well today.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
He went back to take a nap.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,730
Taking a nap?

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,280
Kun,

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,850
I feel like he's acting strange today.

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,300
I hope there's no problem over there.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,400
I think you should stay away from the company for a while.

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,160
You'd better get out of town for a bit.

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,079
These people are not to be messed with.

71
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,200
We've screwed them over.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
They'll definitely come after us.

73
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,280
We live in a society governed by law now.

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,740
You think I'm afraid of them coming after me?

75
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,740
It's better to avoid trouble.

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,340
You should lay low for now.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
I've already booked my ticket.

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
I'm going to hide out for a few days.

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,180
Hung up.

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,400
Xiaoqi.

81
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,250
Mr. Chen.

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
Go back and pack up now.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
You're coming with me on a long trip.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Now?

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,320
Yes.

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,050
The sooner, the better.

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,260
Where are we going?

88
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,400
Just pack as I told you.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,660
Why so many questions?

90
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,290
Okay.

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Hello.

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,880
The number you have dialed is powered off.

93
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,280
Kun,

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,650
I can't get through.

95
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,240
Try again.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,400
Hello.

97
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,850
The number you have dialed is powered off.

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,800
Kun,

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,560
I've tried,

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
both of their phones are turned off.

101
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,360
They're messing with me now.

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,280
You guys,

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,920
bring some stuff

104
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
and come with me for a bit.

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,480
Let's go.

106
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Let's go settle the score with them.

107
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
Let's go.

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,810
I'm coming with you.

109
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,280
What are you going for?

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm worried.

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
I need to keep an eye on you.

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,480
Don't worry,

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,440
I won't do anything rash.

114
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,170
I don't care.

115
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,140
Let's go, let's go.

116
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,760
Let's go.

117
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,840
President Bai.

118
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240
Still working overtime?

119
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes.

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
Then I'll head back first.

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,660
Take care of yourself.

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,570
Okay.

123
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,170
Brother Kun.

124
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,210
It's right here.

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
What are you here for?

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,320
It's none of your business what we're here for.

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,600
Quite arrogant, aren't you?

128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,330
Once you're here, you're under my jurisdiction.

129
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Excuse me.

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,440
We're advertising workers.

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
we're here to find this PR company.

132
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,340
to install advertisements for them.

133
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,480
Oh, Pudu PR?

134
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,900
That's the one.

135
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
You should have said so earlier.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,930
Someone come and register with me.

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,100
I'll do it then.

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,620
Go quickly.

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
You look so melancholy.

140
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Do I

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
look very melancholy?

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,200
Do I

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
look very melancholy?

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,400
Xu Yue,

145
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,480
do you really love me?

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Why are you asking such a boring question late at night again?

147
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,080
I love you.

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,400
I love you.

149
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,460
I love you the most.

150
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,060
You should get some rest then.

151
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,940
I'll head back now.

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,920
You wake me up in the middle of the night,

153
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,620
and then you're just leaving?

154
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Qingqing.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
What PR?

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
What the hell kind of PR?

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,660
It's right here, boss.

158
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,520
Boss.

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,280
Chen Feng, Cao Xin.

160
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,960
Both of you, come out here.

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,490
Come out.

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,659
Did you hear me?

163
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,290
Get your asses out here now.

164
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,130
Stop hiding.

165
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,920
If you don't come out,

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
we'll tear this place apart.

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,450
You guys.

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,960
Xiao Hua.

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,520
Is that you, Xiao Hua?

170
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
write mine first.

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
let me tell you something.

172
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
Your parents are already divorced.

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,960
No one wants you anymore.

174
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
If our family hadn't taken you in,

175
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
you'd still be in the countryside with no one to care for you.

176
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,280
You still want to go to school?

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,010
Not a chance.

178
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
From now on, my homework,

179
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
you'll do it all for me.

180
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,120
Remember,

181
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm not your cousin.

182
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,080
You should call me Little Mistress.

183
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,140
Do you understand?

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,960
Xiao Hua.

185
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,640
I saw it.

186
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,160
She's the one who took it.

187
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,370
Sister-in-law,

188
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,450
are you alright?

189
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,880
Xiao Hua.

190
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Brother Kun.

191
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,600
