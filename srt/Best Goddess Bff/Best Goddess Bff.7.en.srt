1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,720
Please take a look at this.

2
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,080
No.

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,480
Would you mind taking a look?

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,280
No, no, no.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,120
No.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,200
Please have a look.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,920
No, no.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,040
Please take a look at this.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,760
No, no.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Take a look at this, please.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,920
No, no.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,640
Just take a look, please, just take a look.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:50,960
No.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,010
Don't give it to me, don't give it to me.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,200
Would you like to know more about this?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,960
No, no.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,680
Sis,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,960
these agreements...

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,360
They refused without even looking at them.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,260
There must be more to this than meets the eye.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,480
Actually,

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,690
it's not that complicated.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,520
So it was him.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,400
The sunlight is too strong.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,370
He's afraid of getting sunburned.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,980
Let's try it again.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,039
The sunlight is too strong.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,400
The sunlight

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,840
is too strong.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
He's afraid

31
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,240
of getting sunburned.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Too strong.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,370
Mr. Gao, there's a Mr. Chen from Fengxian PR who wants to see you.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
Fengxian PR

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Let him in.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,210
Alright.

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,890
He's afraid of getting sunburned.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
We'll continue learning later.

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Hello, Mr. Gao.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,170
I'm Chen Feng from Fengxian PR.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,960
What brings you here?

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,640
I know

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,639
you hired Bai Xiaofei from Purdue PR

44
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,280
to handle the lease termination and relocation matters.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,340
Is there a problem?

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,940
It's like this.

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,000
Due to Bai Xiaofei's arrogance,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,320
the entire farmers' market

49
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
has developed

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,840
a strong aversion to Bai Xiaofei personally.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,360
So I suggest you change to a different person or company.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,560
It might lead to a smoother resolution.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,660
You mean replace her with you?

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,680
Our Fengxian PR

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
has always been dedicated to handling the most complex crisis PR cases,

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
serving the highest-end clients.

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,020
Over the years,

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,600
we've maintained an excellent reputation

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,860
and have never failed.

60
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Quite confident.

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
Actually, the farmers' market

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,079
accepts the terms you proposed.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,940
They just have some concerns.

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,440
Now we just need to find the right person

65
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,079
to alleviate their concerns,

66
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,880
and all problems will be solved.

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,520
And our Fengxian

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
is that right person.

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,720
So confident?

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,360
If we can't handle it,

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,690
we won't charge any fee.

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
If we succeed,

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
we'll only charge 80%

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,000
of Purdue PR's fee.

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Sounds like

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
this is a good option too.

77
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,210
Leave this job to us,

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
and you can rest assured.

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,220
Then I'll wait for your good news.

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,020
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Gao.

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,900
Have a little snack first.

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,160
Sis,

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,890
from the looks of it,

84
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
it must be Chen Feng

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,800
who said something to the merchants,

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,880
so they've been avoiding us.

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,200
It's okay.

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Let's go back to the company first.

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,770
We'll reorganize all the materials again

90
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,480
and then connect with each merchant one by one.

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,810
Come on, come on.

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
Everyone, please gather around for a moment.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
this here

94
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,160
is my cousin, Chen Feng.

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,600
He has secured the final benefits for all of us.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,730
Please take a good look at this.

97
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,640
Thanks to my cousin's

98
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,360
and Gao Qiang's relentless efforts and negotiations,

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Shengqiang Group has finally adopted our proposal.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
According to the plan of ten shops corresponding to each stall,

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,329
we will have a 25% share,

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
while Shengqiang Group will have a 75% share.

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,740
This has been finalized in the current resolution.

104
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,250
Wait,

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,520
how is this different from the previous proposal?

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,650
Oh, the difference is huge.

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
That female PR representative

108
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
was just all talk.

109
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,760
But this one

110
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,880
was negotiated word by word by my cousin,

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,560
solidly agreed upon with Shengqiang Group.

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,010
You really are something, aren't you?

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Sis,

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Bai Xiaofen.

115
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,620
I'm telling you, stop wasting your time.

116
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,120
All cooperative relocation matters for the farmers' market

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,920
have already been fully signed.

118
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
No way.

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,280
What do you mean, 'no way'?

120
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm just afraid you're working hard for nothing,

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,920
so I came here specially to remind you.

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,520
Chen Feng.

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,260
This is a violation of professional ethics.

124
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,360
Kid,

125
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
don't talk nonsense.

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,920
Making it out here depends on your abilities.

127
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,720
If you can't make it in this building in the future,

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,080
you can come to me.

129
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,690
I'll definitely give you a meal to eat.

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,700
Shameless scoundrel.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
Is Mr. Gao satisfied?

132
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,280
Mr. Gao isn't in the office.

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,760
However, he asked me to take you to our club.

134
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,890
to relax and unwind.

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,970
That's true.

136
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
These merchants have been through a lot.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,460
It is indeed time to relax.

138
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,580
This way, Mr. Chen.

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,200
This big corporation is truly impressive.

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,440
They really know how to do things right.

141
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Cousin,

142
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,000
you're really something, aren't you?

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
Pay attention and learn.

144
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,960
This way, Mr. Chen.

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,500
Mr. Gao.

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,920
You're too kind.

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,640
Is there a chair missing?

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,730
No, there isn't.

149
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,700
Mr. Gao, you...

150
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,170
Brother, you...

151
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,800
Mr. Gao.

152
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,760
Mr. Gao.

153
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,400
Mr. Gao.

154
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,570
What do you mean?

155
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
Bai Xiaofei.

156
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
How did you...

157
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,560
Miss Bai,

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
I hope this dinner

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,960
is to your liking.

160
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
Mr. Gao,

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
what exactly do you mean?

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,440
Kids these days lack proper education.

163
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
They even dare to scheme against me.

164
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,960
Today,

165
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll discipline you on behalf of your parents.

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,400
Miss Bai.

167
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,200
This Chen Feng is simply reaping what he sowed.

168
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
So he's harming others and himself.

169
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,760
Although we help people with crisis management,

170
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,160
we must also distinguish right from wrong.

171
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Otherwise, what awaits us

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,940
is a bottomless abyss.

173
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,690
Sister Xiaofei,

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
since you have such a deep connection with Mr. Gao from Shengqiang Group,

175
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,240
you have such a close relationship,

176
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,370
does that mean the nursing home matter

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,720
is settled?

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,289
It's hard to say.

179
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,100
Business is business.

180
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Gao Qiang is a businessman,

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,539
not a philanthropist.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,440
The essence of a businessman is to pursue profit.

183
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,120
So,

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,450
we can't be too optimistic about everything.

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,880
Alright.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
Miss Bai,

187
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,920
Mr. Gao is out of the country these days,

188
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
so he specifically instructed

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
our executive vice president to receive you.

190
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,010
