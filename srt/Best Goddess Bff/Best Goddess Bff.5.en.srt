1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,880
Who was that just now?

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
like a madman.

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,930
I don't know.

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,680
Has the police been called?

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,320
Yes, they have.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,400
The police have already been here.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,130
They took statements and left.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
Xiaofe,

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
what do you think?

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,210
Could this be someone's deliberate revenge?

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,440
Clean up the office.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
Okay.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
Who are you looking for?

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,160
Don't stop me.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,240
Uncle, please calm down.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,210
Bai Xiaofei.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,480
Come out here!

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,120
Who is this person?

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,000
Xiao Yang,

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,020
President Bai.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
go to the police station

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
and drop the case.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Drop the case?

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,120
Did I hear that right?

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,560
Yes,

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,240
you heard correctly.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Drop the case.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,479
Okay.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,280
Sister Xiaofei,

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,410
why do you want to drop the case?

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,900
Come with me to a place.

32
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,570
Alright.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,920
Xiaofe.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,600
This is...

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Stop right there!

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,320
Auntie, I really didn't take it.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
You dare say you didn't take it?

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,400
Did you spend the ten yuan from my purse?

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
How dare you steal money!

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,040
Tell me, is this ten yuan from my purse?

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Did you take the ten yuan?

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,440
If it wasn't you, was it Xiaohua?

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Mom, I saw it.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,890
She took it. She took it all.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,480
It really wasn't me.

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,520
How dare you lie!

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,000
You dare to steal money!

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,660
I'll teach you to steal money!

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,760
Do my homework.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,820
It's due tomorrow.

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,800
Xiaohua, I haven't finished mine yet.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
Do mine first.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Let me tell you something.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
Your parents are already divorced.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
No one wants you anymore.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
If our family hadn't taken you in,

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,000
you'd still be in the countryside with no one to care for you.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
You still want to go to school?

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Not a chance.

60
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,040
From now on, my homework...

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
you'll do it all for me.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Remember, I'm not your cousin.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,660
You'll call me Little Master, got it?

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,400
Eat.

65
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Xiaofe hasn't come back yet, has she?

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,610
she should be back soon.

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,120
Put these two away first.

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,320
You can take them to school to eat later.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
What's going on?

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Xiaofe is also growing.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
None of your business.

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,380
Even eating can't shut you up.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,880
You're driving me crazy.

74
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm so angry!

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,760
This...

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,970
How can there be such a cruel family in this world?

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,920
Isn't this a lack of virtue for eight generations?

78
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,210
It's all in the past.

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,050
We need to allow everything to happen.

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
Once you allow all of this,

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,020
you'll gradually become a soft and relaxed person.

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,210
So you're planning to let them off just like that?

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,770
This isn't about letting them off,

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,970
it's about letting myself off.

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,880
So,

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,760
the one who came to smash things at the company was that second uncle?

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
After all, he raised me.

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,839
Otherwise, I wouldn't be who I am now.

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,900
So what's the deal with him coming to wreck the company?

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,140
Ever since my second aunt passed away in a car accident,

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
my second uncle has been drinking heavily every day.

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
He's also developed some mental issues.

93
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
It comes and goes.

94
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,960
He often says

95
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,080
that it's because of me that his wife died.

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Seeing that he had no one to take care of him,

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,120
I eventually sent him to a nursing home.

98
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
But he occasionally runs away.

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
When he does,

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
he either smashes my car or wrecks my house.

101
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,080
This time he ran to my company.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,440
Indeed,

103
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
it's not that the elderly have turned bad,

104
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,570
but that bad people have grown old.

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,560
So,

106
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,200
what about your younger cousin?

107
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
She went to northern Myanmar a few years ago.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,060
There's been no news of her since.

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
It's good that she's gone.

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,730
She deserves it.

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,800
Let's go.

112
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,340
We'll visit the nursing home.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
You're not going to see him, are you?

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,100
How about we go catch him instead?

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,140
That works.

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,690
Let's go.

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
I want to go home.

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,680
I want to go home.

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
I need to go home.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Grandpa Qian,

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,060
Your son asked me to bring you some candy.

122
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,280
Stop messing around.

123
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
I want to go home.

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,380
It's really pitiful when people get old.

125
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
Manager Bai,

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,200
You're here.

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,159
Director,

128
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,490
is my second uncle here?

129
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,050
I was just about to call you.

130
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
This morning,

131
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,520
he slipped out while the auntie went grocery shopping.

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
He hasn't come back yet.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,040
Did he cause trouble for you again?

134
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
It's more than just trouble.

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,810
He wrecked the company.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm so sorry.

137
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,640
It's okay.

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,130
it's not the first time.

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,120
Oh, right.

140
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Director,

141
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,680
this is this month's

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
donation for the elderly care home.

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,960
Please use it to improve the meals for the seniors.

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,040
Look at you,

145
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,640
Ms. Bai, you're so busy,

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,200
yet you always think of the elderly.

147
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,240
You sponsor our living expenses every month.

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
The seniors have all gained weight.

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,500
They're very content.

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,840
Physical satisfaction is easy,

151
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,360
but mental satisfaction is harder.

152
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
That's right.

153
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
Look at Old Man Qian,

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,040
his children haven't shown up for three months.

155
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,480
Well,

156
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,280
next month I'd like to organize an event for the elderly.

157
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
Let's take the seniors

158
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,880
on an outing to the suburbs to relax.

159
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Do you think that would work?

160
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,960
Ms. Bai,

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,690
you're just too kind-hearted.

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,280
So busy, yet you think of the elderly every day.

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,540
And your second uncle,

164
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
even after all he's done,

165
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,170
you don't hold a grudge.

166
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
It's fine.

167
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,040
People get old,

168
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,100
they all miss home.

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,300
They all need care.

170
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
We're young,

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
able-bodied.

172
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
If we don't take care of them,

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
when we get old,

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,530
who will take care of us?

175
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
That's right, Ms. Bai.

176
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,640
I can't argue with you.

177
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:07,960
Come,

178
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
let's go inside for some tea.

179
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,280
Your second uncle's caretaker

180
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,080
should be back soon.

181
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,760
Let's go.

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,320
The moment I wasn't paying attention,

183
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,680
he went out and caused trouble.

184
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
If the police station hadn't said

185
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
the company withdrew the case,

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,960
I think

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
that troublesome old man

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
wouldn't be allowed to come back this time.

189
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Don't let her bother you.

190
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,250
She's just a troublemaker.

191
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Director,

192
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
I've brought him back for you.

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
President Bai, you're back.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,800
President Bai,

195
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,560
you're here.

196
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,450
Look at this bad old man,

197
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,480
he's causing trouble for you again.

198
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,280
It's alright.

199
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,159
I'll handle it.

200
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,820
Auntie Niu,

201
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Uncle,

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,520
are the police here?

203
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,380
Don't touch me,

204
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,120
you troublemaker.

205
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Uncle,

206
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,920
I know you blame me in your heart.

207
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
If it wasn't for me when I was young,

208
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,440
begging grandma to let me go to school in the city,

209
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
that wouldn't have happened to your family.

210
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
It's you,

211
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,159
you're just a troublemaker.

212
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,200
If it weren't for you,

213
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,330
our family wouldn't have been ruined.

214
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,740
You wicked old man!

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,280
It was clearly your entire family who bullied others,

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,210
and now you're trying to shift the blame, aren't you?

217
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Uncle, I know you have resentment in your heart,

218
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,130
but you're getting old now.

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Can you please let me take good care of you?

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,330
Just stay here peacefully,

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
and stop causing trouble outside.

222
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,160
Okay?

223
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,960
Ms. Bai,

224
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,690
Don't worry.

225
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,300
We'll take care of your uncle's matters.

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,700
President Bai,

227
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,480
I know you're in public relations,

228
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,520
specializing in solving problems for people.

229
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,280
Now,

230
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,039
the nursing home has encountered a very tricky problem.

231
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,159
I wonder if you could

232
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,280
find someone to help us coordinate this matter.

233
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,880
Director,

234
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,679
please don't be polite.

235
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,720
Just tell me directly.

236
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,580
It's like this.

237
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
Previously, this land for the nursing home

238
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,640
was collective land owned by the village.

239
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
The township also specially approved it

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,520
as land for elderly care facilities to take care of the seniors.

241
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,280
But a new township head has recently arrived,

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,520
saying it's for

243
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
attracting investment.

244
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,560
They've included the nursing home

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,220
in the development zone plan.

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
They say they want to build a leisure tourism eco-city.

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
They want to relocate the nursing home

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,320
to the oil well area ten kilometers away.

249
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,620
The air quality there is poor,

250
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,720
transportation is inconvenient,

251
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,760
and medical facilities are inadequate.

252
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,680
It's really not friendly to these elderly people.

253
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,920
Director,

254
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,850
why are you only telling me about such a big issue now?

255
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
I just received the notice myself.

256
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Now that you're here,

257
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
I've told you about it.

258
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,720
Could you find someone to help

259
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,250
and coordinate this for us?

260
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Do you know

261
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
the name of the company developing this tourism eco-city?

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
I heard

263
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,400
it's called Shengqiang Group.

264
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,680
The boss seems to

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
have the surname Gao.

266
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
Shengqiang Group.

267
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,280
