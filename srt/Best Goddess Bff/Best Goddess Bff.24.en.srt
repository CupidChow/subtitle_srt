1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,480
Life is like a maze.

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,600
We spend the first half of our lives searching for the entrance,

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,360
yet we spend the second half looking for the exit.

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,050
Beautiful things are not without cracks,

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,650
but rather full of cracks without falling apart.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
Often,

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
what blinds our eyes

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,300
is not an illusion,

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,800
but an obsession.

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,440
And if we are alive,

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
we need coordinates.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,500
Although we can't go back,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,360
we can still see it.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,530
Did you find her?

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,200
She's such a fast runner.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,890
We finally ran into her.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,260
But unfortunately, we missed her again.

18
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,640
I know where we can find her now.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
How?

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,440
Xiaofe,

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,890
look.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
Yukun Auto Repair.

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,040
Brother Kun.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,520
Right?

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,660
So you know my name.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,820
I heard them call you that yesterday.

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
I want to see Bai Xiaohua.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,740
Get out of here.

29
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,840
There's no one here by that name.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,360
The girl who was with you yesterday.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,090
That's my cousin, Bai Xiaohua.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,800
We've been looking for her for four whole years.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
Because of searching for her,

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,450
her mother has passed away.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Her father

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,450
is also having some mental issues.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,850
I don't know anyone you're talking about.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,400
Why are you being so unreasonable?

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm not educated.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,079
What reason should I understand?

41
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,680
This is shameless behavior.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,240
Beautiful lady,

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,800
How dare you speak to my brother like that?

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you asking for trouble?

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,600
What?

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
You want to try my scissor kick, huh?

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,280
Come on,

48
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,540
stick out your leg and try.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,120
Let's go,

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,180
hurry up and leave.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,040
Go, go, go.

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,040
Bai Xiaohua,

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,800
I know we had deep misunderstandings in the past,

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,520
but now

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
we've all grown up.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,800
We now know right from wrong,

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,520
what is right,

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,400
and what is wrong.

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,920
Your mother has passed away,

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,400
and your father has some mental issues.

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,160
We need to take care of him together.

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,600
Should we

63
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,160
still give up our most precious family bonds

64
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,220
for the sake of past ignorant vanity?

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
We have no one left in this world.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,600
we have no family left.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Don't talk about this here.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,329
Let's go.

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
The person you're looking for isn't here at all.

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Come on, let's go.

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,840
Let's go, let's go.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,100
Let's hurry and leave.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,700
Kun'er.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Xiaohua.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,460
Sister,

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
I was immature before.

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,780
I sincerely apologize to you here today.

78
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,060
Please forgive me.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,290
It's good that you're back.

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,280
Look.

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,820
Who's here?

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,850
Xiaofei.

84
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,160
Dad.

85
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,160
Dad.

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,760
Dad.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,440
Dad.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
It's okay, child.

90
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
It's good that you're back.

91
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,090
The power of love

92
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,050
helped my cousin find her way home,

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
and reconciled me with my uncle's family.

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,760
We've become a loving family again.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Qingqing,

96
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,650
are you sure about this?

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,620
Everyone needs to learn to grow on their own.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
I finally understand now

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,970
that the best happiness

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
is not about confining someone,

101
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,520
but accepting all the flaws and imperfections.

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,530
One of life's greatest acts of courage

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
is to maintain the ability to trust and love

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,930
even after experiencing deception and hurt.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
Life is a form of endurance.

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
We must learn to support ourselves.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Many things,

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,880
when we truly realize

109
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,020
their preciousness and importance,

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
have often been irreversibly lost.

111
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,120
Every time we grow,

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,520
it starts with a mistake.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
Xu Yue

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,370
What are you doing here?

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Qingqing.

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,220
I was wrong.

117
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,240
I truly know I was wrong.

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
Please don't leave me, okay?

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,490
Alright.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,930
It's no big deal.

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,320
I made you lose our child.

123
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
We didn't lose it.

124
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,530
it's still here.

125
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,620
it hasn't even formed yet.

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,810
What's the rush?

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,170
Then you just...

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,810
Brother,

129
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,220
are you stupid?

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,560
Qingqing has severe morning sickness.

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,090
We just came for a check-up.

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,900
You didn't abort the baby?

133
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,400
Why would I abort our child?

134
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Xu Yue,

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
if you don't want to raise this child,

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll raise it myself.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I want to.

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
Of course I want to raise it.

139
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,980
I'll definitely raise it.

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,040
President Bai,

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
why are you here?

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Yu Zhen's mother.

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,880
President Bai,

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,540
you already know everything.

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,060
when I found out

147
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,410
that your first husband's surname was Yu,

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,060
I pretty much understood.

149
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,080
I didn't set the fire on purpose.

150
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,760
That day, I missed my daughter so much.

151
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,560
I was so angry that she was killed.

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,540
You were even doing PR for the person who killed her.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,880
So I just...

154
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,679
Auntie Li,

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
it really wasn't Wu Yuxuan's fault.

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,679
We have already submitted

157
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,480
the evidence of the real culprit who killed Yu Zhen

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,740
to the police station.

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,929
I believe the real culprit will be punished soon.

160
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,020
Thank you, President Bai.

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
i'm sorry.

164
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Xiaofe.

165
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,480
Will you join Sheng Qiang's side?

166
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,840
Of course not.

167
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,800
We're not on the same page with them at all.

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,200
Let's just be ourselves.

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
In this world,

170
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,720
no one is completely happy.

171
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,020
What we call happiness

172
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
is about recognizing one's limitations

173
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
and being content with those limitations,

174
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,060
being at peace,

175
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,480
not causing trouble.

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,450
That is the greatest kindness to others and oneself.

177
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
In this world,

178
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
no one will always be with someone else.

179
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,320
Unless

180
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,840
it's us stubborn ones.

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,100
Cast

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,120
