1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,970
One of them ran that way.

2
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,740
Chase them!

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
Boss, there are military police.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,040
Don't let any of them escape.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,840
Kill them all.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,720
All of you, stop right there!

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,820
Don't be afraid, hold onto me.

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,400
What's wrong?

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,720
Did you have another nightmare?

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
Honey, please don't leave me.

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,920
Okay?

12
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,680
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,210
How could that be possible?

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me see.

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,680
What is it?

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,039
You're under too much stress.

17
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,640
Is that so?

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,490
Don't overthink it.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Do you remember where your hometown is?

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,620
How about I take you there for a visit?

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,259
To clear your mind.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,080
I still can't remember.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,680
It's okay.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm here.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,020
Three hundred.

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,000
No problem.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,130
Don't worry.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,440
The factory is big enough.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,840
I assure you, it won't delay your business.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Xiaoqi.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Mr. Chen,

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
you called for me?

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
Quickly notify Cao Xin.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,760
Have the car factory select 300 scrapped vehicles.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
As soon as the money arrives, start refurbishing immediately.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,330
Alright, I'll tell him right away.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I don't need to know how you make your money.

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,560
Mr. Sang,

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
you just need to tell me

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
what problems exist with the product,

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,440
and what room and methods there are for solving them.

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,840
The remaining PR issues,

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,890
leave them to me.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,810
Alright.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll meet with you after I finish the meeting with the product department.

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay.

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,810
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Sang.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,840
Xiao Zhi.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,980
Ms. Bai.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,730
How's the situation

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
with the border police station?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,560
That incident was quite complicated.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
It was handled directly by the department.

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
We're still trying to find ways to inquire about it.

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,120
The main thing is to clarify the list of casualties.

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,850
Understood.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,320
Come.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
Xu Lang,

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,960
time for soup.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,840
You.

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,100
What are you doing?

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,610
It's nothing. Just feeding you some soup.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,720
If it's just soup, then fine.

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
why all this fuss?

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,200
you gave me quite a scare.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm just trying to make things less boring for you.

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Put it down first.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,410
Well, thank you very much then.

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,020
I don't have a brother, only a sister.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,690
She can't avenge me.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,140
That's not necessarily true.

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,700
Sister Youyou,

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
Just call me Youyou from now on.

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,440
if things keep going this way,

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
I'll have to start calling you sister-in-law.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,160
Sister-in-law? Really?

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
If you had come any later,

78
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
the person lying here would be bleeding from seven orifices.

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
It's good to bleed a bit more.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,600
It'd be best if all the blood in your body was replaced.

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,000
You...

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,770
Are you even my sister anymore?

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Youyou.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,100
Did you eat something bad?

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,210
Brother Kun,

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Cao Xin just called.

87
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,400
He wants us to go to the junkyard and pick out 300 scrapped cars.

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,860
We're to start refurbishing them as soon as the money arrives.

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,700
Then take them to the factory.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,290
Alright.

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,440
You guys get ready.

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Come with me to pick out the cars.

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:55,960
Okay!

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,020
Alright, alright.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
What about the product situation?

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
That's about it.

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Now it's up to Director Bai to turn the tide.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
Director Sang,

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,160
since I dared to take on your case,

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
I have the ability and confidence

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
to handle it well for you.

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,760
Director Bai is truly young and accomplished.

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
And she's beautiful too.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,260
It's really enviable.

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,820
Director Sang, you must be talking about yourself.

106
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,760
Sis,

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,040
Mr. Sang, please have a seat.

108
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,320
The specific details of the contract signing

109
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,840
will be explained to you by my colleague.

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,360
I have to leave for some business.

111
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
No problem, you go ahead.

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,290
Alright.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,130
Mr. Sang,

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,680
let's take a look at the specific contract.

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,159
Are you sure that

116
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,520
Bai Xiaohua is not on the death list?

117
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm absolutely certain.

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,580
I've already carefully verified it.

119
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,650
That's good.

120
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,880
Alright,

121
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,409
Xiaozhi,

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,200
your next task

123
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,320
is mainly to help me gather information

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,080
and see if you can find any trace of Bai Xiaohua.

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,600
Understood.

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,730
I'll get right on it.

127
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,640
Yes.

128
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Anything with wheels in the factory,

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,730
we want all of it.

130
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,409
Alright.

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Kun, how about it?

132
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,200
Three hundred shouldn't be a problem, right?

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,480
The money's not an issue.

134
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,840
There's no problem on my end.

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,320
You can rest assured about our side.

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,360
As for my cousin's side,

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,420
it's the same both domestically and internationally.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,850
Have a drink.

139
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,840
Kun,

140
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,900
please, you first.

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
What's wrong?

142
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,080
Why so serious?

143
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,159
Xiaofe

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
I don't know what to do.

145
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,090
Don't worry.

146
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,850
Have you told Xu Yue?

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
I don't want to pressure him.

148
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,940
and I don't want

149
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,730
to make him feel like I'm threatening him.

150
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,690
How can this be called a threat?

151
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,940
This is the fruit of your love.

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,900
You need to bear this responsibility together.

153
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,480
But

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I have nothing right now.

155
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,320
This child

156
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,920
is it coming a bit too early?

157
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Most things in our lives

158
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
are not decided by us.

159
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,169
When you've made all the preparations and plans,

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,559
unexpected things

161
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,559
will break all your plans.

162
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,640
At this time,

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,760
what we can do

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,370
is not to resist,

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
but to accept it gracefully.

166
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
We need to be with someone

167
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
who is close to our soul.

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Together.

169
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
When you meet him,

170
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,680
in his eyes,

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,440
you will see yourself.

172
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,200
So,

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,440
do you see yourself in Xu Yue's eyes?

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
Then you should go together

175
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,740
to face this challenge

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,400
and your new identities.

177
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
Xiaofe,

178
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
Once I finish modifying these cars,

179
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll build you a big mansion,

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
making your dream come true.

181
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,880
So you won't have to squeeze into this small shabby house with me anymore.

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,520
Um...

183
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,120
I...

184
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,920
What's wrong?

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you pregnant?

186
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,860
Cast

187
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,880
Dong Xuanyu as Zeng Qingqing

188
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,200
Yu You as Xu Youyou

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,480
Yuan Mingze as Xu Yue

190
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,840
Tang Duoer as Yang Xingyu
