1
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,560
Xiaofe,

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,120
what do you think?

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,080
If Dean Wei isn't the arsonist,

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,930
then who could it be?

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,380
That's exactly what I'm most worried about.

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,400
I've been trying

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,680
to draw out the person hiding in the shadows,

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,340
but they won't come out at all.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,730
Could it be Chen Feng from Fengxian PR?

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,900
This person may be shameless,

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,320
but he wouldn't dare to do something like this.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Then who could it be?

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,420
It's very possible

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,330
that this was just an accident.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
They didn't intentionally set the fire,

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,860
and it wasn't aimed at you.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,980
That's right, Xiaofe.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,440
What do you think?

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,770
Could it be that we're overthinking this?

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,720
My intuition tells me

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,759
this is definitely not an accident.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,420
Of course this is not an accident.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,850
Mr. Chen,

24
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,970
the car is ready.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,729
Let's go.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,420
Cousin,

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,980
He's just a car washer.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
How could he have so many scrap cars?

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,039
Don't underestimate the car washer.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,240
He owns several scrap car yards.

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,380
If we follow the plan we agreed on before,

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
it could be a small fortune.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Let's go meet him.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,690
Alright.

35
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,840
The boss, Brother Kun,

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
is already waiting for you.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,450
Let's go.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,620
Cousin,

39
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,200
let me introduce you to someone.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,329
This is Brother Kun,

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,079
the boss here.

42
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,010
The head honcho.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,960
You wanted to see me?

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,220
Yes.

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,170
We want to do a

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
big deal with you.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,520
How big?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,200
A million?

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,930
Ten million?

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
It's a small goal.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,930
A small goal?

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,290
Brother Kun,

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,480
if we pull this off, forget about one small goal,

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
even two

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,730
would be no problem.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,460
Don't blow your own horn too much.

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Those few pieces of junk in the factory,

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,080
how could they be worth a small fortune?

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
I work in international public relations.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,800
As it happens, I'm abroad,

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,640
and some friends want to buy a large number of scrapped cars.

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,560
Each car

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
will be purchased at the market price of a new vehicle.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,820
You just need to refurbish them a bit.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,000
As for whether they can be driven or not,

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,680
it doesn't matter.

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
Buying scrapped cars at new car market prices?

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
What kind of logic is that?

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,780
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,680
Do you think I'm uneducated?

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,010
Do you take me for a fool?

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,450
Brother Kun,

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,730
listen to me.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,600
Let me explain.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,460
For these cars,

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
the money from the sales,

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,920
20 percent

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,240
will be your refurbishment fee.

79
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
10 percent

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,480
will be our company's PR and marketing fee.

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,880
The remaining 70 percent

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,220
will be transferred to the client's designated company in China.

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Even 20 percent is quite high.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,130
These scrapped cars

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,320
are worth less than 1 percent of their original price.

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,720
Including refurbishment,

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160
it's a tenfold profit.

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,240
I don't know how good this guy is at repairs,

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
but his math skills are pretty good.

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,130
Isn't this just money laundering?

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,650
Brother Kun,

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,140
What do you mean by money laundering?

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,720
These days,

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
some provide the vehicles,

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
some provide the money.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
It's all legitimate.

97
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,409
you're good,

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,010
I'm good,

99
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
everyone's good.

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
I want to add two more points.

101
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Deal.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,410
Xiaofei.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
The person who helped us investigate has news.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,120
one good news,

105
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,850
one bad news.

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Which one do you want to hear first?

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's hear the bad news first.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,520
The bad news is,

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,320
in their compound in Myanmar,

110
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,040
they couldn't find anyone named Xiao Hua.

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
She might have

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
changed her name.

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,930
But the good news is,

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,450
on the smuggler's list,

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
they found a record of Xiao Hua

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
sneaking back into the country two years ago.

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Sneaking back into the country?

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
Yes, sneaking back in.

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,080
You mean

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,840
she might have returned to China two years ago?

121
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
I can't be certain,

122
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,450
but it's highly likely.

123
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Okay, thank you,

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Youyou.

125
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Don't mention it.

126
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,760
I'm heading back tomorrow.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,159
Weren't you supposed to stay with Yu Xuan for the filming?

128
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,090
I can't anymore.

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,320
There are a few artists

130
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,880
with urgent endorsement deals to negotiate.

131
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Manager Yang wants me to return as soon as possible.

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,200
Alright,

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
take care.

134
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,500
See you.

135
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,540
See you.

136
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,740
Cousin,

137
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,920
you really have connections.

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,780
Following you,

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,120
getting rich is just around the corner.

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,640
What did this Brother Kun do before?

141
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,840
When did you two meet?

142
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,440
I heard

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,080
he used to be involved in Mark Six lottery with some people.

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
Later, when the factory closed down,

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,290
he started doing car dismantling.

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,880
Listen to me carefully,

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,740
don't you dare cause any trouble.

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Don't worry,

149
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,700
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize the money.

150
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,760
Kun'er.

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Can we really become rich?

152
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,650
I don't know.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,730
Let's take it one step at a time.

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
We've been together

155
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,810
for about two years now, right?

156
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
Two years

157
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
and three months.

158
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,170
It's so good to have you.

159
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,130
If it weren't for you that time,

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
I might

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
have really ended up feeding the fish.

162
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Why are you talking about this?

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,410
Isn't it all in the past?

164
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Then do you know

165
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,960
when I get rich,

166
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,890
what I want to do?

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
What do you want to do?

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
I want to have your children,

169
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,300
lots and lots of children.

170
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
Then buy a huge, enormous mansion,

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,040
where our whole family

172
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
can live without a care in the world.

173
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,050
Okay,

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
whatever you say.

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,720
What are you doing?

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,850
I haven't finished wiping my feet yet.

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,120
What?

178
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,460
The bed collapsed.

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,130
You did this.

180
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,520
Qingqing,

181
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I always thought you were a lady.

182
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,820
I didn't expect you to be such a tiger.

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,290
I don't even know what to say to you two.

184
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,580
Tell me,

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,920
even if you're young and passionate,

186
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,380
and want to... you know...

187
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,440
couldn't you be a little more polite?

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
a little gentler?

189
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
Just look at this.

190
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,010
Look at the state you've left Xu Yue in.

191
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,320
Well...

192
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,570
It's not Qingqing's fault.

193
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,679
It might be...

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,400
I bought a bed that wasn't very sturdy.

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Can you buy a sturdier bed then?

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,120
If you keep this up...

197
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
How am I supposed to explain this to Xu Youyou?

198
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,409
Alright.

199
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,799
Explain what?

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Isn't this great?

201
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
You're back, Youyou.

202
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,810
I came straight here as soon as I got off the plane.

203
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
Sister Youyou,

204
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,280
Xu Yue.

205
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,520
Finally, someone's here to deal with you for me.

206
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Take it easy.

208
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Good job pinning him down.

209
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,920
You're the one who needs to discipline him this time.

210
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,180
Oh, by the way, Xiaofe,

211
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
I bought this from the smugglers.

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,930
Their list recorded...

213
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,720
Two years ago, there was a...

214
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
Chinese woman named Bai Xiaohua.

215
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
She secretly re-entered the country through them.

216
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,500
Take a look.

217
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
Do they have any other more detailed information?

218
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,080
They're all illegal immigrants.

219
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,560
It's already pretty good to have a name recorded.

220
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,220
However...

221
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,050
There's also some bad news.

222
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,160
What is it?

223
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,200
There was an incident on the Mekong River that time.

224
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
Out of twenty illegal immigrants...

225
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,440
