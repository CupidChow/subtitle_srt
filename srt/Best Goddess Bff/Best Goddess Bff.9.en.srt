1
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,040
Miss Bai,

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
this way, please.

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,260
You like to eat it this way too?

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
I used to see my brother eat like this all the time.

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,680
I tried it myself,

6
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
and now I can't change the habit.

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,120
Once many habits are formed,

8
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,690
they're hard to change.

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,760
Margaret,

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,890
give it a try.

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
Very good.

12
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,600
Rich and fragrant,

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,340
with a lingering aftertaste.

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Just that one sip

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,680
could probably fund an entire nursing home, right?

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,740
I knew you were going to bring that up.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,539
I've been concerned about it.

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,720
I've looked at the eco-city planning proposal.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,600
I've seen it.

20
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,220
You really chose a prime location back then.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,800
That nursing home you mentioned

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,080
is exactly where the eco-city's central building is supposed to be,

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,140
which is essentially the heart of the entire eco-city.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't worry,

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,720
I've already thought of a solution.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,120
The nursing home will definitely need to be relocated,

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,600
I can give you the site

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,440
of the clubhouse 100 meters away from the original location.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,280
You can simply convert the clubhouse into a nursing home.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
If that's really the case,

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,840
I must thank you on behalf of those dozens of elderly people.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Thank you.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,170
Don't thank me too soon.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
We have our own requests as well.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,300
After all, business is business.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
Everything in this world

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,690
is obtained through exchange.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,800
So,

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
what do you need me

40
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,960
to exchange?

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
Three things.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,460
What three things?

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,360
First,

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,490
there's a quarry north of the village.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,360
It's run by the village chief's nephew

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,690
and his gang of friends.

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,720
They're known as the Red Tails.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
They're stubborn and uncooperative.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,360
We've negotiated many times but can't reach an agreement.

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,620
It's seriously affecting our progress.

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,320
No problem,

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,700
I'll go negotiate.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,280
Second,

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Director Jia from the Environmental Protection Bureau has a wife, Liu Yan.

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
She's addicted to gambling,

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,480
especially loves playing mahjong.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,800
Their child is in the last year of high school,

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,880
but she doesn't care.

59
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,720
Director Jia is very troubled by this.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
Director Jia has always been very supportive of our work,

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
so we want to help ease his troubles.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,060
I'll find a way to help.

63
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,240
Miss Bai,

64
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,280
you're really a straightforward person.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,240
So what's the third thing?

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
The third thing

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
shouldn't be difficult for you.

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,280
A true friend is hard to find, even with a thousand pieces of gold.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
After you complete the first two tasks,

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,480
we'll discuss the third one.

71
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,680
Wei.

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,200
Look.

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,130
Someone's here.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
Who else could it be but you?

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,840
Can't you see I'm eating hot pot?

76
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Xiao... Xiaofei.

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
You're still in the mood for hot pot?

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,760
It's not like that.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,800
What wind

80
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
blew you here?

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,770
It's signed.

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,370
It's Sheng Qiang again.

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,520
No.

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,320
Sister,

85
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
how could you also aid the tyrant in his cruelty?

86
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Who's the tyrant and who's being cruel?

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,940
Take a look.

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,880
These are all materials about your illegal sand transportation and private mining.

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Sister,

90
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
didn't you say before that as long as I don't touch prostitution, gambling, or drugs,

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,800
I could handle the rest as I see fit?

92
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,520
Illegal activities are still not allowed.

93
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Who are you guys?

94
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,200
What business is it of yours whether it's illegal or not?

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
You're asking for trouble, aren't you?

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Get lost.

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,690
Hong Wei, this is...

98
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,930
This is my sister, call her Sister Fei.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Call her.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,370
Sister Fei, Sister Fei.

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,140
Sister,

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
let's talk inside.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,960
Go, go, go.

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Calm down.

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,940
Be careful.

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,650
What's going on?

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Behave yourself.

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,850
Return to society soon.

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,940
Be a useful person.

110
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,770
Stand properly.

111
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,680
Welcome!

112
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
I heard you just got

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,440
dual master's degrees in psychology and law.

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
The children here,

115
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,280
unlike children from other places,

116
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,600
need guidance from talented individuals like you.

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,159
Wang,

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,960
you're too kind.

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,090
I'll do my very best.

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,290
Hongwei.

121
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
This is your social science tutoring.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Teacher Bai Xiaofei.

123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
You need to behave well.

124
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,020
Strive to return to society as soon as possible.

125
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Teacher,

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
it's class time now,

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
not your mealtime.

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
don't think

129
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,700
you can bribe me with a few duck necks.

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
What if I add a few more?

131
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,250
Do you believe in light?

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,320
Light?

133
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,060
There's no such thing as light in this world.

134
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,140
Of course there is.

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,960
Look here.

136
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,930
It's for you.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
You're really silly.

138
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
What's wrong with being a little silly?

139
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,640
You need to believe

140
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
that what can dispel all the gloom

141
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
is only that light.

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
As long as there's light in your heart,

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,720
sunshine will eventually shine over the land.

144
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,800
Look.

145
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Teacher, something's wrong!

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,960
There's trouble!

147
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,490
Let's go.

148
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,440
Stop!

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,290
Nobody move!

150
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,940
Release him immediately!

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Stay back!

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Hong Wei, what are you doing?

153
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,799
Watch out!

154
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,640
You're not taking quitting gambling seriously.

155
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Why are you guys fighting again?

156
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,640
It's okay.

157
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
it's alright now.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,570
everything's fine.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,640
They say when an avalanche occurs,

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
not a single snowflake is innocent.

161
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
But they will eventually melt together under the sun,

162
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,800
turning into a warm, gentle stream,

163
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
nourishing every brave soul.

164
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,720
Here.

165
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
I've put it on for you.

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Thank you.

167
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,580
Are you sure you want to wear it around your neck?

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,650
Didn't you tell me to believe in the light?

169
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Doesn't it look good?

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
It looks nice.

171
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,010
Here's 10,000 yuan I've saved.

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,100
Take it and see what you can do with it.

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
Can I do anything with it?

174
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,400
As long as you stay away from prostitution, gambling, and drugs,

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,660
anything else is fine.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,620
Cast

177
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,000
