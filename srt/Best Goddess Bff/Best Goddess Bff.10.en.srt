1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Sis,

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,040
it's not that I don't want to give up the quarry.

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,560
It's just that these quarry workers

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,360
are all surplus labor from various villages.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,890
You know,

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,560
they don't have much education.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,620
If I shut this down,

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,300
where will they make a living?

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,400
I've already discussed all of this with Shengqiang Group.

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,440
The quarry workers can be hired in the eco-city in the future.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,120
Security guards, cleaners,

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,160
sanitation workers, maintenance staff, these positions

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,760
can be offered to them first.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
After it's closed,

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
what can I do?

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,840
All the road paving in the eco-city

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,039
and exterior wall decoration can be given to you.

18
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,400
I...

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
Did I hear that right?

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,760
You heard correctly.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,400
I know you're quite familiar with stone materials.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,200
They happen to need that expertise,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,130
so you can help oversee it for them.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,080
Believe in the light.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
We must believe in the light.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,140
With your word,

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,850
I'll shut it down tomorrow.

28
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,360
Oh, right.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,280
There's one more thing

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,479
I need you to do for me.

31
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,320
Your business is my business,

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,640
sis.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
Go ahead.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
That's it.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Sis,

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,160
don't worry.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
I know what I'm doing.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,330
Take it easy.

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,009
Goodbye.

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Sis,

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,490
take it easy.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,130
Don't see us off.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
We can go by ourselves.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,540
Wait a moment, sis.

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,600
Xiaolong, Xiaohu.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,560
Did you get the stuff?

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,120
Hurry up.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,530
Brother Wei,

49
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
coming.

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,919
Quick.

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,000
What's all this?

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,120
This is Brother Wei's private collection.

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
This is so cool.

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,480
The duck necks are free now.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Hurry up and load it into the car for me.

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,570
Alright!

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,329
hurry up!

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,079
Oh, right.

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,500
Remember what I told you earlier.

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,440
Don't worry.

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,370
I'm good at this.

62
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,180
Take care, sis.

63
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,300
Take care, sis.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Take care, ladies.

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,560
Take care.

66
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,480
You two,

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,690
come with me.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,480
Where are we going?

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,010
Where to?

70
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,329
To play mahjong.

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,500
Where are you from?

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
I reserved this room.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
You're Sister Lin, right?

74
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,760
Yes.

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
Sister Zhang and Sister Xu can't make it due to some matters.

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm their cousin.

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm here to fill in.

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Those two unreliable ones.

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,580
Please, have a seat first.

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,250
Alright.

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
Yan, where are you now?

82
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,680
On my way.

83
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,140
Hurry up, hurry up.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,640
Have they arrived?

85
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
Those two unreliable ones.

86
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,640
they have something urgent today.

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,700
They can't make it.

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
What should we do then?

89
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
Someone has already filled in.

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,800
Alright.

91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,640
I'll be there soon, wait for me.

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,770
It's disconnected.

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

94
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm late.

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
You're finally here.

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,079
We've been worried sick.

97
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,120
Don't even mention it.

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
The kid has midterm exams today.

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
His father insisted that I take him.

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
It's so annoying.

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
He's old enough now.

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
Yet they still insist on you taking him?

103
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,840
Tell me about it.

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
But a stepmom is still a mom.

105
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,880
If I don't take care of it,

106
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,720
my husband

107
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,780
would give me hell.

108
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,160
He'd have to eat you every day to keep that up.

109
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,220
You're such a pain.

110
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Come on, let's go.

111
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,600
Oh, right.

112
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
These two are Xiao Xue's cousins.

113
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
They're here to join us.

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,440
This is Sister Yan.

115
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Hello, Sister Yan.

116
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Please, sit down, sit down.

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
In a bit.

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,060
Give me a few more rounds, sis.

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,200
No problem.

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm good at this.

121
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,480
You see,

122
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,329
young people

123
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,450
have potential.

124
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,340
Two bamboo.

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,840
Take.

126
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
One ten thousand.

127
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,300
Six bamboo.

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,000
Take.

129
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Winning on a kong.

130
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Nine dots.

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Pong.

132
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,540
Self-draw.

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,780
Self-draw.

134
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,840
Self-draw.

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
One of characters.

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,200
Kong.

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,540
I self-drew again.

139
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,080
No way.

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
What did you eat for lunch?

141
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,480
Are your hands that skilled?

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
We're all beginners.

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
Maybe it's just beginner's luck.

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Don't give me that.

145
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,560
You're playing dumb to take advantage of us.

146
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,020
Yan'er,

147
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,300
we might lose everything here today.

148
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,120
Let's play two more rounds.

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Let's continue.

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
I don't believe this.

151
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Come on, let's go.

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Six ten thousand.

153
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,170
I've won.

154
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
Won again.

155
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,340
This is never-ending.

156
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,490
Let's keep playing.

157
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,180
Sure, we can keep playing.

158
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,320
However,

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,620
Sister Yan,

160
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,620
Sister Lin,

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,440
you two

162
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,500
need to settle the bill first.

163
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,860
Sister Yan,

164
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,760
you owe

165
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,560
88,000.

166
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Sister Lin,

167
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
you owe 66,000.

168
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,960
Do you two

169
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
want to pay in cash

170
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,940
or by transfer?

171
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,060
Is it really that much?

172
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,760
There are so many people watching.

173
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,420
We won't default on our debts.

174
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,200
Right.

175
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,170
I'll give my husband a call.

176
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,340
Sister Lin.

177
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll call my husband too.

178
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,760
Honey,

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,180
What are you doing?

180
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,080
I'm having dinner with the leaders from the provincial government.

181
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
I see.

182
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
My best friend

183
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes?

184
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,480
is sick

185
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,040
and urgently needs 100,000 yuan.

186
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,640
She lost at mahjong again, didn't she?

187
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm not a bank.

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,860
What are you doing?

189
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Come on, hurry up.

190
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,020
Let's have a drink.

191
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,090
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

192
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Yan Jie.

193
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,440
Yan Jie.

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
Someone's looking for you at the back door.

195
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,120
Coming.

196
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,180
What are you doing?

197
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,920
Let go!

198
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Help!

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,080
Let go!

200
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,640
Get down!

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,170
Let me go!

202
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm not going!

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,960
Let me go!

204
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Let me go!

205
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,920
Are you crazy?

206
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,090
This is kidnapping, you know that?

207
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,960
Don't you know who my husband is?

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
Yan Jie.

209
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Debts must be paid.

210
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,570
it's only right and proper.

211
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,480
Even if your husband is the king of heaven,

212
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
you still have to pay up, don't you?

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I never said I wouldn't pay you back.

214
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,560
My husband is at a business dinner.

215
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,420
When he's done,

216
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
he'll definitely give me the money.

217
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,560
Well then, I'll just have to entertain myself a bit too.

218
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,520
What are you doing?

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,780
Don't come any closer!

220
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Bring her in.

221
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,290
Let's go.

222
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Lin.

223
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,560
Lin.

224
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,740
How did you get caught too?

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,900
Is this really necessary?

226
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,650
I never said I wouldn't pay you.

227
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,160
Speak up.

228
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,760
Yan,

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,890
it's all Sister Lin's fault for wronging you.

230
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,960
What do you mean?

231
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,000
Yan Jie,

232
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,280
this good friend of yours

233
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,500
has been setting you up all along.

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
That Sister Lin and Sister Xu

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,520
are all her accomplices.

236
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,560
Only you,

237
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
stupid as you are, got sold out

238
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,930
and you're still counting your money.

239
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,640
Lin,

240
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,640
is it true?

241
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
How could you do this?

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,860
I was wondering why I kept losing.

243
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,340
I even helped you with your tea business.

244
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
How can you face me?

245
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,080
You've gone too far!

246
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,620
I'll beat you to death!

247
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
Stop it.

248
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,220
Sister Fei.

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,560
In fact, nine out of ten gamblers lose.

250
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,760
There's rarely such thing as real luck.

251
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,760
This...

252
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,820
Isn't this just like in Hong Kong movies?

253
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
In reality,

254
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,200
it's even more ridiculous than that.

255
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,880
Yan Jie,

256
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,120
actually,

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
when I was playing cards with Xiaolong earlier,

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
I was cheating and switching cards the whole time.

259
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,090
You just didn't notice.

260
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,080
After playing mahjong for so many years,

261
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,940
you've been playing for nothing.

262
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,600
Yan Jie,

263
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
look who's here.

264
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Honey!

265
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
Darling!

266
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,480
Honey!

267
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,160
What took you so long?

268
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,300
You scared me to death.

270
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,480
It's okay, it's okay now.

271
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,010
I couldn't see you anymore.

272
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,120
Lanlan,

273
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,650
thank you so much this time.

274
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Director Jia,

275
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
if you want to thank someone,

276
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
thank this Miss Bai.

277
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
She's the one who helped you.

278
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,160
Miss Bai,

279
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
I won't bother with words of thanks.

280
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Come over for tea when you're free.

281
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,040
Talented individuals like yourself,

282
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,840
we are very willing

283
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,770
to cooperate with and support you.

284
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,960
Then I thank you, Director Jia.

285
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
I should be thanking you.

286
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,040
Do come by.

287
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
Honey, let's go home.

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,320
I've prepared some bird's nest soup for you.

289
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,040
Honey,

290
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
you're still the best to me.

291
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
You're my wife, after all.

292
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,060
If I'm not good to you, who else would I be good to?

293
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,140
Let's go, let's go.

294
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,320
Miss Bai.

295
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
My brother said you're very efficient.

296
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
I've learned a lot this time.

297
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
It's just a coincidence.

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,680
Just in time.

299
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,410
I already knew Hong Wei before.

300
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,170
Hong Wei.

301
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
This is General Manager Gao.

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,680
About the stone materials you mentioned before,

303
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,840
it was specially approved by General Manager Gao.

304
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
So you're General Manager Gao.

305
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
I've heard so much about you.

306
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
I'll take care of the stone materials.

307
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,040
I'll make sure General Manager Gao is satisfied.

308
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,000
Then, Brother Wei, please keep a close eye on things in the future.

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
You must be joking.

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,440
Little Wei.

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,500
Call me Little Wei.

312
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
