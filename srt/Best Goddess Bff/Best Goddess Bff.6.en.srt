1
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,520
Xiaofe.

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,240
What's the background of this Shengqiang Group?

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Are you familiar with it?

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm actually quite familiar with it.

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,090
Boss Gao,

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,010
this place you've chosen is quite unique.

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
Miss Bai, you're here.

8
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,180
Have you eaten?

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,680
You don't know about the pork trotter noodles here,

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,400
the taste is absolutely amazing.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,260
You must try it.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,660
Old Cao,

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,480
give me another serving of pork trotter noodles.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,160
Sure thing!

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,880
You're too kind, Boss Gao.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,009
I've already eaten.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,440
It doesn't matter if you've eaten,

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,280
just have a taste.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,080
I believe

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
you'll definitely like the flavor.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,240
Moreover,

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,810
this is a must-try snack for successful entrepreneurs.

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,890
Let me take another sip.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,120
Miss Bai,

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,479
actually,

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,160
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
I've always heard Manager Yang from PwC praising you,

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,770
saying you're very capable

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,280
and have helped them solve many tricky problems.

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
So,

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,840
I'd like to ask you, Miss Bai,

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
to help me solve a problem.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,039
With your business acumen, Boss Gao,

34
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,280
what could you possibly need my help with?

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
Of course I need help.

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Nowadays,

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
everything is about division of labor.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,680
We need everyone to work together to get things done.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,740
One person can't handle everything.

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,660
Don't you have a younger brother?

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,360
Brother?

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Yes,

43
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,200
that's what people are saying.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
They've got it wrong.

45
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,440
That's my younger sister.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,520
She just graduated from abroad a couple of years ago.

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
I saw she didn't have much to do,

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,260
so I let her help me.

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
She might like to

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
dress casually sometimes,

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,820
so people misunderstood.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,970
She's actually not my brother.

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,810
It's embarrassing.

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,800
If that's the case,

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
I wonder, Boss Gao,

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
what can I do for you this time?

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,210
Miss Bai,

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,579
it's like this.

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,280
Previously, our Shengqiang Group bought a farmers' market.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,040
We want to transform it into an international clothing trade market.

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
Now, these merchants

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,580
one by one, are unwilling to terminate their leases and relocate.

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,170
They're saying things like

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,640
their lease hasn't expired,

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
accusing us of bullying and monopolizing the market.

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
They've even made a bunch of messy short videos

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,120
to smear us.

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,880
It's put us in a very passive position now.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Especially that fish vendor at the stall,

70
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,600
he's the most active one.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,760
So I'd like to ask you

72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
to help us with some public relations

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,360
and assist us

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
in coordinating the lease termination matters.

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,490
Can't we just wait until their leases expire?

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,600
We can't wait.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,730
We have a contract with the Hong Kong side.

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,620
If we can't start the work on time,

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,930
our losses will be huge,

80
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,280
at least a small goal.

81
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,680
How much do you plan to compensate them?

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
We have transparent pricing.

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
We're honest with everyone.

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm not only willing to compensate them for a full year's rent,

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
allowing them to become property owners instead of tenants,

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,960
but also add two months' rent as compensation.

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,250
However,

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
they're asking for too much.

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,770
They want a year's rent and compensation,

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
plus all their renovation costs.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
So we couldn't reach an agreement right away.

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
With some of our people downstairs,

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
there was a bit of a conflict.

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,080
A few people got hurt.

95
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,340
You had them beaten up?

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
How could that be?

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,380
We're a legitimate business.

98
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
We've always been

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
the type to turn the other cheek.

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,480
It was some of my people who were beaten.

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,410
They're still in the hospital now.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,680
It pains me so much.

103
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,080
You see,

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,060
I know it's embarrassing.

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
Nowadays, in business,

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
integrity is what matters.

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Our old ways don't work anymore.

108
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,740
I'm very law-abiding.

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,159
Hearing you say this,

110
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm quite surprised.

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,290
Not just you,

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,659
I'm surprised too.

113
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
Why are people so irritable these days?

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,760
Wouldn't it be better to sit down and talk things through?

115
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Right?

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
So, you

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,520
didn't sue them?

118
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
It's just some minor injuries.

119
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
They're all young people.

120
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,159
They'll be fine after resting for a couple of days.

121
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,620
Besides, those merchants

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
are just running small businesses to make a living.

123
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,920
It's not easy for any of them.

124
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,520
Let it go.

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,400
Mr. Gao,

126
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,600
hearing you say all this,

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
it's really overturning my worldview.

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,720
So, Miss Bai,

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
I really need your help.

130
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,010
Times have changed,

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,680
and the way we handle things is different too.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,480
We need talented young people like you with wisdom and methods.

133
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,540
I'll take this job.

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,840
However,

135
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,650
I have one requirement.

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,480
During my execution period,

137
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,400
I need your full cooperation

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
and you cannot act on your own.

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,130
Aren't we cooperating?

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
We're very cooperative.

141
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
If you don't believe me, you can ask

142
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Xiao An.

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Have I been uncooperative?

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,480
No.

145
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,640
See?

146
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
How cooperative.

147
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,170
Alright,

148
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
then let's have a pleasant cooperation.

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,850
Pleasant cooperation.

150
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
The noodles are packed and ready to go.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,960
You can head back now.

152
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,620
Make sure to give it a good try.

153
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Thank you.

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
So you're saying

155
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,860
you two have worked together before?

156
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,500
Was the issue resolved in the end?

157
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,480
Sis,

158
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,320
there are really some hidden talents here.

159
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,800
Let's go.

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Even if it's the den of dragons and tigers,

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
we'll brave it today.

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,080
Alright then.

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
Come visit when you have time.

164
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,400
Okay.

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,000
Take care.

166
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,600
Take it easy.

167
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,060
See you.

168
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Sis,

169
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,540
Those who read this

170
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,700
are usually not easy to deal with.

171
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,040
Knowing there's a tiger in the mountain,

172
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,700
yet still heading towards it.

173
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,880
Boss,

174
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,020
how much for this fish?

175
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,050
Not for sale.

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,810
If you're not selling, why set up this fish stall?

177
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,170
Just for fun.

178
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,260
Are you kidding me?

179
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,650
I just saw you selling to someone else.

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,120
You were the one teasing me first, weren't you?

181
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,850
What do you mean by that?

182
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,250
You're not buying fish anyway.

183
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,570
Why are you asking about the price?

184
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Aren't you the one teasing me first?

185
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,290
How do you know I'm not buying fish?

186
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,720
Your clothes are fancy,

187
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
spotless,

188
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,520
and you've been standing at the entrance

189
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,080
staring for a long time.

190
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,560
I've been selling fish for over a decade,

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
and I've never seen a customer like you.

192
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
You're quite observant, aren't you?

193
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
I see you, big guy in the back.

194
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,720
Come forward,

195
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,360
step up.

196
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
I understand what you're up to.

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,480
You want to cut off my power from behind,

198
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,120
and then

199
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,440
put on a show

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,060
of helping others, right?

201
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Am I right?

202
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
You've really learned from those books, haven't you?

203
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,450
This isn't from reading books.

204
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,640
It's just that your tricks are too old.

205
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Then you must have guessed

206
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
our intentions, right?

207
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
There's no need to guess.

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
You'll tell me directly.

209
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,610
Alright,

210
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,480
I'll get straight to the point.

211
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm the PR representative appointed by Shengqiang Group.

212
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
My surname is Bai.

213
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,840
This time,

214
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,560
I want to discuss the matter of compensation for terminating your lease.

215
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,490
The beauty trap.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,930
Thank you first.

217
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't thank me.

218
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
I haven't agreed to anything.

219
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
At least in your eyes,

220
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,890
I'm a beauty.

221
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,540
Alright, alright.

222
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm not blind.

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,380
I can see that much.

224
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Okay, okay.

225
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,220
What terms do you plan to offer this time?

226
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,480
One word.

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,280
Harmony.

228
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,170
Harmony?

229
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,480
Interesting.

230
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,320
Go on.

231
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Business is all about making money.

232
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
Shengqiang Group's approach of directly asking you

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
to leave and move out

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
is too harsh.

235
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Although compensation was offered,

236
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,420
it doesn't solve your fundamental problem.

237
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
So what do you think is the fundamental problem?

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,840
The fundamental problem

239
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,920
is your continued livelihood after leaving this place.

240
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,600
Go on.

241
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
Taking you as an example,

242
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
whether selling fish or vegetables,

243
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
it's essentially a process

244
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,090
of exchanging goods for money.

245
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
Shengqiang Group.

246
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
They want to transform this place into an international clothing market.

247
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,560
This is undoubtedly a form of eviction for you.

248
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,560
This brings enormous uncertainty

249
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,280
to your future long-term livelihood.

250
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,440
And for those of you who have been operating here

251
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,680
for over a decade,

252
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
it's tantamount to losing your jobs.

253
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
So this approach is outdated,

254
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,260
and it's difficult for both parties to reach an agreement.

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
So you're saying

256
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
you have a better solution?

257
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,280
I wouldn't dare say it's a good idea,

258
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
but for both parties,

259
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,840
it's at least a new opportunity.

260
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I'd like to hear more about it.

261
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,300
You hand over your stalls,

262
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
and the new storefronts

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,540
will be jointly operated by you and Shengqiang.

264
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
One stall corresponds to ten storefronts.

265
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,940
You get a 20% share, Shengqiang gets 80%.

266
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
You'll change from tenants to owners.

267
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
This way, it can guarantee your long-term income

268
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,200
and reduce your workload.

269
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
If any of you

270
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,050
want to try the clothing wholesale business,

271
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
you can have priority to rent storefronts at a discount.

272
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Self-operation.

273
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
Your perspective

274
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,960
is quite unique.

275
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
In business,

276
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,080
the key is to keep up with the times and maintain harmony for prosperity.

277
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,480
So, can Sheng Qiang agree to your proposal?

278
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Do you think they have a better option?

279
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,820
We want 30 percent.

280
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,240
It was originally 30 percent, now it can only be 20 percent.

281
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Why is that?

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,580
Because you hurt someone.

283
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,540
As punishment.

284
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,810
Adults should be responsible for their actions.

285
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,520
25 percent.

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,040
The cost of hurting someone is worth 5 percent.

287
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,680
Deal.

288
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,640
You're not an ordinary person, are you?

289
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,480
Likewise.

290
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Sister Xiaofe,

291
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
you're really amazing.

292
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,650
Things couldn't have been resolved just like that, could they?

293
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,240
Not at all.

294
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
Is this matter with Old Xu settled then?

295
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,800
We've become property owners now.

296
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Shengqiang won't back out, will he?

297
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
He's a big business bullying customers.

298
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
Would he be so easy to deal with?

299
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,400
That young girl looks so young.

300
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Can she really represent Gao Qiang?

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Come on, give me a break.

302
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
Of course not.

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,520
Excuse me.

304
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,130
Excuse me, coming through.

305
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,840
Here.

306
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,120
Cousin, go ahead.

307
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Everyone, please don't fall for that woman's tricks.

308
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,580
That woman called Bai Xiaofei

309
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
is the boss of a PR company.

310
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Her client

311
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,960
is none other than Gao Qiang from Shengqiang Group.

312
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,000
She's taking money from Shengqiang Group.

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,860
She represents the interests of Shengqiang Group.

314
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,320
So do you think

315
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,800
she would be so kind

316
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,810
as to fight for your interests?

317
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,810
There must be

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
a huge trap in this.

319
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,920
That's right.

320
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
How could she be so kind?

321
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
There must be a trap here.

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Right.

323
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,890
There must be a trap.

324
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,540
My cousin is right.

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,560
We can't trust her easily.

326
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,820
We can't agree to this.

327
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,520
Then what's the trap?

328
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,080
If it's a trap,

329
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
how could we let you know?

330
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,760
Exactly.

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,090
How could she be so kind?

332
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
We can't agree.

333
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,260
Right, we can't agree.

334
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,080
No one here should agree.

335
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,800
Right?

336
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,440
We can't agree.

337
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,700
We really can't agree.

338
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
We absolutely cannot agree to this.

339
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,040
Miss Bai,

340
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,280
let's proceed with your plan.

341
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,140
Your abilities

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,420
are truly impressive.

343
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,840
Mr. Gao,

344
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,080
once the agreement is signed,

345
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
you can't go back on your word.

346
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,410
Don't worry,

347
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,200
when I, your brother Qiang, give my word, it's set in stone.

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,130
I won't back out.

349
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Then on behalf of

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,100
all the merchants,

351
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,020
I thank you.

352
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Go for it boldly.

353
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,400
Your life is just beginning.

354
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,920
Mr. Gao.

355
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,080
Brother Qiang,

356
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
those merchants said they won't sign anymore.

357
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,720
Why?

358
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,570
I'm not sure.

359
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,220
The bigger the forest, the more birds there are.

360
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,540
Cast

361
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,920
