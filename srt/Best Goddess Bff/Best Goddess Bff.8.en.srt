1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,800
It's so beautiful.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,360
What a great figure.

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,240
Some things are innate.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,600
You can't get them no matter how hard you try.

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,800
That's true.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
Miss Bai is truly a natural beauty.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,660
No wonder my brother admires you so much.

8
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,440
Mr. Gao,

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,690
you're too kind.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,120
Your brother probably appreciates

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,780
our company's capabilities.

12
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,720
The main purpose of my visit this time

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,200
is for your newly invested

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,259
eco-cultural tourism city project.

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,880
Miss Bai, are you interested in cultural tourism?

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,539
Not really.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
It's just that

18
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,840
the children of these elderly people

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,300
rarely visit them as it is.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,759
They're already very lonely.

21
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,320
If

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
they move to an even more remote place,

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,759
I think their children

24
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,890
will visit them even less frequently.

25
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,200
Taking care of the elderly is something we should do.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,660
However, the eco-city has its overall plan.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm not sure about the specific details of the plan.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,970
So I can't give you an answer right now.

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,300
Mr. Gao,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,460
Lanlan,

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,080
I understand it's all about business,

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,040
and this puts you in a difficult position.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,440
But I still hope

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,080
you could consider the dozens of elderly people

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,640
and reconsider your decision carefully.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
Actually,

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,440
my brother and I aren't really businessmen in the true sense.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
I studied design abroad.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,530
Many times, it depends on our mood.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,960
Sometimes, feelings are more important than business.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
It's great to be rich.

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
You can do things based on your mood.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,820
Even without money, you can still follow your mood.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,640
In this world, problems that can be solved with money

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,040
are not really problems.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,090
It's the problems that money can't solve that are truly worrisome.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,410
Don't you agree,

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Miss Bai?

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,120
Mr. Gao,

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,770
regardless of the outcome,

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,360
on behalf of the dozens of elderly people in the nursing home,

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
I want to thank you first.

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,050
Let's end it here for today.

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,079
Please take good care of our two distinguished guests for me.

55
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,640
I have another meeting in a while.

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Mr. Gao,

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,560
I hope you can reconsider this decision.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,120
Miss Bai,

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,140
Do you know when people are the happiest?

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,160
When?

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,170
When they're infinitely close to happiness.

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,780
Sister Xiaofe,

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
So, what

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
should we do next?

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,610
Change clothes.

66
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,360
Ask the real estate department to bring over the ecological planning document.

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,220
I want to see it.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,180
Certainly.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,660
Do you have time later?

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,380
let's meet.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Gao Lan.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,460
Is it really that surprising?

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,240
Not at all, not at all.

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,520
Alright, I'm recording a song.

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,880
I'll come find you when I'm done recording.

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,740
Okay, I'll send you the location.

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,020
Okay, see you soon.

78
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,890
See you soon.

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,680
Xiaofei,

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Go on.

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,680
Will Gao Lan help us?

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,300
It depends on her mood.

83
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
So what can we do?

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,760
There are many things we can do.

85
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
Tell me, I'll write it down.

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
Work out, eat,

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,600
go shopping, get a spa.

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
Xiaofei,

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,200
are you kidding me?

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,210
Are you serious?

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,240
This feels too good to be true.

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,900
What kind of approach is this?

93
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,840
But...

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,460
We still don't know how to solve the problem.

95
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
Sometimes, when people can't solve problems,

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,860
we leave it to fate.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,520
What?

98
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,840
Is it really that casual?

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Many times,

100
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,050
doing nothing is better than acting blindly.

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,640
Although...

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm so close to you every day,

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
but...

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,760
I still can't figure you out.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Not bad at all.

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,200
You're the one who's gotten worse.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,920
Big star.

108
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,880
What star? Don't be ridiculous.

109
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,560
Oh, right.

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,080
When did you come back?

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,900
I thought you were still away.

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
I've been back for a while.

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,810
I'm helping my brother now.

114
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Your brother?

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,200
Wasn't your brother selling fish?

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,860
Are you helping him sell fish?

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,860
He stopped selling fish long ago.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm just kidding.

119
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
Your brother is now a big shot in the business world.

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,420
No one dares to offend him.

121
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,400
You know,

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,220
it's been six years in the blink of an eye.

123
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,920
When I was training in Seoul,

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,700
you were still in high school.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,180
And now, just like that...

126
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,400
Yu Xuan,

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,130
before you left,

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,720
didn't you have a girlfriend with the surname Bai?

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,180
How do you know about that?

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,040
Don't you remember?

131
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,100
I saw her photo in your wallet before.

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,700
But we broke up a long time ago.

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,290
Why are you bringing her up?

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
I just saw her this afternoon.

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,700
You saw her?

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
What did she want from you?

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
Why did you two break up back then?

138
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
Every man has a shameful past before success.

139
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,050
and a disgraceful history.

140
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,810
Let's not talk about it.

141
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,120
What do you mean by disgraceful?

142
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
I betrayed her.

143
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,850
I betrayed our love.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,530
Darling,

145
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,159
guess what I brought you today.

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
You're preparing for graduate school and working at the same time,

147
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,409
and still taking care of me.

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,400
Don't waste money buying things for me.

149
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
That won't do.

150
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,480
It's your birthday today.

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Ta-da!

152
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
I bought you a birthday cake.

153
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
It's made

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,760
to a one-to-one scale of us.

155
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,440
This is you,

156
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,480
this is me,

157
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,770
and this is mini,

158
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
our future son.

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
From now on, we'll

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
live happily together for the rest of our lives.

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,080
Okay?

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,460
It's almost midnight.

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,880
Oh, Xu Youyou said

164
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,360
you must make a wish before midnight.

165
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
What's wrong?

166
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
Are you moved?

167
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,400
Let me see.

168
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,600
Feifei,

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,240
let's

170
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,480
break up.

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,800
You...

172
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
What... what did you say?

173
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,210
Break up.

174
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,580
Let's break up.

175
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,040
Why...

176
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
why are you saying this?

177
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,450
I've signed with a company.

178
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,500
They're sending us to Seoul for four years of training.

179
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,100
We're not allowed to date.

180
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,480
Xiaofe,

181
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,160
I really don't want to keep

182
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,020
submitting endlessly like this.

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
I really want to achieve my dreams quickly.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can't we work hard together slowly?

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,800
It's too late.

186
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,220
My mom's heart isn't good.

187
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,290
She needs 200,000 for a bypass next month.

188
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,610
The company agreed to advance it to me.

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,380
Even if my dreams can wait,

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
my mom's heart can't.

191
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,240
I...

192
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,660
I can...

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
I can borrow money.

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,840
I can take on more jobs.

195
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,160
It's useless.

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,040
Can't we work hard together?

197
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,100
Let's not break up.

198
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,320
Feifei,

199
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,800
face reality.

200
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,840
If I don't go this time,

201
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,840
I can't even save my mom.

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Am I a jerk?

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,460
You can't really say that.

204
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,840
It's just that you two weren't a good match.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,570
Your dream was about yourself,

206
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,700
while her dream was all about you.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,860
It's good that you two separated.

208
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,680
She is who she is today

209
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,840
thanks to your favor of not marrying her.

210
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,440
And the current her is the best version of herself.

211
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,200
However,

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,930
why are you suddenly concerned about my ex-girlfriend?

213
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,480
You...

214
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,200
don't have any thoughts about Brother Yuxuan, do you?

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Don't flatter yourself.

216
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,480
I think she's

217
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,050
quite interesting.

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,880
Achoo!

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Xiaofe,

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,340
Who's thinking of you?

221
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
As if anyone would think of me.

222
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm lucky if no one's trying to beat me up.

223
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,640
In our line of work,

224
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
although we help many people,

225
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,320
we also offend many.

226
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
It's hard to please everyone.

227
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,560
As long as you believe what you're doing is right,

228
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,640
and you have a clear conscience, that's enough.

229
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Xiaofe,

230
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
I feel like you're full of wisdom.

231
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,880
I can never absorb it all.

232
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,720
Stop sucking up to me!

233
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Hello?

234
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,450
Miss Bai,

235
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,920

236
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
Let's have a drink together.

237
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,880
Sure.

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,480
