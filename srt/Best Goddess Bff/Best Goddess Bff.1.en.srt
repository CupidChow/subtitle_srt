1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,300
From childhood to adulthood,

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,400
we've been desperately running towards that unbridled,

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,520
carefree moment of happiness.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,240
However,

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,720
the further we go,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,210
the lonelier we become.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
I gaze into the abyss,

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,880
while withdrawing from the conformity of my shell,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,280
trying to find

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
the train that would stop for me.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,360
Yet,

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,720
life is like a catalyst.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
Before the flower can bloom,

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,100
the branches are already withering.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,080
Until one day,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,900
when I discovered that true strength

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,040
is not about confrontation,

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
but about allowing things to happen,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,580
allowing regrets,

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
allowing foolishness,

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,410
allowing ugliness,

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
allowing efforts without rewards,

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,040
I knew

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,740
at that moment,

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,520
we are each other's confidence and support.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,680
Sister.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,890
Sister, sister.

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,180
Don't throw it, don't.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
Please give me a few more days.

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm begging you, I'll definitely pay you.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
What do you mean, 'give you more time'?

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
If everyone was like you and didn't pay rent,

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
how am I supposed to survive?

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,500
Take your luggage and get out now.

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Sister.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,680
Sister, open the door!

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
Hello?

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,479
Zeng Qingqing.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,039
You really know how to stir things up, don't you?

40
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,520
It hasn't even been a month since you started.

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
That stunt you pulled last night cost me a big client.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
We lost five million.

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't bother coming to work today.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Go straight to HR and resign.

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Manager Chen.

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Manager Chen.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,720
I...

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello?

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Gazing at the misty lake waters,

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,760
green reeds standing tall.

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,740
How's that?

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,880
Come on, let's drink to that.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,810
Qingqing is such a beautiful name.

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,480
Let me tell you something.

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
The third line is the most famous.

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,620
Green grass by the river bank,

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
we two swim in the water.

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
Come on, let's drink up!

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,600
Qingqing.

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,720
Qingqing.

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
I really like you.

62
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,560
Where are you running off to?

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Just my luck, I'm soaked.

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,640
Born after 2000, huh?

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
Who are you?

66
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,460
Don't come any closer.

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Before,

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,079
I stood where you're standing now.

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Bai Xiaofei, what are you doing?

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,260
Don't come any closer.

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,520
It's just a man, isn't it?

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,730
Is it worth it for someone so disloyal?

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's go back.

74
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,840
Can we start over?

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,940
We're still young, there's still time for everything.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,460
Will you come back with me?

77
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,960
You...

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,000
Where are you taking me?

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Remember,

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
the best way to deal with pain

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
is to face it head-on.

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Lao Chen,

83
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,600
you're so unreliable.

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,160
what kind of people did you invite?

85
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
this is so dishonorable.

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,450
look, they vomited all over me.

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,240
I don't even want to talk to you about it.

88
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,840
you figure out how to make up for this yourself.

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,079
Hey, you,

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,560
get Dr. Feng

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,420
to come here and see me right away.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,399
Director Wei,

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
I think Dr. Feng is on duty today.

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,920
On duty?

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm in this state, and you're talking about being on duty?

96
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,220
Go and arrange it quickly.

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Director Wei,

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,200
her husband got injured in a fall.

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,659
I think he's admitted to our hospital today.

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,610
Which is more important, her husband or her work?

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Ask her.

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,600
Does she still want to be the deputy director or not?

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,930
Work is more important.

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,100
Then what are you waiting for?

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm so angry, I can't even...

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,520
Where is this?

107
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,290
What's the room number?

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you believe me?

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,680
You have to stand up for yourself.

110
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,890
You're just in time.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Give me a massage.

112
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,040
It has to be you, Xiao Feng.

113
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,840
This is firm yet gentle.

114
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
That feels good.

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Why is it you?

116
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh, Old Chen, Old Chen.

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,740
You're quick to make amends, huh?

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,880
What's up?

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,930
I've figured it out.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Come down.

121
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,520
Come on.

122
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Come on, get down.

123
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
This smooth skin.

124
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,159
Qingqing.

125
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,159
Put this on.

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Come on.

127
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll go take a quick shower first, then we'll go together.

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,080
Wait for me.

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Baby.

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Hurry up.

131
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,560
It's ready.

132
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,140
Serve the food.

133
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Dean Wei.

134
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Didn't you say 'Three cups of wine for the mundane world'?

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
Come, let's have the first cup.

136
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,340
Yes, yes, yes. Let's do it.

137
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
Cheers!

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,850
You're making great progress!

139
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,320
You seem to be having a lot of fun.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,840
Honey, what are you doing here?

141
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
A long time ago,

142
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,520
someone told me

143
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,050
that happiness is closing one eye.

144
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
I tried,

145
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,890
but I couldn't do it.

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
If you can't accept something,

147
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,650
there's no need to force yourself.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,520
In fact, no winter is insurmountable,

149
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,320
and no spring will fail to arrive.

150
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,840
Today.

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,880
Thank you.

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,040
Don't thank me,

153
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
thank yourself.

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,540
You're the one who forgave yourself.

155
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
This is a book I bought today.

156
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,640
I don't know how to express my gratitude to you.

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,880
I'd like to give you this book.

158
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,120
I hope you'll like it.

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
You know, many times,

160
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,840
things aren't as good as you imagine,

161
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,250
but they're not as bad as you think either.

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,760
Get a good night's sleep,

163
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,400
and believe that when you wake up tomorrow morning,

164
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,080
it will surely be a better day.

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
Oh, by the way,

166
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,440
if you need anything in the future,

167
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,170
feel free to come to me anytime.

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,120
Okay.

169
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,040
Miss,

170
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,000
Where are you going?

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,720
I...

172
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,840
No, if you're a visitor,

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,920
you need to register at the front desk.

174
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm not a visitor.

175
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
I need to see someone.

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Just let me in.

177
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
It's complicated to explain.

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
If you can't explain clearly,

179
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
then you definitely can't go in.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
I really have business here. Just let me in.

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
If I let you in,

182
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
what am I standing here for?

183
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Come on, you're handsome and nice, right?

184
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
What do you mean I'm nice?

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,960
You can't go in.

186
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,220
Sister Xiaofe!

187
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,040
Sister Xiaofe!

188
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,100
It's me, Qingqing.

189
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,560
