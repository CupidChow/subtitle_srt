1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,320
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,080
What about you?

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,560
He hasn't replied to me for the past two weeks.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,240
He's been busy at school.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Do you know these young people?

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,080
They talk about dancing,

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,280
do this and that.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
I rarely see them.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,280
He has his own life.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,200
They are like strangers.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Be a father.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,080
Be more proactive.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,120
Take more care of him.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,000
I understand.

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,280
YoYo English Channel YouTube

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
Daddy.

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,280
Daddy.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,720
Let me go.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,400
Help.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,840
Let me go.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,280
Duan Shao Zeng.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,120
What are you doing?

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Let me go.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
Today's situation is special.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
For safety,

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,840
Mr. Gong will wait on the boat.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,040
When he gets the body,

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
he will go on the boat immediately.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,200
You and I can't afford it.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
I know.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,560
Excuse me.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
Is there a boat going to Longwei?

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
What's going on today?

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
So many people are going to Longwei.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,600
Has anyone been there?

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
What does he look like?

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,400
How many people?

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,240
Three men.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
They are as private as you.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
They said they were going to find a daughter.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Is it Ah Ji and Rima?

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
When did they go out?

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,720
They went for an hour.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
I don't know what they want to do.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Keep doing what you should do.

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,040
You...

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,600
Dan Di.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Are you okay?

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Are you okay?

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,160
Come.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
I'm fine.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,400
Let's go.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Take your daughter.

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Okay.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,320
That way.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,040
Go.

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Two people died today.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
Su Lian Yu

60
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,640
and Li Yi VerApplause

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
He just left us.

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Look.

63
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
He ran away without a sound.

64
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
This isれて cumulative.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,280
It's the first time for him to hear Bang's story.

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,400
No one backs him up again.

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,880
Therefore, he ran away this day.

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,580
Madam,

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,660
I beg you.

70
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,580
Let me call him first.

71
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Fill the form,

72
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,220
then he'll check it after he gets permission.

73
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,340
Just one minute.

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,620
If you're still staying silent on this issue,

75
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,500
you can't prove you guys were related by blood.

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,160
How do I know what you're doing?

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
I have a right to promise.

78
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Madam.

79
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,660
Madam!

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,060
Madam!

81
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Madam!

82
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
This case,

83
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
from a car accident,

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
to the discovery of human organs,

85
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
to the company,

86
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,060
it seems like they are training young people to be stars.

87
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
In fact,

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
they are trying to trick them into doing human organs business.

89
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
They have a very detailed deployment.

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,060
They also have a complete criminal system.

91
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,060
It also involves medical staff.

92
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
We have officially arrested

93
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Dr. Zeng, Zeng Qing Shu,

94
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
and his male assistant Chen Jing Hui.

95
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,060
They have severely violated professional practices

96
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,060
and are suspected of participating in human organs business.

97
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,060
Dr. Zeng admitted to being the one who was drunk and hurt in 2018.

98
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
It was Ricky who took the initiative to find someone to help him.

99
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
From that moment on,

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
he has been helping Ricky.

101
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060
The guards on the island

102
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,060
are all the victims and Ricky's men that were discovered before.

103
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
They have committed murder,

104
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
illegal imprisonment,

105
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
and hurt people.

106
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I have already called the students in the training camp to record a statement.

107
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
They are all willing to testify against these bad people.

108
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
Good job.

109
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,060
This mission

110
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
has broken the first human organ business

111
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
in Hong Kong for some time.

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
I also want to thank

113
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,060
ICAC and the deputy executive officer Liu Yu Fan.

114
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
They have helped me a lot.

115
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
You can handle all the departments.

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
I didn't see the wrong person.

117
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,060
Thank you, sir.

118
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Also,

119
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
I think I have a reasonable reason

120
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
for these cases

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
to be suspected of being related to Qian Feng Group.

122
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,060
Is that so?

123
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Xu Si Si's case

124
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
is not related to the case of the criminal.

125
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
This time,

126
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,060
a wanted criminal was escaped.

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
This time, I met him on the island.

128
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
I think it's definitely not a coincidence.

129
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,060
I know you

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
never let go of Xu Si Si's case.

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
But we are police.

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
We should be very careful

133
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,060
to suspect everything without evidence.

134
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Yes, sir.

135
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Thank you this time.

136
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
You want to thank me?

137
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,060
In the future, when the case of the legal and legal justice case is sued,

138
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
don't take the case so tightly.

139
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Of course you want to be more relaxed.

140
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
You don't follow the rules.

141
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Will the staff die later?

142
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
If you wait one more minute,

143
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
you can't save people.

144
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Will you wait?

145
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Doctor, how is my daughter?

146
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
She has poor nutrition

147
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
and a wound inflammation.

148
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,060
And she has a kidney defect.

149
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Let her rest more.

150
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Take time to recuperate.

151
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Then, turn to a gynecologist

152
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
to deal with the scars on her body.

153
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Thank you.

154
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
She is her father.

155
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
You are her mother.

156
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
How is it?

157
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
I didn't take good care of you.

160
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,060
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Daddy.

162
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,060
I trusted those people

163
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,060
because I thought I could go to Korea.

164
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
That's why I'm like this.

165
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Then,

166
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
don't blame yourself.

167
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
You are a victim.

168
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
You are harmed.

169
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Do you know?

170
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
Anyway,

171
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
promise daddy

172
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
to come back and live with me.

173
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
With daddy here,

174
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
no one will bully you again.

175
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
I thought you wouldn't come to me.

176
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
After I was taken away,

177
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,060
I was so scared and regretful.

178
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
I didn't talk to you

179
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
or talk to you.

180
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,060
I thought you would be angry with me

181
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
and wouldn't come to me.

182
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,060
Silly girl.

183
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Why didn't daddy come to you?

184
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,060
No matter where you are,

185
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
daddy will come to you.

186
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Do you know?

187
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,060
Since mommy left,

188
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
you often just work

189
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
and take me to school.

190
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,060
I thought you didn't want to see me again.

191
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,060
Daddy sent you to study

192
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
because he didn't want you

193
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
to think about it at home.

194
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Why didn't daddy want to see you?

195
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
After mommy left,

197
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,060
I was so ignorant.

198
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
You only know to blame you.

199
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I never asked you how you were.

200
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
I never asked you if you were good or bad.

201
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
When I grow up,

202
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
I feel strong.

203
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
I want to prove to you

204
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
that I can take care of myself.

205
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,060
But I was wrong.

206
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm really so inhuman.

207
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,060
Since mommy left,

208
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,060
I thought I wouldn't mention the past.

209
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
That's the best for you.

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
But I was wrong.

211
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
I didn't know you at all.

212
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
I didn't know what you like.

213
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
I didn't know what kind of friend you knew.

214
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Even if daddy wanted to see you,

215
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
I didn't do anything.

216
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,060
But anyway,

217
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,060
I never blamed you.

218
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
As long as you're doing well,

219
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I'm relieved.

220
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
You're here.

221
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
What's wrong?

222
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Let me see.

223
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Nothing wrong, right?

224
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
I'm fine.

225
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
But I don't know

226
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
if I got a little bit of heat

227
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
and sunstroke on the island yesterday.

228
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Since you're not feeling well,

229
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
take a break.

230
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I...

231
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
I'm fine.

232
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I'm fine.

233
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm fine.

234
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm fine.

235
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
Take a break.

236
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I'll make you something to eat.

237
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
I'll call you when I'm done.

238
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Okay.

239
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
Are you sitting here?

240
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,060
I slept for too long.

241
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
I want to sit for a while.

242
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
Then,

243
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
you're not feeling well

244
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
because you ate lightly today.

245
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
You don't have a choice.

246
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
It's okay.

247
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
I'll eat whatever you make.

248
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Done.

249
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Then,

250
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
enjoy yourself.

251
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Hey, you're leaving?

252
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm leaving.

253
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Why are you still here?

254
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
Bye.

255
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Wait.

256
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
It tastes weird.

257
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Weird?

258
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
How come?

259
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
I've always done this.

260
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
No.

261
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Did you turn the sugar and salt upside down?

262
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
You think I'm you?

263
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
If you don't believe me,

264
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,060
come and try it yourself.

265
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
No way.

266
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
It should be fine.

267
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Try it yourself.

268
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
This?

269
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Here.

270
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Try it.

271
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
It's fine.

272
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,060
Really?

273
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
It's fine?

274
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
Maybe I made a mistake.

275
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Eat.

276
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Actually,

277
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
are you pretending to be sick?

278
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Pretending to be sick?

279
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,060
No.

280
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
We police don't pretend to be sick.

281
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
The tomatoes are delicious today.

282
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Let's eat tomatoes.

283
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
It's better to eat vitamins than skin.

284
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,060
The emergency meeting this time

285
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
is because the police and ICAC

286
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
in a joint operation

287
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
found the largest number of firearms

288
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
in the West Palace's Longwei Province

289
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
in the past ten years.

290
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Sam, please report.

291
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,060
We found 20 AK-47s

292
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
and 45 modern guns,

293
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
60 handguns with 7.62 caliber,

294
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
120 handguns

295
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
and 100,000 bullets.

296
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
According to the latest investigation,

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
these firearms were exported from

298
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Southeast Asia and transferred by the central government.

299
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,060
We don't know if the actual use is smuggling

300
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
or organizational storage.

301
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
In addition,

302
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
we found that

303
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
the gun lines in the previous shooting case

304
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
and the weapons we found this time

305
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,060
were all used by the police.

306
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
We suspect that

307
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
some of these firearms

308
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
have been imported into Hong Kong.

309
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
Hong Kong is an international capital.

310
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
I don't allow Hong Kong's security

311
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,060
to be threatened.

312
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Especially when the guns are imported,

313
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
these crimes that may cause

314
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
public safety

315
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
may lead to danger.

316
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I hope that

317
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
you can cooperate with us

318
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
in this case.

319
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,060
We will find out the source

320
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
and organization of these firearms

321
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
as soon as possible.

322
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
We will also find out

323
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
the source of these firearms

324
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
and organize them behind the scenes.

325
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
If necessary,

326
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,060
we will also prepare for it at any time.

327
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Our navy will strengthen the search

328
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
and monitor all suspicious items

329
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
that are imported.

330
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
We will monitor at the entrance

331
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
whether there are any suspicious criminals

332
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
who entered and left Hong Kong.

333
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
We are still investigating

334
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
the source and use

335
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
of these firearms

336
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,060
that we found this time.

337
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
According to the information

338
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
that we have mastered,

339
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
we have a reason to believe

340
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
that some of these firearms

341
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
have been imported into Hong Kong.

342
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,060
They may be used as a terrorist attack.

343
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Considering this situation,

344
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
we decided to

345
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
raise the level of

346
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
terrorist threat in Hong Kong

347
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
to a high level.

348
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Chief Gao,

349
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,060
we have repaired

350
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Wang Zhen Xiong's phone.

351
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
Look, there is a clue.

352
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Dirk, have you found anything?

353
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Chief Gao,

354
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
there is a space card

355
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
in the phone.

356
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
There is nothing in it.

357
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
There is only one game in it.

358
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
This game

359
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
was very popular seven or eight years ago.

360
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
It can be said that

361
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
it was the earliest

362
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
to be used by the government.

363
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
There must be

364
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
a couple of friends playing with it.

365
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
But now it is closed.

366
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Why is it closed

367
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
and there are still people playing?

368
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
It should be that someone

369
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
stole the information

370
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
and opened a private house.

371
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
You mean

372
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
that the government

373
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
has been closed

374
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,060
and the people who are playing

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
are not allowed to play?

376
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
You mean

377
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,060
private server?

378
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
Yes.

379
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
Everyone knows that

380
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
our colleagues

381
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
have found a batch of

382
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
smuggled weapons

383
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
through the organ trafficking case.

384
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
So I hope that

385
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
all units

386
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
will start

387
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
to search

388
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
and gather information

389
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
from now on.

390
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Let's catch them first.

391
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
This case is not that simple.

392
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,060
I think this batch of weapons

393
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
is related to

394
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
a huge criminal organization.

395
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
We should send people

396
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
to investigate along this line.

397
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
If there are any more reckless actions,

398
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
I'm afraid that

399
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
we will call our colleagues

400
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
to die again.

401
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
That is to say,

402
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
the owner of the private server

403
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
can approve it.

404
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Who can go in

405
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
and play this game?

406
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Just like a private party.

407
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Some people

408
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
don't like to play with strangers.

409
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
I know Wang Zhixiong.

410
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
He doesn't know how to use a computer.

411
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
He doesn't know how to play computer games.

412
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Why would he download

413
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
a game that no one has ever played?

414
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
And why would the server's owner

415
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
invite a person

416
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
who doesn't play the game

417
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
to the party?

418
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
This game must have other uses.

419
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
But there is one thing

420
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,060
that I have a little objection.

421
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
I don't want

422
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Zhou Junjie to be responsible for it.

423
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
I know that Zhou Junjie is very capable.

424
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
He was the one who found

425
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
those missing girls

426
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
and broke this

427
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
machine business case.

428
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
But if all of our police teams

429
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,060
are like him,

430
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
is that okay?

431
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
There is no discipline in the army.

432
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Why don't we

433
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
transfer them to the special forces?

434
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,060
We will all act separately

435
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
in the future.

436
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
No need to report,

437
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
no need to say anything

438
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
about the spirit of the group.

439
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
The reason why I say this

440
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
openly in front of everyone

441
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,060
is because the director

442
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
has announced today

443
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
that the level of threat

444
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
of the terrorist attack

445
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
has been raised to a high level.

446
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
I hope that all of you

447
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
can be safe.

448
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
No one will be

449
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
led to a crime

450
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
because of reckless actions.

451
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
And it will lead to

452
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
a criminal's death.

453
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Oh, right.

454
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
There is also a chat room.

455
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
December 27th,

456
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
which is the day

457
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
when Wang Zhenxiong

458
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
goes to court.

459
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
All the players

460
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
will leave the chat room together.

461
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
December 12th,

462
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
is the day

463
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
when the killer intercepts the witness.

464
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
If I'm not wrong,

465
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
all the players

466
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
in the server are the same age.

467
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
If it wasn't for Zhou Junjie,

468
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,060
we wouldn't have found

469
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
this batch of firearms.

470
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
He was taken back by his life.

471
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
Zhou Junjie was brought out by you.

472
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Of course you said so.

473
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Someone wanted to

474
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
make up for the mistake.

475
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
So,

476
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
he gave the information

477
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
to him

478
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
so that he could

479
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
find this batch of firearms.

480
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Or is he really

481
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
so unlucky?

482
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
He found it for no reason.

483
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
I believe

484
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,060
my men are all

485
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,060
capable.

486
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Not by luck.

487
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Speaking of luck,

488
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
I think you're the best.

489
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
You've broken

490
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
the case of 600 million

491
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
of drug drug cases in ten years.

492
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
The case of the drug king's

493
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
thousand-dollar kidnapping.

494
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
The case of the sale of the population.

495
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
All the big cases

496
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
were broken by you.

497
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
How could it be so coincidental?

498
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,060
It's the same as

499
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
what happened to Zhou Junjie.

500
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
Shut up.

501
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Is this how you talk to me?

502
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Sorry, sir.

503
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Wang Zhenxiong took advantage

504
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
and leaked the witness location.

505
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,060
I believe it's not a single case.

506
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
There must be other police

507
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
involved.

508
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Even the senior officers of the police.

509
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
What do you mean by

510
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
showing me these?

511
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
I believe it's their way

512
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
to communicate with each other

513
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
and to explain the task.

514
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
So I officially

515
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
apply for a case investigation

516
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
of this large-scale

517
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
police corruption group.

518
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
First of all, thank you

519
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
for your appreciation

520
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
for coming to my party.

521
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
I've served the police for 34 years.

522
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
I've also experienced

523
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
the times of three major thieves.

524
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Now,

525
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
the whole of Hong Kong

526
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
has stabilized.

527
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
Sometimes I ask,

528
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
whether Hong Kong citizens

529
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
still need police?

530
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
I finally figured it out.

531
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
The existence of the police

532
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,060
is not for the crime,

533
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
but for the citizens.

534
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm not a criminal.

535
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
I'm a criminal.

536
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
I'm a criminal.

537
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
Our ultimate goal

538
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
is not to arrest people,

539
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
but to prevent the crime from happening.

540
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
So I really hope

541
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
that the police can continue

542
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
to play this role.

543
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
This is the best protection

544
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
for the citizens.

545
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
Sir,

546
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
congratulations on your retirement.

547
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,060
On behalf of all colleagues,

548
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
thank you for leading us for four years.

549
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Thank you, Aki.

550
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
Aki,

551
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
Lei Xue Sen and Ouyang Jun

552
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
are the best in the same class.

553
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
I can't tell

554
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
who is better as your successor.

555
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Only this can be done.

556
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Sam is from the front line.

557
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
He often rushes to the front line.

558
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
He has a battle plan and a reputation.

559
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
All colleagues like him.

560
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Ouyang is a police officer.

561
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
He knows how to deal with

562
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
internal and external affairs.

563
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
Especially,

564
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
he has political skills.

565
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
The next four to six years

566
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
will be yours.

567
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Who do you think can help you?

568
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
If it's a big deal,

569
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,060
Ouyang is more suitable.

570
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
You don't think Ouyang

571
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
used to follow you in the O.G.

572
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Everyone was born and raised,

573
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
and had revolutionary emotions.

574
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
That's why you chose him, right?

575
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,060
More or less,

576
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
I have some feelings.

577
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
It's rational to discuss

578
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
which one is the best.

579
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Come in.

580
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Director.

581
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Ouyang, what's up?

582
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
About the personnel's transfer,

583
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
I have something to ask you.

584
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
What is it?

585
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
I want to ask why

586
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,060
I only transferred from the Department of Forms to the Department of Personnel.

587
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
But Lei Xue Sen,

588
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
he was promoted to SACP so quickly.

589
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
This is what the former director meant.

590
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
I'm just doing it for him.

591
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Has the personnel selection been decided?

592
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Not yet.

593
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
But

594
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
everyone seems to know what it means.

595
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
SACP

596
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
is temporarily one of the positions.

597
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Sam has a lot of experience in the frontline.

598
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,060
So I temporarily transferred him to the Department of Action.

599
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
When the other SACP retire,

600
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,060
it's your turn.

601
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Lei Xue Sen is the fastest

602
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
to be promoted to SACP in our same period.

603
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
That means he has been selected.

604
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
I haven't even been in the position.

605
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
You're just saying that?

606
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
And I only retired for four years.

607
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
How can I be so fast?

608
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,060
Actually,

609
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
not only you and him,

610
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
but also others in the police force

611
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
are very competitive.

612
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
Yes.

613
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,060
Maybe you and him will be the ones to be competitive.

614
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
So during this period,

615
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
you should show your ability.

616
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Now you're transferred to the Department of Personnel,

617
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
it depends on whether you're suitable to be a civil official.

618
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
Do your best, okay?

619
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Yes, sir.

620
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,060
Okay.

621
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
What's wrong?

622
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Nothing.

623
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
You're still saying nothing?

624
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
You're just looking at the watch.

625
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
You're so passionate.

626
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
You know such an old-fashioned word.

627
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
You're called a heroine.

628
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Of course I know. I learned it from the TV.

629
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
You shouldn't be so careless.

630
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Here you are.

631
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Congratulations.

632
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Aunt Ren Ren Chu, I miss you so much.

633
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Me too.

634
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,060
This room will be yours from now on.

635
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
I'll clean it up for you.

636
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Thank you so much.

637
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
You're welcome.

638
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
Is it really okay

639
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
to move in with her?

640
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Annie has grown up.

641
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
If she moves out,

642
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
I can't be the one to decide.

643
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
But you'll still worry about her.

644
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
How can I not worry?

645
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
Especially when such a big thing happens.

646
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
But I've learned it.

647
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Now she has her own world.

648
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,060
I also have to learn how to let go.

649
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
I've thought about it too.

650
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Don't think about the past.

651
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Start over.

652
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
Why are you staring at me like that?

653
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
I'm afraid you're drunk.

654
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
I haven't drunk for eight years.

655
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,060
I can't get drunk with such a little thing.

656
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
I'm sorry.

657
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
What's wrong?

658
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,060
If I couldn't have signed the lawsuit for you,

659
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
you wouldn't have wasted eight years.

660
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Maybe you're a famous architect now.

661
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Maybe you have a very happy family.

662
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
You have a very good life.

663
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Listen.

664
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
You've never been sorry to me.

665
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
For eight years,

666
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,060
you've been the only one who believed in me, helped me.

667
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
You've been trying to help me catch Dai Zu Fu and Gong You Cheng.

668
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Actually, I've been the one who dragged you down.

669
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
I really want to help you.

670
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I know it the most now.

671
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,060
I know who is really good to me.

672
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
I thank you.

673
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Thank you for the past eight years.

674
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,060
I'm afraid you haven't given up on me.

675
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
The End

676
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
There's a deserted house on the island.

677
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
There's a lot of military supplies there.

678
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
I don't know what it's for now.

679
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Is it for selling?

680
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
It's not popular now.

681
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
It's not profitable.

682
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Is it free?

683
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Free?

684
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
It's enough for such a large number of soldiers to fight.

685
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
It's better to check it out in person.

686
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Lin, check if there's a registered owner of this abandoned house.

687
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
Yes.

688
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Black Bull and Brother Qiang, go to the sea near this area.

689
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Ask the boatman if he has seen suspicious people or goods that have been moved to the island.

690
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Yes, sir.

691
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Gennan, Zhu Zai, you go to the dock.

692
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
Check the surveillance.

693
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
See if there's anything.

694
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
Yes, sir.

695
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
If you understand, do it.

696
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
Wang, come to my room.

697
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
I need to talk to you.

698
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
Zhe San, what can I do for you?

699
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Sit down.

700
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Have you heard of this plan?

701
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Yes.

702
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
I think you should get promoted.

703
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
Try it.

704
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Actually, I've reported it many times.

705
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Either there's no recommended person or there's no competition.

706
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
I know you have a blood-sucking obstacle.

707
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
I've thought about it.

708
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,060
This is a past topic.

709
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
Do it again.

710
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Then I'll take you to the mock interview.

711
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
If you can't, you can try.

712
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Zhe San, thank you.

713
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
But who can be recommended by me?

714
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Only those who have more than SP can be recommended.

715
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
I've done all the work for you.

716
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Check it yourself.

717
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,060
Thank you, sir.

718
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Hello, welcome.

719
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Hello.

720
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Hi.

721
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
You're so energetic.

722
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
Yes.

723
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
I started dancing a few days ago.

724
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
So good.

725
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
You have to work harder.

726
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,060
We all think you can go to Korea to debut.

727
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
Thank you.

728
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Hi.

729
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,060
This is Aunt Rachel.

730
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,060
Hello, I'm Ah Jie.

731
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
This is my wife Tina.

732
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Hello.

733
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
Hi.

734
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
I'm Ah Jie.

735
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
I'm Ah Jie.

736
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
I'm Ah Jie.

737
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I'm Ah Jie.

738
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
This is my wife Tina.

739
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Hello.

740
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
Hi.

741
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm Jenny.

742
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
Hello.

743
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Long time no see.

744
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
Long time no see.

745
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Everyone is here.

746
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Why are you all standing here?

747
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Let's go in and sit down.

748
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Give me some more time.

749
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
It should be done soon.

750
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Still waiting?

751
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,060
Daddy, have you really learned from the British chef?

752
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,060
I prepared some good things for everyone.

753
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,060
So I spent more time.

754
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Family master.

755
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
What do you want to do for us?

756
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,060
Wellington steak.

757
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
A steak.

758
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
This is my specialty.

759
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
I used to work in the Western restaurant.

760
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Really?

761
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
I am too.

762
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
I also learned from the foreign chef.

763
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,060
Really?

764
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
How about this?

765
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Ladies, sit there and wait for the meal.

766
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,060
The three of us will be responsible for this meal.

767
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Okay?

768
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
It's settled.

769
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Do you want to open it or break it?

770
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
I don't know.

771
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Your mushrooms are also in the water.

772
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Raymond, didn't you say you learned from the chef?

773
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,060
Now it's a beef steak.

774
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
Not a fried steak.

775
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Congratulations.

776
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Cheers.

777
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Thank you.

778
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Congratulations.

779
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Congratulations, you finally got into SAC.

780
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Thank you.

781
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
This gift is for you and me.

782
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
Don't worry, it's not more than 3000 yuan.

783
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,060
Don't worry about being arrested.

784
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
Okay.

785
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
It's beautiful. It suits me.

786
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Thank you.

787
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
It suits you.

788
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,060
In the future, when you investigate big cases,

789
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,060
you should take good care of it.

790
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
I just got in.

791
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Assistant investigation director.

792
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,060
When can I get into that big case?

793
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,060
You're smart.

794
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,060
You'll be there soon.

795
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I want to ask you something.

796
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,060
I'm supervising a construction project.

797
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
I think there's something wrong.

798
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Some workers say the architecture is wrong.

799
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
Did you report to your boss?

800
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
I'm going to see it tomorrow.

801
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Maybe your boss found a problem supplier.

802
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
How about this?

803
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Give me the information.

804
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,060
I'll report to my boss and open the case for you.

805
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
If you open the case,

806
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,060
it's not your first case.

807
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
Right.

808
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
You can pay for it.

809
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
No problem.

810
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I'll pay for it.

811
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Congratulations.

812
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Thank you.

813
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
I don't want to go to court.

814
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
Can we settle it outside?

815
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,060
No.

816
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
If we settle it,

817
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
you'll be a label forever.

818
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
And you're a plaintiff now.

819
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
You can't be a defendant.

820
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Don't worry.

821
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
We'll help you.

822
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
And I believe the court

823
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
will give a fair trial.

824
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm counting on you.

825
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,060
I'll stick to it.

826
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
What's wrong?

827
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Is there a problem with the last account?

828
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
We found the latest

829
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
installation contract

830
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
in the bank

831
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
with the Business Investigation Department.

832
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,060
Installation contract?

833
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
Didn't we get a copy?

834
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
That one is old.

835
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,060
This one is the latest.

836
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
What?

837
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
It's impossible.

838
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
This contract

839
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,060
was signed by Gong Youcheng.

840
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
How can it be signed by Richo now?

841
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
If the file is sent to the court,

842
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
it will be written as

843
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
the short-term witness is Richo.

844
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
I know.

845
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
What can it be?

846
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
The report is Richo.

847
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
This is a false witness.

848
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
You can't find out

849
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
who framed Richo.

850
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
And you're here to submit the file?

851
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
I made it up.

852
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
I asked someone to identify it.

853
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
They said it was Richo.

854
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm not sure.

855
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
I'm not sure.

856
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm not sure.

857
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
I asked someone to identify it.

858
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
They said it was the contract.

859
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
It's true.

860
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
I asked the witness to confirm it.

861
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
What can he do

862
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
if he changes his statement?

863
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
I said I would give up the case

864
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
and not sue Gong Youcheng.

865
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Change it to sue Richo?

866
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
The charge of this case

867
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
is established.

868
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
The charge is established.

869
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
It will be in jail for eight years.

870
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
Forget it.

871
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
It's been eight years.

872
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
I think it's time to let it go.

873
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
By the way,

874
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,060
are you developing with Jenny?

875
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
She's pretty good.

876
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Richo,

877
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Raymond told me

878
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
you used to do architecture.

879
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
I have a friend

880
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,060
who opened a new architecture company

881
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
and asked me to hire him.

882
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Are you interested?

883
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Thank you.

884
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
But I really don't want to do

885
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
anything related to architecture.

886
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm interested in cooking.

887
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
A friend has already

888
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
found me a job

889
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
and worked in a restaurant.

890
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
It's good to change the environment.

891
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
I'm so hungry.

892
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Can they really

893
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
do it in the kitchen?

894
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Don't worry.

895
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
Choser said they would definitely do it.

896
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,060
I guess they will

897
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
give us some food.

898
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,060
Do it again.

899
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Do it again?

900
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
It's already late.

901
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
It doesn't mean it tastes good

902
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
if it doesn't have a good appearance.

903
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,060
Men's business

904
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
is best done

905
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,060
by saying and doing.

906
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
Do it again.

907
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
I can't do it without faith.

908
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
This time,

909
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
you don't have to work.

910
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
You do the work.

911
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
I'll do the work.

912
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,060
But I think

913
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
she really wants to get back together.

914
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Then hurry up.

915
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,060
Save the last chance.

916
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
That's true.

917
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
Just understand some things in your heart.

918
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
Don't say it out.

919
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
Help her do it.

920
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
It's really good.

921
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
I told you

922
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
I learned it from the chef.

923
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
Awesome.

924
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Before eating,

925
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
I really want to thank you

926
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
for coming tonight.

927
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
And thank you

928
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
for helping me so much

929
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,060
when I was missing.

930
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
You saved my life.

931
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
I'm so grateful.

932
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
You're welcome.

933
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Come on.

934
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Try the dishes we cooked.

935
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Okay.

936
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Wait.

937
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Huilin's food is so good.

938
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
I'm so happy.

939
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Wait.

940
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,060
The essence of Huilin steak

941
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,060
is the cut part.

942
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
I'll share it with everyone.

943
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Wait.

944
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
What's wrong?

945
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
The essence is the essence.

946
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
I want to take a picture before eating.

947
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
Okay.

948
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,060
Take the camera.

949
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
This one?

950
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Yes.

951
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Okay, let's sit closer.

952
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
Okay.

953
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Look at the camera.

954
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Ready.

955
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
Three, two, one.

956
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
And you.

957
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Yes, you.

958
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
I'll take a picture too.

959
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Wait.

960
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Ready.

961
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
Three, two, one.

962
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Okay.

963
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,060
I'm so hungry.

964
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Let's eat.

965
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
You're so big.

966
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
Come on.

967
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Let's eat.

968
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Hurry up.

969
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Don't show your essence.

970
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Okay.

971
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
What do you want to eat?

972
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
I'll help you.

973
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Thank you.

974
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Drive home safely.

975
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Bye.

976
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Jianing.

977
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,060
I have something to tell you.

978
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
I went to Rongji.

979
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,060
I know you didn't buy the soup.

980
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
You made it.

981
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
If you like soup, I can order more.

982
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,060
Thank you for caring about me.

983
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
I want to say that

984
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
we're just the boss and subordinate.

985
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,060
And this relationship will not change.

986
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Adults

987
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
hope it won't affect your work performance.

988
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Good night.

989
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
Wait.

990
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
I have something to tell you too.

991
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Yes.

992
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
I like you.

993
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I know you don't accept me.

994
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
But you don't accept me.

995
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
It doesn't mean I can't continue to like you.

996
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Don't worry.

997
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,060
I'll keep my professionalism at work.

998
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
Good night.

999
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Since the first shooting,

1000
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
the crime rate has increased by 50%.

1001
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
If it goes on,

1002
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Hong Kong's security will only get worse.

1003
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I can only say that it's very timely

1004
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
and very meansful.

1005
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
This is a serious matter.

1006
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I approve that you can act with guns.

1007
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
I suggest that we tell the special forces

1008
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,060
to use emergency measures to open the surveillance power.

1009
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
We should be the first to do it.

1010
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:05,060
The season without you by my side

1011
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,060
is more obvious

1012
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,060
The fallen leaves

1013
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,060
are also tired of the wind

1014
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,060
Tired of chasing

1015
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:31,060
the perfect world

1016
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,060
Who can take me away

1017
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Who is at the far end

1018
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Who will fight with me for the world

1019
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Is there anyone

1020
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
who guards for me

1021
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,060
No need for too many reasons

1022
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Light up the fire in the dark

1023
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,060
Don't retreat

1024
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Smile if you are all around me

1025
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Until the end

1026
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Is there any remorse

1027
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:29,060
The season without you by my side

1028
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,060
is more obvious

1029
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:39,060
The fallen leaves

1030
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,060
are also tired of the wind

1031
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Tired of chasing

1032
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,060
the perfect world

1033
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,060
Who can take me away

1034
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Who is at the far end

1035
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Who will fight with me for the world

1036
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,060
Is there anyone

1037
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,060
who guards for me

1038
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,060
No need for too many reasons

1039
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,060
Light up the fire in the dark

1040
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Don't retreat

1041
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:33,060
Smile if you are all around me

1042
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,060
Until the end

1043
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,060
Is there anyone

1044
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,060
who guards for me

1045
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,060
No need for too many reasons

1046
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Light up the fire in the dark

1047
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,060
Don't retreat

1048
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,060
Smile if you are all around me

1049
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,060
Until the end

1050
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,060
Is there anyone

1051
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,060
who guards for me

1052
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,060
No need for too many reasons

1053
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:22,060
Light up the fire in the dark

1054
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Don't retreat

1055
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:35,060
Smile if you are all around me

1056
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,060
No need for too many reasons

1057
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,060
Light up the fire in the dark

1058
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,060
Don't retreat

1059
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:52,060
Smile if you are all around me

1060
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,060
Until the end
