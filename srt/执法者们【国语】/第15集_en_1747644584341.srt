1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mr. Dai, aren't you busy?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Why are you here?

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,120
What's the matter?

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,720
I'm here to see your subordinate, Zhou Junjie.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,640
He's on leave.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
He's not here.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,160
That's good.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,120
He's not fit to be a cop.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,320
He's here to do good things for us.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm here with Klein

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,440
to officially cancel our charge against

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,440
the senior inspector, Zhou Junjie,

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,920
and Mr. Dai Zu Fu.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,520
Laser,

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,520
I suggest you take him to the doctor.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,640
Otherwise, he'll scream

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,920
and bite people when he's out.

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,880
That's not good.

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,400
You guys should take care of your subordinate.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,280
He's so impulsive.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,760
He'll kill someone.

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,320
Has it been changed?

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,680
Who is the one in the mirror

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:40,680
who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,080
one who is the Chy dependencies

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:43,960
Yes

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,900
Because my mother

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,020
黄金

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,360
Jon

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,020
yss

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,340
yes

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,900
Dr.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,320
Dr.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,100
What

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,260
Dr.

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,560
Dr.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:00,980
What

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,900
The doctor

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,120
The doctor

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,140
Pen BOY

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,720
The doctor

43
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,420
The doctor

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,480
We don't believe this

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Somebody help me!

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,360
元一

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
Why does the virgin high Higher Chief Police still show no signs of complete algunas evidence?

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,920
their death

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Are you out of your mind?

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,120
No, I see

51
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,460
I've been on that case for gek out of a minute

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,680
His sufferings

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
He said you once offered him a chance to make a living.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,480
The condition is that he will use Jing Si's warning

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
to handle Hu Shao Hao's business case.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
May I ask what your explanation is?

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
First, when we were in the internal investigation,

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,080
Chen Jing Si did mention to me about his case.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
I think one of them is Hu Shao Hao's business case.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
But I don't remember the details.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,480
Also, I don't understand why ICAC is accusing me.

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,480
You are the head of Human Resources Department.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Will he really propose such a simple business case?

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,880
Or do you have a special relationship with Hu Shao Hao?

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,280
In my position, I do have the need to understand my colleagues' workload.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,480
To determine if I need to increase my staff or transfer my colleagues

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,680
to some department to be their support.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,880
These are normal requirements.

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,480
Maybe ICAC doesn't have many departments.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
It's normal to not understand.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,480
These cases are seriously hurting people.

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,880
Is Jing Si's warning light?

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,680
The victim is still unconscious.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Have you seen her or her family?

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Is it fair?

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,280
From what I know, the law doesn't limit the number of Jing Si's warning.

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,080
If the victim's family agrees to Jing Si's warning,

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,680
then what's the problem?

79
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
Moreover, the defendant is young.

80
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
He will consider the impact on his future.

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,080
If the victim's family agrees to Jing Si's warning,

82
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,880
then the police have the right to warn Jing Si.

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
There is no law that limits the number of the warning.

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,480
Just because of this, people are using this route and this system.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
But I don't understand.

86
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
A 15-year-old child fighting with other children.

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,880
What does this case have to do with ICAC?

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,680
15 years old is not a child anymore.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,080
It's a teenager with analysis skills.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,880
He needs to take responsibility.

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
And I'm not targeting this teenager.

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm targeting those who use this system to help someone

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
who is unfair.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,080
As a civil servant, I agree with your statement.

95
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,880
But if ICAC does something unreasonable without any evidence,

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,880
then you're using this system to black out Jing Yuan.

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,680
As a law enforcement force, we want evidence, not a straight line.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
You can rest assured about this.

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
We already have the initial evidence.

100
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,480
If necessary, we will arrest people who are not willing to accept it.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
That's the best.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
I hope that you ICAC will act as soon as possible.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Don't waste resources.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
You don't have any questions, right?

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,480
Then I'll go first. I'm busy today.

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
If you need anything, just call me.

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,080
fools

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Copied it.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Okay.

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,280
Fighting.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Fighting.

112
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
Fighting.

113
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Mr. Dai, do you want to come back?

114
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:38,280
The

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
You want to go?

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
It's useless.

117
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Xu Sisi?

118
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Why are you here?

119
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Zhou Sen

120
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Thank you for your hard work that day.

121
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Are you crazy?

122
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
You told me to kill people, not kill people.

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
They are all my brothers.

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
You just woke up now.

125
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Isn't it too late?

126
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Miss Xu, thank you.

127
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Mr. Dai is waiting for you.

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Xu Sisi, I'll save you out now.

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't be afraid, I'm a police.

130
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm afraid.

131
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Tell Mr. Dai that the traitor has been found.

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
The boat is ready.

133
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Mr. Dai will wait for you in the sea.

134
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
So you and Dai Zuofu are a team.

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Where's my wife?

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I dare to beat you.

137
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
You are bold.

138
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
How are you two?

139
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Tonight you are the main character.

140
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
You'll know when the time comes.

141
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Be gentle.

142
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Don't hurt him.

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
He is our VIP.

144
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Hu Shaohao's business case.

145
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Evidence is enough.

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
You can withdraw from the court.

147
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
I can't sleep.

148
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
I don't think he will be so cautious.

149
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
I don't know why Zhuang Weilin's mother

150
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
would sign this agreement.

151
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Will someone force her to sign?

152
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Her mother wouldn't want to see me.

153
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Since the establishment of the Law Firm,

154
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
we have never tried to overturn the caution.

155
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Once in court,

156
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
the judge will ask a lot of questions.

157
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Are you afraid?

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm afraid that

159
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
if Zhuang Weilin's mother doesn't go to court,

160
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
we will lose a core evidence.

161
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
What about Lu Yongtong?

162
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Is it enough to sue him?

163
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Now you only have

164
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
a mobile phone GPS evidence.

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
You suspect that

166
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
he is a high-level mole in the police.

167
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
These indirect evidence

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
are always high-risk.

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I'm thinking why Lu Yongtong

170
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
should help him.

171
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
For money or other reasons?

172
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
I think you can

173
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
investigate in this direction.

174
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
If Lu Yongtong is really a mole,

175
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
he is the biggest threat in the police.

176
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Not only my uncle's case,

177
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
but even Richo's case.

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
He may know about it.

179
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
He even knows the truth.

180
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Anyway, I will remind Zhuang Weilin

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
that his mother will stand up

182
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
and make it clear.

183
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
I will follow Hu Shaohao.

184
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
I also want to find out what is the relationship between him and Hu Shaohao.

185
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
We will split up.

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Go back to work.

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Okay. Bye.

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Bye.

189
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
How is it?

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Any news from sister?

191
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
I sent her a message

192
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
asking about her wife.

193
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
But she didn't reply.

194
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
I also looked for her. She didn't reply.

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
After all, her wife

196
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
disappeared.

197
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
It's normal that she didn't see her.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Where is Richo?

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Where did she move to?

200
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
She didn't reply.

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Really?

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Anyway,

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
if Lu Yongtong is a mole,

204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
it means he knows about

205
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
the thing about Dai Zufu.

206
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Maybe he can help your uncle

207
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
to find the truth.

208
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Sorry.

209
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Jenny. Hi.

210
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
This is the information about Hu Shaohao's case.

211
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Thank you. Sorry for being late.

212
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I had a meeting just now.

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I asked you to come here to find me.

215
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
It's okay. I have nothing to do after work.

216
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Go in quickly. Your boyfriend is waiting for you.

217
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
It's not a boyfriend. It's an ordinary friend.

218
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
And I don't want to go back.

219
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Can you do me a favor?

220
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I thought

221
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
there were only two of us today.

222
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
But we didn't eat anything.

223
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
You don't mind, do you?

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
No.

225
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Let me introduce first.

226
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Jenny. She is an investigator of ICAC.

227
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I have been working with her for a long time.

228
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
This is Howard.

229
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
He is my coach in the gym.

230
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
He often invites me to dinner.

231
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Not only that,

232
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
he also said that his friend's hotel has a VIP room

233
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
that can invite me to go on vacation.

234
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Do you want to come with me?

235
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Howard.

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
It's like this.

237
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Vacation is a gift.

238
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
As law enforcement officers, it may not be easy to accept.

239
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Yes.

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Howard.

241
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm really sorry.

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I'm really grateful for your kindness to me.

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
But I think we're going to have a good meal.

244
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Okay.

245
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I'll go first.

246
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Bye.

247
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Thank you.

248
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
It's nothing.

249
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Do you usually have many guys to invite you out for dinner?

250
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Not many.

251
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Maybe one or two a week.

252
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
One or two? So many?

253
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Are you interested in every one?

254
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Of course not.

255
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
But we lawyers often have to socialize.

256
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
How can we know if it's appropriate

257
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
if we don't meet?

258
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
How many times have you taken pictures?

259
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Me?

260
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Twenty times.

261
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Just twice.

262
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Twice? How is that possible?

263
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You're so pretty. There must be many people who want you.

264
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I've been in love for a long time.

265
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
So how are you

266
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
with Gosser?

267
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Don't you like Gosser?

268
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
How do you know?

269
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Why wouldn't I know?

270
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
You're so obvious.

271
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Am I obvious?

272
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
How are you with Gosser?

273
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
No.

274
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
Just working, working, working, working.

275
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Working, working, working. And then?

276
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
We usually

277
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
meet at work.

278
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
We didn't... Wait a minute.

279
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
What's your MBTI?

280
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
INFJ.

281
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
No wonder.

282
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
You're an iron.

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Do you know that when you

284
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
meet someone you like,

285
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
it's like when you're investigating a case.

286
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
You have to know your own feelings.

287
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
You have to know his likes,

288
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
you have to be close, you have to be considerate.

289
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
You can't be by his side

290
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
and make him feel like you're his friend.

291
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
You're not happy?

292
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
No.

293
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Worried about Le Qiao?

294
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I miss him a lot.

295
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Right away.

296
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
No, come, let's go.

297
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
As long as we act faster

298
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
and do everything right,

299
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
let godfather and hospital tell us,

300
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
they will phot thumb it.

301
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
When Le Qiao is done with the surgery

302
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
and resistant,

303
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,320
Thank you, say Hello.

304
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,320
Godmother.

305
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Mr. Da.

306
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,720
At the meeting?

307
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm going out to work.

308
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,040
How's your cooperation?

309
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,200
攝利

310
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Have you prepared what I told you to do?

311
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
Almost ready.

312
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,800
Almost ready.

313
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,360
I told you to come to Baolei so early

314
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
to prepare as soon as possible.

315
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
Xiaoyao.

316
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
I told you to keep an eye on Dennis.

317
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,280
You didn't even know that

318
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,480
he took the gun away.

319
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
The goods were gone.

320
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
And you even wanted to leave a big change

321
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
for us to clean up.

322
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Sorry, Godfather.

323
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
I promised your mother

324
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,120
that I would take good care of you

325
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
and watch you grow up.

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
One day,

327
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,040
you will take over all my business.

328
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,480
I told you to come early

329
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,520
to manage this Baolei

330
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,280
so that you can see how to do business.

331
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,960
You can't even do this.

332
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,920
How can you manage your business

333
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
and trade with the customers in the future?

334
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,040
Do you want to be a horseman forever?

335
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,560
No.

336
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,680
Gong Yongcheng is dead.

337
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
Didn't he just change his body?

338
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
He was in a bad state.

339
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm looking for someone to investigate this matter.

340
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
The number of people who believed in him

341
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,720
was getting smaller and smaller.

342
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm doing this Baolei

343
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,800
to prevent people from catching the bait.

344
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,080
As long as this system works well,

345
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,320
then we can

346
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
re-establish a new system.

347
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,600
I see, Godfather.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,880
I see, Godfather.

349
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,640
How's the next performance going?

350
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
I'm ready.

351
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,760
I've sent the invitation file

352
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,720
and sent the data.

353
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,200
I've also checked the live streaming system.

354
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
The server and network should be fine.

355
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,600
There shouldn't be any

356
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,720
lagging like last time.

357
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,600
Thank you.

358
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,040
I've been following that kid for a few days.

359
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,160
It seems that he goes to school and school every day.

360
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
He doesn't look like he can hit people.

361
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
He even hit him so hard.

362
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
He's like a man in a house.

363
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm like you.

364
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm off school.

365
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,960
This kid only eats take-out food every day?

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
His father is working in the mainland.

367
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
He doesn't have time to take care of him.

368
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Vicky is currently on duty.

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,200
I'll send you home.

370
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,720
Hello.

371
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,240
I'll be right back.

372
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,000
Do you want me to go with you?

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,800
I'll go with you.

374
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,520
I'll go with you.

375
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,400
I'll go with you.

376
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,360
I'll go with you.

377
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,400
I'll go with you.

378
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I'll go with you.

379
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I'll go with you.

380
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll go with you.

381
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I'll go with you.

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,680
Haoran.

383
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,280
Mrs. Qiu.

384
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,200
Mrs. Wang.

385
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,320
Why are you here?

386
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,560
Someone complained about you.

387
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,680
Did you leak water?

388
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,400
Leak water?

389
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,280
No.

390
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I didn't leak water.

391
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
Don't listen to them.

392
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
They always make fun of me.

393
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I didn't leak water.

394
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,160
The house is fine.

395
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
No problem.

396
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,080
Mrs. Wang.

397
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,880
Do you want me to throw all the garbage away?

398
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,160
No, no.

399
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,000
My husband left all of these to me.

400
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,560
You can't throw away everything.

401
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
No, no.

402
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,480
I'll help you clean up.

403
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
No, no, no.

404
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,440
These are all your uncle's favorite foods.

405
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
There are steamed pig's hands.

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,080
His favorite food.

407
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Pork feet and ginger.

408
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
I bought it for him.

409
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,680
Why can't I find it?

410
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
Where is it?

411
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,520
What are you looking for?

412
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,440
The photo album that I went out with your uncle last time.

413
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,080
I can't find it.

414
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,560
That photo album.

415
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
I went to many places with him.

416
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
I couldn't find it.

417
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Look.

418
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,960
It's all messed up.

419
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,760
Your uncle hates it the most.

420
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,840
I'll clean it up.

421
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
No.

422
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,680
I have to find the photo album first.

423
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,480
How about this?

424
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll help you find it later.

425
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
No.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
I've already found it.

427
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
How can I not find it?

428
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,160
Haoran.

429
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,720
Do you remember where it is?

430
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
I showed it to you last time.

431
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I don't remember.

432
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Maybe in the room.

433
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,560
In the room.

434
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Let me see.

435
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,800
Maybe in the room.

436
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,280
I'll go see where the water is leaking.

437
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,200
Thank you.

438
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Wen.

439
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Your aunt is like this now.

440
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
It's easy to get into trouble.

441
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I didn't expect it.

442
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
It's only been a few months.

443
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
It's all my fault.

444
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I knew that I was investigating the case every day.

445
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I neglected the closest people around me.

446
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
I think I have to change it.

447
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I can't let my aunt face it alone.

448
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
You have to remember.

449
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
You're not alone.

450
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You have me and Raymond.

451
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Thank you.

452
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Hello.

454
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm a re-examination specialist

455
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
in the police department.

456
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
My name is Liu Yufan.

457
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
By the way,

458
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
how is Wei Ling now?

459
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
You don't have to care about her.

460
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
You're here to seduce the law enforcement.

461
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
You're here to play nice.

462
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Go away.

463
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Don't disturb us.

464
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I know how much this matter

465
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
has hit you.

466
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
No matter what you do,

467
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
you can't make up for it.

468
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You have to help your son

469
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
to get back the public opinion.

470
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Public opinion?

471
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
That day when they forced me

472
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
to sign the police report,

473
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
where was the public opinion?

474
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Who helped us?

475
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Although I didn't handle the case myself,

477
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
now I will

478
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
overturn the police report.

479
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I will go to court

480
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
and sue Young Master Hu for serious injury.

481
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
So your testimony is very important.

482
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Because I want you to go to court as a witness.

483
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Really?

484
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
You have time to sue now?

485
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
No need to say sorry.

486
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
We understand.

487
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
You are noble.

488
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I understand.

489
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
It's unfair.

490
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
It's really unfair

491
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
to feel that no one helps.

492
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
When my daughter was born,

493
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I was like you now.

494
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I felt helpless.

495
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
After my wife passed away,

496
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
I was the only one

497
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
who handled my daughter's affairs.

498
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
But later,

499
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
I had a good friend

500
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
who came to take care of us.

501
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
But later,

502
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
because of one thing,

503
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
he had been in prison for eight years.

504
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Because I couldn't help him,

505
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
this matter has always been

506
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
a thorn in my heart.

507
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I can see the real murderer

508
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
wandering outside the law.

509
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I understand that pain.

510
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
So I don't want this to happen

511
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
to become a thorn in your heart.

512
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,200
If I had found out earlier,

513
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
you wouldn't have to go through so much pain.

514
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Give me a chance.

515
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Help your son get justice back.

516
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Even if you don't believe in the system,

517
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I hope you can trust me once.

518
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I will sue Hu Shao Hao

519
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
in the name of the law firm.

520
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Of course,

521
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
if you can get out of prison,

522
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
you will be able to

523
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
give Hu Shao Hao psychological pressure.

524
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
What we need most now

525
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
is him.

526
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Hu Shao Hao

527
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Hu Shao Hao

528
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Hu Shao Hao

529
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Hu Shao Hao

530
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Hu Shao Hao

531
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Hu Shao Hao

532
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Hu Shao Hao

533
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Hu Shao Hao

534
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Hu Shao Hao

535
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Hu Shao Hao

536
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Hu Shao Hao

537
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Hu Shao Hao

538
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Hu Shao Hao

539
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Hu Shao Hao

540
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Hu Shao Hao

541
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Hu Shao Hao

542
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Hu Shao Hao

543
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Hu Shao Hao

544
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Hu Shao Hao

545
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Hu Shao Hao

546
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Hu Shao Hao

547
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Hu Shao Hao

548
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Hu Shao Hao

549
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Hu Shao Hao

550
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Hu Shao Hao

551
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Hu Shao Hao

552
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Hu Shao Hao

553
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Hu Shao Hao

554
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Hu Shao Hao

555
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Hu Shao Hao

556
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Hu Shao Hao

557
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Hu Shao Hao

558
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Hu Shao Hao

559
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Hu Shao Hao

560
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Hu Shao Hao

561
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200

562
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Hu Shao Hao

563
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Hu Shao Hao

564
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Hu Shao Hao

565
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Hu Shao Hao

566
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

567
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Welcome to the flashdown.

568
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,200
The show is about to start again.

569
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Are you ready?

570
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Let's see how many survivors there are tonight.

571
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Two!

572
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
There are two survivors today!

573
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Six of them will play together until they die!

574
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Okay.

575
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Let's see who will be the first one to perform today!

576
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
The first one is...

577
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Number 24!

578
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
The next one is...

579
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Number 76!

580
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
The third one is...

581
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Number 18!

582
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
The fourth one is...

583
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Number 132!

584
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Number 132!

585
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
The next one is...

586
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Number 9!

587
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
The last one is...

588
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Number 3!

589
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Let me introduce first.

590
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Number 3 is the first time he's been to the Black Show.

591
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
He is an Acero.

592
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
His name is Aichi!

593
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
He came here for his wife today.

594
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Will he be able to survive for his wife until the end?

595
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
The Black Show is about to start!

596
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Have you already set the number you like on the screen?

597
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
That's right.

598
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I've already prepared everything.

599
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
How are you going to play?

600
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,200
I want to see how long I can play for.

601
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Let's get started.

602
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Our rules are simple.

603
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
The six who play until the end,

604
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
they are the winners tonight!

605
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,600
The last two will be the winners tonight!

606
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,000
The rest will all die!

607
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,800
Isn't it exciting?

608
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Xu People's Hospital

609
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,700
Start.

610
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,020
Before this should start,

611
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,900
I want to remind the chief prosecutor and the defense lawyer

612
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,540
This is the children's court of the court of the judge

613
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
You are responsible

614
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,020
In a plain language

615
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,260
Explain to the defendant the content of the charge

616
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,700
Ensure that the defendant understands the nature of the charge

617
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,780
Judge, prepare to answer

618
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,900
Hu Shaohao, you are now accused of violating Hong Kong law

619
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,820
Article 212

620
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,500
Violation of the Human Rights Act

621
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,700
Article 17

622
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,500
Make Zhuang Weilin injured

623
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,220
Or seriously injured by other forms

624
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Do you admit your crime?

625
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,780
No

626
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,780
Due to the injured Zhuang Weilin

627
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,780
Still in the hospital

628
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,300
The控方 will present

629
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,820
Hu Shaohao's warning testimony as evidence

630
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,940
Hu Shaohao, how do you describe

631
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,740
Your relationship with Zhuang Weilin

632
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,260
Friend

633
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,580
I need to report

634
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,460
Look at the photo evidence P16A

635
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,700
Please write it down

636
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,420
Your friend was beaten like this

637
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,780
Have you seen it

638
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,780
No

639
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,180
On the day of the park

640
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,820
Only you and Zhuang Weilin two people

641
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,260
You are the one who beat him

642
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,020
Right

643
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,060
Did you see who beat him?

644
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,180
I don't remember

645
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,500
Do you remember

646
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,140
How did the person who beat him beat him?

647
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,900
He used a fist or a stone

648
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,860
How to beat

649
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,820
Can beat him like this

650
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,020
Witness, you have to answer

651
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,780
Time passes too long

652
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,740
I don't remember

653
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,220
In short, I only hit him once

654
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,060
One punch

655
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,700
That is to say, one punch

656
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,620
Can beat your friend like this

657
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,380
I do not know

658
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,180
What time did it happen?

659
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,620
The statement says seven o'clock in the evening

660
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,780
Judge

661
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,700
Judge

662
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,500
In fact, the defense is not controversial

663
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,180
The accuracy of the statement

664
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,060
I don't understand why the chief prosecutor

665
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,820
Still have to be entangled in this issue

666
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,540
Zhuang Weilin seems to have woken up

667
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,860
Judge

668
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,140
Just received medical notice

669
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,740
The condition of the injured is also improving

670
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,900
I want to apply for a rest

671
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,700
Let's first understand the condition of the injured

672
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,540
See if he can arrange him to leave the court to testify

673
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,620
Rest

674
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,660
Perhaps

675
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,380
Do you choose not to enter?

676
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,500
Ok

677
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,260
Both come and go

678
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,300
How to see your wife

679
00:34:45,620 --> 00:35:11,500
Attack.

680
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Everyone, what weapon do you want to play today?

681
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Joseph, your wife is waiting for you.

682
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Put the weapon down.

683
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Put the axe on her.

684
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Go.

685
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I have a way to get out of here.

686
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
But you have to help me.

687
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
I really like her more and more.

688
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Zhou Junjie is like a chicken that knows how to lay golden eggs.

689
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
If you see the data tonight, you will be happier.

690
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,500
The black show just now, the investment amount is 600 million dollars.

691
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
It's twice the usual.

692
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
There are police inside, enough to alert.

693
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Then should we let her see her wife?

694
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Of course.

695
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Does she like to see her wife so much?

696
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Give her a surprise.

697
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Do you know that you two are very valuable?

698
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
You helped me win a lot of boxing.

699
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I want you to rest.

700
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
It's your wife's turn.

701
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
What do you want?

702
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Let her go.

703
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Let her go.

704
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I heard that Wang Zhengxiong is your uncle.

705
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Please answer my question.

706
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I did it.

707
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
But it's not to help the ancestors.

708
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Love has no regrets

709
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,500
The season without you by my side

710
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Is more obvious

711
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Falling leaves

712
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Is the same as the wind

713
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm tired of chasing

714
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,500
The world that pursues perfection

715
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Who can take me away

716
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Who is at the far end

717
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Who will fight with me for the world

718
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Is there anyone

719
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Who will guard for me

720
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
I don't need too many reasons

721
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Light up the fire in the dark

722
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I won't give up

723
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I'll be the one who holds you in my arms

724
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Until the end

725
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Love has no regrets

726
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:10,500
The season without you by my side

727
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Is more obvious

728
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Falling leaves

729
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Is the same as the wind

730
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
I'm tired of chasing

731
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,500
The world that pursues perfection

732
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Who can take me away

733
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Who is at the far end

734
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Who will fight with me for the world

735
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Is there anyone

736
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Who will guard for me

737
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I don't need too many reasons

738
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Light up the fire in the dark

739
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I won't give up

740
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,500
I'll be the one who holds you in my arms

741
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Until the end

742
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Love has no regrets

743
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,500
The season without you by my side

744
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500

Is the same as the wind

747
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm tired of chasing

748
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,500
The world that pursues perfection

749
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Who can take me away

750
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Who is at the far end

751
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Who will fight with me for the world

752
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I don't need too many reasons

753
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Light up the fire in the dark

754
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
I won't give up

755
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I'll be the one who holds you in my arms

756
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
The Long Ballad

757
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Everything is okay

758
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,500
As long as you're here, it's okay
