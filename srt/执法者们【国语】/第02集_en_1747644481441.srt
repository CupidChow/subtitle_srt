1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Our ordnance department

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,520
has a joint operation spoke to us

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,780
and we will make the witness come to the coelg secondary school

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,340
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,540
The number you dialed

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,180
is no longer working.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,540
He's dead?

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,860
I have reasons to suspect

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,700
that if not,

10
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,500
someone is sipping some alcohol

11
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,300
and stuff.

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,300
Is that what it is?

13
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,380
Really?

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,520
I've been 30 years

15
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,980
since we last talked.

16
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,860
What?

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,580
My brain is FM.

18
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,380
There is a person who is involved in the hostage protection plan.

19
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,860
Because everyone has the suspicion of being a mole.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,700
This world is cruel.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,340
The person around you may not be a good person.

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,580
You are the most suspicious one

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,540
among the people I investigated.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:15,580
Who is the person in the mirror who is concerned about the exchange?

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,020
Who can take me away?

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,980
Who is at the far end of the world?

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,180
Who can exchange hands with me?

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Is there anyone who can protect me?

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,180
I don't need too many reasons.

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,180
In the dark, the fireflies light up.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,180
I don't need to be afraid.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,180
I can smile if you are by my side.

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
Until the end.

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,180
I don't need to be afraid.

35
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Are you okay?

36
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
Are you worthy of being a leader?

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
You have killed my husband.

38
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Wait a moment.

39
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,180
Zhou Junjie.

40
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Gao Haoran, the chief investigator of ICAC.

41
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,180
Now he suspects that you are a police officer.

42
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,180
You are being bribe.

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,180
You leaked the information of the police's secret action.

44
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,180
You caused two witnesses to die.

45
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
One of them is missing.

46
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,180
He wants to ask you to go back to help with the investigation.

47
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,180
I am just here to help with the investigation.

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Is it necessary to disturb my wife?

49
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
Zhou Junjie.

50
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,180
All the people involved in the case,

51
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,180
whether it is colleagues or family members,

52
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,180
will all be invited back to help with the investigation.

53
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,180
We follow the procedure.

54
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
As a senior inspector,

55
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,180
there is no reason not to know.

56
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
Okay.

57
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,180
Do you like to play with procedures the most in ICAC?

58
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,180
Okay.

59
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
I will go to the police station.

60
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,180
I will go to the police station.

61
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,180
Do you like to play with procedures?

62
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
Okay.

63
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180
I am fine.

64
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Don't worry.

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
Miss He Tianru.

66
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,180
As you know,

67
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Zhou Junjie has no debt problem.

68
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
I have known him for ten years.

69
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,180
He never borrowed money from others.

70
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,180
We know you are having a divorce.

71
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
He never borrowed money from others.

72
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Zhou Sen.

73
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
Half a year ago, you borrowed 500,000 yuan from others.

74
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
Right?

75
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
Yes.

76
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,180
It has been ten minutes since I came in.

77
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,180
You have been asking some personal questions.

78
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,180
What do you want?

79
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,180
You are not pushing it.

80
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
You are making up stories.

81
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
I can tell you.

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,180
Even if Zhou Junjie is not a good husband,

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
he is definitely a good police.

84
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,180
I am borrowing money from others and owed them.

85
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
I am asking you.

86
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Where is the interest?

87
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Your reasoning is not logical.

88
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
If there is a problem with the money,

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
it will increase the chance of being bought

90
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
and taken back.

91
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
How do I know if you are borrowing money from others?

92
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
You actually borrowed a lot of money from others.

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Do you mind asking you a personal question?

94
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Why did you divorce?

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
When I was on the move that day,

96
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,180
I saw that Alex

97
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
sent a message on his private phone.

98
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
I don't know what he sent.

99
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,180
It is hard to describe the feelings.

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Anyway, I don't want to answer personal questions.

101
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
All the phone records that day,

102
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
we checked them all.

103
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,180
Alex sent a message

104
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,180
to his wife.

105
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
He told her that

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
he couldn't go back for dinner tonight.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Also, we just received

108
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
a police notice.

109
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,180
We found Alex's body.

110
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
He is dead?

111
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,180
You are also a customs officer.

112
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
I understand the difficulty of us as the executors.

113
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
My conclusion is

114
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
Alex is a responsible

115
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,180
but unfortunate agent.

116
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,180
But you,

117
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,180
you are the most suspicious

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
among my investigators.

119
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
I had a informant before.

120
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
His name is Fa Shu.

121
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Stop! Police!

122
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Stop!

123
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
Fa Shu!

124
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Fa Shu!

125
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Help me take care of my son.

126
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
Don't worry.

127
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
I have settled the debt

128
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
Xiao Qiang owes me.

129
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
I will do

130
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
what I promised you.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
I lent him 500,000 yuan half a year ago.

132
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
Then he used my name

133
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,180
to be a guarantor.

134
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,180
He borrowed a lot of money from the financial company.

135
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
So I was caught up in debt.

136
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
This is my unborn child.

137
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Are you satisfied with this answer?

138
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,180
I tried to tell you this story.

139
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
The person in charge

140
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,180
revealed the route

141
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
to the killers.

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
Those killers

143
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
prepared a lot of snipers

144
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
to kill a police officer.

145
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
The background

146
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,180
is the last scene.

147
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,180
The hand-pulled eggs

148
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
are just a piece of cake.

149
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
They are all the script.

150
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
Take your time to make assumptions.

151
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,180
But remember,

152
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,180
you need to find evidence.

153
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
You are so high-profile

154
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,180
to invite people to the funeral.

155
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Aren't you afraid of disturbing the mood?

156
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
I just tried.

157
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,180
If Zhou Jinjie really helped Grandfather Dai,

158
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
he would definitely ask Grandfather Dai for help.

159
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
You must have clues

160
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
if you follow him 24 hours.

161
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,180
ICAC has opened a file

162
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,180
to investigate you.

163
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
I think you are not suitable to stay in the police force for now.

164
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
I think you need to quit.

165
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Wait.

166
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
Now Zhou Jinjie is just helping ICAC

167
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
to investigate.

168
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,180
I don't want to have other

169
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
gossip about the police.

170
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,180
It's not only him who is responsible for the reputation

171
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
of the police.

172
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
But he must be punished.

173
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,180
I am willing to accept the internal investigation.

174
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,180
I am willing to quit.

175
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Goodbye, sir.

176
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
I am Ding Xiaofei,

177
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
your son.

178
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
I have said it many times.

179
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
I am Xiaofei.

180
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
Xiaofei.

181
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Xiaofei.

182
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
Xiaofei.

183
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
Xiaofei.

184
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Mom, you go first.

185
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Finally, it's not me.

186
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
It's not me.

187
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
It's not me.

188
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
It's not me.

189
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Finally, it's not me.

190
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
What's up?

191
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
You saw Xiao Qiangmei. I couldn't find her for several days.

192
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,180
What's wrong? Something happened again?

193
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
She made me in trouble.

194
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
She borrowed money from me all day long.

195
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,180
ICAC is investigating her.

196
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
She has been called to quit gambling.

197
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,180
But if you can't find her,

198
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
you may really run away.

199
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
Will you make the police

200
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
do nothing?

201
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
How can you?

202
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,180
You are so capable.

203
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,180
You can't find her.

204
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
And we talked about

205
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
the money for the cash.

206
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,180
Is it...

207
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Just kidding.

208
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Let me show you something.

209
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,180
The whole Hong Kong discussion area

210
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
is talking about the police.

211
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Is there someone who betrayed the cash?

212
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
The witness died, the missing person disappeared.

213
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,180
You are the only one who is safe.

214
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,180
If even Wang Zhenxiong

215
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
died, you can't explain it clearly.

216
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,180
That's why I am so anxious to find you.

217
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
Now Alex is dead,

218
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,180
and Xu Sisi is missing.

219
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
You know many people,

220
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
but you can't find her.

221
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
You are looking for the information of Dai Zufu.

222
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Is he crazy?

223
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
He died by accident.

224
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Yes, he is careful.

225
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
But I ask you to be serious.

226
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
If you can't find Xu Sisi,

227
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,180
find Xiao Qiang for me.

228
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Okay, I will try my best.

229
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Okay.

230
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,180
That's all.

231
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
hey

232
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
ma'am

233
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:20,980
Our

234
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
I can't want to see the police.

235
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,060
Produce daddy'ssuited

236
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Always care about going back.

237
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Plus, we can't let go of it.

238
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,660
I just wanted to tell you about what happened just now.

239
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,860
Nothing else.

240
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,660
I'll send you back.

241
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
No need. I'll call a cab.

242
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
Do we really not have a chance anymore?

243
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,060
I believe that you are a good police officer. It doesn't mean that I believe that you will change your mind.

244
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
We've been together for so many years. Can't we give each other a chance?

245
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,660
There's no room for us to go back.

246
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,860
How many times have you cared about me?

247
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,860
I didn't mean that.

248
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,860
You said that you didn't mean that, but in fact,

249
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm always behind you.

250
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Forget it.

251
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,660
Continue with the divorce. If you have anything to say, tell the lawyer.

252
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,740
You've had enough!

253
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,460
How is the situation? What happened?

254
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm fine.

255
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
You're a father now.

256
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,980
You're playing with me.

257
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,180
Really?

258
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,700
Thanks, wife.

259
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,340
You bought a woman's clothes and shoes for a man's clothes.

260
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,300
What should we do now?

261
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,860
You're just talking about me.

262
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,940
You bought a bracelet too, right?

263
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,900
This one.

264
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,940
A girl's bracelet.

265
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,900
You know it must be a girl's bracelet.

266
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
What if it's a boy's bracelet?

267
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,380
And it's so big.

268
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,860
How can it be this big?

269
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,060
I'll eat an apple.

270
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,140
What?

271
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,740
I don't want you to go on like this.

272
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,460
You're still like this for a month or two.

273
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,620
Do you want to be like this in the future?

274
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,660
That's your child.

275
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,540
Why can you say that?

276
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,500
Do you want to divorce?

277
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,580
You can divorce if you want.

278
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
I don't believe that you would be soズ

279
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,260
to say that.

280
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,100
You talk with me.

281
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,420
I didn't tell you to help him.

282
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm making ammm grant

283
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,580
andallow him to leave.

284
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,380
You came up here for good photos.

285
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,660
Let's go back.

286
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Do you want to have some supper?

287
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm a little hungry.

288
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Okay.

289
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Haoran, drinking soup like this doesn't require a spoon.

290
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
This is the right way to drink it.

291
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Come, let's drink together.

292
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,860
You're drinking a whole bowl of soup without any soup?

293
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,860
My uncle likes drinking soup like this.

294
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Maybe he was brought up by him.

295
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,860
He was influenced by him.

296
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Would you mind asking your parents...

297
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Siqi was the most beautiful.

298
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
I was only six years old at that time.

299
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
I was a little too young.

300
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,860
When I was a child, I didn't have much experience.

301
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
I was only six years old at that time.

302
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,860
After that, my uncle and aunt took me home.

303
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
They treated me like their own son.

304
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
They gave me a home.

305
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,860
What happened, we can't change.

306
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,860
But what didn't happen, we can still do our best.

307
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Drink another bowl of soup.

308
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,860
When you are drunk, only alcohol can empower you...

309
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,360
to help those victims of sexual abuse.

310
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Also, am I right that every girl doesn't like to be honest?

311
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Don't men seem to be produkts?

312
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Some men feel that they always need help.

313
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,580
Anyway,

314
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,580
I need your help especially.

315
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,380
Okay.

316
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,060
Mr. Liu,

317
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Mr. Liu, this is the photo I took with Lin Meixia.

318
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,060
I know this photo is a little bit far away and a little bit blurry.

319
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
But I can see where that place is.

320
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Do you know where he went?

321
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
I know. Let me see first.

322
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,060
And which floor did he go to? What company is there in the building?

323
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
What is the name of the business building? Do you know?

324
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,060
I know. That building is called Cuiying Business Center.

325
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
What about the door number?

326
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
I didn't get it.

327
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Hurry up and take it back. I want to know what company is there.

328
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Okay.

329
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Zhui Li, as a supervisor, it's not every time you have to rely on others to give us the information.

330
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,060
Sometimes we have to find a way to get the information ourselves.

331
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,060
You have to find a way that belongs to you. Do you understand?

332
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Gao Sir, Lin Meixia's information about the currency.

333
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,060
As far as I know, Wang Zhen Xiong has never been good at investing.

334
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
So what he usually buys are some stable things.

335
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,060
For example, those funds or those low-risk stocks.

336
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Mr. Liu, that's the door number of the building.

337
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,060
I remember that the elevator was stopped at 17th, 21st and 24th floors.

338
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,060
The whole brick, the

339
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,060
rich and the poor, the beauty center, the financial company.

340
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
With his character, there's no reason to buy the encrypted currency.

341
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
But they did buy a lot in the last half year.

342
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
They even bought 5 million per letter.

343
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,060
But I guess it's not the beauty center or the whole brick.

344
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Why do you say that?

345
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Because Lin Meixia is the owner of the whole brick.

346
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Because Lin Meixia is not a woman who likes to dress up.

347
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,060
She won't spend money on beauty or on the whole brick.

348
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
What about the rehabilitation clinic?

349
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
I've checked it. This is his medical record.

350
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
He regularly goes to the public hospital for rehabilitation.

351
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,060
But it's all three-degrees. There's no problem of rehabilitation.

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
So it won't be a rehabilitation clinic.

353
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Rehabilitation financial case?

354
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,060
The previous rehabilitation financial case's encrypted currency business was suspected of fraud.

355
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,060
Many shareholders couldn't even take back the money because they invested in the encrypted currency.

356
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,060
This is the name of the shareholders who reported the case.

357
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Lin Meixia's name is also here?

358
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,060
That's right. So Lin Meixia should be the one who took the rehabilitation financial case.

359
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
Actually, you know everything.

360
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Why do you still want me to investigate?

361
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Do you want others to tell you the answer every time?

362
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,060
At least you can find it yourself.

363
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,060
She didn't go to the rehabilitation clinic or the beauty clinic.

364
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
This is called progress.

365
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Lin Meixia actually solved the case.

366
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
She's really a little weird.

367
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,060
Get out.

368
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Where are you going?

369
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
I want to know something in person.

370
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,060
What do you want?

371
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
I want to know.

372
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
That's all right.

373
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Go.

374
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Go.

375
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
I don't want to know.

376
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
I don't want to know.

377
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Go.

378
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Are you crazy?

379
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,060
You said you wanted someone, but not to kill!

380
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
They are all my brothers!

381
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,220
Stop been.

382
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,620
犹啊

383
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,820
Come in

384
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,540
Nothing

385
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,540
Brother Xun

386
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,740
I want to ask you something

387
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,520
Sir

388
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,600
Do you remember what you told that man on the day of the operation?

389
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,360
What are you trying to say? I don't understand.

390
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,440
I was a little depressed that day.

391
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,000
But I remembered it just now.

392
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,840
You had a conversation with that man. You know him.

393
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,240
How was I supposed to know him? Did you remember it wrong?

394
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
I also heard that he mentioned your nephew Gao Haoran.

395
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,660
Say it. Did he use your nephew to threaten you?

396
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,240
I don't know what you're talking about. I need to rest.

397
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Are you coming in?

398
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
How do you explain?

399
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,120
I don't even know what happened.

400
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,680
You don't know what happened?

401
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,920
It's obvious now.

402
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,320
You're the mole.

403
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,240
Someone is afraid that you'll expose yourself.

404
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
So they asked the killer to kill you.

405
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
Don't talk nonsense.

406
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,960
How do I know

407
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
if the killer is here to kill me or you?

408
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,600
Are you going to die

409
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,560
without telling the truth?

410
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
I don't know anything.

411
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,200
No need to ask.

412
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,800
All of our brothers are dead.

413
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,040
You still don't dare to say who is the mole.

414
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,160
Do you still have a conscience?

415
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Stop!

416
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
Jiu Jiu, are you okay?

417
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,160
I'm fine. It's just a misunderstanding.

418
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,200
You said you didn't know what happened.

419
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,960
Now you're saying it's a misunderstanding.

420
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,360
Do you know what you're talking about?

421
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,080
A killer came to kill her just now.

422
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,120
If it wasn't me, she would have died.

423
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
I just saw

424
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
Zhou Si'er fighting with a doctor

425
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,240
and then he went outside.

426
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,360
What do you want to know?

427
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,080
Watch the surveillance.

428
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,120
Zhou Si'er, my uncle is a patient.

429
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,720
You're harassing a patient now.

430
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
I'll apply for a ban

431
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
to stop you from getting close to him.

432
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
Aren't you going to investigate that mole?

433
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280
He's at the scene.

434
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you want to investigate?

435
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Do you want to cover up for him?

436
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm following the procedures

437
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,520
and have evidence to do things.

438
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
We don't need you to teach us

439
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,040
how to do things in the ICICI.

440
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,280
Then how do we investigate the case?

441
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
You don't need to teach us.

442
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,960
Gao Si'er.

443
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,920
Morning.

444
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
Are you thinking about your uncle?

445
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,040
I went to the hospital last night.

446
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,200
I saw Zhou Junjie

447
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,920
pulling my uncle's clothes.

448
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
My uncle said he didn't know what happened.

449
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,160
But Zhou Junjie was sure that

450
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,600
there was a killer who wanted to kill him.

451
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,920
If what Zhou Junjie said is true,

452
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,960
are you afraid that your uncle is in danger?

453
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,160
Is it related to the witness case?

454
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,560
My uncle looks calm.

455
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
He even asked Zhou Junjie

456
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,000
to find some colleagues to investigate the case.

457
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,160
But the question is,

458
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,320
why would Zhou Junjie go to the hospital?

459
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
After Zhou Junjie left,

460
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
my uncle kept pushing me away.

461
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
He seemed to be afraid that I would ask him about things.

462
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,720
I know you've never

463
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
invested in these high-risk things.

464
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,560
Why did you buy

465
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,800
this kind of virtual currency

466
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,200
half a year ago?

467
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,600
Are you investigating me?

468
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,400
Just a psychological investigation.

469
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Then promise me

470
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,600
that I can let your aunt know.

471
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,760
I know a friend

472
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
who watched those videos

473
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
and taught others to invest.

474
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,160
He said that buying virtual currency

475
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,040
can make money.

476
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
He also introduced me to that

477
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,600
capital finance shop.

478
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,920
So I planned to make some money

479
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,080
and save it for the retirement.

480
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,320
But it was getting worse.

481
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,000
Then I left when I was a flat-hand.

482
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,200
Fortunately,

483
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
the shop was closed soon.

484
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,840
Otherwise, I would have lost all my money.

485
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,440
That's it?

486
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,320
Yes.

487
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,040
Remember,

488
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,960
don't tell your aunt.

489
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,960
Okay, keep it a secret.

490
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
My uncle used to...

491
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,800
no matter what friends

492
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,040
asked him to buy investment products,

493
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,880
he wouldn't buy them.

494
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Why would he buy them this time?

495
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,360
How about this?

496
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
Check the record

497
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,920
of my uncle's

498
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,680
investment encrypted currency for me.

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,760
When did he buy it?

500
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,640
When did he buy it out?

501
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,280
How is the transaction of each one?

502
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,320
The more detailed, the better.

503
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,920
I'll follow up

504
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,120
on Zhou Junjie.

505
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay, I'll go now.

506
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,320
For you.

507
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
The water boiled

508
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,440
has no taste.

509
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
I won't drink it.

510
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,760
It's not water, okay?

511
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,600
It's soup.

512
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,520
Try it.

513
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,040
How much? I'll pay you.

514
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,680
It's just a little money.

515
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Don't count it with me.

516
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,960
Have you found Xu Sisi?

517
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,840
Xu Sisi again?

518
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,360
Take care of yourself first.

519
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,040
ICICI won't let you off so easily.

520
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
I know.

521
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,120
That's why I have to find Xu Sisi as soon as possible.

522
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,480
This way, I can prove my innocence.

523
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
You just recovered.

524
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,840
Please take a rest.

525
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,800
Don't do anything rash.

526
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm already very reserved

527
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
with my character.

528
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,640
The most likely person

529
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,960
is Wang Zhengxiong.

530
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm not sure

531
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
if it's him.

532
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm not sure.

533
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm not sure.

534
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm not sure.

535
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm not sure.

536
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,040
I'm not sure.

537
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm not sure.

538
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,640
I'm not sure.

539
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
I'm not sure.

540
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Why is it Wang Zhengxiong?

541
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,160
Do you have any evidence?

542
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,360
Last night, someone went to the hospital to kill him.

543
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,880
Think about it.

544
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,800
Such a big battle.

545
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,880
It's suspicious to find someone to kill

546
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,360
a corrupt police officer in the hospital.

547
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,400
And

548
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,920
Wang Zhengxiong

549
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,720
is the uncle of my ICICI

550
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,000
Gao Haoran.

551
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,640
They might be of the same gang.

552
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,040
So

553
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,800
we have to force Wang Zhengxiong

554
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,080
or find that killer.

555
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,560
Then we can find Xu Sisi.

556
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,000
This video was received this morning.

557
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,920
I was not alone before.

558
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,600
In fact,

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,600
it confirmed my ghost.

560
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
What nonsense

561
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,400
can be true?

562
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,560
It's мир Bang Siini.

563
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,040
Why did that keep

564
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,540
Yang Qingxin and

565
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,860
Tang Su quem B conduzir a

566
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,880
솔!

567
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
What's wrong?

568
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,800
Why let J visa

569
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,800
ask Dr. Chi D sound

570
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Tell you

571
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,640
But he's not optimistic.

572
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,640
He wants to risk his life for Yang Qi Ping.

573
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,280
It's up to you whether he can make it or not.

574
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,120
Xu Sisi in the film is about to die.

575
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
He risked his life for Yang Qi.

576
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,040
It's obviously about the grandfather.

577
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,080
What's the purpose?

578
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,400
It's to embarrass us.

579
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
If we can't save him,

580
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
it means we're not doing a good job.

581
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,920
Can you find the source of this video?

582
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
The video was sent to the public relations department

583
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
through the encrypted network positioning.

584
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,840
It needs more time to find the source.

585
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,040
On the day Xu Sisi disappeared,

586
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,480
I sent the PTU

587
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,760
to search within the five kilometers of his disappearance.

588
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,880
But we didn't find him.

589
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,480
So I've transferred other troops

590
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,200
to use all the information to find Xu Sisi.

591
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Good job.

592
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,760
Ouyang, what do you think?

593
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,560
I don't have a clue.

594
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,280
Sam, please continue your investigation.

595
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
After you're done,

596
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
report to everyone.

597
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,560
Yes, sir.

598
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,120
Remember,

599
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Xu Sisi's video must be confidential.

600
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,800
You can't leak it.

601
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,800
Yes, sir.

602
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
We also found

603
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
a suspicious truck

604
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,320
at the gunpoint that day.

605
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
We're looking for someone to follow it.

606
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,640
Yes, sir.

607
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,480
Can you give me the video?

608
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,120
I watched you grow up in the police force.

609
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't I believe you?

610
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,200
But this video is important.

611
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,720
You have to be careful.

612
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,600
I'll send it to you.

613
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,560
Thank you, sir.

614
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,440
I'll be careful.

615
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,320
I'll let you know as soon as I get the news.

616
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,520
Take care.

617
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,840
Ouyang Wei Young,

618
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,620
we want to tell you about

619
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,000
how we's highly interested in...

620
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Xu Sisi and to Xu Xintong

621
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,920
's딱See you.

622
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,580
You guys get to do your job obscured.

623
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,620
You should be careful in this.

624
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,760
No.

625
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,720
I'm not talking about you being a suspicious electrician.

626
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,760
You're the one who has falter.

627
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,840
God damn you!

628
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,960
I'ma mess this thing up.

629
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,120
I'll stop talking to you then.

630
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm sorry daarling.

631
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,480
Stop talking to me.

632
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,960
I don't think I can.

633
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Lin Meixia recently went to the capital of the capital

634
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,360
The owner of the capital of the capital, Donald O

635
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,160
was suspected of fraud before

636
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,240
Many people who invest in his company

637
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
虛擬貨幣

638
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,960
All can't get the capital

639
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Will report the case

640
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,840
On the victim list

641
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
I found Lin Meixia's name

642
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,840
The fraud case of the capital of the capital

643
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,680
It happened in October

644
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,120
And Wang Zhenxiong

645
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,760
It's impossible to leave the factory

646
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,320
in November

647
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,960
What's important is the next day

648
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,680
Lin Meixia went to the case

649
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,760
To withdraw the charge of the capital

650
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,880
Lin Meixia invested in虛擬貨幣

651
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,200
And Wang Zhenxiong was always very cautious

652
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,080
Ask who can persuade him

653
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,600
To invest five million in虛擬貨幣

654
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,760
That person must be the most trusted

655
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,840
The closest person

656
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,000
That person is Lin Meixia

657
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,160
Since they got the money back

658
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,240
Why did Lin Meixia go to the capital?

659
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,680
Wang Zhenxiong is afraid that he will be in trouble

660
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,800
He knows more

661
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,480
ICICI is looking for the mole

662
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,440
He is afraid of finding himself

663
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,280
So he went to cancel the account

664
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,920
Now you take this information

665
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,680
To ask Wang Zhenxiong

666
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,080
I am also very confident

667
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
You may find

668
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,840
Xu Sisi's whereabouts

669
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
Long time no see

670
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,800
Say hello to you

671
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Hello

672
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,240
This is to help your police

673
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,640
To find the evidence of the mole

674
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,840
Recently I think

675
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
There is a mole around us

676
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Well, keep it a secret

677
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,080
Because of the mole

678
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,520
Those police and ICICI

679
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,800
Bite me and don't let go

680
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,520
If you find

681
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,040
What will your family do if they are corrupt?

682
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,520
Report or not report

683
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,520
