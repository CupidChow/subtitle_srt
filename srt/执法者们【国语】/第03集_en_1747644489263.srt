1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Do you remember who taught me what justice is, what is right and wrong?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I understand that you have never disappointed us.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Some things can never be compensated for losing.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All of our brothers are dead.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You still dare not say who is the mastermind.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you still have a conscience?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are in the same position.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who can convince him that he is the most trusted and closest person?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What happened, we can't change.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But what didn't happen, we can still try our best.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Uncle, what do you want to eat after you leave the hospital?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll buy you some food.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Of course, I'll go to the Golden Pavilion to eat the pig's hands.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Your uncle likes it the most.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Eating nothing is useless.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't even walk.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have to sit on the wheelchair for the rest of my life.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You will retire in two years.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm still thinking about getting a retirement fund for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who...

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Qiu Qiu, I don't know why Joseph came to you that night.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know why either.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wu Yuan Wu came to me.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He fought with the doctor as soon as he entered the room.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know that he has been investigating Xu Sisi's whereabouts.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you know anything?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know anything.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I just know that he is a very good person.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He is a very good person.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm just investigating Xu Sisi's whereabouts.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you know anything?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Haoran, what do you mean by saying that?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You suspect your uncle.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He almost lost his life.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, if uncle remembers anything,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
just tell me.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Maybe I can help you.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go. I don't want to stay here.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's go.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,080
anç

76
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,180
Chief of Criminal Department,

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,000
Xu Sisi is in our hands as you can see.

78
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,000
I want just to play a game with you.

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,340
Let's play unless%

80
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,160
event

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But she is not too optimistic

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's up to you.

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,800
After the analysis and analysis of the environment in the video,

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
we infer that Xu Sisi

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,280
is most likely in the warehouse

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,320
or warehouse.

87
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
We marked 20 locations

88
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,600
which are the cargo docks,

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
the construction site and the warehouse.

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Have you found anything?

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
We have found suspicious trucks

92
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,000
at the shooting range.

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
But they have left the shooting range.

94
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
But if we continue to investigate,

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
we find that the license plate number is fake.

96
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
We will look back at the video of the time of the crime.

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
We will look for it later.

98
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
We can't find this truck.

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
After further investigation,

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,680
we can confirm that this truck is a logistics company.

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Please ask the CAB colleagues to investigate it.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Find the logistics warehouse related to this company.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
If you find anything suspicious,

104
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,120
report it immediately.

105
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Yes, sir.

106
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Thank you for your hard work.

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's report the progress.

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,280
Zhou Junjie seems to have found out that we followed him.

109
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,120
So he took us around a few days ago.

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
He ran away later.

111
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,080
As for the high-level information,

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,960
you said that you saw him in Wang Zhengxiong's ward last night.

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,600
We

114
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
checked the surveillance video of the hospital

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
to see if there were any so-called killers.

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Today, Zhou Junjie

117
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,920
asked Lei Xue Sen to meet him at the Guan Tang factory.

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
We also investigated that

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,280
Zhou Junjie has been with Lei Xue Sen for many years.

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Lei Xue Sen has always been optimistic about him.

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Their relationship is like a master and disciple.

122
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
Jenny, what about you?

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
The yellow file is Wang Zhengxiong's

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
business record in Fudu Finance.

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Have you checked the background of Fudu Finance?

126
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,560
The boss behind Fudu Finance is called Danao.

127
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,200
It turns out that he is one of the business partners of Dai Zufu.

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
There has always been a company that has been in the business of Dai Zufu.

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
Qian Feng International.

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,400
Mr. Dai,

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
the two witnesses of your case were killed.

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,800
I suspect you...

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,360
I don't think I will answer

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,080
such a hypothetical question.

135
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,200
I have the most advanced person in there to meet me.

136
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,000
Lei Ze, Lei Ze, sit down.

137
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,440
I am Lei Xue Sen, the deputy chief of the police station.

138
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,040
No matter what level the police station is,

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,880
the procedures of the entrance are the same.

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
I know your procedures.

141
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Relax.

142
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,880
It's been a long time since we last met.

143
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
Let me say hello to you.

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,920
By the way,

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,040
whether it's a high-level or a low-level,

146
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,320
people are so crowded.

147
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Order takeout.

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
Come on, I'll treat you.

149
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Any resident has the right to

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
order water and food.

151
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I think you know it very well.

152
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,480
I think you know it very well.

153
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,480
Thank you.

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,920
You're welcome.

155
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
It's the money of the person who took the water.

156
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,960
The law says that you can't smoke in the city.

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
I'll follow the law.

158
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,720
Let's not open the topic.

159
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
The witness of this case

160
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,200
is either dead or missing.

161
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,200
You are the biggest beneficiary.

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
What's your explanation?

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
I won't answer

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,960
this hypothetical question.

165
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Only you are capable of

166
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
doing such a big thing.

167
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
Who else can it be if it's not you?

168
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Lei Ze,

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,280
today,

170
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
my client and I

171
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,200
are here to help you investigate.

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
You suspect me?

173
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Henry,

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,840
if you have sympathy,

175
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,840
they are almost

176
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,200
a country.

177
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,200
We need to cooperate with the people.

178
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay.

179
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
But I want to remind you

180
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
that I have the right

181
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
to keep silent.

182
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay, you can keep silent.

183
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
But we'll ask them.

184
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,680
Zhao Xie, what did you say?

185
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,960
We'll have enough evidence

186
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
to take you back to court.

187
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
We'll let the judge know

188
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
how much you don't cooperate with us.

189
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,720
We'll let the judge judge you.

190
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,840
Okay, I'll go to my home town.

191
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,000
The court?

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Keep asking.

193
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,200
If he doesn't answer,

194
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
then Zhao Xie won't.

195
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Take your time.

196
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Let him go after you're done.

197
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,880
Yes, sir.

198
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
If you need anything,

199
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
we'll ask you to come back

200
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
and help us.

201
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
Follow the procedure.

202
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
Make a pre-ordered agreement with my secretary.

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,680
Okay.

204
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,880
Boss.

205
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Number,

206
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,220
calling from 7-6-5-6-5-6-O-C.

207
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,600
You've established the九-tsu meeting, officer.

208
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,560
We will wait for you to return to the mission ground.

209
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,580
Thank you.

210
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,920
I really should take things easy.

211
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,680
כ ahead, thank you.

212
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,620
Boss

213
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,940
Boss

214
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,060
Where is Cheng

215
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,720
Be careful

216
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,480
Be careful

217
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,720
Dennis

218
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
You go back first

219
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,880
Uncle

220
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,260
Ok

221
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,260
This way

222
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,340
Boss

223
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Clothes

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
How are you recently?

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
The doctor said that it's useless to take a breath now.

226
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
It's best to change your body as soon as possible.

227
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Okay, everyone is here.

228
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I'll say a few words.

229
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Recently, I feel that we have a mole around us.

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Just because there is a mole,

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I feel that I'm not a good person.

232
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Although I will continue to be in court after a month,

233
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
I will definitely be able to escape this case.

234
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
But before we find the mole,

235
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,480
I want you all to stop doing what you're doing.

236
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't do it anymore.

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Yes.

238
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Cheng,

239
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
I'm sorry.

240
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Cheng,

245
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
use this time to heal your body.

246
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Boss,

247
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,480
but there are still some goods that haven't been sold.

248
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Boss, don't worry.

249
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I've already told Guang to keep an eye on the car team.

250
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,480
If anyone dares to go out of the car without permission, I'll make them.

251
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Forget about these business of chicken feathers and garlic skins.

252
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
It's decided then.

253
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes, boss.

254
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Yes, boss.

255
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I've been doing it for so long.

256
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Anyway, I'll find the mole and get the things I have.

257
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I'll leave.

258
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Before I leave,

259
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
I'll have a bonus.

260
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm sorry for everyone who's helped me for so many years.

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes, yes.

262
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Thank you, boss.

263
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Thank you, boss.

264
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Tell the person you're staring at to keep an eye on me.

265
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Don't let anyone get away.

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
I've arranged it.

267
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
It's okay.

269
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
I know you've tried your best.

270
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Anyway, I promise you.

271
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
If Liu Yifan is still in the law firm for one day,

272
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I won't let Dai Zu Fu go.

273
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
I believe one day,

274
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll punish him.

275
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
As you wish.

276
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
After so many years,

277
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I've been angry.

278
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Even if I catch him in jail now,

279
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I can't make up for it.

280
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
I've been doing it for eight years.

281
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Hurry up.

282
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
It's all your fault.

283
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
You're late now.

284
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
It's your fault.

285
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
You're late for the class.

286
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Today is the first class of this semester.

287
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't have any requirements.

288
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
There's only one thing.

289
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
It's to be on time.

290
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Don't be late.

291
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
It's time for class.

294
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Don't talk.

295
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
No.

296
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
I just finished class.

297
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I have to go.

298
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
I made a mistake.

299
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I forgot to ask aunt to come to see you.

300
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Stay with me for a while.

301
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
It's fast.

302
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Just two hours.

303
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
No.

304
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Hurry up.

305
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Don't be so loud.

306
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Little girl.

307
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Stay with dad for a while.

308
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
After class,

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I'll treat you to a snow cake.

310
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Can you treat dad too?

311
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Because he doesn't have mom to accompany him.

312
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Poor thing.

313
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
You don't have to mind him.

316
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm sorry.

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
It's okay.

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Do you want to play a game?

319
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
How about we play a game now?

320
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Only the teacher can talk.

321
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
We can't talk.

322
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
If the teacher knows who's talking,

323
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
even if you lose,

324
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
you have to pay the school fee.

325
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,480
The winner can have three wishes.

326
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Sister.

327
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm seven years old.

328
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't believe it.

329
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
You'd better lie to other kids.

330
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
You can't talk like this.

331
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Sorry.

332
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
It's okay.

333
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
How about this?

334
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Let's ask brother to play together.

335
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
He'll be fair.

336
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Thank you.

337
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm sorry.

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Don't talk.

339
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Let's start.

340
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
This is a camera.

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
It's very expensive.

342
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Who gave it to you?

343
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I gave it to you.

344
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
She's a little girl.

345
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
How could she know how to take pictures?

346
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
She doesn't know how to take pictures.

347
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
She doesn't know how to take pictures.

348
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I know how to take pictures.

349
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Come on.

350
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Let's take a picture of your family.

351
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Three?

352
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Three.

353
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Come on.

354
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Come on.

355
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Hurry up.

356
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Sit closer.

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Yes.

358
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
One, two, three.

359
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Some things are lost.

360
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I can't make up for it forever.

361
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Anyway, you can leave the matter of Dai Zufu to me.

362
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Don't think too much.

363
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Let's think about where you want to go after you go out.

364
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
We'll call Annie.

365
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
The three of us will go out and have a good time.

366
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I have nothing to do.

367
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I have nowhere to go.

368
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
I just want to live quietly.

369
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm sorry.

370
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm late.

371
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
It doesn't matter.

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Thank you.

373
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
According to the screenshot you gave me,

374
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I found all the companies that import this oxygen bottle.

375
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
That's it.

376
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Thank you.

377
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,480
I didn't expect you to remember that I checked the import case of this oxygen bottle.

378
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I didn't forget many things.

379
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Hot latte, milk, and milk.

380
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Thank you.

381
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
I'm leaving.

382
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Be careful.

383
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Follow Zhou San first.

384
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I'll go ask some things.

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Okay.

386
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Miss He.

387
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
I've said what I wanted to say last time.

388
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
There's nothing I can help you with.

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Don't follow me anymore.

390
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm sorry.

391
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm just following you.

392
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm sorry.

393
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm sorry.

394
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I just want to know what you gave Zhou San.

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
If you have something to ask me, don't disturb my wife.

396
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Gao San, he...

397
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Get in the car first.

398
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
We are all law enforcement officers.

399
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
You know my position very well.

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Of course, if you cooperate and provide the information yourself,

401
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I'll be much more relaxed.

402
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm not not cooperating.

403
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
You've been with me for so many days.

404
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I haven't stopped you.

405
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I came to find my wife because I found some clues.

406
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I came to investigate Xu Si Si's whereabouts.

407
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
So my wife provided me some information.

408
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Are you interested?

409
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
As long as you say you are innocent,

410
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I don't need to investigate you.

411
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm not afraid of you investigating me.

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I just don't want you to disturb my family.

413
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Also, you're wasting your time on me.

414
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
It's better to investigate other people.

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
What did you find?

416
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
I remember that on the day of the operation,

417
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Xiong, your uncle,

418
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
had a killer standing next to him.

419
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
But you must say that I'm talking nonsense.

420
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
But he's your uncle.

421
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
You can ask him yourself.

422
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Excuse me.

423
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
You're so lucky.

424
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Let's go.

425
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Uncle, I bought this new one.

426
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
It's for you.

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
It's a problem to waste this kind of money.

428
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
I use this one well.

429
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
This one is all automatic.

430
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
It's much better.

431
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Try it.

432
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Hey, dinner is ready.

433
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
You're a god of the cart now.

434
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Come on.

435
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
No, no, no. I'll try it myself.

436
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I'll wash my hands first.

437
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Be careful, honey.

438
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
The god of the cart is coming.

439
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Can you do it?

440
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Wow, so fast.

441
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
How is it? Are you used to it?

442
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
It's very convenient.

443
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Really?

444
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Yes.

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
It's good to have it.

446
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Great.

447
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Let's eat.

448
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Come on, let's eat.

449
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Do you like to eat the dishes cooked by your aunt?

450
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Come on, eat more.

451
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Thank you, uncle.

452
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
You eat more.

453
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Thank you.

454
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
By the way, when will you be discharged?

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll send you back.

456
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
No need.

457
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
You bought a car for me.

458
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I can drive it myself.

459
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
What if you have to go up and down the stairs?

460
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
What should I do?

461
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
There's an elevator, honey.

462
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
It's delicious.

463
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Is it delicious?

464
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Do you remember the day ICAC was hired?

465
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
When you came for the interview,

466
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I seemed to ask you a question.

467
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,480
If you find out what your family does when they are corrupt,

468
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
will you report it or not?

469
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
I remember you answered that

470
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,480
your parents left early, so there won't be this problem.

471
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
I remember your answer is to take the credit.

472
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
You must catch him by yourself.

473
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
If I ask you again now,

474
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
is it the same answer?

475
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
You don't have to carry everything yourself.

476
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
It's true.

477
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
If something can't be done,

478
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
you can ask someone to help you.

479
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Although we found the transfer record

480
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
of Zhou Junjie and Rong Qing Finance Company,

481
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
we can't prove that

482
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
he borrowed the money or Xiao Qiang did.

483
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
We don't have enough evidence to suspect him.

484
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
In terms of behavior,

485
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Wang Zhenxiong is more suspicious.

486
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I remember when I took him out of the hospital,

487
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
I tried him.

488
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
He reacted a lot.

489
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
He questioned me why I suspected him.

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
And the capital and finance,

491
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
many hard workers can't get the money back.

492
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Only Wang Zhenxiong can get it back.

493
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
This is indeed suspicious.

494
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
What's wrong? Do you want to work?

495
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
No. Let's eat.

496
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Eat more. Don't leave anything.

497
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Eat the meal first.

498
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
It's really delicious.

499
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Not bad.

500
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Is it delicious?

501
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Last time, you didn't finish it

502
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
and left a lot.

503
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Great.

504
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
When can I teach you to fight?

505
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
I want to. I want to.

506
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
They both can.

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Don't waste it.

508
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Give me this.

509
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Let's go.

510
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I don't have much time.

511
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Just say it.

512
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
No time?

513
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
That old man wants me to stop.

514
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
He just doesn't have food to eat.

515
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
He wants us to drink Northwest wind.

516
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
How about this?

517
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
We cooperate together.

518
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
I'll do the drugs.

519
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
You'll do the car team.

520
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
That old man will leave sooner or later.

521
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Then we'll decide.

522
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Mr. Dai said no.

523
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
You always know Mr. Dai's temper.

524
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
If he knows,

525
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
you'll be dead.

526
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Mr. Dai is first.

527
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Mr. Dai is second.

528
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I'm in charge of the car team.

529
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
You didn't do anything and took it away.

530
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
You gave him your ass.

531
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
A'Guo.

532
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
You take the car team.

533
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
You're in charge.

534
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Follow me.

535
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
You'll earn more than him.

536
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I won't do it with you.

537
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
You're a coward.

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
You talk to me like this.

539
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Stop.

540
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Get off.

541
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Why?

542
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I said stop for a while.

543
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Who's the man who stole the car?

544
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Who's the man?

545
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Mr. Yin.

546
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Mr. Yin.

547
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
You're scaring me.

548
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
It's really Mr. Yin.

549
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Mr. Yin.

550
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Mr. Yin.

551
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Mr. Yin.

552
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Mr. Yin.

553
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Mr. Yin.

554
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Mr. Yin.

555
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Mr. Yin.

556
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Mr. Yin.

557
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Mr. Yin.

558
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
It's really your boss.

559
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Get in the car.

560
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Get in the car.

561
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Drive.

562
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
How's it going?

563
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Is the bastard here?

564
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Where did he go?

565
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
He's always late.

566
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I'll be there in a minute.

567
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Very soon.

568
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Is your turn in the diving turn?

569
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Do you have any responsibility?

570
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
If I have a responsibility,

571
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I won't be a scoundrel.

572
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
What's going on over there?

573
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
I don't care.

574
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll go in first.

575
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Can't Lv Zheng Si get out of jail?

576
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
They said there was not enough evidence to arrest him.

577
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
If they leave Hong Kong,

578
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
there will be no chance in the future.

579
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
But we only found Lin Meixia

580
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
and the relationship of the capital.

581
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
There is no direct evidence to show

582
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
that Wang Zhen Xiong has helped the killer

583
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
to kidnap Xu Sisi.

584
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
At most,

585
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
he can only stay for 48 hours.

586
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Slow down.

587
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
He's out.

588
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
How's it going?

589
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Is there any evidence?

590
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I really want to know.

591
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I won't come here.

592
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
If you find it,

593
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
I won't come.

594
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
I'll sleep a little longer.

595
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Go to sleep.

596
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Sleep.

597
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm going to sleep.

598
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Sleep.

599
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Hello, Liu Er.

600
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Come here. I'll talk to you.

601
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Get in the car of A Bi.

602
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
What about you?

603
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I want to talk to my uncle in person.

604
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
You guys do the support.

605
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
If there's anything, contact me.

606
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
I'll take care of it.

607
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Where are you going?

608
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Take my car.

609
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
What?

610
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
They told you to send the goods to this warehouse.

611
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Yes, Brother Guan.

612
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm just following orders.

613
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Following orders?

614
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Whose orders are you following now?

615
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
The car is here.

616
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Go on a trip.

617
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Where?

618
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
We go to Canada to see relatives.

619
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
I haven't heard you say

620
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
that relatives are in Canada.

621
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
How long will it take?

622
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
About two weeks.

623
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
How is it?

624
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Did you buy the return ticket?

625
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Should I buy it for you?

626
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
I plan to live there for a lifetime.

627
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Do you really think that if you go there,

628
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
those people won't be able to find you?

629
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Don't be like your uncle.

630
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
He's been there every day.

631
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm not going to go there.

632
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm going to go to Canada.

633
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Canada?

634
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
To be honest,

635
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
it's the same as going there to jail.

636
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Uncle, auntie,

637
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
once you go there, you won't be able to come back.

638
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
You won't be able to be a person for the rest of your life.

639
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
The rich and the poor are being framed.

640
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
They're cheating people to invest in virtual currency.

641
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
They're crying for the wrong people.

642
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
No one can get back the money.

643
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Only auntie can.

644
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Uncle,

645
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
do you remember

646
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
who taught me

647
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
what justice is,

648
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
what black and white is,

649
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
and you?

650
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Why is English so hard to learn in elementary school?

651
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
It's very simple.

652
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm most worried about the composition.

653
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
What composition?

654
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
The topic is, my idol.

655
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
It's so hard.

656
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
How hard?

657
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
You have a lot of people to write about.

658
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I don't have an idol.

659
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
No one deserves my appreciation.

660
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Forget it. Don't give me homework.

661
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
You're so old-fashioned.

662
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Boss, 20 yuan of lean meat.

663
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Okay.

664
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
I'm sorry, Li San.

665
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
This is just a small business.

666
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I don't have that much goods for you.

667
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm not greedy.

668
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I'll definitely leave some for you to do business.

669
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Do business.

670
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Do business.

671
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Thank you.

672
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Do your best.

673
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Being a police officer

674
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
doesn't make you take advantage of it.

675
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Who are you?

676
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Where's Xiao Jingyuan?

677
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Which police officer are you looking for?

678
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Hong Kong Police Department.

679
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
You're from Fesha?

680
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Do you know how close I am to you?

681
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Do you believe I'll call you and kill you?

682
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Okay.

683
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll go to ICC, too.

684
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm a police officer. It doesn't matter.

685
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Wang Zhenxiong, right?

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Is it enough?

687
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Yes.

688
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Give it to me.

689
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Please.

690
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
The difference between police and ordinary citizens

691
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
is the best of law enforcement and crime.

692
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
This is also what your uncle taught me.

693
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
This time, are you looking for me

694
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
as ICC

695
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
or as my nephew?

696
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
At this moment,

697
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I must be your nephew.

698
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
I hope my nephew

699
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
will turn himself in

700
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
and watch your uncle do something right.

701
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Uncle,

702
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
after I went to ICC,

703
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
I'm the senior investigator, Gao Haoran.

704
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I understand.

705
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
You never let us down.

706
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
You didn't do anything wrong.

707
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
It's my fault.

708
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm Gao Haoran,

709
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
the senior investigator of ICC.

710
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Wang Zhenxiong, police officer.

711
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
You're suspected of violating

712
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
the law enforcement's duty.

713
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I don't have to tell you,

714
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
but what you said

715
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
will be recorded

716
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
and become a public statement.

717
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Xiong,

718
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
don't go to the east.

719
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Go to the north.

720
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
But...

721
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Command center,

722
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
the C-team decided to go north.

723
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Did you admit that

724
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
you leaked the safe route

725
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
of transporting the witness

726
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
after the meeting

727
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
and led to Xu Sisi's disappearance?

728
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Yes.

729
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I used my wife's account

730
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
to buy 5 million

731
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
in the capital's finance

732
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
to make you live.

733
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
I had won more than a million,

734
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
but because I was greedy,

735
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
I spent 3 million in the capital

736
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
and planned to borrow more,

737
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
get more,

738
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
and win more.

739
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
After reading your account records,

740
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
the owner of the capital's finance

741
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
will return you 5 million

742
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
without you paying,

743
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
right?

744
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Yes.

745
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
The money that night

746
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
fell from 5 yuan to a few cents,

747
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
and it all exploded in an instant.

748
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I lost everything

749
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
in my loan.

750
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
What did he ask you to do

751
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
to give you that 5 million?

752
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
He knew that I was a police officer

753
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
and was involved in this operation

754
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
to protect the witness from the court

755
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
to testify for the grand father.

756
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Daniel

757
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
asked me to send a tracker

758
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
to the witness

759
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
to make the police's action

760
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
shine.

761
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
But I didn't expect

762
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
they would shoot and kill people.

763
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
I killed so many colleagues.

764
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Mr. Lei.

765
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
We just received a report.

766
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
There is a warehouse

767
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
in the basement of Yuan Langping.

768
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
If there is any doubt,

769
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
send the Flying Tiger Team to the scene immediately.

770
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Yes, sir.

771
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Fortunately, I'm late.

772
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Otherwise, who would have saved you?

773
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Yes.

774
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Thank you.

775
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Of course.

776
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Let's go.

777
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
What?

778
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Xu Sisi's location is here.

779
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
See if there is any surveillance camera.

780
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
What?

781
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Isn't there a surveillance camera in the store?

782
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Leave this kind of rough goods to me.

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Just pay the cash.

784
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Okay.

785
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Don't worry. I'll give it to you.

786
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Now,

787
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
you guys are hiding from me

788
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
and go out to catch the money.

789
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Do you know that Mr. Dai

790
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
gave an order

791
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
to stop the construction of the whole world?

792
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
You are my subordinate.

793
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
How dare you drive my car

794
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
and deliver goods everywhere?

795
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
If Mr. Dai knows about this,

796
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
we will be dead.

797
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Or do you want to

798
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
send me to the place where I'm dead?

799
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
That's not what we mean, Guangge.

800
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
We have no reason

801
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
to disobey the order from Mr. Yin.

802
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
You know that.

803
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Mr. Yin.

804
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
How many goods have been delivered

805
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
so far?

806
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
One cabinet.

807
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
One cabinet?

808
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
There are two cabinets missing from the order.

809
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Where did they go?

810
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
I only know that

811
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
the goods we delivered

812
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
were killed by the cabinet.

813
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
We really don't know

814
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
the rest.

815
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You don't know?

816
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Do you know?

817
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
I don't know, Guangge.

818
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
You don't know?

819
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Then investigate it.

820
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
I only know

821
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
where the cabinet is.

822
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
I also know

823
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
what goods are inside.

824
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Besides you guys,

825
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
who else is involved?

826
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
I don't want to set up a troupe.

827
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
There are cabinet members inside.

828
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Get out.

829
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I know, Guangge.

830
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Give us some time.

831
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
How did he contact you?

832
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Is it

833
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
through this phone?

834
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Yes.

835
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
I contacted him through this phone.

836
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Then how did he

837
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
give you the tracker?

838
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
He told me that

839
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
he put a tracker

840
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,480
in the cabinet of the police station's changing room.

841
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
He wanted to take it.

842
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
There is a rule in their capital.

843
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
No matter if it's business or contact,

844
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
they have to use this phone.

845
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
But now I can't get into

846
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
their house.

847
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
I have to go.

848
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
I have to go.

849
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
The whole thing

850
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
is all up to you.

851
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Do you have any other help?

852
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I don't know.

853
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Since you have helped them,

854
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
why do they still

855
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
shoot you?

856
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Are you crazy?

857
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
You told me to kill someone.

858
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
I didn't say we were going to kill someone.

859
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
They are all my brothers.

860
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
It's too late

861
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
for you to wake up now.

862
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Isn't it, A-Zi?

863
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I will leave her to you.

864
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
We won't be able to trust each other in the future.

865
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Only dead people can keep secrets.

866
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,080
I really thought they just wanted to save Xu Sisi.

867
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,280
I never thought it would turn out like this.

868
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,480
Alpha team in position. Bravo team in position.

869
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
There are only two exits in the warehouse.

870
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,080
Team A and Team B, attack from the front and back.

871
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,680
All units, action.

872
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
Move.

873
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,280
Don't move.

874
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Don't worry. Run.

875
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,280
Don't move.

876
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Sir, we can't find Xu Sisi.

877
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,080
Get them all back.

878
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,480
Collect all the evidence. Don't miss a thing.

879
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
Ask them if anyone knows where Xu Sisi is now.

880
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
One man and one woman were injured in the warehouse.

881
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,080
The man is seriously injured and unconscious. He needs a ambulance immediately.

882
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,680
Sir, can you spare your life and let us record it?

883
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Be careful.

884
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,280
What?

885
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,680
Be careful of the mole.

886
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,480
defendant, I want to remind you once.

887
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,480
This very serious charge, are you sure?

888
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,080
If you want to save him, you shouldn't hide it.

889
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,680
Did you guarantee that I would say it?

890
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,080
He will be fine.

891
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Remember, you are a police.

892
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
You need to know what you can do and what you can't.

893
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,880
I believe he won't lie in front of me.

894
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,080
Something must have happened before he went to the court.

895
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,680
Is there any remorse?

896
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:50,080
The season without you by my side is more obvious.

897
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:03,480
The falling leaves are also tired.

898
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:14,280
I'm tired of chasing, chasing a perfect world.

899
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,080
Who can take me away?

900
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,880
Who is at the far end?

901
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,280
Who will fight with me for the world?

902
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:33,480
Oh, is there anyone to guard for me?

903
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,280
I don't need too many reasons.

904
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,680
In the dark, the fireworks lit up.

905
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,680
I won't back down.

906
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,480
I will smile if you are by my side.

907
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,680
Until the end.

908
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,680
Is there any remorse?

909
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:14,680
The season without you by my side is more obvious.

910
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:24,880
The falling leaves are also tired.

911
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm tired of chasing, chasing a perfect world.

912
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,880
Who can take me away?

913
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,680
Who is at the far end?

914
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,080
Who will fight with me for the world?

915
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:56,280
Oh, is there anyone to guard for me?

916
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,080
I don't need too many reasons.

917
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,480
In the dark, the fireworks lit up.

918
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,680
I won't back down.

919
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I will smile if you are by my side.

920
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Until the end.

921
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Oh, is there anyone to guard for me?

922
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I don't need too many reasons.

923
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
In the dark, the fireworks lit up.

924
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I won't back down.

925
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,680
I will smile if you are by my side.

926
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Until the end.

927
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Is there anyone to guard for me?

928
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
I don't need too many reasons.

929
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,680
Is there anyone to guard for me?

930
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I don't need too many reasons.

931
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,680
In the dark, the fireworks lit up.

932
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I won't back down.

933
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:10,680
I will smile if you are by my side.

934
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Until the end.

935
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Until the end.

936
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,680
