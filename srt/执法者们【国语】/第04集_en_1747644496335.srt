1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
I thought about committing suicide.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,800
I thought about jumping off the roof of the financial building.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,000
The defendant is the chairman of Qian Feng International Group.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,000
From 2003 to 2023,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,400
he used company funds to make multiple steps of transactions.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Only you have the ability to make such a big mistake.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Who else can it be if it's not you?

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,000
But you'd better not forget that

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,800
it's the money of the public to sue the wrong person.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
I fell down here.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
In addition to standing up here,

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,600
I also want to take Hong Kong to the international track.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
You can bear the consequences as you wish.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
He...

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This time, I helped you,

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
then now, we are each of our own.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
So it's really easy for us to be found out.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
You come, I help, I come and help you.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Come on, let's work together.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
A-Se,

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
after you become a police officer,

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
you'll be rich.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
My business will be better.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Come on, let's work together.

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Who will guard for me?

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't need too many reasons.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
In the dark, the fireflies light up.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I won't back down.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I'll be small if you're by my side.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Until the end.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Episode 15

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
A-Se, I found it.

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
You found Xu Sisi?

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I found the clue to Xu Sisi's location.

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
The flow chamber?

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
No wonder I couldn't find it before.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Didn't you say you saw some medical papers?

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
If nothing happened,

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
this should be the place where Xu Sisi is locked.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
The day of taking the goods away

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,800
is the same as the day of Xu Sisi's short film.

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
They're so smart.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Are you the one who did it?

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I don't think I know their reaction.

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Who are those people?

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I remember the leader's name is Guangge.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
He was a car driver.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
He was famous for his underground logistics.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
He used fake cars to transport goods.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
He's been dead for so long,

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
but he's hardly ever been caught.

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Many gangs

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
are looking for them to transport goods.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
No one dares to mess with their logistics.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll go find someone to help.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll check the whereabouts of the goods.

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Be careful.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
What?

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Be careful of the mole.

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
No one in this world can trust you.

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
No one in this world can trust you.

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
There must be a mole in Xu Sisi's case.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm not careful.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
You should be careful, too.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
How did you get the clue?

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Is it reliable?

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Absolutely.

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I gave him my life.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
You should remember that you're a cop.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You should know what you can do and what you can't.

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I know.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
But I hope you can help.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I have clues to find Xu Sisi's location.

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I'll notify you as soon as I find her location.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
So I want you to call the intelligence department.

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
We'll help you at any time.

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Okay, I'll help you.

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
But you have to remember

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
that you're suspended now.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
If anything happens,

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
you have to take it on yourself.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
No one can help you.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm ready to take this on myself.

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I've killed so many brothers.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I have to give them an explanation.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
We helped Wang Zhenxiong to make a confession.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
He admitted that he leaked the police's secrets for money.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
It led to the death of the witness, Xu Sisi.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Please, Duncan.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Don't be like this.

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
We've handed over the information to the law firm.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
They're applying for Wang Zhenxiong's death date.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
We plan to do it in a low profile this time.

94
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll wait until the court is over

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
before I make a statement

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
and announce the results of this operation.

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Because the police have a mole,

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
it will lead to the failure of protecting the witness.

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay, if you don't want to do it,

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm afraid they'll be dissatisfied if the police find out too early.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll inform the chief of the security bureau

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
and the chief of police department

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
as soon as the court has the result.

104
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Sir, this phone belongs to Wang Zhenxiong.

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll send it to the computer data witness group

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
to repair it.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
See if there's any clue in it.

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,800
And I think there's more than one mole in this case.

109
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Do you think there's anyone helping Wang Zhenxiong?

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
He has a accomplice.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Wang Zhenxiong mentioned that

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
someone put the tracker in his cabinet.

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
It's obvious that this person must be from the police.

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
You suspect Zhou Junjie?

115
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Zhou Junjie is suspicious.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
But he's not the only suspect.

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
The police officers who participated in the operation

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
all had the chance to be mole.

119
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I suggest that when Wang Zhenxiong goes to court,

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
he should also report Zhou Junjie

121
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
and let Raymond test him.

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Raymond has been following the case of the black money laundering of Grandfather Dai.

123
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm very confident in him.

124
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Okay, I'll inform the law firm then.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I hope they can cooperate.

126
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Arrange Raymond Liu to be the mastermind.

127
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Thank you, Tim.

128
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
It's really hard for you.

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh, right.

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Have you ever thought about

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
giving yourself a break after handling this case?

132
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
You haven't had a holiday for a long time.

133
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
No, sir. I'm fine. Thank you.

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay.

135
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Jiao Ma'er, the soup.

136
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Uncle,

137
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
one bowl per person.

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
We'll share it.

139
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Huaxi ginseng and ten-pot pork pork.

140
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Your aunt said you often stay up late.

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I brought it to cool you down.

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It smells so good.

143
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
She said that

144
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
half of it will be enough.

145
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
The other half will be kept for tomorrow.

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
We'll drink it after it's hot.

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
We'll share it.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
In other words,

149
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm not the only one who's worried about you.

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm worried about you.

151
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
By the way,

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
you haven't come back for dinner for a long time.

153
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Yes.

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Wait until I catch Dai Zuofu

155
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
and we'll have dinner together.

156
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
You don't need a spoon

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
when drinking soup like uncle.

158
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
It's manly enough.

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Come on, let's drink together.

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
It's not hot.

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
The Lvzhengsi just came back.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Your uncle will go to court tomorrow.

163
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Liu Yuwen will be in charge.

164
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Green and red radish is good for the mouth.

165
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
The soup cooked by my aunt

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
is as good as the soup.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Where did you buy it?

168
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
It's in Rongji.

169
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
How much is it?

170
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's just a few yuan.

171
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
It's not expensive.

172
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not expensive.

173
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
It's just a few yuan.

174
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
It's not expensive.

175
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
It's just a few yuan.

176
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
It's just a few yuan.

177
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Then...

178
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Your uncle should be in court soon.

179
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll go and prepare it.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Mr. Liu,

181
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Wang Zhengxiong said he would confess.

182
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
How about letting me read the summary this time?

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
No need.

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I can read it myself.

185
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Wang Zhengxiong,

186
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
now you are accused of

187
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
being a public official,

188
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
accepting benefits,

189
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
and breaking the fourth chapter of the EBRA

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
of the Anti-corruption Act,

191
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
and the illegal illegal legal justice.

192
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Do you admit your crime?

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I admit my crime.

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Before the incident,

195
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
you were suspected of collecting the bribe.

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Then you collaborated with other

197
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
unknown people that day

198
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and were arrested in the city

199
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
for the crime.

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
You were arrested for the crime.

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
You were arrested for the crime.

202
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
We collaborated

203
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
and took the tracking device with us

204
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
during the transport of witness Xu Sisi

205
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
to leak the police's safety route.

206
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
The police were attacked by many

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
murderers and fire.

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
12 police officers were killed

209
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
and 2 police officers were injured.

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
The witness Xu Sisi,

211
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
who was missing

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
in the case of Dai Zufu's black money,

213
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
was not able to testify.

214
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Do you agree with the case?

215
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Wang Zhenxiong,

216
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
do you agree or not?

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I don't agree.

218
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
No one instructed me that day.

219
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I did everything myself.

220
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Wen.

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
How are you doing?

222
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
How are you doing?

223
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm fine.

224
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm fine.

225
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm fine.

226
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
How are you doing?

227
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
How are you doing?

228
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Business is good, right?

229
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I know I owe you money.

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I'll pay you back later.

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Mr. Ding,

232
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
what are you going to do this time?

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I lost 100,000 yuan last time.

234
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Let's not talk about this.

235
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
There is a way out this time.

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I have to collect the money,

237
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
but I haven't found anyone yet.

238
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I only know that

239
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
he drives a freight car

240
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
and is still looking around here.

241
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
The people who drive here

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
will definitely look for you.

243
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Help me.

244
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I know you.

245
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Look carefully.

246
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
If you receive this bill,

247
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
it will definitely be beneficial.

248
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
What's your name?

249
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Mingzai.

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
This brother is called Ming.

251
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
He also drives this car.

252
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Where is he?

253
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You want to find him?

254
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It's the stock market.

255
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Go and have a look.

256
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
OK.

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Food and drink are all on me.

258
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I also remember to pay back the money.

259
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I know.

260
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Judge,

261
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
because of this,

262
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
I need to

263
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
take instructions from the defendant again.

264
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
But according to what the defendant said now,

265
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
it seems that

266
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
we need to

267
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
conduct a trial.

268
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
The case will affect the sentence

269
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
and need to be dealt with.

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Before the trial,

271
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I want to know

272
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
the content of the defendant's argument.

273
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I want to know

274
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
the content of the defendant's argument.

275
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I want to know

276
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
the content of the defendant's argument.

277
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I admit that

278
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
when I was transporting the witness,

279
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Xu Sisi,

280
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I did have a tracking device.

281
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
I did have a tracking device.

282
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
But he didn't agree

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
that he had to cooperate with anyone.

284
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Defendant,

285
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
when you surrendered to ICIC that day,

286
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
you made a statement.

287
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Daniel

288
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
asked me to put a tracking device

289
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
on the witness's head

290
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
to make the police's action shine.

291
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
But I didn't expect

292
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
they would shoot and kill.

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I didn't expect

294
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
they would shoot and kill.

295
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I killed so many colleagues.

296
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
How did he

297
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
give you the tracking device?

298
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
He told me

299
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
that he put a tracking device

300
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
in the locker room of the police station.

301
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
May I ask

302
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
who gave you this tracking device?

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I bought this tracking device myself.

304
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I may have remembered

305
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
the day of the testimony.

306
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Wang Zhenshiong,

307
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
please think clearly before you answer.

308
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Who are you protecting?

309
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Defendant,

310
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
the person who saved the witness

311
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and the testimony

312
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
is the one who is responsible for the testimony.

313
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm here to testify

314
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
that the witness

315
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
was not aware of the testimony

316
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
and made a statement.

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I have a doctor here

318
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
who can prove

319
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
that when he received the testimony,

320
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
he had a fever of 39.4 degrees.

321
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
He received the testimony

322
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
when he was unconscious.

323
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
If the defendant

324
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
is in a bad state,

325
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
he won't turn himself in

326
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
and spent three hours

327
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
to make the statement.

328
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Now the控 is strongly suspicious.

329
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
The defendant suddenly changed his statement.

330
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
He was forced to use it.

331
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
No one forced me to use it.

332
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I did everything

333
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
to make the statement.

334
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Defendant,

335
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
I want to stop the trial

336
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
and let my client calm down.

337
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
The trial is fifteen minutes now.

338
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Where is my wife?

339
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
What do you want?

340
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Do you want to let your wife go

341
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
or you?

342
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm Gao Haoran,

343
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
the owner of the IJC.

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I want to see Wang Zhenxiong.

345
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Xiao Xiao.

346
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Just tell me what you want.

347
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Don't be afraid.

348
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I'll help you.

349
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Xiao Xiao.

350
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Xiao Xiao.

351
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Xiao Xiao.

352
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Haoran,

353
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
help me take care of your aunt.

354
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I don't want to see anyone now.

355
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Mr. Judge,

356
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I was prepared.

357
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
You can continue the trial.

358
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Defendant,

359
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
you mean

360
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
you contacted those criminals

361
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
on your own

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
in the whole case

363
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
and then you arranged them

364
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
to attack Xu Sisi.

365
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
No.

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Someone helped me in the whole thing.

367
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
But you said just now

368
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
no one cooperated with you.

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
What are you talking about?

370
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I changed my statement just now

371
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
because the person who instructed me

372
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
was in court.

373
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Can you point it out?

374
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
It's him,

375
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Zhou Junjie.

376
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
You mean

377
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
the person who planned to seize the hostage

378
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
is Zhou Junjie, the senior inspector of the criminal group?

379
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Yes.

380
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Beigao,

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I want to remind you once.

382
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
This very serious charge,

383
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
are you sure?

384
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Yes.

385
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
He gave me the tracker.

386
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I saw him in court just now.

387
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I was afraid he would kill someone

388
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
so I changed my statement.

389
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Are you not going to tell the truth

390
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
even if you die?

391
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
All of us are dead.

392
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You still dare not say who is the mastermind.

393
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Do you still have a conscience?

394
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Because he went to the hospital before

395
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
to kill me.

396
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
But now,

397
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I know there is no way to turn back.

398
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I killed so many colleagues.

399
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I'm sorry to them.

400
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You'd better not talk nonsense.

401
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I know your nephew is the successor of SAC.

402
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Don't talk nonsense.

403
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
You dare to sue him.

404
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll give you one hundred and two hundred.

405
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Uncle, don't.

406
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Haoran, come in.

407
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I promised your mother

408
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
that I would take good care of you.

409
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
From now on, this is your home.

410
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
We are family.

411
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Yes, we are family.

412
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Come in.

413
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Come.

414
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Haoran, you're so good.

415
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
You've cleaned it up for me.

416
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Come, try this soup.

417
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
It's so good.

418
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
It's so good.

419
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
It's so good.

420
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It's so good.

421
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Come, try this soup.

422
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Tomato and potato soup.

423
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
See if it's good.

424
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Haoran looks like this.

425
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm really heartbroken.

426
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
His parents just passed away.

427
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Give him some time to get used to it.

428
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I hope he can get used to it as soon as possible.

429
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Haoran.

430
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Tim.

431
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I decided to leave this case to Jenny to follow up.

432
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
You don't have to be responsible.

433
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Don't worry, Gao Si'er.

434
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I will try my best to find out the truth.

435
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I'll let you know as soon as I have news.

436
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I can.

437
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
I can keep up with her.

438
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
You're not ready at all.

439
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
How can you ask questions calmly?

440
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Why don't you go home and rest first?

441
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Leave it to us.

442
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
How do you want me to rest?

443
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Will my uncle come back?

444
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Will my uncle come back?

445
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Si'er.

446
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I promise you.

447
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I will calm down.

448
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I must find out the truth.

449
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
This is the only thing I can do.

450
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
OK.

451
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I will watch you in the surveillance room.

452
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
If you can't control yourself,

453
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I will transfer you immediately.

454
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you understand?

455
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Thank you, sir.

456
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I will go to the police station.

457
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I will go to the police station.

458
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I will go to the police station.

459
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I will go to the police station.

460
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I will go to the police station.

461
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I will go to the police station.

462
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
I will go to the police station.

463
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I will go to the police station.

464
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I will go to the police station.

465
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I will go to the police station.

466
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I will go to the police station.

467
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I will go to the police station.

468
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I will go to the police station.

469
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I will go to the police station.

470
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I will go to the police station.

471
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I will go to the police station.

472
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I will go to the police station.

473
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I will go to the police station.

474
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I will go to the police station.

475
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I will go to the police station.

476
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I will go to the police station.

477
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I will go to the police station.

478
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I think Xu Shan's body is still in the trunk.

479
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I really think Xu Shan's body is still in the trunk.

480
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
There is no proof that it is at the trunk.

481
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Because there are no tough pieces that can only be cracked out!

482
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Are there anything other thanonya..

483
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Nothing.

484
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
We are all responsible for this.

485
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
We are not responsible for such a big crime.

486
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
You gave me the answer.

487
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,860
Yeiran

488
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
This case

489
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,600
You gave me the answer Umm wrong, blackdone.

490
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
It's real dark.

491
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,560
Yeiran

492
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,780
Wait, I have a question

493
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
Yes.

494
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,820
Are you talking to an ending date for me to say what happened is the end of the day?

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Yes

496
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
No, I didn't.

497
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm not going to Ice World.

498
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Okay?

499
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
to save Xu Sisi.

500
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
This is the only chance to catch Dai Zu Fu

501
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,920
and prove my innocence.

502
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,800
You've been in ICICI for many years.

503
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,080
Do you want to catch Dai Zu Fu?

504
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
Don't you plan to let him go?

505
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,240
Your uncle changed his statement in the court.

506
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Obviously, someone forced him.

507
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
You wasted so much time.

508
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,240
Not only your uncle died,

509
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,480
but more people will die.

510
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
If I were a mole,

511
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,960
I would have let go of these things.

512
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,240
Do I need your uncle?

513
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
Why should I go to court to testify?

514
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
According to the record,

515
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
before you went to court,

516
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,200
you asked Wang Zheng Xiong.

517
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
What did you tell him?

518
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,200
As his lawyer,

519
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
I signed the confidentiality agreement.

520
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
I don't need to explain so much to you.

521
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,920
But to prove my innocence,

522
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,440
I decided to make it public.

523
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,120
At that time, Wang Zheng Xiong

524
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,280
decided not to plead guilty.

525
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,440
I must remind him

526
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,840
of legal responsibility and the consequences.

527
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,200
I came here today

528
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
to help investigate.

529
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
I've said what I wanted to say.

530
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,760
If there are no other questions,

531
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,040
I'll leave.

532
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,760
Brother,

533
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
this warehouse is so big.

534
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
How can I find it by myself?

535
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,680
Come here.

536
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,280
Is it bad?

537
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,280
Can you tell us his circumstances?

538
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,980
Wang Zheng Xiong

539
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,880
volunteered to testify after taking the blame for me.

540
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,800
I helped him make it public myself.

541
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
I believe he will lie to me in person.

542
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
There must be something

543
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,840
happened in front of court.

544
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,440
So, you knew that there would be problems.

545
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,040
Why do you call me back?

546
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't touch me.

547
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
You said that an assassin

548
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,840
wanted to kill Wang Zheng Xiong in the hospital.

549
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,720
Don't be so lazy.

550
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Watch the surveillance.

551
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,040
How can I recognize that man with a mask?

552
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
He will really die.

553
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let me see.

554
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
I'm sorry.

555
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Come in.

556
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
Mr. Lei, I just got the news.

557
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,720
Zhou Junjie was investigated by SAC.

558
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,120
The chief asked you to go to the meeting room.

559
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
Ouyang Si has prepared it.

560
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,920
We just received a live encrypted clip.

561
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,040
It's from the same source as the last one.

562
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,640
Sirs,

563
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
it seems that you are not serious enough.

564
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
You haven't found us yet.

565
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,840
There are only four hours left for oxygen here.

566
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,640
Four hours later, Xu Sisi will die of lack of oxygen.

567
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
If you don't want him to die,

568
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,600
you can find him.

569
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Or you can hand over the undercover of Longxing Group.

570
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,520
Don't think of lying to us.

571
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,160
Chiefs,

572
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,600
good luck.

573
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,120
Otherwise,

574
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,760
when the time comes,

575
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
the whole Hong Kong will know that

576
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,800
the one who killed Xu Sisi

577
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,880
is the Hong Kong police.

578
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,360
Did we receive it?

579
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,160
Sir,

580
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,720
the Public Relations Department has confirmed it.

581
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,520
No media received it.

582
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,760
It's been a long time

583
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,680
since the first time we received the clip.

584
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
Ouyang Si,

585
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
what's the status of your undercover?

586
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,440
I've been trying my best to contact him.

587
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,040
But I still can't contact him.

588
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Actually, it's not too late.

589
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,160
Shouldn't we send the undercover's information

590
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,520
to C.I.B.

591
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
and ask them to find him as soon as possible?

592
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,160
Sir,

593
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
we have a mole inside.

594
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,840
If we send the undercover's information

595
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
to other departments without any reason,

596
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,920
then his identity will be exposed.

597
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
Owen, I'm asking you now.

598
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,640
Ouyang Si is not asking you.

599
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
Do you know who the undercover is?

600
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,720
Do you know what's his situation now?

601
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,560
It's because we don't know what's going on.

602
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
If his identity is exposed,

603
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
every action of us

604
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,360
will make our undercover

605
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
more dangerous.

606
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,320
Then Xu Sisi will be more dangerous.

607
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,000
Can one save one?

608
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
If we can't even do this,

609
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,720
we may not be able to save these two lives.

610
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
Then my undercover's life is not a life.

611
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,720
If you really want to save him,

612
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,240
you shouldn't hide it.

613
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,560
Did you promise me that

614
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,120
he would be fine?

615
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,720
The undercover is important.

616
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,960
Yes, the undercover is important.

617
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,800
But Xu Sisi is also important.

618
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:21,680
She is the key to the

619
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,680
case.

620
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
Don't joke, Mr. Lei.

621
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
Anyway,

622
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,680
the undercover's task

623
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,640
is not completed for a day.

624
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,440
I won't tell you

625
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
his identity for a day.

626
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,920
And I've already called my men

627
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,320
to find Xu Sisi.

628
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm handling it according to the procedure.

629
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,280
Mr. Ouyang, you...

630
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,720
Listen to me.

631
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,960
Ouyang,

632
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,840
let's not make a mess.

633
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,640
Anyway, we all work hard.

634
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,800
We can't give him the person.

635
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,280
Now there are only four hours left.

636
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,120
All units,

637
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,840
start the horse-riding operation.

638
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,640
Yes, sir.

639
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,520
I thought

640
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,920
the traitor was a high-ranking person.

641
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,320
It turns out that you are such a little bastard.

642
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,840
No, I'm not a traitor.

643
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,760
It's not my business.

644
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,600
Continue to hit.

645
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,720
Let the others see

646
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,760
the value of being a traitor.

647
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,360
Hit.

648
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,840
What's wrong?

649
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm fine.

650
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm fine.

651
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm fine.

652
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
I'm fine.

653
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I'm fine.

654
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm fine.

655
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
I'm fine.

656
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm fine.

657
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm fine.

658
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
I'm fine.

659
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,280
We still have so many people who

660
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,160
should be treated with the obligatory license later.

661
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,320
I give you the car at all costs?

662
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Tell me,

663
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,840
what did you tell to those police?

664
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,400
I...

665
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,200
I didn't.

666
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,920
You're still so stubborn and brazen?

667
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
Alright.

668
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,280
Then I'll use my own method

669
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,600
to find the answer.

670
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
No.

671
00:26:50,600 --> 00:27:13,280
Two more peutai

672
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,960
Four Seventh our squeeze

673
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Hello, this is 999.

674
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
There's a man and a woman injured at the front gate of the warehouse.

675
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
The man is seriously injured and unconscious.

676
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
We need to rescue the car immediately.

677
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,880
Sir, can you leave your name?

678
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,080
We will use it as a record of the report.

679
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,120
Three minutes ago, the radio station received this anonymous report.

680
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
They thought it was suspicious, so they reported it to us.

681
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,000
Who is it?

682
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
The person who reported it didn't say his name, so they hung up.

683
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,720
They couldn't trace his call either.

684
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,120
That's weird.

685
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Wei.

686
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,200
Xu Sisi might be here.

687
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
The situation is very serious now.

688
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Inform the EU and SDU to act immediately.

689
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Tell them to leave for the warehouse at the front gate.

690
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,800
Yes, sir.

691
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,600
The person who reported the case is your spy?

692
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You used a phone to call the EU and SDU.

693
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Did you think it through?

694
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Could it be a trap?

695
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,400
I think we should be honest about it.

696
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
The most effective action is to communicate with each other.

697
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
Don't worry.

698
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
I will explain it to the Chief.

699
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I hope Ouyang Sir knows what he is doing.

700
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,600
Two lives and the reputation of the police.

701
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,400
If the action fails, I don't know if you can take it.

702
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
You Xin.

703
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,480
Listen.

704
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,080
He is promising.

705
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,240
Then it's a SOUP.

706
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,240
Help.

707
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,680
Youstealers, help us!

708
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
What's wrong with him?

709
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,160
Help me call an ambulance.

710
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
Xu Sisi must be nearby.

711
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll go find him.

712
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,120
Okay.

713
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Xu Sisi, I'm here.

714
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,560
Xu Sisi, I'll get you out of here.

715
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
Don't be afraid. I'm a cop.

716
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,520
Get over here.

717
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,640
Hanguang!

718
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't run!

719
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,960
You look sick.

720
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,240
We'll get tried.

721
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
The doctor said

722
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,400
I left the team

723
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
when I was off work.

724
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,200
So...

725
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,320
Does the cop

726
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,160
want to make it up to me?

727
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,040
disabled

728
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,560
and just

729
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,980
governments'

730
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,180
You have compensation?

731
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,340
Do you have it?

732
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,340
But I'm not a cop.

733
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,460
How can I have it?

734
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,300
But Zhou San'er,

735
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,300
can you

736
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,700
give it to me first?

737
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,980
You can't do it with your lower body.

738
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,260
It's not very miserable.

739
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,220
You can't do it with your lower body.

740
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,340
Is it miserable?

741
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,300
Where?

742
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,020
Here?

743
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,500
Is it here?

744
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,060
Here?

745
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,780
Or here?

746
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,060
Okay, okay, okay.

747
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,180
Okay.

748
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,460
I'm hurt because I helped you.

749
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,140
Now I don't have my current identity.

750
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,180
I'm injured again.

751
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,620
It's not easy this time.

752
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,980
You're not afraid of exposure.

753
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,100
Just plastic surgery.

754
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,860
But before the plastic surgery,

755
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,980
you have to see your mother first.

756
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,140
Otherwise, she won't recognize you.

757
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,580
Forget it.

758
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,740
She doesn't even recognize me.

759
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,100
She only remembers you.

760
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,780
Even so,

761
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,380
you should see her more.

762
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,220
When you can't see her,

763
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,420
you'll regret it.

764
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,540
Well,

765
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,660
what about Guang?

766
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,620
How is he?

767
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,140
After all, he saved my life.

768
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,020
But I didn't expect it to be so funny.

769
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,460
He beat his own man.

770
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,860
No way.

771
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,100
I owe him a life.

772
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,100
Zhou San'er,

773
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,660
you must catch those criminals.

774
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,740
You must help him avenge.

775
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,140
Okay.

776
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,740
Yes.

777
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:25,680
From originally Dick's house to the

778
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,020
yamen building,

779
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,460
he'sometHaveHardnot been too dashing in long these past months.

780
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,100
He's finally found me.

781
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,420
and see what clues he has.

782
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,460
At the same time,

783
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,340
I will keep following

784
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,300
the situation of Lin Meixia and Zhou Junjie.

785
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,460
Isn't Zhou Junjie out of suspicion?

786
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,620
That's right.

787
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,220
Zhou Junjie is indeed

788
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,540
not suspicious of being killed.

789
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,300
But his financial situation

790
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,540
is very chaotic.

791
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,340
As a police officer,

792
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,740
his personal life is so chaotic,

793
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,060
so he has to be clear about it.

794
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
I will keep following

795
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,100
his performance after he was appointed,

796
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,540
until he has a reasonable explanation

797
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,980
of his financial situation.

798
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,620
Stop.

799
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,580
I know you are very nervous about this case.

800
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,220
But being too persistent

801
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,700
will affect your judgment.

802
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,820
Deng Cel,

803
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,980
I told you

804
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,340
I will take the credit.

805
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,820
The witness has been missing for so many days.

806
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,180
Why can't the police find him?

807
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,860
Is there any problem in the middle?

808
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,540
Is there a mole in the police

809
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,980
that caused the witness to be exposed?

810
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,660
It is said that the high-ranking police officer

811
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,500
Zhou Junjie is the most suspicious.

812
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,460
Is there such a thing?

813
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,300
First,

814
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,660
I want to highly praise

815
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,060
the high-ranking police officer, Zhou Junjie,

816
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
for his heroic performance in this operation.

817
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,820
He took the greatest effort to protect the witness.

818
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,500
Later,

819
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,700
he also did his best

820
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,980
in searching for Xu Sisi.

821
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,300
As for the problem of the witness being exposed,

822
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
it is a matter of the police.

823
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,100
And the current stage is under investigation.

824
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,420
So I can't reveal too much for the time being.

825
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,300
The early black-and-white case

826
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,180
was attacked separately

827
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,540
when the police escorted the witness to the court.

828
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,460
Two of the witnesses died on the spot.

829
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,740
Another witness was kidnapped and missing.

830
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
The控方 has applied to

831
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,300
hold the case in the mountains for a month.

832
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,060
But so far,

833
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,740
the police still haven't found

834
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,140
the whereabouts of another witness.

835
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,140
So that today's interrogation

836
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,300
can't be carried out.

837
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,140
The Law Enforcement Department is based on the suspicion of the defendant.

838
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,180
We can't use the evidence

839
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,500
to convict the defendant.

840
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,180
The High Court has decided

841
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
that the defendant Dai Zufu

842
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,700
is not guilty.

843
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,300
The defendant was Innovation Patty.

844
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,220
But this time,

845
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,260
I But,

846
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,620
Isn't it all well-matched?

847
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,060
We

848
00:36:44,060 --> 00:37:02,460
нано

849
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,820
Even by the noodles and air,

850
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,020
Hiding your emotions and thoughts.

851
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,020
For example, acting like you're not hurt.

852
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,620
But isn't it hard to act like this?

853
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,620
This doll was bought by your father.

854
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,020
Give it to him.

855
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,820
Who is it?

856
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Is there any remorse?

857
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Without you, the season by my side is more obvious.

858
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:35,820
The leaves falling down are also tired of being crazy.

859
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:46,820
Tired of chasing, chasing a perfect world.

860
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Who can take me away?

861
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Who is at the far end?

862
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Who will fight with me for the world?

863
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Is there anyone to guard for me?

864
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,820
There is no need for too many reasons.

865
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,820
In the darkness, the sky is lit by the fireworks.

866
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,820
I will not retreat.

867
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:28,820
If you are by my side, I will be there until the end.

868
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Is there any remorse?

869
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:47,820
Without you, the season by my side is more obvious.

870
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:59,820
The leaves falling down are also tired of being crazy.

871
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:10,820
Tired of chasing, chasing a perfect world.

872
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,820
Who can take me away?

873
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Who is at the far end?

874
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,820
Who will fight with me for the world?

875
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,820
Is there anyone?

876
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Who will guard for me?

877
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,820
There is no need for too many reasons.

878
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,820
In the darkness, the sky is lit by the fireworks.

879
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,820
I will not retreat.

880
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:51,820
If you are by my side, I will be there until the end.

881
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Who can take me away?

882
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
Who is at the far end?

883
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,820
Who will fight with me for the world?

884
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,820
Is there anyone?

885
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Who will guard for me?

886
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,820
There is no need for too many reasons.

887
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,820
In the darkness, the sky is lit by the fireworks.

888
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,820
I will not retreat.

889
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:29,820
If you are by my side, I will be there until the end.

890
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,820
The Long Ballad

891
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Everything is okay.

892
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,820
As long as you are here, it's okay.
