1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
End

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,640
Who is the one you are concerned about?

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,440
Who can take me away?

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,120
Who is at the far end of the world?

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,560
Who can give the world a hand?

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, is there anyone?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,760
Who is there to guard me?

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,600
I don't need too many reasons

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,920
Lighting up the fireworks in the dark

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,080
I won't give up

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,920
I'll smile if you're by my side

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,280
Until the end

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,760
Episode 16

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,840
Let me introduce to you

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,400
our new assistant supervisor, Madam He.

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Hello, everyone. I'm He Tianru.

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,760
She is the youngest CIP in our department.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,440
Have a good cooperation.

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,840
Sit down. Let's begin.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,040
I believe everyone knows that the police recently searched for the firearms.

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
It's probably from Hailu.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,240
Madam He, you are responsible for this time.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Enhance all ship quality search.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
You can't let any smuggled goods enter Hong Kong again.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,760
The direction of this operation will be taken from several aspects.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,640
This batch of smuggled ship is very random.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,560
We haven't touched their trading model yet.

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,200
So we can only send more people to monitor at the command center.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,440
In addition, when we patrol the sea, we have to pay more attention to the shore.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,840
We can't let even the small ship quality go.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,160
Mr. Ding.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Your mother hasn't paid the rent for the last month.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
It's almost time for her to pay this month. When is it convenient?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Actually, my surname is Zhou.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,000
You brat. You don't know your mother.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,840
You even gave your father's name. You're a beast.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Mr. Ding.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,760
Okay.

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
Sorry. How much do you owe?

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,200
32,000 for two months.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,600
Okay. Wait for me inside. I'll pay first.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Ding Xiao Fei.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,520
Okay. Okay.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,920
This way.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Sorry.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Is it here?

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Yes. Yes.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
This place is so old.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Because it's so tiring.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
Zhou Si.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,200
The salary of the man.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,200
You're just a robber. You know the law and you're a criminal.

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,600
I know the law and I'm a criminal?

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I just paid the money for my godmother's nursing home.

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
32,000.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Say it. Why don't you pay?

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm poor.

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Poor?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Don't you know a rich and rich nurse's girlfriend?

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm done.

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,400
That's right. If I were that woman, I would kick you out.

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
I kicked her out.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was dancing with a girl.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She was jealous. She was so angry.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're so stubborn.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I...

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
Hold this.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Zhou Si. You can't take black money.

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Xiao Fei, he's a bad person. Don't go so close to him.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,200
I know.

71
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't lose your dad, uncle, and uncle.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's uncle San and uncle Er.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,200
What?

74
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Don't mind him. Don't mind him. Let's go.

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Godmother really wants to see you become a police officer.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is a iron rule.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
You just don't want to pay me.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
This is not a matter of money.

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
That's your mom.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
I really don't want to be in the police force.

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
My mom...

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,600
She thinks I'm just a thief.

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
She doesn't necessarily want to be a police officer.

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Ordinary citizens can pay for food and clothing.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
They don't need to wear uniforms.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Actually, should you give me a good citizen award?

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Fine.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But a good citizen award doesn't have a cash fee.

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Remember to pay.

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,560
Then you can go help the police

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
is to get a citizen award.

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Uncle, you're the guiding style here.

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes.

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
You're in the car, too.

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, thanks.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,800
My happiness is with you.

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
What's wrong with you?

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Are you feeling better today, Dou Dou?

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I really couldn't leave today

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
so I asked you to take her to the doctor.

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
It's okay.

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
It's your first day of work.

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I knew you'd be busy.

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
So I knew you'd be worried about Dou Dou.

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
So I brought her here to pick you up from work.

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Oh, right.

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
The doctor said her joints are slightly sprained.

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
You should pay attention to her limbs.

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Get in the car.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
We've extracted the conversation in the game.

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
There are only 40 messages.

115
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Many of their conversations are very strange.

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
There are also some chaotic codes

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
besides the endless text content.

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
There are also some numbers that are unclear.

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
We've already found experts to solve the chaotic codes and numbers.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
As for the remaining text,

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
we've also organized some clues.

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
We can get to the beginning a few months ago.

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
What's a brick?

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
We've been thinking about the meaning of bricks for a long time.

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
We suspect that

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
the most likely one is the number of police, brick.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
In the structure of the P.T.U.,

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
one team is a row.

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
There are four teams in a row.

130
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
There are eight people in one team.

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Half of the team is a small team.

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
It just so happens that Wang Zhen Xiong entered the P.T.U. in 1994.

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
So we suspect that

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
the brick they're looking for

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
is the team of Wang Zhen Xiong's team.

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Hu Yao Dang,

137
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm going to apply for the documents right away.

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I want to find out the background of everyone who entered the P.T.U. in 1994.

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,760
The

140
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,800
Rock, paper, scissors!

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Rock, paper, scissors!

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,800
One, two, three, four!

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
This afternoon,

144
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
there was a gun incident in Huang Daxian Park.

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Liu You Tong found a gun in the flower pond.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Fortunately, he didn't go online.

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
The police are investigating the source of the gunshot.

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
But we haven't confirmed that this incident

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
is related to the recent multiple gunfights.

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
We won't exclude the terrorist activity.

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
The police called on the citizens

152
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
to inform the police if they find suspicious items

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
in public.

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Please don't touch them.

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Inform the police immediately.

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Annie, it's Daddy.

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Where are you?

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Nothing.

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I just want to remind you

160
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
that if there's nothing,

161
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
go home early and don't go out.

162
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Okay, bye.

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
You're crazy.

164
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
You haven't stopped since you started.

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
When we came back from the park,

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
there were gunshots in the market.

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
There were gunshots everywhere.

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Are you playing tricks on us?

169
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm afraid we're going to get busy.

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
This morning,

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
a child picked up two guns

172
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
in the park.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
The market had a fight

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
and the gunshot was heard.

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
There was also a gunshot

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
in the Jianghu case.

177
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
There were so many cases

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
about guns in one day.

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm sure

180
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
there will be more.

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Yes.

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
There are many cases

183
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
about guns in the market.

184
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
It's really strange

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
that the people who fight

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
can get a gun.

187
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It's even more strange

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
to have two guns

189
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
in the park.

190
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
It's obvious

191
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
that there are a lot of guns

192
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
in the residential area.

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
But who put the goods out?

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
What's the purpose of the goods?

195
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
How many are there?

196
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
We don't know yet.

197
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
The two guns found in the park

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
today

199
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
have no gun license.

200
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
They should be replicas.

201
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
The bullets and bullets

202
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
were all fired at the same time.

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
The gun was fired at the same time.

204
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The bullet and bullet shell

205
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
have been tested

206
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
by the Military Affairs and Law Enforcement Bureau.

207
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
The report came out

208
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
and we knew

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
if they were the same gun.

210
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
It's not related to the case.

211
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
But I noticed

212
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
that the accessories

213
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
of the two guns in the park

214
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
are very similar

215
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
to the guns

216
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
we found in the deserted island.

217
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
The report came out

218
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
and we can be sure.

219
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I think so too.

220
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I also suspect

221
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
that the guns in the market

222
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
and the guns on the deserted island

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
are the same.

224
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I checked it.

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
The owner of the abandoned house

226
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
on the deserted island

227
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
has been dead for ten years.

228
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
His children have all immigrated.

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
No one has ever lived there.

230
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
No one has ever been to the deserted island.

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Then there's no need to interrogate.

232
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
These people know

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
that the house is abandoned

234
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
and no one cares about it.

235
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
So they put the gun there.

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Have you asked the boatman?

237
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
We asked.

238
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
He's new.

239
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
He didn't do it before.

240
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
The boatman nearby said

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
he knew nothing.

242
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I and Tian Nan

243
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
watched the TV

244
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
near the dock.

245
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
We found this man

246
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
in the past month.

247
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
He appeared

248
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
many times in this area.

249
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
And every time he appeared,

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
he took a blue thermos

251
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
and looked like a fishing gun.

252
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
But the TV paper

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
showed that he was a fisherman.

254
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
He was so different from other boatmen.

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
It's hard to catch up with him.

256
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Then we'll concentrate on the fire

257
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
and find him.

258
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Yes, sir.

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
They are playing tricks.

260
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
They don't take us seriously.

261
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
We have to find the source of the gun as soon as possible.

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
We can't let them

263
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
continue to spread the fire.

264
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
We don't know yet

265
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
how many guns

266
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
are left in the market.

267
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Similar gunfire

268
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
may happen again.

269
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
So we have to

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
quickly solve the case

271
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
and make a combination.

272
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Now we have to

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
find the source of the gun as soon as possible.

274
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Yes, sir.

275
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I suggest that

276
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
we should tell the special forces

277
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
to use emergency measures

278
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
to open the surveillance power.

279
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
This may cause

280
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
public panic.

281
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
If there are gunfights

282
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
every day,

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Hong Kong will be completely out of control.

284
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Sir, we should be the first to issue the order.

285
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Sirs,

286
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm very worried about

287
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Hong Kong's current security issues.

288
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
We have to give the citizens

289
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
an explanation.

290
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Maybe we can help them

291
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
to find the source of the gun.

292
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Yes, sir.

293
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
We have to give the citizens

294
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
an explanation.

295
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
We also need to make

296
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
appropriate corresponding measures.

297
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Before I hear

298
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
your opinions,

299
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I want to invite the chief of police

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
to tell us the latest situation.

301
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Sir,

302
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
we suspected that

303
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
the gunfights

304
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
were in the hands of the citizens

305
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
on the way to the three-coast meeting.

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's a pity that

307
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
we haven't been able to confirm

308
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
how many are left in the market.

309
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Now the situation is serious.

310
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I think we need to

311
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
use emergency measures

312
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
to make a regulation.

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Most of the cases

314
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
are approved by the law.

315
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Most of our law enforcement forces

316
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
can directly monitor

317
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
the relevant criminal organizations.

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I think this question

319
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
needs to be discussed in detail.

320
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
But now

321
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
there are still many guns out there.

322
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Many people still don't know

323
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
how many guns they have.

324
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
So we need to find

325
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
which organization

326
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
is in charge of these guns.

327
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Since the first shooting,

328
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
the crime rate has increased by 50%.

329
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
If it goes on,

330
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Hong Kong's security

331
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
will only get worse.

332
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I think the current situation

333
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
is really harming public safety.

334
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
It's necessary to consider

335
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
the director's suggestion.

336
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
The last incident

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
has already been on the headlines.

338
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
The whole of Hong Kong knows.

339
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
But this meeting place is still open.

340
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It seems like nothing happened.

341
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
The flying room is gone.

342
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
But we can just find someone

343
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
to register and reopen it.

344
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
The big boss didn't find it

345
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
for a day.

346
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It won't be too late.

347
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
This meeting place

348
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
is specifically for sex services

349
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
to bribe those public officials.

350
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
There are police in it.

351
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Maybe there are police

352
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
covering this meeting place.

353
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
So how can it be sold out quickly?

354
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I really did a lot last month.

355
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Really?

356
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I seem to know

357
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
the girl in a short skirt.

358
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
She was here last time.

359
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
She should know something.

360
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Later, be more clever.

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Don't quarrel, don't talk.

362
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
You can only talk

363
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
when I call you.

364
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Got it?

365
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Let's go.

366
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
She's out.

367
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
The flying room is gone.

368
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Why do you still want to go back?

369
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Are you being threatened?

370
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
What do you want to ask?

371
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Why don't you ask directly?

372
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Besides those two customs officers,

373
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
are there any other public officials

374
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
who want to go up there?

375
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
How would I know?

376
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Think it over.

377
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Sir, I really don't know.

378
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Will he be a firefighter

379
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
and wear a firefighter uniform

380
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
to go up there to play?

381
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
During the bail,

382
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
if someone catches you,

383
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
you know it's troublesome.

384
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
I'm not afraid of you.

385
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
You're so beautiful and young.

386
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
You don't want to go to jail

387
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
and waste your time, right?

388
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Ruiya, don't go.

389
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
No.

390
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
This club was opened by the grandfather.

391
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
As long as I can go in,

392
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I will have a chance

393
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
to find his evidence.

394
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Let me help you.

395
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I only know

396
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
that many public officials

397
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
can come in and play.

398
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I can't go in.

399
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I can't go in.

400
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I can't go in.

401
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I can't go in.

402
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I can't go in.

403
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Do you know

404
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
that the fire department

405
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
has been working hard

406
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
to protect the fire department?

407
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
There's no one to help.

408
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
The fire department

409
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
is always in a hurry.

410
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I have no idea

411
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
what they do.

412
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I don't know what they do.

413
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
But there was an uncle

414
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
with a scar on his arm.

415
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
It looked like a knife wound.

416
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I asked him

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
how he was hurt then.

418
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
He said it was

419
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
when he caught the thief.

420
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
What was his name?

421
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Is there any other name

422
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
or other names?

423
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
People here are very mysterious.

424
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
No one calls anyone's name

425
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm spearing to leave now.

426
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,620
Later, give me an update.

427
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,080
The members of our member,

428
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,320
including the well-known

429
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,340

430
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,100

432
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,180
the mildest geholis,

433
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,640
Wang Sizjin,

434
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,460
and the entirely

435
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,380
virtuous finger,

436
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,960
Ling Kun.

437
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,360
Geg belongings to follow.

438
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm following China's Prime Minister.

439
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,240
Yes, sir.

440
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,720
Vicky, you follow Wang Siqing.

441
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,280
Yes, sir.

442
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
I'll follow Lin Kun.

443
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,760
Bi.

444
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Bi.

445
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,680
Yes, sir.

446
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
What did I say?

447
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,640
Sorry, sir.

448
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,600
I'll say it again.

449
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,040
You're in charge of Lin Kun.

450
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,040
What have you been doing?

451
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,520
You're not in the mood.

452
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,080
You've made a mistake.

453
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,360
If you keep doing this,

454
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I'll transfer you away.

455
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes, sir.

456
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,360
Dismiss.

457
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,040
Dismiss.

458
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,040
Dismiss.

459
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,080
Sir.

460
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,840
Remember it.

461
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
Dr. Zhang, did you find anything?

462
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
The victim's fatal injury is a head injury.

463
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
According to the direction of the bullet,

464
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,760
the victim was shot from the front.

465
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,800
There are no special marks on the victim's body and hands.

466
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
At first glance,

467
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,400
the time of his death was from 9 to 11 p.m.

468
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,360
Mr. Chi.

469
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,360
How is it?

470
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,960
Over there.

471
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,680
I found the bullet.

472
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Give it to the hospital.

473
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,440
Yes, sir.

474
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,160
Yes, sir.

475
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes, sir.

476
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,680
Yes, sir.

477
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
Give it to the hospital.

478
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,320
Okay.

479
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,160
Sir.

480
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,600
I found a wallet on the victim.

481
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,520
His name is He Jiaming.

482
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
He's 28 years old.

483
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,600
On his body,

484
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,680
I found a certificate of ICAC.

485
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,200
ICAC?

486
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,280
Have you informed them?

487
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

488
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,200
Sir, you can't come in here.

489
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
The police are doing something.

490
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm Gao Haoran, the senior investigator of ICAC.

491
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,080
That's my team member.

492
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,840
Let him in.

493
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,720
Gao San.

494
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm here.

495
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
Did you find his phone or laptop?

496
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,600
I only found his wallet and earphones.

497
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,360
Mr. Zhao, can I?

498
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I said

499
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,160
I would wait for the support.

500
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
Why didn't you listen?

501
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Your family informed me

502
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,520
that your mother was sick recently

503
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,920
and needed a large amount of medical expenses.

504
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,560
So I didn't come to the hospital often.

505
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
I didn't know much about it.

506
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,160
I'm sorry.

507
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't worry, A'Bi.

508
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,280
I won't

509
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,680
let you die in vain.

510
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,240
Gao San.

511
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
May I ask

512
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,720
what your colleague was doing?

513
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
He was in the front.

514
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Can you tell me

515
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,360
what the case is?

516
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,840
I just want to know

517
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,960
if there are any suspicious people

518
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
who have a motive to kill

519
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
and narrow the scope

520
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
to save time.

521
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,200
People are dead now.

522
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
You said you were protecting others.

523
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm sorry.

524
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,480
ICAC

525
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,920
won't provide any information,

526
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,840
assistance or investigation.

527
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,000
I hope you understand.

528
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,760
The program is dead.

529
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,440
ICAC involves confidentiality.

530
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
When was the last time

531
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,800
you contacted him?

532
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
You can ask that.

533
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
It was 9.40 p.m. last night.

534
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,560
We contacted him by phone.

535
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,680
What happened after that?

536
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,440
The signal was weak.

537
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,600
We lost contact.

538
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,360
I see.

539
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
I'll call you if I need you.

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
He didn't even tell me

541
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,160
who the suspect was.

542
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,280
They have common sense.

543
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
They know everything.

544
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,680
They're not afraid of being caught.

545
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,080
They have a program.

546
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,480
They'll tell you when they can.

547
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,160
Wasting everyone's time.

548
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,960
Yes.

549
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,160
They'll tell you

550
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,920
who the murderer is

551
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,680
without investigation.

552
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
But he's cold-blooded.

553
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,320
He killed a subordinate.

554
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,160
He doesn't have feelings.

555
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
Is he crying in front of you?

556
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,600
He's holding on.

557
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,280
I understand.

558
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,920
Will they investigate the police?

559
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
That's why they don't want to tell you.

560
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,640
Anything is possible.

561
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,840
By the way,

562
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,280
the report is coming.

563
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
You'll take care of it.

564
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Yes, sir.

565
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,360
Sir, something's wrong.

566
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,240
Wait.

567
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,360
Don't move.

568
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,760
I saw Lin Kun

569
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
and another person.

570
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,600
But I can't hear what he said.

571
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,120
I'll go in and listen.

572
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,840
Bi,

573
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,160
wait for the signal.

574
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,320
What?

575
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,400
I know Bi's death

576
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,880
is a big blow to everyone.

577
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,800
But this case

578
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,000
will have more victims

579
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
if we don't find the murderer

580
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,920
one day.

581
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,680
So we can't give up now.

582
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,880
We have to work harder.

583
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
That's the only way to make Bi happy.

584
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:22,200
It's okay.

585
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,640
Mr. Wang.

586
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
I think the latest machine gun shooting case

587
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
is all about this gun.

588
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,360
That's right.

589
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,800
Black Bull, please go to the government's

590
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
to check if the current firepower

591
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,480
is the same.

592
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Roger.

593
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,560
I asked the police's armory.

594
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,880
They said that the guns we found

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
were not the same.

596
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,040
That means that

597
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,440
the guns we found before

598
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,560
are not all of them.

599
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,640
There is still a part of them

600
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
that has been left to the public.

601
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,040
There are two suspicious persons

602
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,240
that are suspected of being related to Abie's death.

603
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,040
The first one is

604
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
the senior officer of the European Union, Lin Kun.

605
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
The second one is

606
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,680
the person that Abie said

607
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,720
that he was in contact with Lin Kun.

608
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,440
Lin Kun disappeared from last night.

609
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,320
I don't know where he went.

610
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
The two of them are extremely suspicious

611
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,520
and extremely dangerous.

612
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,960
They have a gun.

613
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,440
Any member who meets them

614
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,840
must report to the police immediately.

615
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,120
Don't act on your own,

616
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,440
understand?

617
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, sir.

618
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,160
This is a serious matter.

619
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,760
I approve that you can act on your own.

620
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,840
If anything happens,

621
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
report to me immediately.

622
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,880
I don't want any more

623
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,480
colleagues to get into trouble.

624
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
Vicky,

625
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,680
you are in charge of monitoring Lin Kun's family.

626
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,840
Yes, sir.

627
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,120
Jenny,

628
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,600
check Lin Kun's

629
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,120
credit card's consumption records

630
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,760
and see if you can find him.

631
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,040
We don't know how many

632
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,640
military goods are left.

633
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,520
We have to find them

634
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,520
as soon as possible.

635
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,560
There are two things to check.

636
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,000
Brother Qiang.

637
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,920
Yes.

638
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,280
Please go and investigate

639
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,800
the background of the warehouse owner

640
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,560
and see if it has anything to do with the military goods.

641
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,920
Okay.

642
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,360
Tianan, Xiao Lin,

643
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
please go and ask the relevant colleagues

644
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,320
how the military goods were checked,

645
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,480
where the origin was,

646
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,120
and who else it had to do with.

647
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,520
Yes, sir.

648
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,320
Well done.

649
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,640
Thank you, sir.

650
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
Everyone, follow Abang's instructions.

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,920
I will report to the superior.

652
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,240
So this time, as long as we know

653
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,160
why the ICICI investigator was killed,

654
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,640
we will have a chance to find the military goods.

655
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,480
Come on.

656
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,680
Yes, sir.

657
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
I am Gao Haoran,

658
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,560
the senior investigator of ICICI.

659
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,600
Good morning, sir.

660
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
Good morning, sir.

661
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,600
That is the chief investigator

662
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
of ICICI, Gao materials.

663
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,040
Comrades,

664
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,240
please go to the central office

665
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:18,520
Lv

666
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,600
and see if it is relied on.

667
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,400
Gao Haoran,

668
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,640
the assistant investigator

669
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,840
and the boss of Jiaming,

670
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,040
who just got promoted.

671
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,200
The review and control specialist,

672
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,040
Raymond Liu,

673
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,840
Liu Yufan.

674
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,720
Senior Investigation Officer,

675
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,000
Zhou Junjie,

676
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in charge of investigating

677
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,880
the robbery case of the ICAC director.

678
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,200
Three officers, please sit.

679
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,920
Three officers,

680
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,320
I believe that before you came,

681
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,200
you have received the relevant report.

682
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I want to consult

683
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,760
the person in charge of the case.

684
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
As for the implementation of the emergency law,

685
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,280
the approval of the discipline of the army,

686
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,240
and the supervision of the relevant personnel,

687
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,160
can it help your case?

688
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,720
In addition, this is a mistake.

689
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,080
Can it help our current crisis situation?

690
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,480
I think

691
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,280
it is absolutely necessary

692
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
to improve the supervision of the power.

693
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,600
In such a short time,

694
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,680
so many major accidents

695
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,400
have happened in the last two years.

696
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,160
It is a time race.

697
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,600
Use the shortest time to collect information

698
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,480
and break through all suspicious people

699
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
to help us.

700
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,800
Executive Officer,

701
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,720
officials,

702
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,920
from the legal point of view,

703
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
I think it is a little different.

704
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,360
First,

705
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,880
power is hard to take.

706
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
Enlarging the supervision of power

707
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,160
will also make more law enforcement departments

708
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,240
keep making such requests.

709
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,400
Without an effective

710
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
monitoring mechanism,

711
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
what we do

712
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
will only make people panic.

713
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,320
Every person, every second,

714
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,640
does not know

715
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,800
which one is monitoring which one.

716
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,880
Second,

717
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,960
the content of monitoring

718
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
can it really be used

719
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,920
as a political evidence?

720
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,960
If so,

721
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,120
it means

722
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,280
we need to

723
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
rewrite and define

724
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,800
the whole evidence law.

725
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,000
Third,

726
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,920
it is to balance public interests.

727
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,480
This is definitely not

728
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,400
a reasonable reason

729
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
for the law enforcement

730
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
to use such a large power.

731
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,080
I can only say

732
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
it is very practical

733
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
and very practical.

734
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,960
But everyone

735
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,800
needs to consider one thing.

736
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,760
Is the law

737
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,680
equal to catching people?

738
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
Can this law

739
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,960
really stop

740
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,240
all the killers?

741
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,320
Even the killers

742
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,960
will be the killers.

743
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm sorry, executives.

744
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I think

745
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,080
there is a need for legislation.

746
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
We need to

747
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,880
set a short deadline for them.

748
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,840
For example, a week.

749
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
After monitoring,

750
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,560
our law enforcement department

751
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,480
needs to report

752
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
all the information of the monitor.

753
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,720
If we find anything wrong

754
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,360
or abuse of power,

755
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
the law enforcement department

756
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,680
can immediately

757
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
remove our power permanently.

758
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,840
Executive officer,

759
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,920
what's the result

760
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,480
of this executive meeting?

761
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,880
Is there an ICICI investigator

762
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,600
who died?

763
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,880
Is the government still able

764
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
to maintain Hong Kong's security?

765
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,280
This series of shooting cases

766
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
is one of the most serious

767
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,520
incidents since the opening of Hong Kong.

768
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,360
But I believe that

769
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,920
the existing Hong Kong system

770
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,960
and law enforcement agencies

771
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,320
are capable and responsible.

772
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Are you going to use

773
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,520
emergency measures

774
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
to deal with this incident?

775
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,280
No.

776
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,080
I believe that the existing Hong Kong system

777
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,200
has enough ability

778
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,760
to deal with this incident.

779
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,920
To ease the worries of the public,

780
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,400
we have a special special emergency group

781
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,720
controlled by the Lv Zhengsi Re-enforcement Division

782
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,360
and Liu Yufan,

783
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,560
who directly assist the police and ICICI

784
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,000
to deal with it quickly.

785
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,320
If someone gets shot again,

786
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,880
what will be the next step?

787
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,520
Who made the decision this time?

788
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,120
I sincerely ask the public

789
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,560
to believe in the Hong Kong special emergency government.

790
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,360
We will catch the murderer of the shooting case as soon as possible

791
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
and restore social security.

792
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,520
We are already standing by

793
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
at Lin Kun's house.

794
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,160
When the time comes,

795
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,720
Weiki will come to work.

796
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
If you have any news, please let us know.

797
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
No problem.

798
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,880
Did you find Lin Kun?

799
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,200
Did he not check the card?

800
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
No.

801
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,760
He didn't even use the barcode.

802
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,640
There is no digital barrier.

803
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
This person is very careful.

804
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
What about the phone?

805
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,160
I didn't use it since last night.

806
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,720
These old police officers

807
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,360
know how to handle cases.

808
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,800
They are very good at avoiding these traps.

809
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
Gao Si'er.

810
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,600
We can't find anything.

811
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,760
Fatty!

812
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,600
That's it.

813
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,080
You shot the person who killed the person.

814
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,040
The police next to me

815
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,240
was scared to death.

816
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,520
I was so angry by you.

817
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Do you know

818
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,480
you killed the ICAC person?

819
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,840
So what?

820
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,800
Why can I kill the street scoundrel?

821
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,040
The ICAC person can't do it.

822
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Is it fair?

823
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,040
Where did you hide that military weapon?

824
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Are you crazy?

825
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,280
You dare to steal Mr. Dai's gun?

826
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,400
You even put it here?

827
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,680
Don't worry.

828
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,400
Mr. Dai's guns are all self-use.

829
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,440
I have to sell it.

830
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,480
He won't mind the money.

831
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
Tell me honestly.

832
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,000
When did you start to steal guns and sell them?

833
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Something happened to you some time ago.

834
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,960
I helped you look at the company.

835
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,760
I came up with a great idea.

836
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,720
Don't worry. I'll count you in.

837
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,160
Now there are a lot of people looking for you outside.

838
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,120
What are you going to do?

839
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,520
I'll find a police officer in the police station

840
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,600
to help me.

841
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't you know a lot of people in the police station?

842
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,240
I was going to ask Lin Kun out.

843
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,920
I was going to ask him for help.

844
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,240
But that fool

845
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,560
was targeted by the ICAC

846
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,840
and messed up the whole thing.

847
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,400
What you're saying is not

848
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,080
how to deal with these police officers.

849
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,640
It's how to explain to Mr. Dai.

850
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,160
Come on, uncle.

851
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,040
You're in this position now.

852
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,440
Do you need to be afraid of the ancestral talisman?

853
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560
Shut up.

854
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Shut up, you idiot.

855
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,240
You want to die, but I don't want to die.

856
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,360
This warehouse is my name.

857
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,840
If anything happens, you'll kill me.

858
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,520
Don't say so much.

859
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,680
You have to find a place as soon as possible to avoid the storm.

860
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,320
As for the police,

861
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,880
I'll find someone to ask.

862
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
See what they've found.

863
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,040
But the most important thing in this matter

864
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,240
is not to let Mr. Dai know.

865
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
Otherwise,

866
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,840
no one can save you.

867
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
Okay.

868
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Then I'll find a place

869
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,600
to get these guns.

870
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,000
This warehouse

871
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
will take time to be cleared.

872
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,480
No.

873
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,400
I can't approve your application.

874
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,200
Lin Kun,

875
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,120
China's Prime Minister,

876
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
Huang Siqing,

877
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,120
they're all possible.

878
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,160
To catch Lin Kun,

879
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,840
you have to monitor the other two.

880
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,400
These are your speculations.

881
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,360
You take this content to find the judge.

882
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,320
The judge won't approve it.

883
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,760
Chapter 589.

884
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,700
The

885
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,120
three Bs,

886
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,520
which are reasonable doubts

887
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,680
about public safety,

888
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,320
they will definitely contact you.

889
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,360
Lin Kun,

890
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,120
you can apply for monitoring.

891
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,320
But the other two

892
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,120
can't be.

893
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,440
You can monitor one

894
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
to achieve your goal.

895
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Why do you have to spend so much resources

896
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,560
to do this?

897
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,200
I think it's okay to do it fully.

898
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
I'm not

899
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,120
not trying to help you.

900
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
But you need to understand the situation.

901
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,720
If you do this,

902
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,640
it will alert the police.

903
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
Now your ICIC and the police

904
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,280
have been in a conflict.

905
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
Okay, in the end,

906
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,560
if you can't find anything,

907
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,880
it will only deepen the misunderstanding

908
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,360
between the two departments.

909
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,800
And the most basic thing is

910
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,760
you don't have any real evidence

911
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,920
to prove that the two people are related.

912
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,000
I think it has reached

913
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
the reasonable doubt standard.

914
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,320
In the end,

915
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,160
you're biased against the police.

916
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm not biased.

917
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm just talking about the past.

918
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,240
When did the Law Enforcement Department

919
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,800
care about the relationship between the ICIC and the police?

920
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
Law enforcement, law enforcement, and judicial law

921
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,440
are indispensable.

922
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,960
From the position of judicial law,

923
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,520
we must consider the big environment.

924
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,680
As for your case,

925
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
frankly speaking,

926
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,920
even the first level evidence

927
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
can't be reviewed.

928
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,840
Do you understand?

929
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,800
I'll find the evidence myself.

930
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,280
Contact again.

931
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,280
The executive officer

932
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,000
also reported our case.

933
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,080
Ling Kun may run away.

934
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,280
You go back and help me check

935
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,880
the case of Ling Kun,

936
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,160
China's Prime Minister, Wang Siqing,

937
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,480
who has been in the police for so many years.

938
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Okay.

939
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Is it delicious?

940
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,600
Wait a minute.

941
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,280
That golden fried rice is even better.

942
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,880
Your body just recovered.

943
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Don't eat so greasy.

944
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,280
It doesn't matter.

945
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,880
The family comes out to eat.

946
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Golden fried rice.

947
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Is it beautiful?

948
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Mr. Gong,

949
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
this is your bill.

950
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
What bill should I buy

951
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
before I finish eating?

952
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Husband, what's the matter?

953
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Don't eat.

954
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Don't eat, everyone.

955
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
What do you want?

956
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
I'll get something

957
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
and leave after I finish it.

958
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Who is he?

959
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
He is the employee

960
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
who was in prison

961
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
a few years ago.

962
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Then,

963
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
is it that we have cleared the bill

964
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
and this matter is just a joke?

965
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Mr. Gong,

966
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
it's hard to make a joke

967
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
if you don't clear the bill.

968
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's hard to make a joke.

969
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Since we're talking about this,

970
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
I'll just open the bill.

971
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Just think about it.

972
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Do you want to give it or not?

973
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Rachel,

974
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
things have been going on for so long.

975
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
It's hard to say now.

976
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Hard to say?

977
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
It's easy to say.

978
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
You gave me all the documents

979
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
and signed it.

980
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
That day,

981
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
you thought about it.

982
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Once something happens,

983
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
you let me handle it.

984
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
It's pretty clear.

985
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
I gave you everything

986
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
because I thought you were capable.

987
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I trusted you.

988
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Give or not give?

989
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
You gave me the right answer.

990
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I gave you this money today

991
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,880
not because I felt sorry for you,

992
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
but because I appreciated your courage

993
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,880
and dared to ask for money from me.

994
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Only the first time,

995
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
not the second time.

996
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Don't worry.

997
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
It's not the third time.

998
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Thank you.

999
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Yes.

1000
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
The bill,

1001
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
and one more dinner set

1002
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
to pack and take away.

1003
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Okay, no problem.

1004
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Thank you.

1005
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
What's wrong?

1006
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
You're not full

1007
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
and you're ordering take-out?

1008
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
I bought it for your daughter.

1009
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
She lives alone.

1010
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
She shouldn't eat well.

1011
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
I'm not careful enough.

1012
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Your daughter is stubborn

1013
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
and she's not good at cooking.

1014
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm not good at cooking.

1015
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Your daughter is stubborn

1016
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
and she has her own thoughts.

1017
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
If you care about her too much,

1018
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
she'll feel uncomfortable.

1019
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Who do you think she's been passed on to?

1020
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
When she needs a mother the most,

1021
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm the only one left.

1022
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
I've already treated Anni as my daughter.

1023
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Don't worry.

1024
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I'll be with her

1025
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
no matter what.

1026
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
This is a good fit for you.

1027
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
It's for you.

1028
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
For me?

1029
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Where did you get so much money?

1030
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
I went to see Gong Youcheng.

1031
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
The money he gave you?

1032
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Don't you think I should take it?

1033
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
How much money do you think

1034
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
you can't make up for the past eight years?

1035
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Anyway, thank you.

1036
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Next time, no matter what happens,

1037
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
tell me right away.

1038
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
I'll be with you.

1039
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
I know you're afraid

1040
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm not used to living a life.

1041
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
You want to be with me anytime.

1042
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Don't worry.

1043
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,880
When I'm done with things one by one,

1044
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
my life will slowly return to normal.

1045
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Thank you.

1046
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Let me do it.

1047
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
You pay the money slowly.

1048
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
I'll pay for it.

1049
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I just want to spend this money

1050
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
on the people around me.

1051
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,880
An Ning, I've been looking for you for a day.

1052
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm sorry.

1053
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Hello, who are you looking for?

1054
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Hello, I'm sorry.

1055
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm sorry to bother you.

1056
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Thank you.

1057
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Did you turn on the phone?

1058
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I was dancing just now.

1059
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
I'm sorry.

1060
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Why do you look so scared?

1061
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Are you not feeling well?

1062
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
I'm fine.

1063
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I'm fine.

1064
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
If you're really not feeling well,

1065
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
tell me.

1066
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Don't force yourself.

1067
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
I'm fine.

1068
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
You just recovered.

1069
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
You need more time to recover.

1070
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,880
I used to dance for 4 to 5 hours.

1071
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,880
But now I can't dance for half an hour.

1072
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
How can you compare to before?

1073
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
There are things you can't force yourself.

1074
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Do you know that?

1075
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
But there are still 5 minutes left.

1076
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
The online contest is about to end.

1077
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
My dream is to enter this company.

1078
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,880
But I can't dance well.

1079
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
It's okay.

1080
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
When you're fully recovered,

1081
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
come and try again.

1082
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
How long can I wait?

1083
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,880
I've waited for half a year, one year, two years.

1084
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
There will be no chance.

1085
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,880
You've seen thebuzzer.

1086
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Billy, well done.

1087
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
But you've got strange HDR and

1088
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
that makes me feel very sad.

1089
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,280
center is still relatively broken.

1090
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
Where should we fix it?

1091
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
How should we fix it?

1092
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,480
Iü

1093
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
How could we fix that?

1094
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,880
You know I am in the top couple in Grape Millennium,

1095
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
right?

1096
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Family Cooling team lost the Wolf suspension.

1097
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Thanks.

1098
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I only say it once.

1099
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Only smart people have good luck.

1100
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Only good luck can have a chance.

1101
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
I know you're not happy.

1102
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,880
But maybe this is the arrangement of God.

1103
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
He wants you to go this way.

1104
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
They like to arrange it as they like.

1105
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Hello.

1106
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
What do you mean?

1107
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
I said I would turn myself in.

1108
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I just want you to catch me.

1109
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
You've been looking for me for a long time.

1110
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
I'm sorry.

1111
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
I'm sorry.

1112
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm sorry.

1113
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I'm sorry.

1114
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I'm sorry.

1115
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm sorry.

1116
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
I'm sorry.

1117
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm sorry.

1118
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm sorry.

1119
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm sorry.

1120
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I'm sorry.

1121
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I'm sorry.

1122
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
I'm sorry.

1123
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm sorry.

1124
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I'm sorry.

1125
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
I'm sorry.

1126
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm sorry.

1127
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I'm sorry.

1128
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
I'm sorry.

1129
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
I'm sorry.

1130
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
I'm sorry.

1131
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm sorry.

1132
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,880
I'm sorry.

1133
