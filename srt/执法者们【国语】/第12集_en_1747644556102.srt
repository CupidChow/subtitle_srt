1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's one thing I haven't told you yet. I bought that shop back.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I should say this, but I'm glad that I was able to meet you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm glad that I was able to meet you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm glad that I was able to meet you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Cheers. Thank you, everyone.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Has it been changed?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In the mirror, who is the one who is changing with the rain?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Who can take me away? Who is at the end of the distance?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Who will fight with me for the world?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is there anyone who can guard me?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There's not much reason to light up the fireworks in the dark.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I won't back down.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you're by my side, I'll be there until the end.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The King of Blaze

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Episode 15

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come in.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mr. Huang Yang, you're looking for me?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Have you ever been to the Marino Hotel and asked them to take all the surveillance footage?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You should know that the anti-black side has already asked them to take the video.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you going to take it again?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Anti-black is anti-black, the case is the case.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The hotel has already complained to us that the police are constantly investigating.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They feel very annoyed and don't want to cooperate with us anymore.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've followed all the procedures.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The people outside don't care about which department you're in.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The hotel's general manager has already spoken to the director

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
saying that they don't want the police to harass their group again.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you want to get any evidence, please communicate with the anti-black side.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you know about the previous emergency executive meeting?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everyone in the government has already been dissatisfied with us.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xia Er, I followed all the procedures.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Please tell me which police force I've broken into.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shut up!

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Stop all the investigation work in the hotel immediately!

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sir, I followed Mr. Lei.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will go back and ask for his opinion based on your request.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Goodbye, sir!

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you okay? You've been investigating for so long.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's fine. I don't need to care about him.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's in charge of the administration, we're in charge of the operation.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In short, you continue to investigate the military. I'll continue to investigate Dennis.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll definitely support you.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Please give littleπ

47
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
I have lots of things to talk with you, sir.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,700
Thank you for 따라ing myMi's lecture.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
flatter

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm trying to use this opportunity to show my face.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,420
to buy me food.

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,700
Of course not.

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,540
No matter how busy you are,

54
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
you have to love your wife.

55
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,100
Besides,

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,860
I'm so angry.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,020
I feel better when I see you

58
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,980
blowing the sea breeze.

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,700
Who made Zhou Sen angry?

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,020
It's the military fire case you just mentioned.

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,620
We're investigating a man named Dennis.

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,060
He's obviously involved in this case.

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,300
He should have been hiding from me.

64
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,660
You can't imagine that.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,780
He was so arrogant

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,940
that he brought a female star

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,420
to help me with the investigation.

68
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,300
He told me that

69
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,260
he spent seven days and nights

70
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,220
with that female star

71
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,860
in the hotel.

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,540
It proves that he's not there.

73
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,580
Is it that exaggerated?

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,540
It's indeed very exaggerated.

75
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,060
Did you check the hotel's

76
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,660
surveillance footage?

77
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,340
Is it true?

78
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,540
Of course I did.

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,460
But the worst thing is

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,420
I've been investigating for a while.

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
Suddenly, a madam came out

82
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,260
and said she wanted to take over the case.

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,940
I've been following her.

84
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
Of course I ignored her.

85
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,860
I went to the hotel

86
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
to get the surveillance footage.

87
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,020
Ouyang Sir not only didn't help me,

88
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,820
but also the hotel.

89
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,820
He told me

90
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,340
not to investigate this case anymore.

91
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm in charge of this case.

92
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,940
How can I not...

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,660
Calm down.

94
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,820
You're so angry

95
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,020
that you can't think of anything.

96
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,660
Since the evidence is not found,

97
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,020
let's continue to investigate the witness.

98
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,820
Daniel has checked it.

99
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,140
Did you check the female star

100
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,780
he brought?

101
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,540
Seven days and nights.

102
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,820
It's so strange.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,380
What are you doing?

104
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,540
Your wife helped you so much.

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
You're still eating bread?

106
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,540
You're eating hot pot?

107
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,980
It's so strange that two people are eating hot pot.

108
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,460
Mr. Zhou,

109
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,740
I have a clue.

110
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,180
The night when Ou Mingwei was born as He Jiaming,

111
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,300
he and Xiong Huizhen

112
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,300
stayed in the hotel for seven days and nights.

113
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,300
I called Xiong Huizhen's

114
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,980
financial company

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,020
and found a notice.

116
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,260
On the day of the incident,

117
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,940
Xiong Huizhen was shooting an MV

118
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,700
in a village in Meiwo.

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,500
He left at 10 o'clock the next day.

120
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,460
So many people were sent to the MV.

121
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
A lot of witnesses.

122
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,020
His MV is a foreign team.

123
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,260
After the shooting, all the people left.

124
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,140
But I searched the B-log TV at the dock.

125
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,860
There is indeed

126
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,500
Xiong Huizhen's upper and lower ship records.

127
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,940
That's good.

128
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,900
It's Xiong Huizhen and Ou Mingwei

129
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,140
who conspired to give false statements.

130
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,300
We can arrest them.

131
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,180
Yes, sir.

132
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,860
Yes.

133
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,420
It's really him.

134
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,740
Miss Xiong Huizhen,

135
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,180
I'm Luo Tianluo, a detective

136
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,980
in the central case team of the Hong Kong Island.

137
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,420
You conspired with Ou Mingwei

138
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,660
to prevent judicial justice.

139
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,700
Now you are arrested.

140
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,580
Go away.

141
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,140
Move.

142
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,700
Police.

143
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,220
Go away.

144
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,020
Go away.

145
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,380
Stop.

146
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,980
Move.

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,300
Be careful.

148
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,660
Police.

149
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,140
Move.

150
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,860
Police.

151
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,540
The Law Enforcement Department finally approved us

152
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,900
to monitor Lin Kun, Wang Siqing,

153
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,500
and the family of China's Prime Minister.

154
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,820
Marco, Henry,

155
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,460
you go to their usual place

156
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
and install the monitor.

157
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,540
In addition,

158
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,220
you go to contact the telecom company

159
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,580
and start to intercept the signal.

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,020
24 hours of whole-time surveillance.

161
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,700
Pay attention to their conversation content

162
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,940
and see if they have any further actions.

163
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,940
I've seen many times but I can't see the flaws.

164
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,100
Will that guy send someone

165
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,060
to re-send the video in order to escape punishment?

166
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,900
It's so hard to get the video

167
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,180
if you don't do it.

168
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,740
There's no clue at all.

169
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,100
Any other information?

170
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,140
You used to be in the Flying Tiger Team.

171
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,460
You must know how to shoot.

172
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,940
People are crazy these days.

173
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,620
They shoot directly on the street.

174
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,580
Why do they come to my place?

175
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,500
I heard there are many goods on the street.

176
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,500
Is there a way out?

177
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,980
A-Se.

178
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,420
Don't hurt me.

179
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,380
I'm here to take the license.

180
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,540
I won't do anything illegal.

181
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,620
92F.

182
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,100
I've never seen it before.

183
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,700
Do you have a registration?

184
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,540
Don't take me as a fool.

185
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,420
You've hidden so many good guns.

186
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,060
How can you register them all?

187
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,540
Zhang Si.

188
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,700
You've been playing with guns for so long.

189
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,340
Don't bother me.

190
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,820
I like to cooperate with Jin Mi.

191
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,460
You cooperate with me.

192
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,660
I cooperate with you.

193
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,300
You don't want me to check the guns every day

194
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,340
and make you lose your business, do you?

195
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,820
How about this?

196
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,500
Help me to get the money.

197
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,180
See where those black market guns are traded.

198
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,260
Where the goods are kept.

199
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,580
Let me know if you have any news.

200
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,220
Okay?

201
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,860
Thank you.

202
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,620
Any news?

203
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,940
No.

204
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,580
The inform team's colleagues are still following us.

205
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,500
Channel One is Lin Kun's wife.

206
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,820
Let them out.

207
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,660
Okay.

208
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,180
Where's Channel Eight?

209
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,940
bucks out partially

210
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,720
ThreeШ

211
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,700
Do you feel A plastic bottle

212
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
OK?

213
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,540
How is that A plastic bottle?

214
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,780
Is it empty?

215
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,300
The situation is like this these days.

216
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,900
Wang Siqin and his family in China

217
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,740
are nothing special.

218
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,460
Lingkun still hasn't contacted his wife.

219
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,220
Someone is calling Lingkun's wife.

220
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,340
Record time.

221
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,900
Hello, Miss.

222
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,460
This is the travel agency in the Bay Area.

223
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
We want to tell you about the new tour group's discount.

224
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,700
We don't know if you have any travel plans.

225
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,780
Go ahead.

226
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,740
Our company is organising a tour group.

227
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,940
The Hong Kong port project is about to start,

228
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
and they are going to Hainan Island by boat.

229
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,220
We don't know if you are interested in participating.

230
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,060
No.

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
So many trashy calls.

232
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,740
All three communication companies

233
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,660
have a service to stop phone harassment.

234
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,380
You shouldn't receive these calls.

235
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,460
I'll check again.

236
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,980
Let me see this.

237
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,060
That's weird.

238
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,340
What's wrong?

239
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,620
Two reports mentioned that

240
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,220
all guns are painted with TW251.

241
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,660
What's this?

242
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,660
Gun grease.

243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:03,980
It's a lubricant for gun's

244
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,380
rust.

245
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,540
Gao Zir.

246
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,660
I checked the sources of those phone harassment calls.

247
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,660
I found that

248
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,540
one of the registered persons of these phone numbers

249
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,460
is dead,

250
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,500
and the other is in prison.

251
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,220
The last one is missing.

252
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,620
So I suspect that

253
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,060
Lingkun, Wang Siqing and China Xiang are the ones who called.

254
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,060
The phone number is from the Pama River,

255
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,380
Mingdong Building.

256
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
Can we trust the boatman?

257
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,180
You are so good.

258
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,260
You can find him.

259
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
I just want to ask.

260
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,260
Why are you so angry?

261
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,260
If you hadn't held that bastard,

262
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,300
he would be like this.

263
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,780
That bastard is crazy.

264
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,620
He can shoot at will.

265
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,940
I can't hold him.

266
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,580
The boatman is not moving.

267
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,660
He will never pretend to be dead.

268
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,820
Gao Haoran, the chief of ICAC's advanced investigation.

269
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,020
Now you suspect that Lingkun,

270
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,700
China Xiang and Wang Siqing

271
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,340
are the ones who took bribes

272
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,620
and arrested you.

273
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,860
March 5th, 2024.

274
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,060
9.47 pm.

275
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,900
Where are you?

276
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm walking in the park near my home.

277
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,900
So you have no witness.

278
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,020
But I have no evidence to prove that I'm there.

279
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,580
Why did you use

280
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,420
someone else's phone number?

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,660
That card was bought on Yaliao Street.

282
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,700
How could I know?

283
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
According to the execution report,

284
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,180
you have to go to work tomorrow.

285
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,980
Three of you pack your luggage together.

286
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,740
Where do you want to go?

287
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,540
To have fun.

288
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,900
Why didn't you ask for a leave?

289
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,820
I can go back and forth on that day.

290
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,300
I want to go on a boat.

291
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,580
Is it illegal?

292
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
I want to find a lawyer.

293
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,980
I only know that many people

294
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,900
who can come in and play are public officials.

295
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,420
But I really don't know

296
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,820
what they do.

297
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,020
But there's an uncle

298
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,780
with a scar on his arm.

299
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,460
It seems to be a knife wound.

300
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,220
Ke Yi,

301
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,740
your gift has been found.

302
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,540
Shall I check the lab closer?

303
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,900
novel.

304
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
The knot is missing.

305
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,140
What shall I do?

306
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,140
No one will see the knot if they hear it.

307
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,900
Let them be.

308
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,500
I have sent you some information.

309
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,220
The related Coco's

310
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,540
Detective case is going on,

311
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,780
we just don't need a bike to call.

312
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,220
It doesn't matter.

313
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,660
What?

314
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,820
You also have a share in the case of Xu Sisi's witness case

315
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,300
that you hid the source of the military fire

316
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
and covered the military fire from the market.

317
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,340
Wang Zhenxiong, Lin Kun, Zhong Guoxiang, Wang Siqing

318
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,060
all contacted the upper line through a game called

319
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
The Game of Conquering the Jianghu.

320
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,340
We estimate that their upper line is a player named Shifu.

321
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,860
And this Shifu will use the game's number

322
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
to make comparisons every time he orders.

323
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,260
It seems to be no different from playing games.

324
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
I don't understand

325
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,660
how they use private servers to play games.

326
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,060
Have you heard of the game?

327
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,860
No.

328
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
This game is open to players

329
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,260
to play with friends using private servers.

330
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,060
It's like you enter Disney

331
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,660
and play your own games.

332
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,060
That means if we know his IP address,

333
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,660
we can find Shifu's identity.

334
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,060
Theoretically, it's possible.

335
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,860
But in fact, we need to go into the server to know.

336
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
Then where is their server base?

337
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,660
Lvzhijiao, Zhianan Industrial Building.

338
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,260
A place called Follow Data's data center.

339
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,260
So you're going to hack into their base?

340
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,460
Such a big move.

341
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,660
Aren't you afraid of disturbing Shifu?

342
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,460
So I and Derek came up with a

343
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,260
more feasible way.

344
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,860
We will arrange our colleagues

345
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,060
to go to the data center to pretend to be staff.

346
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,260
Go to the base and install the backdoor program.

347
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,660
I only need a few minutes.

348
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,260
Please help me drag it.

349
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
Be careful.

350
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,460
I'll watch here.

351
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,260
What's the matter?

352
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,860
We were sent by the head office.

353
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,060
Our server is broken.

354
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
We can't detect it.

355
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,460
So we want to come and check.

356
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,860
Okay, follow me.

357
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
This way.

358
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,060
Which server are you going to install?

359
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
IP 1198329.

360
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,460
1198329.

361
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Here it is.

362
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Okay.

363
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay.

364
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,660
You're welcome.

365
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Okay.

366
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
It's open.

367
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Let's go.

368
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,860
Go.

369
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,260
Hurry up.

370
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,860
Hurry up.

371
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Hurry up.

372
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,260
Hurry up.

373
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,060
Hurry up.

374
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Hurry up.

375
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,260
Hurry up.

376
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Hurry up.

377
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,060
Someone is coming.

378
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,260
Go.

379
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
What's the matter?

380
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,460
I saw the B-line was blocked by something.

381
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
I'll take care of it.

382
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
Master Xiao is here.

383
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,860
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

384
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,860
You guys eat first.

385
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,660
I'll watch over him.

386
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
I'll get you a meal.

387
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,260
How is it?

388
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,260
Did you find anything?

389
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,860
No.

390
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
He hasn't got any blood.

391
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,260
Will your background program

392
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,260
be useless?

393
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
It all depends on luck.

394
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,460
Although I copied his server,

395
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
he didn't log in for a day.

396
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,660
I couldn't track him down for a day.

397
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,460
And his phone

398
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,260
must be equipped with a virtual private network.

399
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
Anyway, as soon as he logged in,

400
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,260
we have to fight with him.

401
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,860
If he changes his IP every minute,

402
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,260
we have to start over.

403
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,860
Okay.

404
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,060
You guys eat first.

405
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,860
Thank you.

406
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,260
That pet food processor

407
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,460
will notify me if he has any goods.

408
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,460
I'll get it for you.

409
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,460
Okay.

410
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,660
Go!

411
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,460
Are you hurt?

412
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,260
Are you okay?

413
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,860
I'm fine.

414
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,260
And

415
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,460
ask the uniform staff

416
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,260
if they can help

417
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,660
to inspect my wife's house.

418
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,260
Yes.

419
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,660
Okay.

420
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,660
I'll contact you if I need anything.

421
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,260
Thank you.

422
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,260
I called my colleagues

423
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
to ask them to come here to patrol.

424
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,460
And I checked everywhere.

425
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,260
It should be safe.

426
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,460
Come here first.

427
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,460
I'll help you wrap up the wound.

428
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,060
Okay.

429
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,060
No.

430
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,260
I thought about it.

431
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
I'll stay here tonight.

432
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,460
I can protect you if I need anything.

433
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,460
No.

434
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,260
I'll stay here.

435
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,260
I'll sleep in the living room.

436
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
You'll sleep in the room.

437
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,060
I'm also a member of the discipline force.

438
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
I don't need to be so nervous.

439
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,660
If I'm not nervous, who are you nervous about?

440
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
You're my wife.

441
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,460
I can protect myself.

442
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,460
But you

443
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
are my wife.

444
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,660
It's you.

445
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
When can you learn

446
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
to take care of yourself

447
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,660
and get hurt every time?

448
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,460
It doesn't matter if I have skin wounds.

449
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
It's mainly because you're fine.

450
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,460
I feel bad

451
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
when you're in trouble.

452
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,260
It's decided.

453
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,260
I'll stay here tonight.

454
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,860
Okay. It's decided.

455
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,460
Does it mean

456
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
I can move back?

457
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
It's decided.

458
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,860
The air conditioner is cold.

459
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
exhaustive

460
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,900
derrick

461
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,660
derrick

462
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,980
the phobia is on the line

463
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,480
look for her position as soon as possible

464
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,200
I am what to follow

465
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
input to her cell phone

466
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,560
okay

467
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm at the police station.

468
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,480
What's wrong?

469
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,360
Go to the parking lot.

470
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,920
I'll come over as you walk.

471
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,400
Okay.

472
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,560
The black police is calling at the parking lot.

473
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,040
He's watching the police officers above the police officers.

474
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,800
That's all?

475
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,160
Is it a man or a woman?

476
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,960
I don't know.

477
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
I only know he's above the police officers.

478
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:52,920
Li

479
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,460
Forget it

480
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,820
You can go now

481
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,320
Bros

482
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,440
It's really late

483
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Otherwise, we will be late

484
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,560
Leqiao

485
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,200
We are going to have check-up

486
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,700
You like to row boat

487
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Why do you see the classic arriving of boat recently?

488
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Then you must take your medicine and listen to the doctor and nurse.

489
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
You will be able to see your mother soon.

490
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I know.

491
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Le Qiao, my older brother and sister want to chat with you.

492
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Can you ask them a few questions?

493
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Yes, Le Qiao. We have a few questions to ask you.

494
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Le Qiao.

495
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Aunt Rachel.

496
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Miss Li, why are you so early today?

497
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Nurse, didn't I say that Le Qiao is not accepting the visit?

498
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Le Qiao is always a patient sponsored by the International Charity Fund.

499
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
The Fund wants to help promote it through Le Qiao.

500
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Nurse, let me say it again.

501
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,680
No matter what the reason is, Le Qiao will not accept the visit.

502
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Miss Li, I'm sorry.

503
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
But you are not his wife.

504
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
His mother is my good friend.

505
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I can always take her to the lawyer to understand the situation.

506
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Miss Li, I don't want to make things worse.

507
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
This is my job.

508
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
The Fund values Le Qiao very much.

509
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
They also hope to help promote it.

510
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
If it doesn't work, then there's no other way.

511
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Le Qiao, how are you today?

512
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I ate two bowls of rice today.

513
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
You are so good.

514
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Where is Aunt Rachel?

515
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm not as good as you.

516
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
But I also ate one bowl.

517
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Aunt Rachel, I had a dream last night.

518
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm afraid that I don't want to live in the hospital anymore.

519
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
You don't have to live there anymore.

520
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
You said that last time.

521
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Here.

522
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,680
The doctor said that he will do the surgery for you soon.

523
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
It won't hurt after the surgery.

524
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Then you can come to my house and live with me.

525
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Really?

526
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Then you can play with me.

527
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
You can play and wait for me to come back.

528
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
That's great.

529
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Look.

530
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
This is the boat.

531
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
This is my mother.

532
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Bye.

533
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Bye.

534
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
This is Rui.

535
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
I can't answer your phone right now.

536
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,680
If you have something important, please keep it.

537
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I will reply to you as soon as possible.

538
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Hello.

539
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
A Xin.

540
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
I have been calling Rui.

541
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
No one answered.

542
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Could it be an accident?

543
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Excuse me.

544
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I want to book a seat.

545
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Yes.

546
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
When is the time?

547
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Qingzhou.

548
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Next Sunday at seven thirty.

549
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Yes.

550
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Number 14, right?

551
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Yes.

552
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Thank you.

553
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Okay.

554
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
See you later.

555
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Bye.

556
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Welcome.

557
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I want to book a seat.

558
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Next week.

559
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Okay.

560
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Do you want to add a new card?

561
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Okay.

562
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Come and see the flowers here.

563
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
There are some dolls and little hearts.

564
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
No.

565
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Fortunately, I didn't take so many things when I left.

566
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
It doesn't matter.

567
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
You can leave when you leave next time.

568
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Wait.

569
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
What did you say?

570
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Next time?

571
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm kidding.

572
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
You are so over.

573
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
We have a anniversary in two days.

574
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,680
I don't know if someone has any preparations.

575
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I heard that your favorite restaurant...

576
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Okay.

577
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Shouldn't there be any表示?

578
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
What are you doing?

579
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I'm giving you the key.

580
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
That's it?

581
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Yes.

582
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Unbox it.

583
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I think I have to clean it up.

584
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Dou Dou is doing it.

585
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Dou Dou.

586
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
You are awake.

587
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Do you want me to cook for you?

588
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Okay.

589
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
What do you want to eat?

590
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
I want to eat...

591
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Beef noodles with satay.

592
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Okay.

593
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
I want to eat...

594
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Beef noodles with satay.

595
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Okay.

596
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
I want to eat...

597
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Beef noodles with satay.

598
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay.

599
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I want to eat...

600
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Beef noodles with satay.

601
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
It tastes so strong.

602
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
I haven't eaten it for a year.

603
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
It's time for breakfast.

604
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
It smells good, right?

605
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay.

606
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
It's coming.

607
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Eat it.

608
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Wait.

609
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Hello.

610
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I know.

611
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Okay.

612
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
What's wrong?

613
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Sorry.

614
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Mr. Dou.

615
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I'm going out.

616
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
I have something to do.

617
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
What about my breakfast?

618
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
It's too late.

619
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
You guys eat.

620
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
We'll eat.

621
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
See you tonight.

622
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Your mother said we can eat.

623
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Then you can eat too.

624
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Do you want to eat?

625
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Come on.

626
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Dennis has already worked hard to make up for this.

627
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
There will be new goods shipped today.

628
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
He will definitely pay off the accounts.

629
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
I knew you could solve it early on.

630
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
The sea fortress is almost done.

631
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,680
The partners of the world are waiting for us.

632
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I really don't want to lose to you for this.

633
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
I really appreciate your words.

634
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,680
But recently, the police and the police have been watching closely.

635
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Why don't you stop this first?

636
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
How to stop?

637
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Stop?

638
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Take it apart?

639
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Or blow it up?

640
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Don't worry.

641
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Trust me.

642
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Of course I trust you.

643
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
You saved my life.

644
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
If I don't trust you, who else can I trust?

645
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
In 1997,

646
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
at the rooftop of the financial building,

647
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
do you remember what I said?

648
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I told you to look up at the sky.

649
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
As a person, you can't always look down.

650
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,680
If you look down, you will easily fall to death.

651
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I can save you once,

652
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I can save you twice,

653
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I can save you three times.

654
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Remember what I told you.

655
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I will.

656
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
We are partners.

657
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
By the way,

658
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,680
I recently bought a wine house in France.

659
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
I took the best wine from it.

660
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
You are a professional.

661
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Help me evaluate it.

662
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
The fruit flavor is very rich.

663
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
The taste is very solid.

664
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Good wine.

665
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
A bottle of red wine.

666
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
The seed is seeded.

667
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
It needs to be cultivated.

668
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
It needs to be taken care of.

669
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Then it is put into a bottle.

670
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
It needs to be transported.

671
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
It needs to be sold out.

672
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
It needs to be handled by so many people.

673
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Tell me.

674
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Will the owner of the wine house

675
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,680
participate in every step?

676
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Actually, many things

677
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
don't need us to do.

678
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I understand.

679
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Then the most important thing

680
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
is to get what we want.

681
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Of course.

682
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
I also want to get the treasure on the sea.

683
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
It's time for you to go to the treasure on the sea

684
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
and get ready.

685
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
I understand, Godfather.

686
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
After getting ready,

687
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
you will take your nephew from Gongyou City

688
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
to play.

689
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
In fact, Dennis has already

690
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
worked hard to clean up the stall.

691
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Can we go to the sea

692
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
and get ready?

693
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
I don't think so.

694
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I think

695
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
we should go to the sea.

696
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I think

697
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
we should go to the sea.

698
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
The stall is empty.

699
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Can we

700
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
not do this?

701
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
The goods he made

702
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
are not clean.

703
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
The police and ICAC

704
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
are watching him.

705
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
If we leave him here,

706
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
he will only get us involved.

707
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
We need to teach him a lesson.

708
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
But you have a lot of business

709
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
with Gongshu Shu.

710
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Can you let him go?

711
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
I want to

712
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
judge if a person

713
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
can stay by your side.

714
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
There is only one principle

715
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
around him.

716
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
It's whether he is valuable or not.

717
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Gongyou City

718
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
still has some remaining value.

719
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
It doesn't mean

720
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
his nephew has it.

721
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Remember,

722
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
no one can believe it.

723
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You can only rely on yourself.

724
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Mr. Zhou,

725
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
this is the military information

726
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
found by the Ye's meeting.

727
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Jiu Sen,

728
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
my informant told me

729
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
that Dennis will have

730
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
a military fire trade today.

731
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Where is he?

732
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
He is on the field.

733
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Only with these clues,

734
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
I can't do anything.

735
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
A'Bao,

736
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
didn't you say

737
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
the military fire

738
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
is used

739
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
with high-intensity melting oil?

740
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Yes.

741
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
If this basket

742
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
is used

743
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
to store military fire,

744
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
it means

745
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
every time

746
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
we have to go out to get it.

747
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
That is to say,

748
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
these military fires

749
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
are near the sea.

750
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
That's why

751
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
we have to use

752
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
such high-intensity melting oil

753
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
to prevent the fire.

754
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Uncle,

755
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
the batch of goods is done.

756
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Mr. Dai must be satisfied.

757
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
The headquarters said

758
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
that the unknown ships

759
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
were wandering around.

760
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
They suspect that

761
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
the ships are smuggling military fire.

762
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Let's cheer up.

763
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Yes, sir.

764
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
What are you doing?

765
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Stop!

766
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Stop!

767
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Stop!

768
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Stop!

769
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Police,

770
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
change the boxes.

771
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Don't move.

772
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Stand up!

773
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Police, stand up!

774
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Don't move!

775
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Now they suspect you are smuggling the army.

776
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
What smuggling the army?

777
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
We are just selling fish.

778
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
Yes, we are selling fish to do business.

779
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Okay.

780
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
After the police check, if there is nothing else, we will let you go.

781
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Action.

782
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
C-17, command center calling.

783
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
This is C-17, please speak.

784
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I just found a suspicious ship.

785
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
It is 0.3 nautical miles south of Hengnan Island.

786
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Please go and check it.

787
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Roger.

788
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Yes, madam.

789
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Nothing.

790
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
C-17, command center.

791
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Over there.

792
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
This is C-17.

793
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
We found a suspicious ship. Please send for help.

794
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
We will go and check it.

795
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Yes, madam.

796
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Don't you think it's strange?

797
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Whether it's the human body or the military fire,

798
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
it's all related to the dock and the sea.

799
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Will they be trading in the sea?

800
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
Many smugglers are trading in the sea.

801
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
If Dai Zufu and others are really trading in the sea,

802
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
we can't do anything about them.

803
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
But if this time,

804
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
we catch Dennis,

805
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
we can definitely get them.

806
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Let's not talk about it.

807
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Let's go to another fishing boat.

808
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Yes, sir.

809
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Let's go.

810
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
The ship is clear.

811
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
This is the sea level.

812
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Please stop the ship.

813
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
We need to check the ship.

814
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
The ship ahead is clear.

815
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
This is the sea level.

816
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Stop the ship immediately.

817
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
The ship ahead is clear.

818
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
This is the sea level.

819
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Stop the ship immediately.

820
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
C-17 is firing.

821
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Please send for help.

822
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
There is a gunshot.

823
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
It's a gunshot.

824
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
It's a gunshot.

825
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
We are the customs officers of the county.

826
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
We are arresting you.

827
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Hello?

828
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Yes, I am.

829
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Okay, thank you.

830
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Okay, I'll be there right away.

831
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I want to tell everyone that the operation is cancelled today.

832
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
I need to get off at the intersection ahead.

833
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,680
What's the matter, sir?

834
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
My wife had an accident during the operation.

835
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
I'll go and check.

836
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Actually, we know the details of the operation very well.

837
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
We can't let you go.

838
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
We can't let you go.

839
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
We can't let you go.

840
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Actually, we know the details of the operation very well.

841
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
We can just go on our own.

842
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Of course not. I'm not there.

843
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Who is responsible for the accident?

844
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
My current staff said that after Dennis finished this, he wouldn't fire again.

845
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
If we want to arrest him, we don't know when he will wait.

846
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
You try to answer this question to the next interview.

847
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
You will definitely die.

848
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I understand that everyone wants to solve the case.

849
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
But safety is the most important.

850
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Don't say so much.

851
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Go back and wait for my news.

852
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Yes, sir.

853
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Don't take it to heart.

854
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Do you know that Zhou Sui Sui is soft-hearted?

855
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Yes. She often goes to the hospital with you.

856
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
She definitely doesn't mean that.

857
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Of course I know her background.

858
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
What kind of customs action is so serious?

859
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
I don't know.

860
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
If Dennis really deals in military goods, what's the point of doing this?

861
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
He used to steal the company's goods,

862
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,680
and now?

863
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
He's trying to make up for it.

864
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Otherwise, Dai Zuofu won't let him go.

865
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Actually, I don't understand.

866
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
There are so many rich people, and they can't spend their whole life.

867
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Why are you so greedy?

868
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Their world can only be seen by money.

869
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
They don't care about anything else.

870
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I also want to try to eat without seeing the price.

871
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
You can dream.

872
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
No, Brother Qiang. If someone gives you millions,

873
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
do you have a fixed price?

874
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Thank you. I'm just waiting for the retirement fund.

875
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

876
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Sir, please don't enter here.

877
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
No.

878
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Find four Chinese men and bodies on the sea.

879
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Prove that they are the customs colleagues of this operation.

880
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
From the morning to now,

881
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
do you think I don't know?

882
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Is it true that the bad guys

883
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
are really evil?

884
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
What are you doing? To pick up the criminal?

885
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
No, I just want to have a good time.

886
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Where's the weapon?

887
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
As long as you remember not to lie,

888
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
Boss Dai will be very careful.

889
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
The bad guys

890
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
will be punished.

891
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Even if he's still safe now,

892
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
sooner or later,

893
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
he will be punished.

894
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Has it been changed?

895
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Who is the person in the mirror

896
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,680
who is playing with the rain?

897
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Is there any remorse?

898
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Without you by my side,

899
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,680
the season of love is more obvious.

900
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,680
The fallen leaves

901
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
are like the wind

902
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,680
and the same tiredness.

903
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Tiredness to chase,

904
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,680
the perfect world.

905
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Who can take me away?

906
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Who is at the far end?

907
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Who can exchange hands with me?

908
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Is there anyone

909
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
who guards me?

910
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,680
No need for too many reasons.

911
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,680
The darkness has lit up the fire.

912
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,680
The stage is loose.

913
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,680
The small road and fire,

914
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,680
you are all around me.

915
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Until the end.

916
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Is there any remorse?

917
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,680
Without you by my side,

918
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:18,680
the season of love is more obvious.

919
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,680
The fallen leaves

920
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,680
are like the wind

921
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
and the same tiredness.

922
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Tiredness to chase,

923
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,680
the perfect world.

924
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Who can take me away?

925
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Who is at the far end?

926
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Who can exchange hands with me?

927
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
Is there anyone

928
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,680
who guards me?

929
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
No need for too many reasons.

930
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,680
The darkness has lit up the fire.

931
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,680
The stage is loose.

932
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
The small road and fire,

933
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,680
you are all around me.

934
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,680
Until the end.

935
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Is there anyone

936
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
who can take me away?

937
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
Who is at the far end?

938
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Who can exchange hands with me?

939
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Is there anyone

940
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
who guards me?

941
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
No need for too many reasons.

942
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
The darkness has lit up the fire.

943
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
The stage is loose.

944
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
The small road and fire,

945
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
you are all around me.

946
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Until the end.

947
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,680
No need for too many reasons.

948
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,680
The darkness has lit up the fire.

949
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,680
The stage is loose.

950
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
The small road and fire,

951
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,680
you are all around me.

952
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Until the end.

953
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
The stage is loose.

954
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
The stage is loose.

955
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Until the end.

956
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,680
Everything is fine.

957
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,680
As long as you are here, I'm fine.
