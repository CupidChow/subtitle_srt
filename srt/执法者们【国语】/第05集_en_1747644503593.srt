1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
The witness has been missing for so many days.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,640
Why can't the police find him?

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,240
Is there any problem in the middle?

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,960
Is there a mole in the police

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
that led to the witness's whereabouts?

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,200
There is a rumor that the high-ranking police officer Zhou Junjie

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,000
is the most suspicious.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,880
Is there such a thing?

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,920
Have you settled the matter with Xu Sisi and Yin Mao?

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
I've arranged them.

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,160
You can rest assured.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,720
First, I highly praise

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,040
the high-ranking police officer Zhou Junjie

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,080
for his heroic performance in this operation.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
He did his best to protect the witness.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
Later, he also did his best

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,760
in searching for Xu Sisi.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,560
Is there anything else that hasn't been settled?

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,000
And that Yin Boss.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,280
He asked him to find a mole.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
But it turned out to be a group fight.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,160
He even lured that police officer here.

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,440
He almost got into trouble.

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,960
As for the problem of the witness's whereabouts being leaked,

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
this is a matter within the police.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,040
And it's currently being investigated.

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,840
So I can't reveal too much for now.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,720
Don't trust outsiders.

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Whether it's Yin Boss or Ricky,

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
be careful.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
I know

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
who is at the far end of the world.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,240
Who will fight for the world with me?

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
Is there anyone

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,640
who will guard it for me?

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,400
There's no need for too many reasons.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Light up the fireworks in the dark.

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,160
I won't back down.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,840
If you're always by my side,

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,240
until the end...

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,480
The King's Avatar

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Episode 15

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
After our investigation,

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
there's no evidence

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
that Zhou Junjie is a mole.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
And in the action,

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,400
he was loyal and found many key evidence.

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,840
So I'm here to announce

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
that Zhou Junjie is back.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Zhou Junjie, welcome to be reinstated.

51
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Thank you, sir.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,880
There's no case. What are you looking at?

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Read more books. I'm speaking English.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
Good morning, madam.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,000
Good morning, madam.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,160
This is your new boss,

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
Zhou Junjie, Senior Investigation Officer.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
Let me introduce.

59
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Tie Nan, Xiao Lin,

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
A Bang,

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
Black Bull,

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
Xiao Zhu,

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,880
Brother Qiang.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,240
They're all elites.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Especially Brother Qiang.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
He's been a cop for 30 years.

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,880
He's an old cop.

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
Zhou Sir.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Hello, everyone.

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
I'll leave this team to you.

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Thank you, madam.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
Good bye, madam.

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Zhou Sir, we all know

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
that you're going to be reinstated today.

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
So...

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,800
We bought you a cake.

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,760
Congratulations to Zhou Sir for your great achievement.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,560
Great achievement.

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Successful.

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
You may not know my rules

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
on the first day of cooperation.

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,840
In my office,

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
food is not allowed to appear.

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
If you want to eat,

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,600
please go to the teahouse or restaurant.

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes.

87
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,320
Sorry, sir.

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,120
This cake will be left for our afternoon tea.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Let's go to the restaurant to eat together.

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,480
And...

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,440
I want to sort out

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,680
the case of the RCU in the last five years.

93
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
Anyone can help?

94
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
Sir, let me do it.

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Okay.

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Zhou Sir.

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
After I finish the delivery,

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
I'll take it to the teahouse.

99
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
Why are you back so late?

100
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,960
You asked me to get the case of the RCU

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
in the last five years.

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,800
I didn't ask you to finish it tonight.

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
I can do it tomorrow or today.

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
It's better to finish it earlier.

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Okay, stop.

106
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Sir, do you have other orders?

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes.

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
I order you to eat first.

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
And then do it.

110
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I signed it.

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,280
Just take it to the lawyer's office.

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,800
Don't bother to give it to me.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Wait.

116
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm afraid I've filled the wrong thing.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Help me see if I've written anything wrong.

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
I've filled the wrong date.

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
It's correct.

120
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
2026.

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I want you to keep it.

122
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll give it to the lawyer next year.

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
What do you want to do?

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
You said in ICAC

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
that I neglected you

126
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
because I put my work in the first place.

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
You're right.

128
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I'm really an unqualified husband.

129
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
I came here to help you.

130
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I want you to give me a chance.

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Give me a year

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
to be a qualified husband.

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Even a full husband.

134
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
You've reflected on it.

135
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I've reflected on it too.

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
It's not just you who did it wrong.

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,960
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I just want to know

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
if you'll give me a chance.

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Okay.

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I'll give you another year.

142
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Congratulations.

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Thank you.

144
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Cheers.

145
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Congratulations, Judy.

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Congratulations, Judy.

147
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Today is the probation period.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
You've finally changed your job.

149
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Thank you for your hard work.

150
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I'll treat you to dinner.

151
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You're welcome.

152
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Okay.

153
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Judy, well done.

154
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Thank you.

155
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Keep working hard.

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Okay.

157
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Enjoy your meal.

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I have something to do.

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I'll leave now.

160
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Bye.

161
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Bye.

162
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Bye.

163
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Does Wu Renmeng

164
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
not like Suo Suo?

165
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Maybe he's involved in the case

166
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
of the grandfather.

167
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
He got away with all the things

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
we did.

169
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
But we can't say that

170
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
we're 100% sure

171
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
we'll be charged every time we file a lawsuit.

172
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
How did he tell Rachel

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
about the case?

174
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Is he close to Richard?

175
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
They've known each other for a long time.

176
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
They were all helped by

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Raymond to sue Rachel.

178
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Although they failed to win,

179
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Raymond has been helping him

180
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
to sue her.

181
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I've finished reading

182
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
the books you gave me.

183
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Really?

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Do you want to take more?

185
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
I think I can take more.

186
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I've calculated.

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
If I perform well,

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I can release it

189
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
in about a month.

190
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
So I don't need to calculate it again.

191
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Right.

192
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
It's almost time.

193
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

194
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

195
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

196
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

197
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm sorry,

198
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I made you be like this.

199
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
You haven't written to me

200
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
recently.

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
How is he?

202
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
You came back?

203
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
What are you doing?

204
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Where are you going

205
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
with the luggage?

206
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
You don't read my messages again.

207
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Didn't I say

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
I would pack my luggage?

209
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
My friend and I

210
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
rented a place

211
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
and plan to move out.

212
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Move out?

213
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Where are you moving?

214
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Shanshui Group.

215
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Shanshui Group?

216
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Fibers?

217
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Shen Shui Bu.

218
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Shen Shui Bu?

219
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
How can a girl live in that kind of place?

220
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Didn't I say that I rent with a friend?

221
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
That's what I said.

222
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
When did you care about me so much?

223
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
You never cared about me.

224
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
You threw me out of the boarding school since middle school.

225
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm used to being alone.

226
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
You don't have to pay me for living. I'll take care of it myself.

227
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Then I'll send you.

228
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
My friend came to pick me up.

229
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
What friend?

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
You don't know me even if I tell you.

231
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Get in the car first.

232
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
She has moved out.

233
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
We rarely meet now.

234
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Girls want to coax her.

235
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
If you have time, ask her out.

236
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Just go around.

237
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Watch a movie and keep her company.

238
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I'll try.

239
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Oh, right.

240
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Tim asked me to say sorry to you.

241
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
We can't help you.

242
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
I've figured it out.

243
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Let bygones be bygones.

244
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
I just want to live again.

245
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
The next question.

246
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
It says ABCD here.

247
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
And this BCD

248
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
is here.

249
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
114 degrees.

250
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Focus.

251
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
You don't have much time.

252
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
You have to finish the three-year course in half a year.

253
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
You can't waste a second.

254
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes, teacher.

255
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
You said you wanted to go to college after you got out of prison.

256
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
You want to show off to your mother.

257
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You give up so quickly.

258
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Continue to ask.

259
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Here.

260
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I lost.

261
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I lost all.

262
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
How do you count this?

263
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Do you want to help you calculate how much you lost?

264
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
You're so arrogant.

265
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
You don't believe me?

266
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
What are you doing?

267
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Get down.

268
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Get down.

269
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Yiwen.

270
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Look ahead.

271
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I've been wanting to tell you for a long time.

272
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I really appreciate you.

273
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Because if I didn't meet you this year,

274
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I can't hold on.

275
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm afraid after I get out of prison,

276
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
this world can't accommodate people like me.

277
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Come.

278
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Look at me.

279
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
What do you think of me?

280
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Very calm.

281
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
It's like I don't have a temper.

282
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
People are easily confused by the surface.

283
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
When you show your feelings,

284
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
the other party will accept it.

285
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Just like you are now.

286
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Like the whole world owes you.

287
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
People can see your feelings at a glance.

288
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
They will want to bully you.

289
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
But

290
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
if you know how to hide

291
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
your emotions and feelings,

292
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
for example,

293
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
to show that there is no harm in the human world,

294
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
people won't be able to guard against you.

295
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Do you remember

296
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
you gave me a diary before?

297
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I used it every day.

298
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I found that

299
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I wrote most of what I wanted to do after I got out.

300
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Actually,

301
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
I wanted to live a happy life.

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Hello.

303
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I bought a lot of gifts for Dou Dou.

304
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Just pour the dog food in and it's done.

305
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
The salesman said that this machine

306
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
can be controlled

307
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
by connecting with your phone.

308
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
When can you feed Dou Dou?

309
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
It can also...

310
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Hey,

311
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm not a dog.

312
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm a dog.

313
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm a dog.

314
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm a dog.

315
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
You can also

316
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
see Dou Dou through the camera.

317
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Mr. Zhou, you're watching me.

318
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
I didn't contact this machine.

319
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
But

320
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
if I can watch it more,

321
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
it's not bad.

322
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
By the way,

323
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
you don't usually work or rest.

324
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Are you playing with Dou Dou?

325
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes.

326
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Is it easy to take care of small animals?

327
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
So if you want to adopt them,

328
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
you have to consider whether you have time to take care of them.

329
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I don't adopt them.

330
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I want to

331
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
take care of you and Dou Dou.

332
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I don't need to.

333
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I need to?

334
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I only have one year.

335
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Of course, I can do as much as I want.

336
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
In order not to repeat the mistakes,

337
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
we had a fight and even divorced.

338
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
It's because we have the same personality.

339
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm like you.

340
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
You're still like me.

341
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You're like me even before I finish talking.

342
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Okay, you talk. I'll listen.

343
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
We're like each other

344
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
because we're impulsive and impatient.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
We had a fight

346
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
in one or two sentences.

347
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Before the other person finished talking,

348
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
we had a fight and broke up.

349
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I really don't agree with this.

350
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Every time I want to talk to you,

351
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
you're like you want to fight.

352
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
But

353
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I haven't finished talking yet.

354
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I was beaten to death by you.

355
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Can you talk faster next time?

356
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Can you react slower?

357
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
But in order to avoid the same mistake in the future,

358
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
if we have any conflicts in the future,

359
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
we need to give each other three minutes.

360
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
In this three-minute calm period,

361
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
we can't talk

362
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
until the other person has finished speaking

363
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
what they want to say.

364
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
If you see

365
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
this gesture,

366
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
you don't have to talk anymore.

367
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
You have to wait until the other person has finished speaking

368
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
what they want to say.

369
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
It's a deal.

370
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Are you used to

371
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
new team and new partner?

372
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
It's all work.

373
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm not used to it.

374
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Actually, there are many ways

375
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
to treat people.

376
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
You were really serious before.

377
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Relax.

378
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Is it over?

379
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Right, Mr. Lei.

380
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
How's the matter with Guang?

381
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't worry.

382
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I'll call another team to follow up.

383
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Actually,

384
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
can you leave it to me?

385
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You just got back from the job.

386
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
You don't have to be so nervous.

387
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
No.

388
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I always feel strange.

389
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Why Guang lost contact with the police?

390
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
And he knew something was wrong.

391
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
He even didn't inform Ouyang San

392
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
because he was playing 999.

393
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Even he thinks Ouyang San is also suspicious.

394
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
If so, there are many things

395
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
we don't know.

396
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
It's hard for us outsiders

397
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
to understand the secret of the undercover and the superior.

398
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
If you don't understand, you can find it out.

399
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I don't want you to be so stressed.

400
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
It's not stress.

401
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
It's an explanation.

402
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
So many brothers died.

403
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
They need an explanation.

404
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Tomorrow morning,

405
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
they will go to Guang's home to search for evidence.

406
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
You do it well.

407
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Ouyang San will go.

411
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Then pack up and go back.

412
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,720
From start to finish,

413
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,880
look at it carefully again.

414
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,640
Yes, sir.

415
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,840
A Jie,

416
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,640
thank you.

417
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,920
Nothing.

418
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,280
Bi,

419
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
are there any news from the second team?

420
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
He has repaired Wang Zhen Xiong's phone.

421
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I've also read his list of contents,

422
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
communication records and documents.

423
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

424
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Could it be that he deleted something?

425
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Derek said that he needed some time to repair it.

426
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Tell Derek to repair all the files as soon as possible.

427
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
After you're done,

428
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
you can look at it again.

429
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Don't look at the wrong person.

430
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Yes.

431
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Gao Si Er,

432
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
about the Dai Zufu case,

433
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
although we've already proved that

434
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
there are people in the police force

435
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
colluding with the outside forces,

436
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
but there are so many people in the police force.

437
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Where should we investigate?

438
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
It's not easy to kill a witness

439
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
by just buying a police officer.

440
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
We should concentrate on investigating

441
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
the internal investigation of Mr. Jing and the surveillance camera.

442
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Yes, sir.

443
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Who are you looking for?

444
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Are you Wang Yao's family?

445
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
No.

446
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
She died a few years ago.

447
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Your husband helped me a lot when he was alive.

448
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
I owe him a big favor.

449
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm grateful for your kindness.

450
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm glad to hear that.

451
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Actually,

452
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
after we divorced,

453
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
he entered the black community.

454
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
We don't want to have any relationship with him anymore.

455
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't want to affect my life with my daughter.

456
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Take it back.

457
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
No need.

458
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
This man has nothing to do with us anymore.

459
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
He's a bad person.

460
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Your father is not a bad person.

461
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
He helped a lot of people.

462
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
And he knew he was wrong.

463
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
He knew he didn't have time to accompany you.

464
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
It's his fault.

465
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
This doll

466
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
was bought by your father.

467
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
But

468
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
he didn't have a chance to give it to you.

469
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Take it.

470
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
It really hurts you.

471
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Believe me.

472
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I'll be with you.

473
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I'll be with you.

474
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Your husband

475
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
is a good person.

476
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I'll go first.

477
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Come.

478
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Shoot in the create.

479
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Attention.

480
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Do it a few times.

481
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Because you're too caring, you'll easily get sad.

482
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Hey, newbie.

483
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,460
You always listen to what Brother Qiang says.

484
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,960
In the past, when Black Bull and I were undercover,

485
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
we were born and raised, all based on two words.

486
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,660
We were able to escape safely because we were in retreat.

487
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,260
Don't be so serious. They're bragging.

488
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,460
If we were to retreat, who would investigate and protect you?

489
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,860
Wow, Old Tie, you understand again?

490
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,060
I was in the Flying Tiger Team.

491
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,160
You did a great job!

492
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,960
But you can just follow Zhou Ci.

493
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,660
Before Zhou Ci, the whole team was covered in flags.

494
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,460
Everyone knows.

495
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,360
Look at how bold you are.

496
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,760
Just follow Zhou Ci and fight for your life.

497
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,160
I don't want to be buried in the backyard so young.

498
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,460
Every action will be dangerous.

499
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,360
The most important thing is to understand how to change and take care of each other.

500
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,460
But our head is surely a bit of a problem.

501
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,460
Letting that SAC tea be won't be that simple.

502
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,260
That's right. I don't know if Zhou Ci is a human or a ghost.

503
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm not that tough.

504
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,660
Anyway, I'm able to go home and eat every day.

505
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,760
You're right. Anyway, we should take care of each other.

506
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,160
We should ask for more blessings.

507
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Continue the meeting.

508
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,560
Yes, sir.

509
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Hurry up.

510
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,260
Yesterday, in the Shanshui Tribe, there was a serious traffic accident.

511
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,760
At the scene, we found an unknown body.

512
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
In a tailed nuovoce dance dance soup restaurant,

513
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,160
Many Martians were dying of starvation.

514
00:23:49,660 --> 00:24:00,260
Love, landmark.

515
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,160
It began when death caught the eyes of jewelry Sir Yuan Jiao voilà là,

516
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,160
The driver of the car accident, Oman Safa, is from Pakistan.

517
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,960
He is an illegal immigrant.

518
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,160
He doesn't have a Hong Kong ID card.

519
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,560
He is applying for custody with a temporary identity.

520
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,760
He died on the spot at the scene of the car accident.

521
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,960
The cause of death is excessive loss of blood.

522
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
According to the information,

523
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
three years ago, he came to Hong Kong alone.

524
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
He has no family, no siblings.

525
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,760
I've seen a lot of people like this in the anti-black group.

526
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
It's hard to say. They are poor.

527
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
They are selling their relatives with their hometown.

528
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,560
There's no other way. Life is hard.

529
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,560
They can't afford to eat even a month's salary.

530
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,360
But someone has to know how to use a knife to do an operation.

531
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,560
Of course, you have to know how to use a knife to remove the kidney.

532
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,760
But to solve the case,

533
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,560
first, we have to find out where this kidney came from.

534
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,960
It's useless.

535
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Then we'll wait for the DNA report from the legal department.

536
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,960
But it's strange that the process of buying and selling organs is so complicated.

537
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,560
There's no precedent in Hong Kong.

538
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,360
Yes.

539
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
The entire organ illegal trade,

540
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,160
this industry chain is big and complicated.

541
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,960
So, congratulations to everyone.

542
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,560
There's such a big case just entered the team.

543
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
Let's assign the work first.

544
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,160
Xiao Lin, help me check the vehicle registration information and the owner.

545
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,760
A'Bao.

546
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Yes.

547
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,760
I'll leave the DNA report to you.

548
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,160
Brother Qiang, Black Bull,

549
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,760
go to the hospital to check the list of patients waiting for the kidney transplant.

550
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Yes, sir.

551
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Action.

552
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,760
Do you know how long ago this kidney was removed?

553
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,160
According to my judgment, about 18 hours ago,

554
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,960
the professional method was used to remove the kidney from the provider.

555
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
But this kidney is already damaged.

556
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,160
It can't be used for organ transplant.

557
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,760
Then is the medicine found in the car used for the surgery?

558
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
Judging from the name of the medicine,

559
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,360
it's a immune drug used after the transplant surgery.

560
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
It can reduce the reaction.

561
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
It can be opened in general hospitals.

562
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,560
But now, this situation is the first type of poison that is illegal.

563
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,760
If it's opened in a hospital,

564
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,160
there will be a record?

565
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,760
I'll send some samples to the legal department to do a test and check the DNA.

566
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
Thank you.

567
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Nurse, I'm sorry.

568
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,160
What can I help you with?

569
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,960
We're from the Hong Kong Island Headquarters.

570
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,560
We want to see your kidney specialist.

571
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
They're here.

572
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,160
Hello.

573
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,560
Hello, the central case team.

574
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,160
Boss.

575
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
The central case team.

576
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
What's up, sir?

577
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,160
Hong Kong Island Headquarters.

578
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,560
We want to ask the chief doctor to help with the investigation.

579
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,760
Where did you go last night?

580
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,160
Last night, my wife and son were at home.

581
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,960
Sir, here's the list.

582
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,560
Okay.

583
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,360
What did you find these past few days?

584
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,560
Sir, I took a DNA report of Shen.

585
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,960
And the missing person's DNA.

586
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I compared it with the criminal records.

587
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,760
There's no match.

588
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
Where's the small van?

589
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,960
I checked. The van's license plate is fake.

590
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
The owner of the van is called He Dong.

591
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,960
He's the person in charge of the abandoned factory.

592
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,360
The van was already broken.

593
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
The owner of the van was going to pay for it.

594
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,560
But He Dong fixed it and decided to use it.

595
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,960
Brother Qiang and I also asked around.

596
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,760
We asked every county official.

597
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
No one knew who did it.

598
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
This is a very deep matter.

599
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,960
We took the list of patients with the same blood type

600
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
from the hospital in Gongli.

601
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,560
There are hundreds of them.

602
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,160
It's a bit strange.

603
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,360
Yes, Zhou San.

604
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,960
These men, women, and old people,

605
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,160
from 30 to 90 years old,

606
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,560
most of them are mentally ill and have a heart attack.

607
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,760
They were first tested.

608
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,160
Ordinary people, ordinary people.

609
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
What about the private hospitals?

610
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,760
The private hospitals are more troublesome.

611
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
They use the patient's privacy as a reason.

612
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
They won't say anything.

613
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
Now, the most powerful doctor in Hong Kong

614
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,760
who can perform a kidney transplant is who?

615
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Ren Xin Hospital is too high.

616
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,360
He's one of the top doctors.

617
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,760
Old Man, help me contact Dao Tazeng.

618
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Ren Xin Hospital?

619
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,360
He's the authority of the kidney transplant department.

620
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,560
There shouldn't be any reason to kill him, right?

621
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,760
I want to ask everyone.

622
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,960
The human organ business

623
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
is such a big market in Southeast Asia.

624
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,560
Why did you choose Hong Kong?

625
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,360
Because Hong Kong has top medical teams.

626
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,160
If you add the high quality organ source,

627
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,960
it's equal to what?

628
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,760
Expensive.

629
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,960
So only rich people can afford it.

630
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
I'm not doubting Dao Tazeng.

631
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
I'm doubting the patient in his hands.

632
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,160
So thank you for your attention.

633
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,760
Put your attention on the patient list of the private hospital.

634
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Yes, sir.

635
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
Thank you.

636
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,960
Zhou, what can I help you with?

637
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,760
We're looking for you to learn about

638
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,360
the procedure of kidney transplant.

639
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
Generally speaking,

640
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,760
when kidney patients have kidney failure,

641
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,160
kidney transplant is the best way to cure them.

642
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,160
If not, they have to spend a lot of time to wash their kidneys every day

643
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,360
and it will seriously affect their daily life.

644
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Then, where did the transplant organ come from?

645
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,560
There are two types of kidney transplant in Hong Kong.

646
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
One is the donor of the body,

647
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,760
which can be from their family or other half.

648
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
The second type is the donor of the body,

649
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
which is the kidney transplant.

650
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,960
But the proportion of the donor of the organ is not that high.

651
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,160
So there are no more than 100 kidney transplant surgeries

652
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,360
that can be treated every year.

653
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,560
Wow.

654
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,160
There are more than 2,000 patients with acute kidney failure.

655
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,960
In the case of no way,

656
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,960
the patient can only rely on washing the kidney to survive.

657
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,560
You also said that

658
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,360
the people who volunteer to donate organs are so short.

659
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,160
Is there a special way

660
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,560
to get a transplant organ faster?

661
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,360
There is only one place in the world

662
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
that can legally sell organs.

663
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,760
That is Iran.

664
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,960
As for other illegal ways,

665
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm sorry, I'm not very clear.

666
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,160
Dr. Zeng, can I have your patient's list?

667
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
You two,

668
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
the patient's information is private.

669
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,560
Our hospital has a confidentiality agreement with the patient.

670
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,360
Even the police can't take their personal information

671
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,360
without the consent of the patient.

672
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
I understand.

673
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,760
Then can you help contact them and ask them?

674
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
Sure.

675
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,960
But I don't know if they will cooperate.

676
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Dr. Zeng, we want to know more about

677
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,960
how the patients usually live.

678
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Can you take us around?

679
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,160
Sure.

680
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,960
This way.

681
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,360
Thank you.

682
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Sorry, I have to take this call. You guys go ahead.

683
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
Okay.

684
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
Hello?

685
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,560
Slow down.

686
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

687
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,960
This is our center of the body.

688
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,560
Dr. Zeng.

689
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,960
Be careful.

690
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,560
Thank you.

691
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
Let me help you.

692
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
Slow down.

693
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,160
Dr. Zeng.

694
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,360
If the patient can't get a transplant,

695
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
is there anything else?

696
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
Wait.

697
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,960
Keep waiting for the miracle to happen.

698
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,560
But now the whole world is in a panic.

699
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,960
This is a problem that all the patients are facing.

700
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,560
If you put it that way,

701
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,360
will organ business be the only way out?

702
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,160
A person's body is fatally exhausted, and his parents are suffering.

703
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
A healthy body is even more a blessing from God.

704
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,160
How much money will you spend to sell your unrepentant health?

705
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,960
Please.

706
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,760
The patients who get kidney surgery are very careful.

707
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,360
But some patients are disobedient and like to take Chinese medicine.

708
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Sometimes they wash their kidney to make their skin itchy,

709
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
and their bones hurt.

710
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,760
We will give them some acid and salt compounds.

711
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
Dr. Zeng.

712
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,760
The patient's family is here.

713
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,960
Did you sign the discharge paper?

714
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,360
I did. It's in my room.

715
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
Come with me.

716
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,060
My blood is bleeding from my heart.

717
00:32:45,060 --> 00:33:07,800
I need to개�

718
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,520
I'm sorry.

719
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,120
We have to go.

720
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
De Rizang, I'm sorry.

721
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,880
We have to go.

722
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,160
Okay.

723
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,760
Thank you.

724
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,320
Thank you.

725
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,040
Thank you.

726
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,680
Did you find anything?

727
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
Thank you for your hard work.

728
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,280
Check the patient's information.

729
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,840
Yes.

730
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,440
Yes.

731
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

732
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Yes.

733
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,160
Yes.

734
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Yes.

735
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes.

736
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,280
Then proceed.

737
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,680
A dependent couple

738
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,680
We've been together for half a century

739
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,320
Our home and home

740
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,480
Our care

741
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,720
A place of pride

742
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Dad

743
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,360
surprise

744
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,080
dad

745
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,480
dad

746
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
Let me see.

747
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
118.

748
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
Now I'm 7 years old.

749
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,760
Look at you.

750
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,760
Look who's here.

751
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,080
Grandma, did you miss me?

752
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,600
If you're not hungry,

753
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,480
let's play a game first, okay?

754
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,280
Wife, it's been another year.

755
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,160
Are you doing well in heaven?

756
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,480
My daughter and I are doing well.

757
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,280
I asked her to come with me,

758
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,800
but in the end,

759
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,400
she didn't reply.

760
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,920
You know that

761
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
when a daughter grows up,

762
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,280
she has her own ideas

763
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,960
and doesn't listen to me.

764
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,240
I thought

765
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,760
I should send her abroad to study

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,000
so that she wouldn't have to

767
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
think about it alone at home.

768
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,760
But who knew that

769
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
because of that,

770
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,960
my relationship with her

771
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,760
became more and more distant.

772
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
I'm an adult.

773
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,160
I don't know how to coax people.

774
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
I really don't know

775
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
how to coax her.

776
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,160
Why don't you just go home

777
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,440
and teach me

778
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,160
what I should do?

779
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,840
Anni.

780
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,160
Anni.

781
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,920
Are you in there?

782
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,680
Anni.

783
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
Who are you?

784
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,680
I'm sorry.

785
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,880
Have you seen

786
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,080
the girl who lives in there?

787
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,880
No.

788
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,760
Sister went to dance.

789
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
She hasn't been back for days.

790
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,760
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know.

791
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,680
I'm sorry.

792
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
I'm the father of this girl.

793
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,880
Now my daughter is missing.

794
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,880
Little sister,

795
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
do you know anything?

796
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,680
I don't know anything.

797
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
I just know that

798
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
you're not here.

799
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm sorry.

800
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,880
I'm sorry.

801
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm sorry.

802
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
My sister knows that I like K-pop.

803
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
She often sends me cards.

804
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
She said that she went to the beach with her friends

805
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
and danced very well.

806
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
If my sister was there,

807
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,800
she would treat me to food.

808
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
She wouldn't just leave it at the door.

809
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,440
Do you know

810
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,800
where my sister usually dances?

811
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,600
At the beach.

812
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
She said that there are many brothers and sisters

813
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,600
dancing there.

814
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,200
They play board games and listen to songs.

815
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,600
Thank you.

816
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Thank you.

817
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,400
Thank you.

818
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,400
Excuse me.

819
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,800
Excuse me.

820
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
Have you seen this girl?

821
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,280
Excuse me.

822
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,600
Excuse me.

823
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't want to bother you.

824
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
My daughter is missing.

825
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
I want to ask you for help.

826
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Have you seen

827
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
the girl who is missing?

828
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Excuse me.

829
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Excuse me.

830
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Excuse me.

831
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Excuse me.

832
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Excuse me.

833
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,120
Do you know this girl?

834
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,120
Where do you think Anni will go?

835
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I can't find her.

836
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
You don't have to be afraid.

837
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,520
She sent a new photo last night.

838
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Look.

839
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
What photo?

840
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,920
No.

841
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
I bought take-out food to her house a few days ago.

842
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,120
She didn't reply to my message.

843
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Her mother had a birthmark yesterday.

844
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
She didn't go.

845
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
I couldn't find her.

846
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
She was in the bathroom.

847
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
She was in the bathroom.

848
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
I couldn't find her.

849
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Six-star move.

850
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I went to her house last night to look for her.

851
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
But I couldn't find her.

852
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
And I met a neighbor

853
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
and she hasn't been home for a few days.

854
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I even looked for her dancing place.

855
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
But I couldn't find her.

856
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,840
Did you pre-set this video?

857
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,240
Or her account was hacked?

858
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
I can't be fooled by this video.

859
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Is it worth it?

860
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Will she let me stay?

861
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
Take your time.

862
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
I'll go get some coffee.

863
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I'll get you a cup.

864
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Coffee.

865
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
There's something wrong with this video.

866
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
What's wrong?

867
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,120
My daughter has a red fetus in her waist.

868
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Look, she doesn't have it.

869
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
This is made by A.I.

870
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
For Everlab's founder, Dong Gui Cheng,

871
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
we're holding a press conference.

872
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I have something to say.

873
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I hope you can help us.

874
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Help me get her out.

875
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
I really suspect that she might have a hidden agenda.

876
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
Didn't I say I'd come back to pack my luggage?

877
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,120
I rented a place with a friend.

878
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
I plan to move out.

879
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,120
She wants a father, not a guardian.

880
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,120
Giving her money doesn't mean giving her a discount.

881
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
Hello.

882
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Are you Mr. Liu Yufan?

883
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Anyone who wants to plot against me,

884
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
listen to me carefully.

885
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
This is my last warning.

886
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,120
I swear I'll do everything I can to find you.

887
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Have you been changed?

888
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:44,120
Who is the one in the mirror who is changing with the rain?

889
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Do you still feel ashamed

890
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,120
when you're not by my side?

891
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,120
It's more obvious

892
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,120
when you're not by my side.

893
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,120
The leaves falling down

894
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,120
are also tired of being crazy.

895
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Don't chase after the perfect world.

896
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Who can take me away?

897
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Who is at the far end of the world?

898
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Who can exchange hands with me?

899
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Is there anyone

900
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,120
who can guard the world for me?

901
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,120
I don't need too many reasons.

902
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Light up the fire in the dark.

903
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,120
I won't back down.

904
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:05,120
I'll be fine if you're by my side.

905
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Until the end.

906
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Do you still feel ashamed

907
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,120
when you're not by my side?

908
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,120
It's more obvious

909
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,120
when you're not by my side.

910
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,120
The leaves falling down

911
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,120
are also tired of being crazy.

912
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Don't chase after the perfect world.

913
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Who can take me away?

914
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,120
Who is at the far end of the world?

915
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,120
Who can exchange hands with me?

916
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
Is there anyone

917
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,120
who can guard the world for me?

918
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,120
I don't need too many reasons.

919
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Light up the fire in the dark.

920
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,120
I won't back down.

921
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I'll be fine if you're by my side.

922
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Until the end.

923
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Do you still feel ashamed

924
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,120
when you're not by my side?

925
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,120
It's more obvious

926
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,120
when you're not by my side.

927
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Don't chase after the perfect world.

928
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,120
Until the end.

929
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Who can take me away?

930
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Who is at the far end of the world?

931
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Who can exchange hands with me?

932
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Is there anyone

933
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,120
who can guard the world for me?

934
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
I don't need too many reasons.

935
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,120
Light up the fire in the dark.

936
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,120
I won't back down.

937
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,120
I'll be fine if you're by my side.

938
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
Until the end.

939
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,120
I won't back down.

940
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,120
I'll be fine if you're by my side.

941
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Until the end.

942
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,120
I won't back down.

943
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I'll be fine if you're by my side.
