1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, I'm going to find my daughter publicly.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to reward her with 300 million yuan.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Whoever finds my daughter, I'll give her 300 million yuan.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Mr. Dong!

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Someone called to look for you. He said he must let you borrow it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
I love you.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Miss!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A few days ago, there was an accident.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,500
We discovered a kidney and a batch of anti-migraine drugs for organ transplant patients.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
This is a drug from the Poisonous Medicine Department.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
It's not allowed to enter the capital.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,500
This is the list of the officers who were on duty that day.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
They are Chen Jingyi, Zhang Zonghan, and Huang Junxing.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You mean these three people have the chance to take advantage of it

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and let that drug enter the capital on purpose?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Yes.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,460
The

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
The

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
The

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
The

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
The

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
The

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
The

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
The

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
The

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
The

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
The

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
The

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
The

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
The

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
The

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
The

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
The

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
The

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
The

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
The

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
The

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
The

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
The

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
The

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
The

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
The

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
The

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
The

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
The

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
The

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
The

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
The

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
The

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
The

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
The

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
The

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
To be honest, Dong Xinyu must know something.

54
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
I really have to ask him.

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Wait.

56
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,340
The bodyguard is watching us.

57
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
How can you get close to him?

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,140
Calm down.

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,060
You told me to calm down.

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,820
How can I calm down?

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,700
My daughter is missing.

62
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,740
Can you understand?

63
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,660
I'm not you.

64
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,820
I can't understand your feelings.

65
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Actually,

66
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,620
I had a chance

67
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,620
to be a father.

68
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,220
It's a pity.

69
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,020
So I understand.

70
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,420
A father

71
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,380
is not in the mood of a child.

72
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,540
I can't calm down.

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Dong Guicheng

74
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
seems to know

75
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,340
that his daughter

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,540
will come back.

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,140
Even blind people can see it.

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,860
He is dark and doesn't chase after alcohol.

79
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,700
He must have used the 300 million

80
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,580
to save his daughter.

81
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,700
It's possible.

82
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,580
I'll go back to the police station

83
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,220
and check his surveillance record.

84
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,660
See if there are any clues.

85
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
Who is the person who gave the 300 million?

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,620
Then we can find Anni.

87
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,660
You

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,260
go home and wait for my news.

89
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,380
Don't go to find his daughter.

90
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,740
Otherwise, Dong Guicheng

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,980
will apply for a temporary ban.

92
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,620
It's harder for you to see his daughter.

93
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,500
Go.

94
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,660
The 300 million girl has come back.

95
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,500
But

96
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,660
who caught her

97
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,820
and where did she go

98
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,100
and how did she come back

99
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
is unknown.

100
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,900
Now

101
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,140
we have to find Liu Huilin.

102
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,700
We can only rely on him.

103
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,460
Mr. Zhu

104
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
I took the nearby

105
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,220
B Road TV records back to check.

106
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,820
Good.

107
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,700
But not enough.

108
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,740
A Bang

109
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,980
You and Black Bull

110
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,020
go find

111
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
the place of Dong Xin Yue

112
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,780
and see what the surveillance and driving records

113
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,620
have taken.

114
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,540
Qiang

115
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,540
You and Lin

116
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,940
go to the hospital to monitor Dong Xin Yue.

117
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,940
When he is discharged,

118
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,700
immediately inform me.

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,620
Yes, sir.

120
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,380
Zhu Zai

121
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,220
Tianan

122
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,380
You listen to the surveillance records

123
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,380
of Dong Guicheng.

124
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,900
See if there are any suspicious calls

125
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,540
to call him.

126
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,220
Yes, sir.

127
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,100
Any questions?

128
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,020
Yes, sir.

129
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,140
But I have a question.

130
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,220
How long are you late today?

131
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,260
Fifteen minutes, sir.

132
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,940
But I can explain.

133
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,660
I don't want to hear.

134
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,460
Mr. Zhou

135
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,340
He won't dare to do it again.

136
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,460
Help me.

137
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,180
What's wrong?

138
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,940
Pay the money.

139
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,460
What money, sir?

140
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,260
Didn't you say it last time?

141
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,380
The first five minutes of being late

142
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,660
will be 20 yuan.

143
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Then add 10 yuan every minute.

144
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,020
I will give you

145
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,860
as much as you give.

146
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,860
Okay, how much?

147
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,900
Fifteen minutes.

148
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,540
120 yuan.

149
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,620
120 yuan.

150
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,540
Hurry up.

151
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,260
Hurry up.

152
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,060
Pay the money.

153
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,580
Not bad.

154
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,900
Sir.

155
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,980
Sir.

156
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,100
Easy.

157
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,780
It's so hot.

158
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,140
What's the happy thing?

159
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,500
Zhou said that the box was full.

160
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,340
He went to eat hot pot.

161
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,900
You have to count me.

162
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,900
I haven't eaten hot pot with Zhou.

163
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,260
You come to my office.

164
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,860
I have something to ask you.

165
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,660
Yes, sir.

166
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,740
I will ask him to fill the box.

167
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,300
You are late.

168
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,860
Stop it.

169
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,580
Eat more hot pot.

170
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,740
Stop talking. No one will take you seriously.

171
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,060
He supports you.

172
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,500
You did well just now.

173
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,700
Those guys are going to be popular.

174
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
So they will work harder.

175
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,140
Our police team is a team cooperation.

176
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,500
We need to help each other.

177
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
We need to make up for shortcomings.

178
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,220
Yes, sir.

179
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,340
Are you still investigating

180
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,460
Dong Xin Yue's case?

181
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,140
Yes.

182
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,620
There are many doubts about this case.

183
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,740
It's still not clear.

184
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,980
It's not that simple.

185
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,980
Don't investigate anymore.

186
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,620
Just solve the case.

187
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,220
Dong Gui Cheng came to solve the case?

188
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,020
The more he doesn't want us to investigate,

189
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,260
the more he has a hidden secret.

190
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,980
His daughter must have clues.

191
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,540
But his daughter

192
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,300
is the victim of this case.

193
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,060
What about the other victim?

194
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,060
Dong Xin Yue and Liu Hui Ling are acquaintances.

195
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,780
They all disappeared in the same time.

196
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
When Dong Xin Yue came back,

197
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,740
she was wearing Liu Hui Ling's clothes.

198
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,660
If you can ask Dong Xin Yue...

199
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,660
I know you went to the hospital last night

200
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
to find Dong Xin Yue.

201
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,460
Now Dong Gui Cheng

202
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,020
is suing you for harassing his daughter.

203
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I didn't do anything wrong.

204
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,420
Listen to me.

205
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,220
Since these cases have been cancelled,

206
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,540
don't harass him anymore.

207
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,060
Otherwise,

208
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,620
I can't keep you.

209
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,660
His situation is stable.

210
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,780
You go over there with me to handle the paperwork.

211
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Okay.

212
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,620
Got it.

213
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,660
Hold it.

214
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,200
Shan Xichao!

215
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm sorry.

216
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,480
As for the other missing people,

217
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,480
leave it to the missing people group.

218
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
You have a lot of things to do.

219
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Marco, Jenny.

220
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
You go to investigate

221
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Zhang Zonghan, Huang Junxin,

222
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
Chen Jingyi's financial situation.

223
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,280
Angus,

224
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,080
check their social accounts

225
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
and see if there are any suspicious places.

226
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,800
The others will follow them separately.

227
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,920
See who they're in contact with.

228
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
And their daily life.

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
I've been following Chen Jingyi, Zhang Zonghan,

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
and Huang Junxin for a few days.

231
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
Except for going to work,

232
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't go to play or work out.

233
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Nothing special for now.

234
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,240
I go to the cafe upstairs

235
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,080
to drink something.

236
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
I also go to the bank

237
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,080
to get their financial reports.

238
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
All of them are clean.

239
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,480
No debt.

240
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
Check their social media.

241
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
They usually send some photos of

242
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
friends or sports.

243
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Except for the personal account of Huang Junxin.

244
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I can't see his account.

245
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
Life is normal, no debt.

246
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,640
But there's nothing.

247
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,560
We need to think of another way.

248
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
Zhenni,

249
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,960
have you been an undercover agent?

250
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
This batch of goods is here.

251
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,200
Please come in.

252
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,560
Introduce yourself.

253
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Let me introduce.

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
This is your master,

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,640
Let me introduce to you.

256
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
This is Zhang Lili, a new colleague.

257
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
She is here for the airport class today.

258
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,400
Please give us your guidance.

259
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm the CI Huang Junxin here.

260
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,480
Just call me David.

261
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,400
Hello, David.

262
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,960
Hello, I'm CI too.

263
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,360
Zhang Zonghan.

264
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,480
Hello.

265
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
This is another CI, Chen Jingyi.

266
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,960
Hello.

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,120
Then you will go to the customs with David today.

268
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,440
You take him.

269
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,920
Okay.

270
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,760
Yes, madam.

271
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,600
Maybe that way.

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,280
Okay.

273
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,040
Today,

274
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,400
you are lucky to be working on the first day.

275
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,000
Follow me.

276
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,800
Just relax a little bit.

277
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,080
That woman is not well.

278
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,560
She has no friends here.

279
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,920
Don't bother to stay away from her.

280
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
What's wrong with her?

281
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
You'll know when you stay here for a long time.

282
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
Anyway, if you have any problems,

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,000
just come to me.

284
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,280
Let's go to the customs.

285
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,960
Excuse me.

286
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:30,640
A piece of soft-c Pi

287
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,920
Please.

288
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
It's not a problem if the goods that are not displayed on the screen are marked in orange.

289
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
You can take them out.

290
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Do you understand?

291
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Oh, I understand.

292
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I don't think I've invited you to eat a free meal yet.

293
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I've checked the schedule. It seems that you're moving out early tomorrow.

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Oh, right.

295
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
But I've already made an appointment with someone.

296
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm going to the office.

297
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I'll be waiting for you.

298
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I'll be waiting for you.

299
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
But I've already made an appointment with someone.

300
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Next time, I'll treat everyone to a meal.

301
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,920
That's fine. The most important thing is that you're willing to come.

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Because you're the female lead.

303
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
I'll go get the next batch of orders, okay?

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Okay. Go get them in my office.

305
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Okay.

306
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Okay.

307
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Okay.

308
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
There's nothing wrong with these two. No need to check.

309
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Okay.

310
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
This is from Malaysia. Check it.

311
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Okay.

312
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Mr. Huang.

313
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Yes.

314
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
This shipment is from Mexico. No need to check.

315
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
There's nothing wrong with this shipment.

316
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Is it from Taquila?

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
But recently, there are many smuggled goods that are from Mexico.

318
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Why don't you check it for safety reasons?

319
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Just because it's from Mexico,

320
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
you think there's something wrong with this shipment?

321
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
It's just that the shipping of the goods is usually long.

322
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I don't think it's very compatible with the economic benefits.

323
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
So I think there's something wrong.

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Do you know how many shipments are handled by our department every day?

325
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
100,000.

326
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,920
If every shipment is checked from Mexico and Brazil,

327
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
then how long will the inspection process take?

328
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
What if these goods are exposed to the warehouse?

329
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
You just joined the team, so many things are not clear.

330
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I can understand.

331
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
But the goods just now are indeed fine.

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
I know this will take a lot of time.

333
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,920
But it doesn't mean we can ignore the suspicious goods.

334
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
It's the customs officer's responsibility to guard the port.

335
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
If the goods with problems are left out of the market,

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
who will be responsible?

337
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Okay.

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Since you insist on not believing my judgment,

339
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
then there's no need to go through the machine.

340
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Just open the box and check it.

341
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
San.

342
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Go do your work first.

343
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Okay.

344
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
The source of the suspicious goods

345
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
doesn't mean that the goods are problematic.

346
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Its receiving address is Jiujiao.

347
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Jiujiao.

348
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Of course, 100 is enough.

349
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
And they are all expensive wine.

350
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
How can you buy so much?

351
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Now they are all opened.

352
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
We have to write a report.

353
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
We have to inform the shipping and receiving people.

354
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Explain to them why we have to open the box and check.

355
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
If there is anything wrong with the goods,

356
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
we will take responsibility at any time.

357
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Before you get off work today,

358
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
remember to put the report on my desk.

359
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Yes, sir.

360
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Don't follow the rules.

361
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
The rules are the dead, the living.

362
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
You have to learn to change the rules.

363
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Hurry up and find someone to help you pack up.

364
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Miss, are you alone?

365
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Sit down.

366
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
How is it? Are you used to it?

367
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
If I'm not used to it,

368
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
can I leave in advance?

369
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
You found it earlier, so you left earlier.

370
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
So how are you now?

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
How is your progress?

372
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Although David is a little bit of a pervert,

373
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
but I've been working with him for a while.

374
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I think there's nothing suspicious for now.

375
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
A'Pou is waiting for her to go to the night shift next week

376
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
to have a chance to contact me.

377
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
But I've checked the time table for the past half year.

378
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Since A'Pou transferred to the customs airport department,

379
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
she often finds a chance to take a vacation with David.

380
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
What's so strange about taking a vacation together?

381
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Aren't they in the same period?

382
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Just because they're not in the same period.

383
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
They were in a hurry to get promoted together.

384
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
So they won't be together.

385
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
But recently,

386
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
they've joined the customs online ball party together.

387
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Any news about A'Pou?

388
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
If you have any news, let me know.

389
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Your Americano.

390
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Thank you.

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
How is it?

392
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
How's your progress in the airport department?

393
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
There's no progress for now.

394
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,920
There's nothing special about the work of the three suspects.

395
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
What about personal life?

396
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Chen Jingyi has just married.

397
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Her husband is a senior director at the immigration office.

398
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
The couple usually don't have any special hobbies.

399
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
So I think she has the least suspicion.

400
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Huang Junxing and Zhang Zonghan

401
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
have a normal relationship.

402
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
But the two of them are not close.

403
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
I think the relationship between them is normal.

404
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
They were both in a hurry to get promoted.

405
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
But they've become good friends in the past half year.

406
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
They often take a vacation together.

407
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
And they often play the ball in the same online ball party.

408
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Take a vacation together and play the ball together.

409
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I think we can use this to get close to them.

410
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
To investigate their private life.

411
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I think so too.

412
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
If I join that online ball party,

413
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I might find out about them.

414
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Okay, I'll arrange for you to join that online ball party.

415
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Remember, if they really have corruption,

416
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
it has something to do with the black market.

417
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Then it's a bit dangerous.

418
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Be careful.

419
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
If you have any questions, just tell me.

420
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
We'll end the operation immediately.

421
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Safety is the most important thing.

422
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Yes, sir.

423
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
This wound is fatal.

424
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
It's caused by the gas.

425
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
This is caused by a 8cm long knife.

426
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
From right to top,

427
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
the left and right meridians are cut off.

428
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
The murderer accurately avoided the bone.

429
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
It was a smooth knife.

430
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
It caused a lot of blood to be spilled.

431
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
And the victim lost too much blood.

432
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Also, on the victim's body,

433
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
there are no other wounds and bruises.

434
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,920
It shows that the victim didn't do anything to resist before he died.

435
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
The murderer is most likely to have a sneak attack from behind.

436
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
The knife marks are effective.

437
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
In this way, the murderer is more dangerous than Vicky.

438
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
That's right.

439
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
From the horizontal surface of the knife,

440
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
the murderer is shorter than the victim.

441
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,920
So the wound is cut off.

442
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
If the wound is from right to left,

443
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,920
and attacked from behind,

444
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
the murderer is likely to be the left side.

445
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
The victim also has a very strange place.

446
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
He had a heart transplant surgery.

447
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
The medical report only wrote that he had a heart disease.

448
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
He never had a transplant surgery.

449
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
So I took his heart to do a heart transplant.

450
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I found that the DNA of this heart is different from the victim's.

451
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
It should have been replaced in recent years.

452
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
There is no official report.

453
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
The heart is not his.

454
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
It is clear that this heart was bought from the black market for illegal transplant.

455
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
What about the time of death?

456
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
According to the judgment, he has been dead for three days.

457
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Dong Xin Yue came back the day before yesterday.

458
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
That means,

459
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,920
he was killed before Dong Xin Yue came back.

460
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
I checked Ricky's entry and exit records.

461
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
He hasn't left Hong Kong in the past five years.

462
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
He found a kidney in the previous traffic accident.

463
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Now he found a heart in the body.

464
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Why are these human organs so easy to buy in Hong Kong?

465
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Ricky can change his heart without going out of the city.

466
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Is there really an illegal organ in Hong Kong?

467
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
To do a surgery for people?

468
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Where did these organs come from?

469
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Hong Kong people are so dense.

470
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Someone is missing.

471
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Someone must have called the police.

472
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
The police don't know.

473
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Do you know that there are at least two thousand missing cases in Hong Kong every year?

474
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Even though 95% of them can be found,

475
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
there are still 5% that can't be found.

476
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
There are still more than 100 people.

477
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
It's not like there are no police.

478
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
If there are no police, no one will investigate.

479
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
No one knows whether he is alive or dead.

480
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,920
This Ricky is the person in charge of the Flying Entertainment Company.

481
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Liu Hui Ling and Dong Xin Yue

482
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
disappeared after their training in his company.

483
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Now Dong Xin Yue is back.

484
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Ricky was murdered.

485
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
They are definitely related in the timeline.

486
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Only Liu Hui Ling hasn't been found yet.

487
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
If we investigate Ricky's case more,

488
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
we might be able to find him.

489
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Yes.

490
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Ricky is the key.

491
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Xiao Lin,

492
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
take Ricky's heart DNA

493
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
and compare it in the database.

494
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
See if it's compatible.

495
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Yes, sir.

496
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
It's the heart and kidney.

497
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I suspect that there is really a large-scale

498
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
and systematic organ sales group in Hong Kong.

499
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
And Ricky may be involved.

500
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,920
If Ricky and Guang Ge are the same person,

501
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
and the killer is the person wearing the ancestral talisman,

502
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
then the ancestral talisman

503
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,920
is either useful or clean the door.

504
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Sir,

505
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
these are all speculations.

506
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Where should we start?

507
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
When a kidney is removed,

508
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
it means that a doctor who does the operation is needed.

509
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Help me investigate

510
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,920
the doctors who did the transplant surgery in Hong Kong.

511
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
See who asked for leave that day

512
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
or didn't have to work.

513
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
There is a case of illegal organ transplant.

514
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I want to invite you to the police station to help investigate.

515
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
We estimate that the operation will be carried out on the 27th.

516
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
We have a reason to believe

517
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
that the doctor of the Hong Kong Shenzang department is involved.

518
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Do you know how much a specialist doctor's salary is?

519
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
How much is the time?

520
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I spent two hours on you.

521
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Do you know how many patients are waiting for me in the hospital?

522
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Do you know that it takes at least 12 years

523
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
to become a specialist doctor?

524
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Do you think that a professional doctor

525
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
will risk the risk of transferring the license

526
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
for the black market surgery fee?

527
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Do you police know

528
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,920
how complicated a organ transplant surgery is?

529
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
How long does the doctor have to spend

530
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
to follow the patient's case before the operation?

531
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Mr. Zeng Xing Shu,

532
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
we are the central case team of the Hong Kong island.

533
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Sir,

534
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
that day my wife and I went to the Dongjing fast mountain.

535
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
If you don't believe me,

536
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
you can check the record of the airline.

537
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
It is absolutely impossible for us

538
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
to take a day off

539
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
and go to the black market for the surgery.

540
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
We have interviewed so many doctors.

541
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
They should be complained by the hospital soon.

542
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
It doesn't matter.

543
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
The most important thing is that there is progress.

544
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
What progress?

545
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,920
We have invited so many doctors to come to ask questions.

546
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
They are all doctors with the right to the surgery.

547
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
They all have a big temper.

548
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Only one doctor

549
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
is very cooperative and polite.

550
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Dr. Zeng?

551
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
And

552
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
look at his statement.

553
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
He said that he and his wife went to the Dongjing fast mountain

554
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
for two days and one night.

555
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
And he said that he had planned this trip for a long time.

556
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Is it fast mountain or long-term plan?

557
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Isn't it a conflict of front and back?

558
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It seems that we are going to work overtime.

559
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Follow them.

560
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
OK.

561
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Drink some water first.

562
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
It's so hot.

563
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes, it's more than thirty degrees, brother.

564
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Lily.

565
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Huang Se, Zhang Se, what a coincidence.

566
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Just call me David.

567
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
It's not working.

568
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Let me introduce to you.

569
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
This is the new member of the airport department.

570
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Zhang Lily.

571
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Hello.

572
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Hello.

573
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Let's go to play the ball first.

574
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
We are quite fated.

575
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
We are in the same team and like to play tennis.

576
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I used to play a lot.

577
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
But after work, I don't have much time.

578
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I saw that there was a tennis meeting at the customs.

579
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
I plan to come and see it.

580
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
So busy.

581
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Which district did you go before?

582
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Luo Hu.

583
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Then you should know Ma Se.

584
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
How is he recently?

585
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Is he still not good at it?

586
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Ma Se is Ma Zheng Hui?

587
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yes.

588
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
You must remember it wrong.

589
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Ma Se is the leader of Luo Hu's leader.

590
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Zhu Sen.

591
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
You are so ugly again.

592
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Lily is like this.

593
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Hurry up.

594
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Let's play the ball.

595
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
OK.

596
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
You guys should let me play.

597
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
I haven't played for a long time.

598
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Relax.

599
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Don't be afraid.

600
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Don't be afraid.

601
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I'm here.

602
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Come.

603
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
What a shame.

604
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
You are pretty good.

605
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
You guys let me play.

606
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Let's play the ball together next time.

607
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
OK.

608
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,320
It's good to be serious.

609
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,920
But sometimes, you have to relax.

610
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,720
I think highly of you.

611
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,120
Thank you.

612
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Last time, you said we can eat together. Are you free tonight?

613
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,320
Let's eat together.

614
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,520
Tonight... no.

615
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,920
Next time.

616
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
Bye bye.

617
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,120
See you next time.

618
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,320
See you next time.

619
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Bye bye.

620
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
You...

621
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,120
Hello, Gao Si Er.

622
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,320
I didn't receive your message. Are you okay?

623
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,720
I've been following David and the others.

624
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
We're now at a commercial building in Guan Tang.

625
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Where?

626
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
I'll send it to you right now.

627
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
I plan to follow them in and see what they're doing.

628
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Don't come here. Wait for help.

629
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
If I wait any longer, they'll leave.

630
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,720
I didn't check it carefully. I don't know the situation inside. It's very dangerous.

631
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
I'll come over as soon as possible. Wait for me.

632
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,720
Don't worry. I'll keep in touch with you.

633
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,520
Hey, don't come here.

634
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Bye bye.

635
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
Hey!

636
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
They're here.

637
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
Hurry up. Go that way.

638
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,120
Hello.

639
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,520
It's been a long time.

640
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
Follow them.

641
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
Are they here?

642
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Your phone and watch.

643
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,720
When you go up, be more smart.

644
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,320
Don't make noise. Don't talk.

645
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,820
I'll teach you how to talk.

646
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,520
Do you understand?

647
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,520
Sorry, handsome. I was late for a while.

648
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Put your phone and watch in.

649
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,120
Remember when you go up.

650
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Don't make noise. Don't talk.

651
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,920
I'll teach you how to talk. Do you understand?

652
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Or I won't teach you next time. Let's go.

653
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Hurry up.

654
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,920
Bring it up.

655
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,120
Hurry up.

656
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
Everyone, hurry up and change your clothes.

657
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Do you understand?

658
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,320
Hurry up.

659
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,320
It's the first time.

660
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,920
The guests here are much more expensive.

661
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,720
Do you come often?

662
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,920
No.

663
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,120
I come when I have work.

664
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,720
I go to other places.

665
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
He...

666
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Jackson!

667
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,360
Come in.

668
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm looking for you.

669
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,600
You're still chatting here.

670
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,680
Hurry up.

671
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Cheers.

672
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,080
This is the last time I'm here for free.

673
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,640
Do you want to help them?

674
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
They were caught so hard recently.

675
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,280
Forget it.

676
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
Maybe they will be caught earlier.

677
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
I still have a wife and a child.

678
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,080
That's true.

679
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,320
The last batch of goods

680
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
will be delivered to them.

681
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,040
That's right.

682
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Hi.

683
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
You're here.

684
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,720
I'm Jiaqi.

685
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm Bo Bo.

686
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Bo Bo.

687
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,720
You're really Bo Bo.

688
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,520
Come on.

689
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,520
Why are you still standing here?

690
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
Go and greet the guests.

691
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,720
I suddenly feel a stomachache.

692
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,440
Where's the bathroom?

693
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,640
You're here for a leave, right?

694
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
If you're here, I'll let you go.

695
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,640
No.

696
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm really in a hurry.

697
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,640
The bathroom is over there.

698
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,440
It's troublesome.

699
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,040
Thank you.

700
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,840
Hello, Gao Sir.

701
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,840
You're up there.

702
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,640
Didn't I tell you to wait for the staff?

703
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm almost there.

704
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,760
I can't wait.

705
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm already in the club.

706
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Oh, no.

707
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
It's Huang Junxin.

708
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,640
I want to drink.

709
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:27,720
Watching and

710
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Let go of me!

711
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Let go of me!

712
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
Let go...

713
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Don't move!

714
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Don't move!

715
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Let go of me!

716
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Don't move!

717
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Don't move!

718
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Shut up!

719
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Stop playing.

720
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Let's see what happens.

721
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Let's go.

722
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
What should we do?

723
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Can we go now?

724
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Enough.

725
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Follow me.

726
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Everyone, be careful.

727
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Don't be afraid.

728
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Follow one by one.

729
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes.

730
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Be careful.

731
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Don't rush.

732
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Follow one by one.

733
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Yes.

734
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Be careful.

735
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Follow one by one.

736
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Yes.

737
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Jenny.

738
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Jenny.

739
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Jenny.

740
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Jenny.

741
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
It's me.

742
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
It's me.

743
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Gao Zi.

744
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Gao Zi.

745
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
Gao Zi, it's me.

746
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
It's me.

747
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
It's okay.

748
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
It's okay.

749
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
It's okay, Jenny.

750
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
It's okay.

751
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
It's okay.

752
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Hurry up.

753
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Hurry up.

754
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
This way.

755
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Follow one by one.

756
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Follow one by one.

757
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Hurry up.

758
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Hurry up.

759
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Thank you.

760
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I said,

761
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
wait for Zhiyuan to act.

762
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Why didn't you listen to me?

763
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Luckily, I was in a hurry.

764
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Otherwise,

765
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I will report this to the superior.

766
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
You are too reckless.

767
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Okay.

768
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
If I didn't come here,

769
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
how could I catch so many people?

770
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
How is it?

771
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Do you want me to drive you home?

772
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Go home?

773
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I have a lot to do later.

774
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Stop it.

775
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Don't shoot.

776
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I have already done it.

777
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Go back and think about

778
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
how to explain to the boss.

779
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Stop shooting.

780
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Go inside.

781
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Who told you to let these drugs in?

782
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Did you take the bribe from the club?

783
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,720
I took the bribe from the club as a benefit.

784
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
As a colleague of the company,

785
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I really don't know what you are talking about.

786
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Why did you enter

787
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
the club of Wonderland?

788
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
We just wanted to have a

789
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
casual activity after work.

790
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Do you know that

791
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
this club is illegal?

792
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
We don't know it is illegal.

793
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I always thought it was a

794
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
horror club or something.

795
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
You have no evidence in ICAC.

796
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Don't talk nonsense.

797
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I found two things in your wallet.

798
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Wonderland meeting card

799
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
and a pack of drugs.

800
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,720
The change is a drug.

801
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
So what?

802
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Nothing.

803
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
After this matter is exposed,

804
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
it should be difficult for you

805
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
to keep your job.

806
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Even if we can't sue you for bribery,

807
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
the police will continue to follow up.

808
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
If you are sued by a few public officials

809
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
for misconduct,

810
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
you will be sentenced to death.

811
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
You seem to have a girl

812
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
who just came into your life.

813
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
I think it's hard for you to see her.

814
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
You may learn to walk or

815
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
call you dad.

816
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Your job will be gone.

817
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
But if you are willing to be a witness,

818
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
we will discuss with the law firm.

819
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
We won't give you too many evidences.

820
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
At most, you will be sentenced to one year in prison.

821
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Plus, if your holiday and behavior are good,

822
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
you won't be in jail for long.

823
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
After you come out,

824
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
find a job and start a new life.

825
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I haven't done it.

826
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Why should I be the one to admit my crime?

827
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Huang Junxin and Zhang Zonghan

828
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
have been protecting each other.

829
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It's not easy for them to

830
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
point at each other.

831
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Sometimes, we can only be united

832
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
when we have interests.

833
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
But when our interests

834
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
start to conflict,

835
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
that's not what we are talking about.

836
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Our colleague

837
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
is next door to Zhang Zonghan.

838
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
We gave him a good suggestion.

839
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I don't know if he will

840
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
be as persistent as you.

841
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm a little worried about him.

842
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
If he accidentally

843
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,720
puts all the blame on you,

844
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,720
you will be the only one

845
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
to take the blame.

846
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
At that time,

847
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I'm afraid you won't be able to

848
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
attend your daughter's graduation.

849
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
If you are willing to be a witness,

850
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
we will discuss with the law firm

851
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
and let you be a witness.

852
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Of course, you can continue to be silent.

853
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
But my colleague just told me

854
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
that David has already

855
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
made a deal with us.

856
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Okay.

857
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I want to be the witness.

858
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Mr. Huang Junxing,

859
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
please explain to me

860
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
how you and Zhang Zonghan

861
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
participated in this corruption.

862
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
We collected the letters

863
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
and helped each other

864
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
to release some drugs

865
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
and enter Hong Kong.

866
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
What happened after that?

867
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Soon after,

868
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
I received a letter

869
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
that said that

870
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
we were secretly taking pictures

871
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
of us and the girl

872
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
going to bed.

873
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
The girl threatened us

874
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
to help her.

875
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Why would a video

876
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
threaten you

877
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
to commit a crime?

878
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Why didn't you call the police?

879
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Because the girl is still young.

880
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
So we had no choice.

881
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
We could only listen to her.

882
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Who is that person?

883
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
I don't know.

884
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
We never knew

885
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
his identity.

886
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
What did they ask you to do?

887
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
They asked me to help them.

888
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
What did they ask you to do?

889
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
What did they ask you to do?

890
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
They asked us to release

891
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
a batch of drugs

892
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
from the airport.

893
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
The drugs were hidden in the plate.

894
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
They also said that

895
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
if we helped them,

896
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
they would continue to give us

897
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
the bribery of the Wanderland.

898
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
How did you communicate?

899
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
How did you know

900
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
which batch of drugs to release?

901
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Before every action,

902
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
they would send us

903
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
a mysterious package.

904
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
There would be a second-generation phone

905
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
with a spare card.

906
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Then they would

907
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
send us a message

908
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
and tell us

909
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
which of their goods they were.

910
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
When it's time to move,

911
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
we would be prepared.

912
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Where did the last batch of goods go?

913
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
I never asked.

914
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
We are not responsible for it.

915
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
It's safer to know less.

916
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Where is that phone?

917
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Why didn't you hand it over?

918
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
It's lost every time.

919
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
It's broken and

920
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
can't be found in the sea.

921
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Shousa.

922
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
The report is out.

923
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
He must die.

924
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
He didn't offend me.

925
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
It only affected everyone.

926
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Rules are rules.

927
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Mr. Liu,

928
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Dong Guicheng sent someone

929
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
to send you a letter.

930
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Dong Guicheng?

931
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
We won't see each other in the future.

932
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
I know you like to drink Taki.

933
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
I especially found someone

934
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
from Mexico to bring it to you.

935
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
That means

936
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
you know my daughter's whereabouts.

937
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
In the past ten years,

938
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
which day

939
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
didn't ICAC

940
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
or the police

941
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
keep an eye on me?

942
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Don't worry.

943
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Anyway, tomorrow,

944
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
the sun will rise from the east.

945
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Is there any remorse?

946
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,720
The season without you

947
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
is more obvious.

948
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,720
The fallen leaves

949
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,720
are as tired as the wind.

950
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Tired of chasing,

951
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,720
chasing a perfect world.

952
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Who can take me away?

953
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Who is at the far end?

954
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Who will fight with me for the world?

955
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Is there anyone

956
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
who can protect me?

957
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
I don't need too many reasons.

958
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
In the dark,

959
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
the fireflies

960
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,720
are burning.

961
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
If you are

962
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,720
always by my side,

963
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,720
until the end,

964
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I will be there.

965
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Is there any remorse?

966
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,720
The season without you

967
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
is more obvious.

968
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,720
The fallen leaves

969
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,720
are as tired as the wind.

970
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Tired of chasing,

971
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,720
chasing a perfect world.

972
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Who can take me away?

973
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Who is at the far end?

974
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Who will fight with me for the world?

975
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Is there anyone

976
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
who can protect me?

977
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I don't need too many reasons.

978
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
In the dark,

979
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
the fireflies

980
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
are burning.

981
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
If you are

982
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
always by my side,

983
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
until the end,

984
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I will be there.

985
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
Is there anyone

986
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
who can protect me?

987
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
I don't need too many reasons.

988
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
In the dark,

989
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
the fireflies

990
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
are burning.

991
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Tired of chasing,

992
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,720
chasing a perfect world.

993
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Is there anyone

994
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
who can protect me?

995
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Is there anyone

996
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720

In the dark,

999
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
the fireflies

1000
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
are burning.

1001
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
If you are

I don't need too many reasons.

1008
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
In the dark,

1009
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
the fireflies

1010
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
are burning.

1011
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Tired of chasing,

1012
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
chasing a perfect world.
