1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Why are you still here? Why don't you leave?

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,400
I'm here to save you.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Let me out.

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
I want to find my husband.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,600
I'm not leaving.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
My husband is still here.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
I want to find him.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,200
What will you do after you save him?

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,600
He will die a worse death if he is caught back.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
I just know that his husband is waiting for him.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,400
A Qiang, wait.

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
Have you thought it through?

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
You said it, right?

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm a good person.

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
There is no heaven in this world.

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
There is no retribution. There is no evil.

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
For these scum,

18
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
you work for a lifetime.

19
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Do you think it's worth it?

20
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,600
I swear to God,

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
I will do nothing in my life,

22
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
until I kill them.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,800
The Long Ballad

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 15

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
This is Zhou Junjie.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
I can't answer your call now.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
Please leave a message.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I will reply as soon as possible.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Hello, Mr. Zhang, it's me.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I've been looking for Zhou.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I haven't found him for a long time.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
Can you contact him?

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Mr. Liu,

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Zhou has not answered the phone for a few days.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know where he is.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
Did something happen?

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
I think Zhou should be fine.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Don't worry.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Please, if you have any news,

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
please let me know.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Thank you.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, no problem.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Sister was suspended from work.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
She never came back.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
She didn't answer the phone.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
No one even cared about the dog.

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
I hope she won't have any accident.

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think she will do anything stupid.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
I just think about it.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I went to her house the day before yesterday.

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
She printed a little sea map.

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,400
She has persuaded many Hong Kong's oceanic materials.

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
That means

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
she will find her wife

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
even if she has to go to the sea.

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
By the way,

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
there is something

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I shouldn't tell you.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
But I always think

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
you need to know.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
I always thought

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Gong You Cheng's death was suspicious.

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Then

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
I followed her to look after Xu Jiaxin for a while.

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
Finally,

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I finally found Rachel.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Then I quarreled with Rachel

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
downstairs her house.

69
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
Then I went to her house.

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
What I want to say is

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
in her house,

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I found

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,200
the house has been filled with the past eight years.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
She planned to

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
take revenge on Gong You Cheng and her grandfather

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
after she went out.

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
You mean

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
she did the death of Gong You Cheng?

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not only her,

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
but a group of people

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
and a group of people led by her.

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Then

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
I went to the shadow seal shop before Xianyi.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,200
I also found

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
a lot of

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
fake documents of different people

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
and fake documents.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
What are you going to do?

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
What should I do?

90
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,200
Rachel,

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
I have collected evidence

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
that Dai Zu Fu committed crime in the sea.

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
It includes photos

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and some videos.

95
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,000
And the coordinates of the treasure in the sea.

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
I believe this time

97
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,600
I can definitely save Dai Zu Fu.

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Wait.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
If you go out now,

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
it's a dead end.

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Zhendong Yao.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Think about it.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
In this sea treasure,

104
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
the only place where it's safer

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
is here.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
This is the place

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
where the treasure is.

108
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
If you go out now,

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
it's a dead end.

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Zhendong Yao,

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I don't think you can go out.

112
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
But

113
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
the only place where it's safer

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
is here.

115
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
If you get caught,

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
you will be dead.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
You and your husband

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
have lost the treasure.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
If you die,

120
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
what about your husband?

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's me.

122
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Find me a person

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
called Lily.

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Here.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Take the medicine first.

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm fine.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm fine.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm fine.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm fine.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm fine.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm fine.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm fine.

133
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Take the medicine.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You'll be better soon.

135
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
What's the matter?

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
You're not the only one

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
suffering here.

138
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm fine.

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm fine.

140
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm fine.

141
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm fine.

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm fine.

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm fine.

144
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm fine.

145
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm fine.

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm fine.

147
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm fine.

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm fine.

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Godfather.

150
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
You ran away from a woman.

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
You've been looking for her for so long.

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
How can you be a leader?

153
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Sorry, Godfather.

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll take some people

155
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
to the platform and look for her again.

156
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Has anyone ever been in your room?

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sisi.

158
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Come.

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Actually,

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I have a son.

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
But he's very unfortunate.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
He's been sick

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
since he was a kid.

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
He's grown up

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
and is in the hospital.

166
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,800
He often goes out and plays outside.

167
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
I often think

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
that I'm not a good mother.

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
I gave birth to him.

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
I watched him suffer.

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Why?

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And now,

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,400
I have to help Dai.

174
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
He's worried every day.

175
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
Sometimes, I'm scared too.

176
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm afraid that I'll walk with him

177
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
and get caught suddenly.

178
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Then I can't

179
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
take care of him anymore

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
and see him again.

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
But you can choose

182
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
who to work with.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You expect this from this person.

184
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Madam.

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
You're wrong.

186
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Not everyone has a choice.

187
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Except me,

188
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
I have a good sister.

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
She's been a prostitute

190
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
for Qian Feng Group.

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
She's been doing it for eight years.

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Eight years.

193
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not easy to rebel against Dai Zufu.

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Is that person you're talking about

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Rui Chou?

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know Rui Chou like Rui Ya.

197
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
That means you know Rui Ya.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
You can save him.

199
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
I guess you must have seen him

200
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
being beaten to death for saving me.

201
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Why did you watch him die?

202
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Don't worry.

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Dai Zufu is the most worthy person.

204
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
I will avenge him.

205
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,800
I'll avenge Rui Ya too.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you can, call the police.

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,400
You can't do it alone.

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
It's too dangerous.

209
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I didn't think of going out

210
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
when I came here.

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Even if I call the police,

212
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
you and your husband

213
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
may not be able to escape.

214
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Just like what you said,

215
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm not a good person.

216
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Besides,

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
I have a mission.

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Xu Sisi.

219
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
I still carry the lives of

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
several good sisters.

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I can't go back

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
after I've gone this far.

223
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Let me out.

224
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Let me go.

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Xu Sisi.

227
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
We can't wait any longer.

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Where is Chu Wugui?

229
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
I can't let any of you

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
get hurt again.

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Where is Chu Wugui?

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Chu Wugui.

233
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,400

You can't go yet.

249
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
We still have runtime.

250
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
This crem Atlantica

251
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,200
is about to be successful.

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
The ceremony is results of

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
the ceremony today.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Are you ready?

255
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,040
Yes.

256
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,360
Do you need me to call the police?

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,040
No, thanks.

258
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Clean the toilet.

259
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Are you okay?

260
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Mr. Dai.

261
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Dai.

262
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,240
I didn't keep a close eye on Ah-Qiao.

263
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Come on.

264
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Get up first.

265
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Get up.

266
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Get up.

267
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Get up.

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Get up.

269
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Get up.

270
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Get up.

271
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Get up.

272
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Get up.

273
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Get up.

274
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Get up.

275
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Get up.

276
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Get up.

277
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Get up first.

278
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Get up.

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Sit down and talk slowly.

280
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Sit down.

281
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Come on.

282
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Sit down.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
I know

284
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
if I say it out,

285
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
it will hurt Ah-Qiao.

286
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
But I don't want to see him keep making mistakes.

287
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I hope after Mr. Dai hears it,

288
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
you won't blame him.

289
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Because he's a good person.

290
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Go on.

291
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,840
He hid He Tianru in his room.

292
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
He asked me to take good care of him.

293
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Tell him to come here.

294
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Yes.

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
What else do you know?

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
He said after He Tianru recovered,

297
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
he arranged for them to get off the boat.

298
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
You're so ungrateful.

299
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Mr. Dai.

300
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
How many years have you been with me?

301
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Seven years.

302
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,840
It doesn't matter if the little demon can't do something big.

303
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
But why can he be stupid?

304
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
He's so stupid to be betrayed by you.

305
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Godfather.

306
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Godfather.

307
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
What happened?

308
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Let her go, okay?

309
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Godfather.

310
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Are you okay?

311
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
You let this woman get close to you.

312
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
You don't even know what she did.

313
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What are you talking about, Godfather?

315
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
She had a plan.

316
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,840
She's going to unite with a woman called Li Yaowen.

317
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
They should be together.

318
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
She wants to kill us.

319
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
She wants to kill us.

320
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
She sent it out with your computer.

321
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Is it true?

322
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
You said I was watching you all day.

323
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
She's the one who really controls you.

324
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Is it true?

325
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Look for yourself.

326
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
There are many photos inside.

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Every one can kill us.

328
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Why do you do this?

329
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Why do you do this?

330
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Let me ask you.

331
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Do you still love this woman?

332
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Godfather.

333
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I beg you to let her go.

334
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
If you don't love her,

335
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I can let her play here.

336
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
If you love her,

337
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
you'll be killed by her sooner or later.

338
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
No, Godfather.

339
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
No.

340
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Kill her yourself.

341
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
No, Godfather.

342
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
No, Godfather.

343
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
No, Godfather.

344
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
I'll give you five minutes.

345
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
If you can't bear it,

346
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
I'll help you.

347
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Don't say that.

349
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
No.

350
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
No.

351
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
We have to find a way.

352
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
We have to find a way.

353
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
There must be a way.

354
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
We'll find a way.

355
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
We'll find a way.

356
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Wenqiang.

357
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Do you remember

358
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
what my future will be like

359
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
if you ask me?

360
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I remember.

361
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
What's wrong?

362
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I didn't answer you that day

363
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
because I used to think

364
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
my future

365
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
will only have Le Qiao.

366
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I promise you.

367
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
She promised.

368
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Did you hear that?

369
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Did you hear that?

370
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
She's willing to marry me.

371
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
She's willing to marry me.

372
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Congratulations.

373
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
She's willing to marry me.

374
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Congratulations.

375
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
You're so old-fashioned.

376
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm afraid you won't agree.

377
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Have you ever thought

378
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
what your future will be like?

379
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
What about you?

380
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
I never thought about it before.

381
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Because I think

382
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
everything was arranged by my godfather.

383
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I didn't have a chance

384
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
to make my own choice.

385
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
But now it's different.

386
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Since you appeared,

387
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I've wanted to

388
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
make my own choice.

389
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Actually, I know

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
you appeared because of my godfather.

391
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
I don't know

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
what he arranged for you to do

393
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
by my side.

394
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I don't want to know either.

395
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
During this period,

396
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I think our feelings are real.

397
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
So I really want

398
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
in your future,

399
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
and in my future,

400
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
there will be each other.

401
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
You may think

402
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I don't know

403
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
how long

404
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
our future will be.

405
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
But I think

406
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
as long as we can be together,

407
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
even every second

408
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
is important.

409
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Let me tell you something.

410
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I used to

411
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
dislike the rain.

412
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
But today, I think

413
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
it's beautiful

414
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
in the rain.

415
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Since I met you,

416
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I think everything has changed.

417
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
My future

418
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
has me,

419
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Le Qiao

420
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
and you.

421
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
We three

422
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
are a family.

423
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
After Le Qiao recovers,

424
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
we will go to many places

425
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
to play together.

426
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
We will be very happy.

427
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Qiao,

428
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
we have come to this point

429
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
after such a difficult time.

430
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
I'm so happy

431
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
that nothing can stop us.

432
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
There must be a way.

433
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
For our future,

434
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
thank you.

435
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
All the organs must be kept.

436
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Inform the doctor

437
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
to send him a batch of goods.

438
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I can't let that police

439
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
get into the case.

440
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I want him to be dealt with.

441
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Chief Zhao An,

442
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
this is the police station.

443
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
We received an anonymous notice

444
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
that someone found

445
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Zhou Junjie's personal items

446
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
in the beach.

447
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
We suspect that he was an accident.

448
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Thank you.

449
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
We have news about Zhou.

450
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Let's go.

451
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Go?

452
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Stop looking.

453
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Sorry to trouble you.

454
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Hello.

455
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm Zhang Jianbao

456
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
from the investigation team.

457
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Did you find

458
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
Zhou's stuff?

459
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
This is the evidence we found.

460
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
You can have a look.

461
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Okay.

462
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Who are you?

463
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Don't run.

464
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Don't run.

465
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Richard, are you okay?

466
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Table 1,

467
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
with soup.

468
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Thank you.

469
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Okay.

470
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Do you mind?

471
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
No one is sitting.

472
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Sir, what would you like to eat?

473
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Table 1, with soup.

474
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Thank you.

475
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Okay.

476
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
What a coincidence.

477
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Yes.

478
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I knew it.

479
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I should have asked you

480
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
if you want to eat with me.

481
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
How is your aunt doing?

482
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
It's strange.

483
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
She seems to be much better

484
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
after cleaning the house.

485
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
She said she was going to

486
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
a drama class,

487
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
and she wanted to learn how to plant flowers.

488
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
She also wanted to meet new friends.

489
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
It's good.

490
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Better than thinking about it.

491
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
That's good.

492
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Actually,

493
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
people

494
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
need someone to be with them.

495
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
That's true.

496
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Here.

497
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Please enjoy.

498
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
What a coincidence.

499
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Let's eat.

500
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Hello?

501
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
I'll be there soon.

502
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
What's up?

503
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Something happened to Ruichu.

504
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
I think I have to go to him now.

505
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Do you want me to go with you?

506
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
No, I can do it myself.

507
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Then go ahead.

508
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Leave it to me.

509
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Sorry.

510
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Xiaoju,

511
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
be careful when you go out.

512
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Call me if you need anything.

513
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Don't go back to Gaoerfu for a meeting.

514
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
I'll come to you tomorrow.

515
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
I'll be there.

516
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
I'll be there.

517
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
I'll be there.

518
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I'll be there.

519
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I'll be there.

520
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
I'll be there.

521
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
I'll be there.

522
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
I'll be there.

523
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
I'll be there.

524
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I'll come to you tomorrow.

525
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Are you okay, Ruichu?

526
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
It's not that long.

527
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I'm fine.

528
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Are you really okay?

529
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Don't be nervous.

530
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Tim must be here.

531
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Come.

532
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Tim.

533
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Ruichu, are you okay?

534
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
I'm fine.

535
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I'm fine.

536
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
How is it?

537
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Did you call the police?

538
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
I can't call the police.

539
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Someone killed you.

540
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
You're always dead.

541
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Why did you call the police?

542
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I didn't expect that.

543
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Because of Gong Youcheng?

544
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
What identity do you have to ask me?

545
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
A law-abiding person or a friend?

546
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
What's the difference?

547
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
I want to help you.

548
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
If you want to help me, don't bother me.

549
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Sorry, I need to rest.

550
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Brother Ruizhou,

551
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
eight years ago,

552
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
I was the one who hurt you.

553
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
I've always been guilty.

554
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You should give me a chance to make up for it.

555
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
A lot of things don't have to face it yourself.

556
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I don't want to face it myself.

557
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm not afraid of death.

558
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
You're not afraid of death.

559
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
What about your partners?

560
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
I went to your mother's bank.

561
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Rui, Huang, Xiao Juan and Xu Jiaxin.

562
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
They're all doing things for you.

563
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Can I find out?

564
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Do you think Grandfather Dai can't find out?

565
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Grandfather Dai can't kill you.

566
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Do you think he'll let them go?

567
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm very tired.

568
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I'll get in touch.

569
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,220
Zh companions of used drugs have

570
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,640
come to submit the old documents.

571
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,880
It...

572
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,720
This is already rook.

573
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,780
What is the use of trying to scold them?

574
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,680
To get others' help?

575
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,460
Did you guys see someone

576
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,880
ARMY escorted by zweite consider them as

577
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
the Eldest Sniper Army

578
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,880
The ring is too precious.

579
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,960
Zhou Sa has never taken off this ring.

580
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
But we can't find her corpse.

581
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,160
It's so suspicious.

582
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,600
Yeah.

583
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
If we haven't found Zhou Sa's corpse,

584
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,080
we can't prove she's dead.

585
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
Zhou Sa won't kill herself.

586
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,560
No way.

587
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,160
She won't.

588
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,760
I got the news.

589
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
Other officers have just held a meeting

590
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,680
and have determined that Zhou Sa's case is a suicide.

591
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,400
There's no doubt.

592
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
We shouldn't investigate anymore.

593
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,440
Today, I found Zhou San's will here.

594
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,720
Did you take Ah Jie's will to do the verification?

595
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,840
Yes.

596
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,920
There's no doubt.

597
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,880
Did you check the video recording of the nearby place?

598
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,560
There's no video recording nearby.

599
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,560
Did you check Ah Jie's phone number?

600
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,320
I checked the telecommunication company.

601
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,000
Everything is normal.

602
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,320
I don't think so.

603
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,600
What's the difference between

604
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,200
the last time you saw Ah Jie?

605
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,480
He was like crazy,

606
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,440
looking for a bait.

607
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,880
From the time Ah Jie disappeared to the time he committed suicide,

608
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,800
everything was so strange

609
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,400
that it didn't make sense at all.

610
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
I don't believe he would commit suicide.

611
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,520
By the way,

612
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,800
can you show me

613
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,760
the will of Ah Jie?

614
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,040
Yes.

615
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,120
Wait.

616
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,720
I haven't seen you.

617
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,440
Take off your mask.

618
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,440
Take off your mask.

619
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,320
What's wrong?

620
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,120
Let's go.

621
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,520
The handwriting is very similar.

622
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,080
But we can't rule out the possibility of cheating.

623
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,280
The handwriting expert has verified it.

624
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,600
No problem.

625
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,640
Ah Jie disappeared for a week.

626
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,440
It turned out that he found himself committing suicide.

627
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,000
He wanted to find his wife so badly.

628
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,040
How could he commit suicide?

629
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,800
So it's impossible.

630
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,440
This will seems to explain the later events.

631
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
Even Ah Bang mentioned it.

632
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,720
I think it's possible.

633
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,680
I also mentioned it.

634
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,960
But there's a big problem.

635
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,200
Look.

636
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,400
After Ah Jie's wife disappeared,

637
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,760
she started to take care of Dou Dou.

638
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,760
Dou Dou is their baby.

639
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,120
Why didn't she mention her dog in it?

640
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,440
At least, tell me who should take care of her.

641
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,880
So I believe more

642
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,480
that someone wants us to believe that Ah Jie is dead

643
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,880
and tell us not to look for her.

644
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,880
Okay.

645
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,040
If we assume that Ah Jie didn't commit suicide,

646
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,560
there are only two possibilities.

647
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
One, she was kidnapped.

648
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,520
Two, she was murdered.

649
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,640
If we want to kill her,

650
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,400
we can just throw her body out.

651
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
Why bother to write a suicide note?

652
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,240
In my opinion, Ah Jie should not be dead.

653
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,360
We still have a chance to find her.

654
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,520
How about this?

655
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
I'll go to the police station and ask them

656
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
if there's any news.

657
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,960
But you have to be careful.

658
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
We haven't found the biggest mole in the police team yet.

659
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Tina's disappearance

660
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,440
is always related to the Grandfather's Manor.

661
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,720
Even X is involved in this case.

662
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,600
It's not strange.

663
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,840
Ah Jie has been missing for so long.

664
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,640
I don't want more people to be hurt or missing.

665
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,280
By the way, how's the crowd over there?

666
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
It's okay for now.

667
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,520
I'll be watching them

668
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,800
until I'm done.

669
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,120
There's no movement at the moment.

670
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,640
Someone's here.

671
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,640
Did you find my wife?

672
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,240
Your wife ran away with that female prisoner.

673
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,600
That prisoner is dead.

674
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,120
There's no news of her yet.

675
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,200
Let's go.

676
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,360
Did you find the female prisoner who ran away?

677
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,320
I don't know.

678
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,120
Senior Police Officer Zhou Junjie

679
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,960
has been missing from the hospital

680
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,120
since January 26, 2025.

681
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,960
The police team needs emotional support.

682
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,320
Please call the mental service department.

683
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,680
Jianing,

685
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,720
check Zhou Junjie's phone records

686
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,280
for me again.

687
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
I want to know

688
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,080
who he called at the end.

689
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,880
We just received an anonymous email.

690
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,000
We have both human and physical evidence.

691
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,520
Lu Yongtong can also testify.

692
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,000
The biggest mole in the police team

693
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,560
is his superior, Ouyang Jun.

694
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,600
This email

695
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,120
provides very good evidence.

696
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,240
Ouyang Jun is related to the Grandfather's Manor.

697
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
We need to find out

698
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,840
who he called at the end.

699
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
We've caught Lin Kun,

700
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,720
China's Prime Minister, Wang Siqin,

701
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,080
Wang Zhenxiong and Lu Yongtong.

702
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,680
They are enough to prove

703
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,520
that there's a systematic crime organization

704
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,360
inside the police team.

705
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,040
I want the public officials to act in the right way

706
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,080
and arrest Ouyang Jun.

707
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
Then we'll go to the police headquarters to search for evidence.

708
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,160
But our case is different from the previous one.

709
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,800
Our target is to stop the deputy chief of the police station.

710
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,880
That's right.

711
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,000
We'll definitely be stopped by the police.

712
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,560
But we can't stop until we find out this step.

713
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,240
If we don't do our best,

714
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,480
Abie's life will be wasted.

715
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,480
Don't worry.

716
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,880
I understand.

717
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,840
I appreciate your efforts.

718
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,960
So no matter how much pressure I face,

719
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll hold on.

720
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,440
I won't let your efforts go to waste.

721
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,800
Thank you, sir.

722
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll ask the law firm to issue a search warrant

723
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,640
and prepare to set off.

724
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,800
Yes, sir.

725
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,960
Sir.

726
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,240
Sit down.

727
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Have you thought about

728
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,520
how to solve Lu Yongtong's case?

729
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,600
We can tell the public

730
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,360
that Lu Yongtong's case

731
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,960
has been put into the judicial process.

732
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
And the police have stopped investigating him.

733
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
They emphasize that

734
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,880
Lu Yongtong is the culprit.

735
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,560
That's right.

736
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,080
We can't let the public know

737
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,480
that Lu Yongtong is the culprit.

738
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,640
We can't let the public know

739
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
that Lu Yongtong is the culprit.

740
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,240
That's right.

741
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
We can't let the public know

742
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
that Lu Yongtong is the culprit.

743
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,480
They emphasize that

744
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,120
this case is purely personal.

745
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,600
It has nothing to do with other people in the county.

746
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,680
The police have

747
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,400
a regular quality assessment.

748
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,040
So,

749
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
the police's operation

750
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,840
has no effect.

751
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,760
No effect?

752
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,560
This morning, the chief of the Security Bureau

753
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,800
called me

754
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
and asked how many police

755
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,240
would be arrested by ICAC.

756
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,120
I retired half a year later.

757
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,320
During this time,

758
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,640
you all

759
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,120
threw so many bombs at me.

760
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,640
Do you want me to retire

761
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,600
before I can save you?

762
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,120
Sir,

763
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,440
Lu Yongtong is my subordinate.

764
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm responsible for his misuse of power.

765
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
I neglected him.

766
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
I didn't monitor him well.

767
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,480
Sorry, sir.

768
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,960
But I have a suggestion.

769
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
To save the public's confidence,

770
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,320
we should do a large-scale review

771
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,080
in our police force

772
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,320
and quality assessment.

773
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,200
Then, we will do a systematic internal inspection.

774
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,640
It proves that our police force is innocent.

775
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,280
What do you think?

776
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Okay.

777
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Is there any otheragaing?

778
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
Sir,

779
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,080
Lu Yongtong

780
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,320
is a bait.

781
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
I agree

782
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,520
that we nothing might go wrong with the police force.

783
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
We still need to

784
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,480
get false suspect's information

785
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,320
which might help us

786
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,800
to listen to the public.

787
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,640
We also need to

788
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,600
check attachement records

789
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,040
about within police fortification.

790
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,360
Maybe they might have been

791
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,600
caught in a mistake otherwise.

792
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,960
Anyway,

793
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Sir, ICAC is here.

794
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,920
ICAC's senior investigator, Gao Haoran,

795
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,280
is investigating a case

796
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,560
of a public official's misbehavior.

797
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
He wants to ask Deputy Chief of Police, Ouyang Jun,

798
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
to help him.

799
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,120
Not only do you ICAC

800
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,320
know how to find the mole,

801
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,160
as Deputy Chief of Police,

802
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
I also want to know

803
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,720
who the mole is.

804
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,920
If you want to leave,

805
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
you can count on yourself.

806
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,320
No one is willing to be a slave.

807
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,720
Don't stay here

808
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,920
to be their money-making tool.

809
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,120
Come on, let's go.

810
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
You're pretty good.

811
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
You can get away every time.

812
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,520
I've shot the first shot,

813
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,040
I'm not afraid of the second shot.

814
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,520
I think your idea

815
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,440
is the same as mine.

816
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,320
If you need me,

817
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I'm happy to come back

818
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
and have a cup of coffee with you.

819
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,440
Have you been changed?

820
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,960
Who is the one

821
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,720
in the mirror

822
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,880
with the rain?

823
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,880
Is there any remorse?

824
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:09,200
Without you by my side,

825
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,200
it's more obvious.

826
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,240
The fallen leaves

827
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,560
are tired

828
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,360
and tired of chasing

829
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:36,480
and pursuing the perfect world.

830
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,360
Who can take me away?

831
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,080
Who is at the far end?

832
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,280
Who can fight for the world with me?

833
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,880
Is there anyone

834
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,680
to guard for me?

835
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,480
I don't need many reasons.

836
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Light up the fire in the dark.

837
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,280
I'll never give up.

838
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,480
If you're by my side,

839
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,280
I'll be there until the end.

840
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,080
Is there any remorse?

841
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:33,280
Without you by my side,

842
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
it's more obvious.

843
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,280
The fallen leaves

844
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,480
are tired

845
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,480
and tired of chasing

846
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,480
and pursuing the perfect world.

847
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,480
Who can take me away?

848
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,080
Who is at the far end?

849
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,480
Who can fight for the world with me?

850
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,080
Is there anyone

851
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,680
to guard for me?

852
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,480
I don't need many reasons.

853
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,680
Light up the fire in the dark.

854
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,480
I'll never give up.

855
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,880
If you're by my side,

856
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,880
I'll be there until the end.

857
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,080
Who can take me away?

858
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,480
Who is at the far end?

859
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,080
Who can fight for the world with me?

860
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I don't need many reasons.

861
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Light up the fire in the dark.

862
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I'll never give up.

863
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,080
If you're by my side,

864
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,280
I'll be there until the end.

865
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,280
Is there anyone

866
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,080
to guard for me?

867
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,880
I don't need many reasons.

868
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,280
Light up the fire in the dark.

869
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,280
I'll never give up.

870
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:39,480
If you're by my side,

871
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,480
I'll be there until the end.

872
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,480
If you're by my side,

873
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,480
I'll be there until the end.

874
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,480
If you're by my side,

875
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,480
I'll be there until the end.
