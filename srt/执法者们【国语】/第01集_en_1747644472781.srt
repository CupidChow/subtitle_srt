1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The case team will be divided into three support teams.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The witnesses will be sent to the High Court.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,920
Today, we will work together with the protection team

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,760
to call for the English Empire.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,400
Mr. Lei!

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Mr. Lei!

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
Mr. Lei!

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
I hope you are prepared.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,200
I also want to trouble you to always be alert.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Today's interrogation is very important.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
But I won't be soft because of this.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Gao Sir, we can go to the court.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
This case is a joint operation

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
planned by the police and ICAC for three years.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,200
The executive officer said that he was highly concerned about the case.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Command center,

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
the security team of the general-in-chief's team is on standby.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Team A will go to the corner.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Team B will go to the corner.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Team C will go to the west.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Team B will go to the west.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Time is 0710.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Let's go.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Roger.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I will take the old man to the white-handed starting point.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Everyone knows that

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
the business is like a battlefield.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The winner must defeat the enemy.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
They are not convinced if they lose.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
But they never think about

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
how to beat me.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Instead, they want to

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
plot,

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
slander

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
and blackmail me.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Kill him.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:21,040
This litigations'

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,000
and jumped down from the top of the building.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
When I looked at the sky,

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
I found out

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,880
that the sky was so big

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
and so wide.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,240
Your Honor,

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,720
I am Liu Yufan, a prosecutor.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I represent the Law Enforcement Department

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,760
to sue the defendant Dai Zufu.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,560
The defendant is the chairman of Qian Feng International Group.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,720
From 2003 to 2023,

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
he used company funds

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,240
to conduct numerous illegal transactions

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,880
and involved a huge amount of money.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Most of the money

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
he managed

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,760
was from the crime of public prosecution.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,840
It was called black money.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
So I decided at that time

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,880
that I would fall here.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,880
In addition to standing here,

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,440
I would also

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,960
take Hong Kong

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,640
and sell it to the international track.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Right.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
He is responsible for protecting Daniel Oh,

64
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
a Chinese American.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,280
Three years ago, he established a virtual currency trading platform

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,280
called INI in Hong Kong.

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Six months ago,

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,760
we found out that he helped Qian Feng Group to black money.

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,280
The witness of Team B's protection was Song Jide.

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
He helped Qian Feng to run underground casino,

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
and infiltrated the Sanghe Club

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,360
to conduct gambling.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Team C is responsible for Xu Sisi.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,760
He is the director of the Qian Feng Accounting Department,

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
and is responsible for handling all the secret financial information of the group.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,200
After being arrested,

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
he is the only one who took the initiative

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
to transfer the evidence.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,320
So he is the most dangerous person.

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
He is the most important person to protect.

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,800
In addition,

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,160
he involved many people,

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,640
and his agent took the benefit.

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,040
He was charged with bribery,

85
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
fraud and other crimes.

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
No!

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
The case involves a lot of documents and evidence.

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,600
Where is the defense?

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
As for the witnesses,

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,000
there are three main witnesses in the控方.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Mr. Liu.

92
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,840
控方,

93
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
I believe you need to consider the court.

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,320
The interrogation continues or not?

95
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,680
代表官

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:01,500
Episode 05

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,360
You...

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
Don't kill me.

99
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,920
I said don't kill me.

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,440
Don't kill me.

101
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
How's it going

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
with your empty square?

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,480
On the way.

104
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,320
If things don't get better,

105
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,440
the control room should consider

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,560
whether to apply for a suspension.

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
Watch out.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stop.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,920
Stop!

110
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,340
Retreat!

111
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,200
Go.

112
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
Let's go.

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,760
That's it.

114
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,520
We're already going to go.

115
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,180
What happened?

116
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,220
Looks like it's gone.

117
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,220
They just broke in and out.

118
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,100
They're so well-raised.

119
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,280
Yes, that's what we should have done.

120
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,960
Yes.

121
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
Get back.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,540
Yes.

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Lei San?

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,480
I believe your judgment.

125
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
Continue.

126
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Everyone who hears this,

127
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
all departments,

128
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
support the C team

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
to change the way to escort the witness.

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,600
Hold on.

131
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,480
I...

132
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
I don't want to go to the court.

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
We're going to the court.

134
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Don't be afraid.

135
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,200
We'll definitely send you to the court safely.

136
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
The C team is here.

137
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Let's go.

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Go.

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,680
Go.

140
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,280
Go.

141
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,880
Go.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Go.

143
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
Go.

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Go.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Go.

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,680
Go.

147
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Go.

148
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
Go.

149
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Go.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Go.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Go.

152
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Go.

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Go.

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
Go.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Go.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Go.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Go.

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Go.

159
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Go.

160
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Go.

161
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Go.

162
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Go.

163
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Go.

164
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Go.

165
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Go.

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Go.

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Go.

168
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Go.

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Go.

170
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Let her go.

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
The C team contacted all units.

172
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
The other team has guns and explosives.

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
Wait.

174
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
The Tiger Team is here to support you.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,880
Wait.

176
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Get into the alley.

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Be careful.

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480
This way.

179
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,480
Come.

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Hurry up.

181
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Brother.

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Go here.

183
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,520
It's different

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,320
An incident has included thisее

185
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:24,260
toís

186
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:33,940
Conjuring

187
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
Tim.

188
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
Officer Liu.

189
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,720
Gao.

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,800
You should be

191
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
the officer of the Reconnaissance Division.

192
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,840
You haven't changed your mind in such a short time.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,760
When I first met you,

194
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,720
I was just a small officer.

195
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Thanks to you,

196
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,640
I wouldn't have been able to

197
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,160
be where I am now

198
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,480
without you.

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
As a Reconnaissance Division's inspection officer,

200
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,360
my duty is to

201
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,520
report people like you.

202
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,600
Mr. Dai Zufu is a business man who follows the law.

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
His company has raised two generations of Hong Kongers.

204
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
He has made great contributions to Hong Kong.

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,240
So you shouldn't report him.

206
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,640
To be honest,

207
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
I really admire you.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,240
You know,

209
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
ordinary people

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
are busy with their daily life.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,920
They are busy with their daily life.

212
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,240
You can force them to make a public statement.

213
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
But you have no money to pay them.

214
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,320
You are willing to be a witness.

215
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,240
You must have spent a lot of time

216
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,960
persuading them.

217
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,400
Ordinary people work hard.

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
But they are deceived by the lawless.

219
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
I am one of them.

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,440
I will stand up and be a witness.

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,480
A servant.

222
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,080
A servant

223
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,040
should serve the public.

224
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
But you'd better not forget

225
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,920
that it's the public's money to sue the wrong person.

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,160
If Xu Sisi doesn't show up after a month,

227
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
I will be innocent.

228
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,000
I will

229
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,120
settle it with you then.

230
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,520
As for ICC,

231
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
I don't appreciate it at all.

232
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,400
Gou Si,

233
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
you should calculate it.

234
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,320
You have been with me for eight years.

235
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,760
Eight years.

236
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,760
So what?

237
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,120
It proves that I am innocent.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,600
I understand.

239
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,840
You were like a mad dog

240
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
biting me.

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
For your girlfriend?

242
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,400
Women.

243
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
I have many.

244
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,120
How about this?

245
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,200
Come and help me next time with Mr. Liu.

246
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,760
I will pick a lot of women for you.

247
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,320
You don't need to argue.

248
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
The judge declares that

249
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
the Dai family case will be under pressure for a month.

250
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
Mr. Su and Ms. Gou

251
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,160
without your detection of him

252
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
will wait for a month.

253
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,680
He will beelynwith the God to finally

254
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
find an alliance with the right person.

255
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,680
Find him by the court,

256
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,280
and tell us

257
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,200
if Mr. eve flexed.

258
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
Do he compares to you and Apple King?

259
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,280
He is a tryin gallouse mashed bargain

260
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,960
with two money- transportНе possessor,

261
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
reveals the singer's name on his Orphan Buy,

262
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
He was hit by a gun.

263
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,920
He's still not awake.

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,700
My doctor seems to be very nervous.

265
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,280
Is he alright?

266
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,540
He's now fine.

267
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm terrifying.

268
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm really scared he will get hurt.

269
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,520
I don't know if he's alright.

270
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,600
Is he alright?

271
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,640
He's alright.

272
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,940
Uncle is alright.

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
Uncle, you must be studying medical knowledge.

274
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,820
Film anothere.

275
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,460
It's okay, uncle.

276
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,220
It's okay.

277
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,660
It's okay.

278
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,540
It's okay.

279
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,420
It's okay.

280
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,900
Qiangma, don't worry.

281
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
The doctor said

282
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,300
uncle passed the danger period.

283
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
He should wake up soon.

284
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,700
How about you sleep early tonight?

285
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,340
I'll go to see uncle tomorrow morning.

286
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,660
Haoran.

287
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,380
Do you think your uncle will be okay?

288
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,140
Uncle will be fine.

289
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
I'll get you some water.

290
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,780
Really?

291
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:19,940
Let's go.

292
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,340
Do you think your uncle will better stay alive after this?

293
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,100
No.

294
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm fine.

295
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,200
You very well.

296
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,760
That's my decision as uncle.

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm fine.

298
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,920
You guys are joking.

299
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Zhou Zi'er, can you hear me?

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,560
Can you tell me your name?

301
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,600
Zhou Junjie.

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Okay, I've checked it for you.

303
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,160
It's nothing serious.

304
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
There are no other serious injuries.

305
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,760
But my head hurts so much.

306
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,480
Because the main factor is the explosion of the hand grenade.

307
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,640
It caused a concussion and a slight concussion.

308
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,280
In a short time, you will have a headache, headache,

309
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,080
or even short-term amnesia.

310
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
If you have a cough or bleeding,

311
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
you must inform us immediately.

312
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
I know.

313
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,680
Then you take a break.

314
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
Thank you.

315
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Come on, hurry up.

316
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,560
Sure.

317
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,520
You can get up soon.

318
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
What's wrong?

319
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,080
Doctor said she's fine.

320
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
He's still awake.

321
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,680
He's still in the operating room.

322
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
The car of Team B was found by the mountain.

323
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Alex is missing.

324
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
We're still looking for him.

325
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
What about Xu Sisi?

326
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,920
She was kidnapped.

327
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
Have a good rest.

328
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,720
Thank you, sir.

329
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
As I Committee,

330
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
you must help me.

331
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
Don't forget about Zan.

332
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,640
Wait for my reply.

333
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Sister-in-law!

334
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,720
Tina!

335
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,480
Mr. Lei!

336
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,680
Don't worry.

337
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,400
It's okay.

338
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,000
See him!

339
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,440
How are you doing?

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,760
How's the doctor?

341
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,040
oh

342
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,080
Ter rebuild

343
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,360
Are you very tight?

344
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm sorry

345
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,480
how many per hour

346
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,000
A way

347
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,640
you

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,600
you

349
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,440

350
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,960
ride

351
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,600
It's okay.

353
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,040
I didn't urge you.

354
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,600
We'll talk about it when you feel better.

355
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,880
I'll make some soup tonight.

356
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,640
Sorry, Mrs.

357
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
We're going to record a statement.

358
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,360
I won't bother you then.

359
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll go.

360
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,600
Mr. Zhou.

361
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,920
Mr. Zhou.

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Derek.

363
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,800
How's Xiong?

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Mr. Zhou.

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,840
Xiong is seriously injured and unconscious.

366
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,440
Why don't you go back and rest?

367
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,040
No, thanks.

368
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,760
Wait a minute.

369
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,120
I want to see Xiong.

370
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
Even if Xiong wakes up,

371
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
he can't go anywhere in his life.

372
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,440
What do you mean?

373
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,400
What can't he go?

374
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,520
He was shot by a bullet.

375
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,080
He's lucky enough to get the antidote.

376
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,960
I guess she doesn't want to see you now.

377
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,200
You'd better go back.

378
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,400
Derek.

379
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,560
Don't scare me.

380
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,280
I'll be fine.

381
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Mrs. Zhou.

382
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,760
I'll go.

383
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,760
According to the police report,

384
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,920
at 7 a.m.,

385
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,240
we received news that two people were killed.

386
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
I'd like to ask

387
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
why the police didn't

388
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,600
report to the law firm in time.

389
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,960
Instead, we had to use the network

390
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,600
to find out the current situation.

391
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,320
Three security rooms

392
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,800
were attacked at 7.05, 7.08,

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
and 7.09.

394
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,160
After we received the news at 7.12,

395
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,640
the police reacted quickly.

396
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,880
In order to protect Xu Sisi,

397
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,080
we quickly transferred the major cases

398
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,760
WPU and PTU to the scene.

399
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,040
I still don't understand one thing.

401
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,440
The security room is a highly confidential place.

402
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,600
Why would such a high-secret place

403
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
be leaked out?

404
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,160
The police's security room is the highest secret.

405
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
Even if it's inside,

406
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
only a few people know the details.

407
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,840
It seems that the killer has a detailed plan.

408
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
We can't rule out that they know the details of the operation

409
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,800
and deploy it as soon as possible.

410
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,040
Does it mean that

411
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,520
the incident was caused by human error

412
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,600
and the location of the security room was leaked out?

413
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,920
Wang Zhenxiong is my uncle.

414
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,680
For a while, he was my guardian.

415
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,400
We have a good relationship.

416
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
Why did you tell me this?

417
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,240
The police have a mole.

418
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
They've already got the message.

419
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,120
I know that the Security Bureau

420
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,080
asks us to investigate the ICAC case.

421
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,960
I want to handle it myself.

422
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,520
In this operation,

423
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,120
we lost 12 colleagues.

424
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Two were injured and one was missing.

425
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,040
Mr. Liu, do you think

426
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,840
human error means that

427
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,560
the police have a mole?

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,440
The hostage is missing.

429
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
The winner is Dai Zufu.

430
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,440
I have a reason to suspect

431
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,840
that everyone who is involved in the human rights protection plan

432
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,760
has the potential to be a mole.

433
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
So we're not particularly targeting the police.

434
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,640
I hope you don't misunderstand.

435
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
The police have a mole

436
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,400
and they've already caused an earthquake.

437
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,680
The ICAC is even more dangerous.

438
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,440
Since the police are your relatives,

439
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,200
why should I risk it

440
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,600
and let you keep following them?

441
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Mr. Liu,

442
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,280
I understand your initial intention and concern.

443
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,680
We will report to the Security Bureau as soon as possible.

444
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,520
We won't miss any suspicious link.

445
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,920
I understand.

446
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,680
The Security Bureau will act accordingly

447
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,040
according to the report.

448
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
But now,

449
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,760
you three departments will continue to cooperate.

450
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,040
I'd like to know

451
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,440
how you will plan the next step.

452
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
I believe that the police have a mole

453
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,960
and a close relationship with Dai Zufu.

454
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,560
We've been investigating Dai Zufu for eight years.

455
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,400
We know very well

456
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,760
about the people and things around him.

457
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
If we investigate the related cases,

458
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,200
I can't imagine that there are people

459
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,640
who are more suitable than us.

460
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,000
The police will concentrate on

461
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,880
tracking Xu Sisi and all the killers.

462
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
We will investigate

463
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,120
the reason for the failure of this operation.

464
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I believe that the police will cooperate well.

465
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,440
Good.

466
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
This time, the Bureau,

467
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
the Law Enforcement Department and the Lianshu

468
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
will cooperate in three ways.

469
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,600
I believe that there will be a clear result

470
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,960
very soon.

471
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,440
Deng Sir,

472
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
you know very well

473
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,560
who I am.

474
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
I know how you are as a person.

475
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,960
So what?

476
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,920
What the ICAC does is

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,960
about justice and justice.

478
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,800
Every step we take,

479
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,720
we will be more careful than others.

480
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
Every ICAC investigator

481
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,560
wants to catch people

482
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,560
and maintain justice.

483
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm not exception.

484
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,520
I promise you

485
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
that I will take the credit.

486
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
If Wang Zhenxiong breaks the law,

487
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,600
I will catch him myself.

488
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,880
This time, we locked

489
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
three suspicious persons

490
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
in the police mole case.

491
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,120
The first one is

492
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
Zhou Junjie, the senior inspector of the Central Criminal Division.

493
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,840
He is the commander

494
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,720
who is responsible for escorting Xu Sisi.

495
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,200
During the escort,

496
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,640
he also ordered

497
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,960
to change the route.

498
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,640
The second one is

499
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,640
Alex, the detective of the Central Criminal Division.

500
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,000
During the gunfight,

501
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,840
he took a car and ran down the mountain.

502
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
He found the car back,

503
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,440
but the person was missing.

504
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,440
He can't rule out

505
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
the possibility of his escape.

506
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,200
The third one is

507
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Wang Zhenxiong, the chief of the Central Criminal Division.

508
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,800
He is responsible for driving

509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,800
and escorting Xu Sisi.

510
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,960
He was shot and unconscious during the gunfight.

511
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
He is still in the hospital.

512
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,600
We can't rule out

513
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,400
the possibility of his being a mole.

514
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
Licky, Angus,

515
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,840
you are responsible for Zhou Junjie.

516
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
See where he has been recently

517
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,160
and who he has contacted.

518
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Yes.

519
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
Bi, Harry,

520
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
you are responsible for Alex.

521
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,360
If you have any news,

522
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,360
please let me know.

523
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,240
Yes, sir.

524
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
Jeff, Marco,

525
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,920
you are responsible for investigating

526
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,640
if they are connected with the black community.

527
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,680
Okay.

528
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
Jenny, you are the most familiar with finance.

529
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,720
You are responsible for checking

530
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
their financial situation.

531
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,280
Okay.

532
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,280
Sanghui,

533
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,760
continue after dinner.

534
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
Hello, Aunt.

535
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,360
Aunt.

536
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,480
How is Uncle?

537
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
Your uncle just woke up.

538
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
The doctor is still checking inside.

539
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,680
But the doctor said

540
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,840
the bullet has been injured a few nerves.

541
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,640
He may not be able to walk

542
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
in the future.

543
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,520
This is...

544
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,880
He is my colleague.

545
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,600
He will help me to help him with the work later.

546
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
Your uncle just woke up.

547
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,840
He is going to tell the public.

548
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
I am sorry, Aunt.

549
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,960
We need to find out the truth as soon as possible.

550
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,360
Chief of Staff,

551
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
you have our talents.

552
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,560
Hey, man.

553
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,360
급ал recession.

554
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,720
Today,

555
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,560
we got crops together with tomatoes, potatoes, and beef.

556
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
Thank you.

557
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,960
I have no guru with me.

558
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,520
You are welcome.

559
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
What's more important is your taste,

560
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
and my wife would be so happy.

561
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,120
Let's get in the toilet.

562
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,160
Thank you, Brother TOI,

563
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,000
Wow.

564
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,480
Okay.

565
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,560
Go to have some soup.

566
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,240
Thank you, brother.

567
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,280
Thank you, brother.

568
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,920
No need.

569
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,080
Coming.

570
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,640
Joseph.

571
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,640
Tomato, potato, beef soup.

572
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
You should hardly drink soup when you live alone.

573
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,320
Try the pork soup.

574
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,240
Thank you.

575
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,880
Uncle.

576
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,920
Uncle.

577
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,080
My colleague picked you up.

578
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,520
He wants to help you with your statement.

579
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
You suspect me?

580
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,560
No.

581
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
I just want to help you

582
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,120
prove your innocence.

583
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,960
Mr. Wang.

584
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,000
I'll start recording now.

585
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,720
Did you notice

586
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,960
any suspicious behavior

587
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,680
of any member

588
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,760
on the day of your action?

589
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
No.

590
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,240
But our car team

591
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
arrived near the Eagle King Road.

592
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
Joseph

593
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,840
changed the route temporarily.

594
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,200
You were ambushed

595
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,600
after changing the route?

596
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,600
The bullets

597
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
were fired from all directions.

598
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
I had no choice.

599
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,640
I had to take Xu Sisi out of the car.

600
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,640
Hurry up.

601
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,160
Go.

602
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,400
Then you went to the alley, right?

603
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,120
Yes.

604
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,080
What bad things have happened?

605
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,040
A killer ambushed us.

606
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:28,080
A bomb

607
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I don't know.

608
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,940
Uncle, this is very important.

609
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,520
What are his characteristics?

610
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
I really don't remember.

611
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
Uncle, think it over.

612
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
This is very important, Uncle.

613
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Where is Hao Ran?

614
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Can you let him rest for a while?

615
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
I think we'll end our discussion here.

616
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,720
If you need anything, we'll contact you again.

617
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Sorry to have disturbed you.

618
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm sorry, Uncle.

619
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I really wanted to help you.

620
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
I'm sorry.

621
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
I'm sorry.

622
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
I'm sorry.

623
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
I really wanted to help you.

625
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm sorry.

626
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,920
Husband, it's okay.

627
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,520
It's okay.

628
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Don't be agitated.

629
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Why is it him?

630
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
He's the only one here.

631
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
Be quiet, kid.

632
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Don't let him hear you.

633
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,120
What are you afraid of? He has the nerve to come back.

634
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
He can still eat.

635
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Lei Ze.

636
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Relax.

637
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,120
Lei Ze.

638
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
You haven't fully recovered yet.

639
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,120
Can you come back to work so soon?

640
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,520
Sure.

641
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,120
Lei Ze, why are you here?

642
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Can't I come to eat with you?

643
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,720
It's not good for you to eat here.

644
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,320
Can't Deputy Chief come down here to eat?

645
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,720
No.

646
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,920
But you're sitting here.

647
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Everyone is looking at you.

648
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
They're afraid to talk.

649
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
What's the matter?

650
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,920
Let them talk.

651
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
So many things have happened.

652
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,320
It's not that bad, right?

653
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,520
You've heard a lot today.

654
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,320
The police have lost 12 important colleagues.

655
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
The police are in a difficult position.

656
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,520
Instead of wasting time talking about these things,

657
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,920
why don't you do it yourself?

658
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,120
I just hope that everyone can be on the same page.

659
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,520
Don't let your colleagues die in vain.

660
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
Thank you, sir.

661
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,520
And, sorry, sir.

662
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,120
I caused you to be talked about by others.

663
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I've been a police officer for decades.

664
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,520
I've seen and heard a lot of things.

665
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
The most important thing is that I'm fine.

666
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,520
Lei Ze.

667
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,120
There's something that I didn't mention when I was talking.

668
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,320
I didn't mention it when I was talking.

669
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,720
When I was acting,

670
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,920
I saw Alice send a message on her phone.

671
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,320
I didn't mention it because I didn't want to wrong her.

672
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,120
I don't believe that my brothers will betray our whole team.

673
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,320
But I think that there must be a mole in this case.

674
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,920
If you find the mole, you'll have a chance to find Xu Si Si.

675
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,920
I'll find out this direction.

676
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
If you need anything, just tell me.

677
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
Have a good rest.

678
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,120
Go and comfort your wife.

679
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,920
I know.

680
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,720
Let's eat.

681
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,360
Zeng Xi,

682
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,060
hurry and move out.

683
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,600
Go go go go.

684
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,720
哪裡 d'you go, Bolou?

685
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
The rest over thereovy you've known him

686
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,960
The right suspicion is a good police officer's rightful action.

687
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,600
This world is cruel.

688
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,360
There's no way you'll be a good person.

689
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,040
Here, eat some orange.

690
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,840
Okay.

691
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
Wipe your hands first.

692
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,280
You don't have to eat it for me.

693
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,480
Eat it for me.

694
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Granny, eat some orange.

695
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
My surname is not Chen.

696
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,920
My surname is Liao.

697
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,840
Granny Liao, eat some orange.

698
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,520
Wipe your hands first.

699
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,440
Eat some orange.

700
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,120
Yes.

701
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
Okay.

702
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,800
You're so good.

703
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
Granny He, you're so lucky.

704
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,920
You have a filial son.

705
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,720
Yes.

706
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,560
Granny Liao, I'm Xiao Fei,

707
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,600
Mrs. Ding's son.

708
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,880
You're Xiao Fei?

709
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,600
Yes.

710
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,920
This man

711
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,080
is pretending to be her son

712
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,200
by robbing other people's mothers.

713
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,520
You're so stupid.

714
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,720
He's the son of Zhou.

715
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
Mom.

716
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,840
He used to be my husband.

717
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,680
He used to take me as his godmother.

718
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,880
I don't know what he's up to.

719
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
What time is it now?

720
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
It's not that late.

721
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,560
It's less than half an hour.

722
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,080
Shut up, you brat.

723
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,920
You're so stupid.

724
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,160
How can you talk to Zhou?

725
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,280
Yeah.

726
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,120
Sorry.

727
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
Can you understand something?

728
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
You got into the police force

729
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
after many tests.

730
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
You want to get promoted,

731
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
but you have to get along with others.

732
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,960
Your dad died early.

733
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,240
Your uncle and uncle

734
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,280
don't want to do those hard work.

735
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,680
You really have no one to rely on.

736
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,920
You have to rely on yourself.

737
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,640
Zhou,

738
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,160
help me keep an eye on Xiao Fei.

739
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,480
I'll keep an eye on him.

740
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,760
Godmother,

741
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,760
can you open it for me?

742
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,120
No problem.

743
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,200
Xiao Fei cried when he didn't understand it.

744
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
Let me handle him.

745
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
Zhou,

746
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,600
you're more popular than those internet celebrities.

747
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,360
Hey.

748
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,880
What's wrong, Zhou?

749
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,080
Besides Xu Sisi,

750
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,400
you have to find another person for me.

751
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Who is he?

752
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,360
He's a colleague of my missing colleague.

753
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,160
I suspect he took Xu Sisi away.

754
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
Even the police can't find him.

755
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,680
It's hard to find him.

756
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,800
What's wrong?

757
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,160
You want to get into the police force again?

758
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,840
Yeah.

759
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
You're crazy.

760
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,360
How can you be so stupid?

761
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,320
Now you have to find two people.

762
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
Double the cash is not too much, right?

763
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Okay.

764
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,080
As long as you can find him,

765
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,640
I'll give you my own money.

766
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,080
Deal.

767
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,640
I...

768
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
It hurts.

769
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,440
I've checked Zhou Junjie,

770
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Wang Zhengxiong and Alex.

771
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,160
Basically, their background is not suspicious.

772
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,480
They're innocent.

773
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,520
But Zhou Junjie

774
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,040
is close to some little rascals.

775
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,120
But he's the head of the crime team.

776
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,880
It's normal to talk to those little rascals.

777
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,400
Maybe even his informants are not used to it.

778
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,800
It's hard to judge now.

779
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,440
So we need to be closer.

780
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,120
I've checked some financial companies.

781
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,840
I found that they sent people

782
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,280
to chase a police officer named Zhou.

783
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,040
It's said that Zhou Junjie is the one with the surname Zhou.

784
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,080
As for Wang Zhengxiong,

785
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,760
his financial records are good.

786
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,560
But I found that he and his wife

787
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
have invested in encrypted currency.

788
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,760
We haven't found out whether they're making money or losing money.

789
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
What about Alex?

790
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,000
We haven't found him yet.

791
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
We haven't found him for a day.

792
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,680
He may have money.

793
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,080
That means

794
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,520
one owes money to the financial company,

795
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
one is fighting with his wife for money,

796
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,400
and one is missing.

797
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Hello.

798
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Yes.

799
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,000
I just got a notice from the police.

800
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
I found Alex.

801
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Zhou Junjie.

802
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,080
ICAC's senior investigator Gao Haoran

803
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
is suspecting you of being a police officer

804
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,760
and being bribed.

805
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,040
He leaked the information of the police's secret operation.

806
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,760
Two witnesses died

807
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,360
and one missing.

808
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
He wants you to help him with the investigation.

809
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
I feel like my life has been turned upside down.

810
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,560
And I tried toistaimlessly

811
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,880
to observe the body.

812
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,540
It's like saying what would I live to see.

813
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,460
In case I became weaving in the sorrowing world.

814
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,960
You didn't say too much.

815
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,120
Only waiting for Раз scenes can be seen.

816
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,840
You said

817
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
my brother-in-law

818
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,840
hasn't been to be asked.

819
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,620
But at this moment,

820
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,740
I knew

821
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,700
there has to be something

822
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,380
I nice to do.

823
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Is there any remorse?

824
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:17,680
The season without you by my side

825
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,640
is more obvious.

826
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,680
The fallen leaves

827
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,000
are as tired as the wind.

828
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,520
I'm tired of chasing,

829
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,640
chasing a perfect world.

830
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,520
No one can take me away.

831
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,280
No one is at the far end.

832
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,520
No one can trade the world for me.

833
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,160
Is there anyone

834
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,760
to guard me?

835
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,600
I don't need many reasons.

836
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,760
The fireworks light up in the dark.

837
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,360
I don't want to be alone.

838
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,640
If you're by my side,

839
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,360
until the end,

840
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,160
is there any remorse?

841
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,040
The season without you by my side

842
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,760
is more obvious.

843
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,760
The fallen leaves

844
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,360
are as tired as the wind.

845
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm tired of chasing,

846
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,360
chasing a perfect world.

847
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,040
No one can take me away.

848
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,840
No one is at the far end.

849
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,360
No one can trade the world for me.

850
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,360
Is there anyone

851
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,960
to guard me?

852
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,760
I don't need many reasons.

853
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,960
The fireworks light up in the dark.

854
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,760
I don't want to be alone.

855
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,960
If you're by my side,

856
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,760
until the end,

857
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,760
is there anyone

858
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,560
to guard me?

859
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,760
No one can trade the world for me.

860
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,360
Is there anyone

861
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,960
to guard me?

862
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,760
I don't need many reasons.

863
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,160
The fireworks light up in the dark.

864
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,760
I don't want to be alone.

865
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:48,360
If you're by my side,

866
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,360
it doesn't matter.

867
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,760
As long as you're here, I'm fine.
