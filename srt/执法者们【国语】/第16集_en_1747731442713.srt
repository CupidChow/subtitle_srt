1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
The

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
The

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,480
Ruiya disappeared after helping the police to testify for Lin Kun.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
He might have been caught by Grandfather.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,360
Only you can find him.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Have you been changed?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Who is the one in the mirror who is playing with the rain?

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
Who can take me away?

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Who is in the distant end of the world?

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Who will fight for the world with me?

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Is it useful?

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Who will guard me?

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I don't need too many reasons.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,360
In the darkness, the fireflies light up.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,360
I won't retreat.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm just a small child.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,360
You're always with me.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Until the end.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
The Ruiya

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Episode 19

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,360
The Ruiya

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Honey.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Honey.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Honey.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
How are you?

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Are you okay?

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Are you hurt?

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Are you seriously hurt?

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
They even caught you.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm fine.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Don't worry.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
I'll find a way to get you out.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,360
I have a baby.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,360
We must protect him this time.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I will.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Don't worry.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
We are family.

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
We will go home safely.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
We must go home safely this time.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I will.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Let her go.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Let her go.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Let her go.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Grandfather.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Grandfather.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
What do you want?

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I told you.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
You can meet your wife if you win.

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm very trustworthy.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
You're so arrogant.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't touch my wife.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Do you know that you two are very valuable?

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
You help me to fight.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
You win a lot.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll let you rest.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
It's your wife's turn.

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
What do you want?

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Start.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Let my wife go.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Get out.

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
I won't let you go if my wife is in danger.

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Let her go.

63
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Do you know what you did wrong?

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,360
You should have a family.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
You should enjoy your family.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
You must make trouble for me.

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Stop.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Stop.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Stop.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Stop.

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Stop.

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't be so mean.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Open the door and let her in.

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Qiao Jingxu.

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Beat him.

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Beat him.

77
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Beat him.

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
So many people are watching.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Go on.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Go on.

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Mr. Dai is looking for you.

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I know.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
If I tell you

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I've seen the life here.

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Do you believe it?

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I'll tell Mr. Dai

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
you're working.

88
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
You can go there later.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Can you stay here with me?

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Hurry up.

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Be careful.

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Don't fall.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Oh, no.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm wet.

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Sorry.

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Let me wipe it for you.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
No paper.

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
We'll take a hot bath in the hospital.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Okay?

100
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Is it cold?

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Okay?

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Here.

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Say thank you.

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Thank you.

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Thank you.

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
You're welcome.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I want to play for a while.

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
No.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
It's raining now.

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
We're going to the hospital.

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Next time, okay?

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I don't know when

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Dr. Chen will let me out again.

114
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Wait for me to talk to Dr. Chen.

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay?

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Okay?

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Smile.

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
It's all yours.

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Thank you.

120
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Coffee.

121
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,360
The whole plan is going well.

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
The guests are satisfied with our conditions.

123
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
What's wrong?

124
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't know when I got dirty.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm not asking you why you got dirty.

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm asking you why you got dirty and didn't clean up.

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
How can you represent our company

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
to talk to those customers about business?

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
How can I trust you to hand over the big project?

130
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Sorry.

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll pay attention in the future.

132
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Sorry is what Luzi will say.

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Come in.

134
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Mr. Dai.

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Sisi is the secretary of the accounting department.

136
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I asked her to come and help you.

137
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Thank you, Godfather.

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Hello.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
You can call me Sisi.

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Hello, Sisi.

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Anyway, she'll help you in the future.

142
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
You can focus on handling the big project.

143
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Okay?

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I got it, Godfather.

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
It hasn't been long since it started.

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
You've already made so much money for the group.

147
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
It proves that my plan works.

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
It's safe enough with fewer people in the middle.

149
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
As long as the system is stable,

150
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Xiaoyao, we'll be friends forever.

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I have faith in you.

152
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Come on.

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Congratulations, Godfather. Keep working.

154
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
But I don't understand.

155
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Godfather, why did you keep the police officer named Zhou?

156
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
What for?

157
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I want to keep his life.

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
He has no value.

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
I'll lose a lot of fun if he dies.

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm just worried that

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
they are police officers and officers.

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Both are civil servants.

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
They've been looking for them outside.

164
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,360
I don't think we need to take this risk.

165
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Xiaoyao,

166
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
do you know why I'm here?

167
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Because my company and the law are clear.

168
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
If you let one go,

169
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
no one will be afraid of you.

170
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
You know I only trust you.

171
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Don't let me down.

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I got it, Godfather.

173
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Still looking?

177
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
At the fifth floor.

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Who are you?

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
It doesn't matter who I am.

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I just know that

181
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
the person I'm looking at is the same friend.

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Let's go.

183
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's go.

184
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Doctor,

185
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
when will my son wake up?

186
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
When I came to check,

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
he started to react.

188
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
But he hasn't woken up yet.

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
His hygiene has been improved.

190
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
It's eleven o'clock.

191
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
He might wake up at any time.

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
What's wrong?

193
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
You often squat outside the hospital.

194
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
You dare not come in.

195
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Do you have a lot to say to your friends?

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
But you're afraid of being scolded by his mother?

197
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
No.

198
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
If you don't say something today,

199
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
you won't have a chance in the future.

200
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Maybe you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

201
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
It's done.

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
No need to add the ingredients.

203
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
It's a good chance.

204
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
We have done

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
what we could.

206
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
But if he doesn't confess,

207
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
we'll be in trouble.

208
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
If he doesn't confess,

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
we'll be in trouble.

210
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
You're right.

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
If he doesn't confess,

221
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
I can persuade the judge

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
to judge him in other ways.

223
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Thank you.

224
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
You finally have enough evidence to sue.

225
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Are you still not satisfied?

226
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I got these cases to court

227
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
not to sue that child for jail.

228
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I haven't found Lu Yuantong yet.

229
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
The relationship with that child.

230
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Can't you find it now?

231
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
It doesn't mean you can't find it in the future.

232
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Sometimes you turn around

233
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
because you haven't found the gap.

234
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Maybe

235
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
after he confesses,

236
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
there will be a turn.

237
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm here to sue Hu Shaohao

238
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,360
for violating the Article 17 of the Human Rights Act.

239
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
The businessman will be severely hurt

240
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
to the human body.

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Kong Feng, please continue.

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Your Honor,

243
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I don't need a lawyer to represent me.

244
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I'll confess.

245
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Your Honor,

246
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I can't represent him

247
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
because I haven't been told to go further.

248
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I apply for a new divorce.

249
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Approved.

250
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
I'm sorry, Jerry.

251
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I want to use this opportunity

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
to apologize to him and his mother here.

253
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
That day in the park,

254
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
we sat on that slide,

255
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
drinking beer

256
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
and talking about what we want to do in the future.

257
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
He said he wanted to take his mother

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
to immigrate abroad

259
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
and live a relaxed life.

260
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I envy him.

261
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
So I laughed at him.

262
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I asked him to save enough money first.

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
What's wrong with doing it

264
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
and insisting on being a second-class citizen?

265
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
He heard that

266
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
I didn't like him at all.

267
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
So we had a little fight.

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
And then I was drunk

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,360
and pushed him down with one hand.

270
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
When he fell down,

271
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
he hit his head

272
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
and bled a lot.

273
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
He didn't move.

274
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I was very scared at that time.

275
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
I don't know what to do.

276
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I just want to be with him.

277
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
I didn't call the police

278
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
and left like that.

279
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I think I don't have the courage

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
to see Jerry in my life.

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Because of my impulsiveness,

282
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
he and his family

283
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
suffered some things that shouldn't be suffered.

284
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Your Honor,

285
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I admit my guilt.

286
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Stand still.

288
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Do you know how many people I've hurt

289
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
for you?

290
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
You actually admit your guilt now?

291
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Miss Lu,

292
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm just doing what a person should do.

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
What's wrong?

294
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
If you have a memory,

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
you wouldn't have done so many things.

296
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
You made me be investigated by ICC.

297
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
I took you out

298
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
with your friends and family.

299
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
I took you out again when you were caught.

300
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Now you want to be a good person?

301
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Really?

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
It's too much trouble for you

303
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
to help me solve this and that.

304
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Have you ever asked me what I want?

305
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
What do you want now?

306
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
You know what you want.

307
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
You know what you're doing.

308
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
If I hadn't protected you,

309
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
you would be in jail now.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I've told you

311
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
that you wouldn't have so many things

312
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
to do when you study abroad.

313
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
You didn't go.

314
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Now you may have a dark past.

315
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
What are you going to do?

316
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Why must I leave?

317
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Why can't I stay here

318
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
and face it?

319
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Even if I have to go to jail,

320
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
it's my own business.

321
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Or are you afraid of shame

322
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
and others saying

323
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
that your son is a prisoner?

324
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Are you afraid that others will say

325
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
that you don't even recognize your son

326
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
for your promotion?

327
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Shut up!

328
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Mom, I've grown up.

329
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I want to be responsible for

330
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
the things I've done.

331
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Then you don't have to do more wrong things

332
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
because of me.

333
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I hereby declare

335
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
that the victim is seriously injured.

336
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I immediately revoke

337
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Hu Shao Hao's warning

338
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
and change the social service order

339
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
to 200 hours.

340
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
The first three years of the punishment

341
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
will be started from today.

342
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Mr. Dai, you're looking for me?

343
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Have you gotten used to it

344
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
in the last few months?

345
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm okay. I'm used to it.

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
With Xiaoyao taking care of you,

347
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
you'll get used to it soon.

348
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm just here to work

349
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
with Mr. Dai.

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
When he was young,

351
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
his dad died.

352
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Then his mom died too.

353
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
He really needs a lot of people

354
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
to take care of him.

355
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
He likes you

356
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
because you're his mom.

357
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
I'll take care of

358
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
what Mr. Dai told me to do.

359
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Is he starting to faint?

360
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
I knew he'd like

361
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
a woman like you a long time ago.

362
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Don't worry, Mr. Dai.

363
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
I know what to do.

364
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Why is his mind

365
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
still so immature?

366
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Why are there so many

367
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
coincidences in this world?

368
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
After you get him,

369
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
just take care of him for me.

370
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Anything else?

371
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Mr. Dai,

372
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
I want to change some

373
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
good hospitals for Leqiao.

374
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Okay.

375
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Thank you, Mr. Dai.

376
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
I'll go to work now.

377
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Sisi,

378
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I can satisfy

379
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
all the conditions you asked.

380
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
But there's one thing

381
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
you can't not know.

382
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I will never

383
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
do a loss-making business.

384
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
If you dare to

385
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
make a condition to me,

386
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
then I'll tell you

387
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
to do everything

388
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
you can do.

389
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
I have good news

390
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
to tell you.

391
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
The doctor has done

392
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
the operation for your son.

393
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Everything is ready.

394
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I'll go to work now.

395
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Okay.

396
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I will go to work now.

397
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Please be careful.

398
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I don't need to worry.

399
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Just help Xiao Yao

400
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
to handle the matter here.

401
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Thank you, Mr. Dai.

402
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Mr. Dai, I'd like to ask,

403
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
when can I

404
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
go to work

405
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
and visit Leqiao?

406
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
You're going to work

407
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
so quickly?

408
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Your son just

409
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
had a big surgery.

410
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
You need to take good care of him.

411
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Don't bother him.

412
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
you can reunite with your mother and son.

413
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,360
Okay.

414
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,640
Don't worry.

415
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,600
That hospital is mine.

416
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,920
Many people will take care of it.

417
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,040
Don't worry.

418
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,280
Okay.

419
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Mr. Dai,

420
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,200
I'll go back to work.

421
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,360
Thank you.

422
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,080
Okay.

423
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,440
Actually, I saw the people

424
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,840
who did this to us.

425
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,360
Especially their couple.

426
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,080
I feel really uncomfortable.

427
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
I understand.

428
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,680
But they can't do anything.

429
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
They offended your godfather.

430
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,800
I didn't offend my godfather.

431
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,720
He taught me public and private education when I was a kid.

432
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,480
He taught me to read IT.

433
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,120
I was going to help him

434
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
after I quit my job.

435
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Develop software.

436
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
Be a programmer.

437
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,520
I never thought

438
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
I would help him make money.

439
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,520
You know it.

440
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,200
He has planned it early.

441
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,320
Sometimes I really don't know what he's thinking.

442
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
He's already so rich.

443
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
How can he have the right?

444
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,680
It's just making money.

445
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,400
There's no need to do this.

446
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,480
Actually,

447
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,960
you don't agree with your godfather's decision.

448
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,720
Why don't you try to talk to him?

449
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,920
Didn't you say

450
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,880
no one dares to offend my godfather?

451
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,840
Even if I dare to say it,

452
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,680
he won't listen.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,320
But I think you can.

454
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
Because you're different from him.

455
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,440
You're not a bad person.

456
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
Gong You Cheng's kidney

457
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,960
is not cured well.

458
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,040
But he died so suddenly.

459
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,120
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

460
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,880
We checked their couple.

461
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
They're quite loving.

462
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,120
Moreover, after Gong You Cheng died,

463
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,520
the property was distributed to his wife and a couple on average.

464
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,720
I believe his wife didn't have any motive to kill.

465
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,600
And Qing Hua's body.

466
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
She's not the only one who's not guilty.

467
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,520
She's the one who killed him.

468
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
She's the one who killed him.

469
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
She's the one who killed him.

470
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
She's the one who killed him.

471
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,440
Is there anyone else suspicious?

472
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,960
We checked the people around him.

473
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
One of them is a servant.

474
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,400
He often goes to the pharmacy to buy Chinese medicine for him.

475
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
I don't know if it's related.

476
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,800
Do you know who this person is?

477
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
His name is Xu Jiaxin.

478
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,480
He's been a private bodyguard of Gong You Cheng for three years.

479
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,520
He was once a thief.

480
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,960
He was imprisoned in the city of Dalan.

481
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,000
Dalan again?

482
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Do you think he knows Rachel?

483
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,560
I don't rule out this possibility.

484
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,840
Although he's in the same prison,

485
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,560
it doesn't mean they know each other.

486
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,680
Gao Si'er, someone's here to see you.

487
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,600
Who?

488
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Lu Yongpeng.

489
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm waiting for your good news.

490
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,160
If I tell you everything,

491
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
what's the point?

492
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,760
I want to see how valuable your testimony is.

493
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,520
Okay. What do you want to know?

494
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,720
The mobile game

495
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,280
is trying to trick the world.

496
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
Is that person your master?

497
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Yes.

498
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Have you ever tried to use your master's identity

499
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,280
in the game

500
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,880
to direct Lin Kun,

501
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,080
Zhong Guoxiang,

502
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,280
Wang Siqing,

503
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,040
and the missing police officer,

504
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,560
Wang Zhenxiong, to do something?

505
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,360
I heard Wang Zhenxiong is your uncle.

506
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,760
Your uncle is a good police officer.

507
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,680
I remember last year,

508
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,840
Dai Zufu was in the dark.

509
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,320
I made an order in the game.

510
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,200
I asked them to help get those witnesses.

511
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,560
I don't want those witnesses to be in court.

512
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,360
That means

513
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,520
you've been in the police

514
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,400
stealing the police's confidential information

515
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
and helping Dai Zufu.

516
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
You want him to avoid the interrogation

517
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,160
over and over again, right?

518
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I didn't.

519
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,280
You just said you did.

520
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,480
Now you say you didn't.

521
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,720
You don't cooperate.

522
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,920
It's hard for me to turn you into a false witness.

523
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you have it or not?

524
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
I have it.

525
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
But I'm not helping Dai Zufu.

526
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Mommy.

527
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
Why are you here?

528
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,760
I hope that no matter what happens in the future,

529
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,560
I can stay by your side and be with you.

530
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Mommy.

531
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,920
I can choose again.

532
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't want to be a police officer anymore.

533
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,000
I want to be a good mommy.

534
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Why are you here?

535
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,720
Mr. Zhu.

536
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,120
Why are you here?

537
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,040
I was caught.

538
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Why are you here?

539
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Your wife's hand was caught.

540
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Sorry.

541
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Have you thought about it?

542
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I can help you.

543
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Promise me.

544
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,360
Just let my friend go.

545
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Don't worry about me.

546
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
You're not leaving?

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,480
My wife is here.

548
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
I want to save her.

549
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Okay.

550
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Let's eat.

551
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
No mercy.

552
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,040
Are all the people who like tension,

553
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,240
excitement,

554
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,800
and hope.

555
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,680
Welcome to the Black Show.

556
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,400
You guys haven't written down

557
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,040
the competition you've been No. 3 for

558
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,960
last night.

559
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,040
You must not miss it.

560
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,560
Our favorite No. 3

561
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,920
will play with us on stage.

562
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:46,200

Are your feet okay?

595
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,060
They seem to be light.

Hello.

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,060
I am Super Star representative.

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,900
I am responsible for the Chinese region.

637
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,420
I think your appearance and temperament

638
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,540
are very potential.

639
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,660
I don't know if you are interested

640
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,940

641
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,180
Sorry.

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,540
I am here with my friend today.

This is not a problem.

644
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,540
Our company

646
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,620
By the way,

647
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,380
have you learned to sing and dance?

648
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,140
No.

649
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,340
I don't know how to dance.

650
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,420
It doesn't matter.

651
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,700
As long as we think it's appropriate,

652
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,220
we will make some courses

653
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,660

I hope you know

657
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,460
this is a rare opportunity.

658
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,020
Think about it carefully.

659
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
I am sorry.

660
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,860
I am sorry.

661
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,460
If it wasn't for me,

662
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,140
you wouldn't be like this.

663
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,060
Super Star,

664
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,580
it's none of your business.

665
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,780
I just want to be

666
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,220
your golden agent.

667
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,340
No.

668
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,660
There are many kinds of artists.

669
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,940
You can sing,

670
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,620

671
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,820

Now you have such a good opportunity.

674
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,260
Why don't you try it?

675
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Maybe these are not for me.

676
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,500
No.

677
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,180
You were not like this before.

678
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,860
You are very strong.

Don't follow me anymore.

There is a boat out two days later.

738
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,620
Find your own way up.

739
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Get up. It's time to eat.

740
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Get up. It's time to eat.

741
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Get up. Don't sleep.

742
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
It's time to eat. Get up.

743
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,180
Get up.

744
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
Someone ran away.

745
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
Come in.

746
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Brother Qiang, the two women in the black room ran away.

747
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
We've sent people to find them.

748
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
How could this be?

749
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Which room? Who is it?

750
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Cai Peiwen from room 16.

751
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Cai Peiwen?

752
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
And He Tianru from room 5.

753
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Do we need to report this to Mr. Dai?

754
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
No.

755
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Stand here and go out and find him.

756
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Okay.

757
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
What should we do? If the godfather knows that He Tianru ran away,

758
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
it will be bad.

759
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
It's okay. Calm down.

760
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Stay in the room and do your work.

761
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
I'll go to the control room and see what's going on.

Don't worry about me. Just go.

You called me out. I'm already very grateful to you.

769
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
My name is He Tianru.

Thank you.

771
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,180
My name is Ruiya, Cai Peiwen.

I have a good sister outside.

775
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Her name is Li Yaowen.

Rachel?

779

It's been eight years.

780
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
There's no justice in this world.

781
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,180
There's no retribution. There's no evil.

782
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Since you can't punish them,

783
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
then I'll use my method to take revenge. What's wrong with that?

784
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
There's another mole in the police force.

785
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
And this person is the one

786
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180

You're killing people without a reason.

For such a scumbag,

791
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
you've been in prison for your whole life.

792
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Do you think it's worth it?
