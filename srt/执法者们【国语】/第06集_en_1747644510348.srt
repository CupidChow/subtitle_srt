1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
I've always wondered

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,680
why Guangge would lose contact with the police.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,840
Also,

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,320
he knew something was wrong.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,600
He didn't tell Ouyang San

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,680
even though he was on 999.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,720
He thinks Ouyang San is also suspicious.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,880
If that's the case,

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,760
we don't know much more.

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,640
If the patients

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,760
can't be interrogated,

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
is there anything else?

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,160
Wait.

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,200
Wait for the miracle to happen.

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,040
But

16
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,560
the whole world is in a panic.

17
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,160
This is a problem

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,120
that all patients are facing.

19
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,080
If you put it this way,

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,280
will the organ business

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,720
be the only way out?

22
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,000
My daughter

23
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,520
has a red fetus in her waist.

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,440
Look.

25
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,440
She doesn't have it.

26
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,720
This is made by the ANA.

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello.

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,360
Hello, Mr. Liu.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,760
I'm Li Guanjie,

30
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
Senior Investigator of the Missing People Investigation Team.

31
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,960
We've been to

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,920
Liu Hui Ling's school

33
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,640
and asked the staff there.

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
She hasn't been back to school or work recently.

35
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,240
We'll continue to investigate.

36
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
If there's any further news,

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
I'll notify you as soon as possible.

38
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,440
Thank you.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,580
Practically스

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,800
Is the private hospital

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,400
going to continue the investigation?

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Mr. Zhou, I...

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Can you do an investigation with the private hospital?

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
Mr. Zhou, I...

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Sorry, sir.

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,880
Sit down.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,080
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,600
Go on.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,920
Mr. Zhou.

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,400
We took the information from the private hospitals.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
But not all of them are willing to give it.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
So there are not many people in the list this time.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,720
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,880
I've done a simple investigation.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,280
The families of these people are relatively rich.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,600
It seems that they have a chance to trade.

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,480
But we will also check

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,720
their family backgrounds,

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
bank information, etc.

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
See if there are any problems.

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
Have you finished the report we brought back?

62
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,920
Those patients of Dota Zeng are more rich.

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Not only the chairman of the listed company,

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,720
but also the senior,

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
even the boss.

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,360
It takes more time to investigate them.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,600
This Dota Zeng

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,360
has such a bad attitude.

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I really suspect

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
that he may have hidden things.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Although he can keep it,

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,080
it's a pity that we don't have any evidence.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
As long as there are patients

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,760
who meet the conditions in the list,

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,360
we will check them one by one.

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
None of them are black.

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,480
Yes, sir.

78
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Mr. Dong Guicheng, the chairman of FireLive,

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,520
held a press conference today.

80
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
He said that he had something important to announce.

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,280
He's coming out.

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,040
He's coming out.

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,200
He's coming out.

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Mr. Dong is now out to meet the reporters.

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,720
Let's hear what he has to say.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
I have something

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
that I hope you can help me spread.

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,040
Today,

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,560
I want to find my daughter publicly.

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,880
My daughter Dong Xin Yue

91
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
has been missing for seven days.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
This is my daughter.

93
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
On the night she disappeared,

94
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
I contacted the police.

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
But the family waited for me for seven days.

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
There is no news of her.

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
I want to get 300 million.

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
Whoever finds my daughter,

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,880
I will give her 300 million.

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,360
Is Dong Xin Yue kidnapped?

101
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,600
Did she run away from home?

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,640
What's your relationship?

103
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,760
I don't rule out anyone.

104
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,400
I want to use my daughter

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,440
to attack me and hurt me.

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
Now,

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
I have no bottom line and no morality.

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
Who is the person in charge of the police?

109
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Did the police start the search?

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
The police have never

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
listed this as a kidnapping case.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,720
Because no kidnappers have contacted me.

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
If they are really capable,

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,320
there will be no more thieves

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,200
in the world.

116
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,360
So today,

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
I directly contacted everyone

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,640
to help me find my daughter publicly.

119
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
I hope all of you

120
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,280
can be like saying that I'm not.

121
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,480
I will immediately spread this matter

122
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
online.

123
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
I will spread it as far as I can.

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Anyone who wants to plot against me,

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
listen to me carefully.

126
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Your life is worth 300 million.

127
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,120
You can choose to take 300 million

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,280
and return my daughter to me.

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,480
Or wait for the people around you to betray you.

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,920
I think in this world,

131
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
most people

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
will never make so much money.

133
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Listen carefully.

134
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
This is my last warning.

135
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,360
You'd better not hurt my daughter.

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,840
Don't even think about killing her.

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
If my daughter has one more hair,

138
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,760
I will kill you.

139
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
I will do everything I can

140
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,680
to find you.

141
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
But you can't get a cent.

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
Let me in.

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
I have a friend.

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,600
Mr. Zhou.

145
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,360
What a coincidence.

146
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,840
Can you help me?

147
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
My daughter is missing.

148
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
When was the last time

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,080
you saw your daughter?

150
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,560
About half a month ago.

151
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
She went home to pack up

152
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
and said she was moving out.

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,480
You haven't seen her since she moved out?

154
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
But we will sometimes

155
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
send messages to each other

156
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
to keep in touch.

157
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
When was the last time you sent messages?

158
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
Last Wednesday.

159
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Can you take a look?

160
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,840
Last week,

161
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,000
I went to her house

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,480
to buy her food.

163
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
But I was afraid to disturb her.

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
So I left the food at the door.

165
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,480
How's your relationship with your daughter?

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Since my wife left,

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
we have less and less communication.

168
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
After that,

169
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
my daughter grew up

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
and we are not that close.

171
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
Could it be

172
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
that your relationship with your daughter is normal

173
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
and she wants to avoid you

174
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
and doesn't want to see you?

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
That's why you can't get in touch?

176
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,520
My wife was angry a few days ago.

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,200
Even if she was angry at me,

178
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,920
she wouldn't like me as her daddy.

179
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Usually, she would come that day.

180
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,880
But she didn't come that day.

181
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
I called her but no one answered.

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
She didn't reply to my messages.

183
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,960
I went to her house to press the doorbell.

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
But no one responded.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,760
Even last week,

186
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
I bought her food

187
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,600
and left it at the door.

188
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
But she didn't move.

189
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
Could it be that she

190
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
went out with her friends?

191
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
I tried everything.

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,200
But I couldn't find her.

193
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
If she really wants to avoid you,

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
how could you find her?

195
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Because we police

197
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
need a lot of fake information.

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
I promised her mother

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,520
that I would take good care of her.

200
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
All these years,

201
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I've tried my best

202
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,680
to take the responsibility

203
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,840
that a father should take.

204
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm usually very busy.

205
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,320
I don't have much time to spend with her.

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,760
The only thing I can give her

207
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,800
is unlimited support

208
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
in the economy.

209
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Alright.

210
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
I sent her to the boarding school

211
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
and thought it was good for her.

212
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,000
But who knew

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,280
she would be more and more distant.

214
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,000
The Public Relations Department

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
has received

216
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,660
more than 50

217
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,440
media inquiries in the past 15 minutes.

218
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
They are all about Dong Xinyue.

219
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
Call Dong Guicheng immediately.

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
Jiao A'Fei,

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
have you found my daughter?

222
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Mr. Dong,

223
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
why didn't you

224
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,120
inform me about the press conference?

225
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,320
Chief,

226
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,400
it's been seven days.

227
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
There's no news at all.

228
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,640
My daughter can't wait any longer.

229
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
You saw it.

230
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
The news spread faster

231
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,600
through your complicated programs.

232
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
You came to me right away,

233
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
didn't you?

234
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Mr. Dong,

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
if this news spreads,

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm afraid

237
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
someone will be unfavorable to Miss Dong.

238
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,440
Are you just sitting here and waiting?

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm using 300 million

240
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,880
to ask the whole city to help me find my daughter.

241
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,480
Isn't it more efficient?

242
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,520
Chief,

243
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
I don't want to embarrass you.

244
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
If you can do it,

245
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm also happy.

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,200
I can give those 300 million to the police.

247
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
You can donate it to the welfare fund.

248
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,880
I can do anything.

249
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,200
Do you have anything else to say?

250
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
Mr. Dong,

251
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,080
I just hope that

252
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
you can inform us

253
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
before you do anything

254
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,360
so that we can know

255
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
how to help you sooner.

256
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Now that things are getting worse,

257
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,760
the citizens of the entire port

258
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,880
must be watching us.

259
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,800
No matter what,

260
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
find Dong Xinyue as soon as possible.

261
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,040
Yes, sir.

262
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,720
Because there are birthmarks

263
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,120
in her right waist.

264
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
But there are no girls in the video.

265
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
So I suspect

266
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
that this video was made by AI.

267
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,280
What's your daughter's social media account?

268
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Annie Liu.

269
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,800
Annie Liu.

270
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,040
Please send it to CSTCB.

271
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,200
Where does your daughter usually go?

272
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
She usually goes to the beach

273
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,560
to dance.

274
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
Sorry.

275
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,120
Mr. Lei.

276
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes, sir.

277
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Sorry.

278
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,880
I have something to do. I have to leave for a while.

279
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
Would you mind if I

280
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
get you a sample of DNA

281
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
to help you find your daughter?

282
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
No problem.

283
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Lin, help me deal with it.

284
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Sorry.

285
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,480
Come in.

286
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,480
Sir.

287
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
We have contacted Dong Guicheng.

288
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,200
We haven't confirmed

289
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,480
whether there are kidnappers

290
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
or just missing.

291
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
But no matter what,

292
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,720
we will do our best to find Dong Xinyue.

293
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,720
This time,

294
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
we are not only

295
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,160
protecting the reputation of the police,

296
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,520
but also saving people.

297
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
The chief is very concerned about this case.

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
If you can

299
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
press the number,

300
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
press it first.

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Go back and arrange the people.

302
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
Send the photos of Dong Xinyue

303
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
to each colleague

304
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,520
and check all the police teams.

305
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,040
Pay attention to

306
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,440
where Dong Xinyue is.

307
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Yes, sir.

308
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,480
Mr. Zhou.

309
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,120
Are we going to find the deputy general Dong Xinyue?

310
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes.

311
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,360
I heard from the superior

312
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
that no one should do anything.

313
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
We just need to find out whether the kidnapper is real.

314
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,760
Yes.

315
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,400
All come in and watch the meeting.

316
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Mr. Zhou.

317
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,080
His account is private.

318
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,600
We only got this picture for now.

319
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Thank you.

320
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
The person we are looking for

321
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
is him, Liu Huiling.

322
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,480
His father is the current

323
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Lv Zhengsi's

324
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,960
Rehabilitation Department's police officer,

325
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
Liu Yufan.

326
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,320
Last week, he and his father

327
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,800
lost contact

328
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,320
after sending the last message.

329
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,560
Mr. Zhou.

330
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Now the whole police team

331
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,600
is looking for Dong Xinyue.

332
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,920
This is the order of the superior.

333
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
We really don't follow it.

334
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes.

335
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,480
If the superior blames us,

336
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
we don't know how to explain it.

337
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
And that Liu Yufan

338
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,440
is so annoying.

339
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
He just pretends to be a good person.

340
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,680
We have insufficient evidence

341
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,280
and we have the wrong procedure.

342
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Maybe his daughter is afraid of him

343
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
and she hates him.

344
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,560
Yes.

345
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
He just does his own work.

346
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
He makes sure that every case

347
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,520
can be checked.

348
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,200
You look like you know him very well.

349
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,600
Are you friends?

350
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,280
Just a little.

351
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,440
The whole police team is looking for Dong Xinyue.

352
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,760
What about the other cases?

353
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Sir.

354
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,400
But I don't understand

355
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
why you are helping that supervisor.

356
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm not helping him.

357
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,480
You said it yourself.

358
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,520
Now the whole police team

359
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,360
is looking for Dong Xinyue.

360
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
And

361
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
there are 300 million people

362
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
who want to get him.

363
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,120
It's enough.

364
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Then we'll go to him.

365
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,920
Any problem?

366
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,480
No, sir.

367
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,720
Thank you.

368
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,240
I will transfer the rent

369
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,960
for a year to you.

370
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,160
No hurry.

371
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
I hope you can find your daughter soon.

372
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Thank you.

373
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Yes.

374
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,640
Let's go!

375
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,620
What organised by sea?

376
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,260
Then you become the

377
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:39,300
late

378
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,880
If you tell me the truth to play an evil game two go ahead

379
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,580
Won't you pay for it either

380
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Comparison

381
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,840
Monica

382
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's vote again

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
on the basis of allmitch

384
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,600
let you

385
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,340
I know you

386
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,920
Don't do it

387
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,800
I've beenнес for a long time

388
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,640
You know what

389
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,480
Good luck

390
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,140
Go ahead

391
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,960
I will

392
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,620
house

393
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,360
You go ahead

394
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,500
Put theNotes on.

395
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Just do what you want

396
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,560
What do you want

397
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,320
Really

398
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,280
On the way

399
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,820
I don't want to get too excited

400
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,300
don't get into graduated

401
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,300
Maybe that guy should have more women

402
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,220
but my daughter

403
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,580
are all look extinction

404
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,460
Do you want to become the ambassador艾妮?

405
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,980
My offer is not open

406
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,780
you are not a specialist

407
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,780
your job is not be a therapist

408
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,540
Never

409
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,220
if I ask she will accept me

410
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm not sure.

411
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
And then?

412
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,740
After I broke up with her,

413
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,380
I never contacted her again.

414
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,100
She hasn't been back for days.

415
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,340
Annie is teaching dance here.

416
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,060
She's very diligent.

417
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,460
So more and more students come to her.

418
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,780
I told her,

419
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,900
why not focus on teaching dance here?

420
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,820
But she said she has her own life.

421
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,860
So she insists on working at the restaurant.

422
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,060
Every time I see her,

423
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,460
I feel sorry for her.

424
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,540
Is she in a hurry to use money?

425
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,300
She said she wants to save money to go to Korea to chase dreams.

426
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Korea?

427
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,380
Did she say when she will go to Korea?

428
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,820
I really don't know.

429
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,340
When I broke up with her,

430
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,300
I didn't know what she was doing or thinking.

431
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,140
Ready.

432
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,660
Five, six, seven, eight.

433
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,780
One, two, and three.

434
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,060
Open your chest. Open your chest wider.

435
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,100
Ready.

436
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,660
Four, turn around.

437
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Kick.

438
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Okay.

439
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,700
Lift your feet higher.

440
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
You're doing great.

441
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Lift your feet higher.

442
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,140
Harder. This position.

443
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,420
Lift higher.

444
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Harder.

445
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
The egg is hot.

446
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Try it.

447
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,060
Eat slowly.

448
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,660
I know.

449
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Egg.

450
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,860
You brat.

451
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,260
You even took my egg.

452
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
I want to eat.

453
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,660
Don't eat so cheap.

454
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,060
I'll buy you one.

455
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
You're so lucky.

456
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,260
Thanks to you,

457
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,740
I slept in the hospital and met my girlfriend.

458
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Doctor?

459
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Nurse.

460
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm not a doctor.

461
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
I'm a doctor.

462
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm a doctor.

463
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
I'm a doctor.

464
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I'm a doctor.

465
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
I'm a doctor.

466
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,620
You're a good man.

467
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
You work in shifts.

468
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,700
You know it.

469
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
You worked in the Navy in your early days.

470
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
What?

471
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,100
Do you want me to teach you some tricks?

472
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,580
You called me here to see you look pale.

473
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,380
No.

474
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,420
But I'm here to work.

475
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,660
The most important thing is the shape.

476
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,820
Look at you.

477
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,460
You're so clumsy.

478
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,980
You deserve to be unlucky.

479
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,140
Let me help you tidy up.

480
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Don't touch me.

481
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,100
You're a man.

482
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't think you're not going to be

483
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
a good man.

484
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Look at me.

485
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Hello, how are you, Ren?

486
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Don't eat.

487
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
No progress.

488
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm going to watch the navy.

489
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Wait.

490
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Chou Yaozi.

491
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,820
Have you learned to dance?

492
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Yes.

493
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
So?

494
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
You.

495
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,300
Have you read my message?

496
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,900
Didn't I say I'd come back to pack up?

497
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,500
My friends and I rented a place

498
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
and we're moving out.

499
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Have you read my message?

500
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Didn't I say I'd come back to pack up?

501
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,700
I rented a place with my friends

502
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
and we're moving out.

503
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,300
I didn't put in the죠

504
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
You only spent seven dollars.

505
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,500
YouI

506
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't be afraid.

507
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,780
I have nothing to lose.

508
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,900
I have nothing to lose.

509
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,220
Don't worry.

510
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,100
Is that wine?

511
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Nothing.

512
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,280
Hello?

513
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,580
I just soup.

514
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,980
Make it spicy.

515
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,980
Make it creamy.

516
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,460
Uncle Hu,

517
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,020
what did I miss the most?

518
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,820
You had fantastic dance moves today.

519
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
I killed one of them.

520
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,060
Have you been to Booker H comparing dreams and dreams?

521
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,260
No, I didn't.

522
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,220
How?

523
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,220
Okay.

524
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,060
I won't bet you on魏疑伦 again.

525
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,820
Look.

526
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,740
I'm sure you did a great job.

527
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,940
Fine, fine, all right.

528
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,220
Hello, nice to meet you.

529
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm Devin.

530
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,320
Gordon.

531
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,880
It's my first time here.

532
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,640
It's really nice here.

533
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,280
You danced well.

534
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
Did you dance for a long time?

535
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,700
Just for fun.

536
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,500
What about you?

537
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
Do you dance here often?

538
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,740
Yeah.

539
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm poor.

540
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,240
I don't have money to rent the studio.

541
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
That's why I come here.

542
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,500
Do you know

543
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,380
Do you know this girl?

544
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,180
Your girlfriend?

545
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,020
No.

546
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,220
My friend said she danced here.

547
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,900
She danced well.

548
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,020
She's going to join the group.

549
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
Annie

550
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,340
used to come with Carrie every time.

551
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,380
But I haven't seen them recently.

552
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,500
I heard they were going to Korea for training.

553
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,060
But Carrie is like this.

554
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,860
I think Annie is not in the mood to dance.

555
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,940
What happened to Carrie?

556
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Everyone in Hong Kong is looking for her.

557
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,420
I just found out from the news.

558
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Her father is the boss of Forever Live.

559
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,380
I see.

560
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,260
By the way,

561
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,660
you can find me if you want to join the group.

562
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,380
I'm fine.

563
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,180
Okay.

564
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,300
I'll make a call.

565
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,500
Hello?

566
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,940
How's it going?

567
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,860
Zhou Si'er.

568
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,420
Liu Huilin and Dong Xinyue are friends.

569
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,100
They danced at the beach park.

570
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,380
But they didn't come recently.

571
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
They said they were going to Korea for training.

572
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,420
Okay, we'll talk later.

573
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,860
A'Bao.

574
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,660
Can you see Liu Huilin's post?

575
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,900
We're waiting for the reply from CSTCB.

576
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,660
She said everyone is going to check Dong Xinyue.

577
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,620
So we have to wait.

578
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,100
What about Dong Xinyue's account?

579
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,620
I want it.

580
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,860
Ella Noodles

581
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,620
This one.

582
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,780
Take it down and have a look.

583
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,660
Stop.

584
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,700
This one.

585
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,300
Liu Huilin?

586
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,860
So they know each other.

587
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,300
How come they disappeared together?

588
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,940
It's possible that

589
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,300
they disappeared together.

590
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
Check their records.

591
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,860
Okay.

592
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,620
Hello?

593
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,220
Hello.

594
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,500
Did you receive my message?

595
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,740
I saw it on Annie's schedule.

596
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,420
I don't know who is Carrie.

597
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,380
Could it be related to her disappearance?

598
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,300
Carrie is Dong Xinyue.

599
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,140
Mr. Dong.

600
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,060
A person from the crime team is looking for you.

601
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,060
Mr. Dong.

602
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,860
We have new findings

603
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,900
about your daughter's disappearance.

604
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,420
We found that

605
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,180
your daughter and another missing person

606
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,420
knew each other temporarily.

607
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,820
And they disappeared

608
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,700
very close.

609
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
We have reason to suspect

610
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
that they disappeared together.

611
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,380
Then can we find

612
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,260
my daughter?

613
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,620
If we find

614
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,140
the place where they are related,

615
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
we can narrow the scope

616
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,860
and find them as soon as possible.

617
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,580
How do you want to find them?

618
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,060
This one.

619
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,220
He is the missing person,

620
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,140
Liu Huning's father.

621
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,700
How did your daughter know Annie?

622
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,260
Where did she take her?

623
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,460
How do I know

624
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,460
how they know each other?

625
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,780
Where did they

626
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,660
go?

627
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,340
Did they have any

628
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,740
good friends?

629
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,020
Do you know?

630
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,060
Miss likes to dance girl group dance.

631
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,140
She often asks a group of friends to dance.

632
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,220
But she doesn't let the bodyguard

633
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,500
follow her every time.

634
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,500
So we don't know where she went.

635
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,780
But she will send a location

636
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,740
to ask the bodyguard to pick her up.

637
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,260
Why do you say that now?

638
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,780
I told you to look after her.

639
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Dong.

640
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,500
She is your daughter.

641
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,140
Why did you give her to others?

642
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,140
This kind of thing,

643
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,180
a person of your level

644
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,140
won't understand.

645
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,540
She wants a father,

646
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,580
not a bodyguard.

647
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,980
Giving her money is not equal to taking responsibility.

648
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,260
How dare you say that about me?

649
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,260
If you look after your daughter,

650
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,060
she won't disappear.

651
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,700
You two,

652
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,340
why don't you find your daughter first

653
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,260
and then study how to be a good father?

654
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,540
Where is your daughter's room?

655
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,140
I want to see.

656
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Dong.

657
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,740
Are you a police or am I a police now?

658
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,980
You fight with her like this.

659
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,660
She drove you away.

660
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,620
You can't do anything.

661
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
I'm sorry, Mr. Dong.

662
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,340
Can I go up to your daughter's room

663
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,500
and see what clues are there?

664
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,860
A'Li, take A'Ci up.

665
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
This way, please.

666
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,220
Miss,

667
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,820
you like Korean girl groups very much.

668
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,420
You often learn them to dance

669
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,460
in front of the mirror.

670
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
It sounds like you have a good relationship with Miss.

671
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,500
I brought her up since childhood.

672
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,100
Mr. Dong is too busy at work.

673
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,660
He gave her to me to take care of.

674
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,820
It's been so many years.

675
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Of course, he has feelings.

676
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm also worried about him.

677
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,340
First stuff,

678
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,980
food.

679
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,940
Something embarrassing.

680
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,940
Something annoying.

681
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
We are to 여린끌.

682
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,780
Something embarrassing.

683
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,260
Can you to act for a moment?

684
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,620
Kim Nam Jin is so fights with others.

685
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,260
He should take care of others as well.

686
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm sorry.

687
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,260
How's it?

688
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Any leads?

689
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
You're in a hurry.

690
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,820
You can't help much.

691
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,660
Trust me. Leave it to me.

692
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,820
I'll tell you as soon as I get the news.

693
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,660
Any leads?

694
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,020
Comparing Liu Hui Ling's DNA

695
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,900
with the body of the sloth,

696
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,780
there's no difference.

697
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,420
Sir.

698
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,700
Liu Hui Ling is a second-year student

699
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,740
of the Academy of Performing Arts.

700
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
We found a school.

701
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
He didn't go to school recently

702
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
and didn't take leave.

703
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,380
These students

704
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,660
won't go to school every day.

705
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,340
The CSTCB

706
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,980
found Liu Hui Ling's social media account.

707
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,300
I found some photos

708
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,940
that said,

709
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
So here we go.

710
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,140
And the latest dance video

711
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,340
was produced by AI.

712
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,380
He loves K-pop so much.

713
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,140
Did he really go to Korea to dance?

714
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,180
They didn't have any entry records.

715
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,820
What's the last location of the phone?

716
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,860
Near the dock.

717
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,020
Qiang, He Niu,

718
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,780
check it.

719
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,780
Yes, sir.

720
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,660
Mr. Dong.

721
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,980
Mr. Dong.

722
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,820
Someone's calling.

723
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,620
It's for you.

724
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,020
He said he would let you answer it.

725
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Mr. Dong.

726
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,620
Your daughter is here.

727
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,940
If you want to save her,

728
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,420
call 3 billion.

729
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,460
Everyone in Hong Kong knows

730
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,340
that I'm looking for my daughter for 3 billion.

731
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
How can I know

732
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,300
if you're telling the truth?

733
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,460
Daddy.

734
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,060
Miss.

735
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,820
Carrie.

736
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,300
Daddy.

737
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,700
Come and save me.

738
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,060
Daddy.

739
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,380
Save me.

740
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,460
Change it according to this suggestion.

741
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,980
Half of the people here are missing.

742
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,700
I think the way of arrangement

743
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
is too much freedom.

744
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,060
Many colleagues will adjust their shifts

745
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
and go to work with acquaintances.

746
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,060
If someone is bribed,

747
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,860
they can easily cover up for each other

748
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,220
and let the illegal goods flow in.

749
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,140
There will be many enemies

750
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,420
who do justice.

751
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,260
I think in the working environment,

752
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,980
it's not the most important thing

753
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,260
to have friends.

754
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,460
As a leader of a team,

755
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,180
it's better to have more friends

756
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,740
than more enemies.

757
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,660
Moreover, you are now

758
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,580
the enemy of the whole world.

759
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,540
Why do you have to make yourself difficult?

760
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,180
I understand.

761
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,340
But if I do the right thing

762
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,940
and offend others,

763
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,180
I have no choice.

764
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
I'm here to work,

765
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,740
not to make friends.

766
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,260
Good.

767
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,020
Recently, the police

768
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,500
found a batch of illegal antibiotics

769
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,060
in a traffic accident

770
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,620
in the drug store.

771
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,860
They didn't even unpack the package.

772
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,420
This is a report

773
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,220
from the police.

774
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
I suspect that someone in the airport

775
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,740
has taken advantage of it

776
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,820
and put this batch of drugs in.

777
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,380
I think it's a right decision

778
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,540
to pass this report to you.

779
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,300
A few days ago,

780
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,180
a traffic accident happened.

781
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,140
We found a body of antibiotics

782
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,780
and a batch of antibiotics

783
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,940
for organ transplant patients.

784
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,980
And this batch of drugs

785
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,940
is a drug of the drug table

786
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,140
that the medical department has listed.

787
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,900
It's not allowed to enter the capital.

788
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,780
This batch of drugs was transported to Hong Kong

789
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
by air. They didn't even unpack the package.

790
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,580
Our customs airport department

791
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,060
will check some goods

792
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,340
from the high-risk areas to Hong Kong.

793
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,380
This batch of drugs

794
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,420
was transported by Mexico to Hong Kong.

795
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,020
Mexico is one of the high-risk areas.

796
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,580
Even if the source is the high-risk areas,

797
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,300
you should

798
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,180
check them gradually.

799
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,940
There will be a chance to be exposed.

800
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,220
Only those who are in the police station

801
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,220
can decide which goods to unpack.

802
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,060
Besides these drugs,

803
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,820
in this batch of goods,

804
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,300
there are also old-fashioned air-blows

805
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,500
that were sent by Mexico to Hong Kong.

806
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,780
We will check the goods

807
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,540
that were transported by

808
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,900
the Chinese police.

809
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,420
But I checked the list.

810
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
The goods were not checked that day.

811
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,500
So the drugs can enter the capital smoothly.

812
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,540
This is the list of the police

813
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,220
who were on duty that day.

814
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,220
Chen Jingyi,

815
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,460
Zhang Zonghan and Huang Junxing.

816
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,420
And the list of the checks

817
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,780
was decided by them.

818
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,660
You mean

819
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,740
these three people have the chance to take advantage

820
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,860
and deliberately let that batch of drugs enter the capital?

821
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,180
Yes.

822
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
Godfather,

823
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,860
we have been very busy this time.

824
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
We finally found the mole.

825
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
But the position of the managers

826
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,180
in the group is vacant.

827
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,980
We can't trust the new assistants

828
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,260
to replace them.

829
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,340
Yes.

830
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,900
The group has been stopped for so long.

831
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,620
The market is not good.

832
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,340
If we sell the goods now,

833
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,460
we will earn at least two times the price.

834
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,540
Do you want to stop when I tell you to?

835
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,140
Boss, I just want to...

836
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,740
Godfather's order

837
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,260
is the final order of the group.

838
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,100
You dare not obey it.

839
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
You want to punish us.

840
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
Don't wrong me.

841
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,980
Do you want me to take a few days off

842
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,300
and you take my position?

843
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,020
Don't joke, boss.

844
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,180
No one can take your position.

845
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,220
But the most important thing is

846
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,300
you know I didn't do anything wrong to you.

847
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,540
I told you to find a mole.

848
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,020
You ruined such an important thing

849
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,940
for Cheng.

850
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,300
Do you think the group is too many

851
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,900
and want me to fire you?

852
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,220
So, boss,

853
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,900
you should organize your own car team as soon as possible.

854
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
Don't just run away from those people.

855
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,220
You know you can't trust them.

856
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,740
And

857
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,820
it's hard to find Cheng's blood type.

858
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,740
But don't worry.

859
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,860
I will handle it.

860
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,060
When the heart is about to arrive,

861
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,460
we can do the operation.

862
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,620
Don't worry.

863
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,700
I can hold on and I won't die.

864
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,020
It's a little late for my nephew Dennis

865
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,180
to help the group.

866
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,980
You don't have to worry about me.

867
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
Cheng,

868
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,140
you don't have to say good words for him.

869
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,620
Right, boss.

870
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,900
A new girl came to my company.

871
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,340
Guess who she is.

872
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,340
She is the daughter of Dong Guicheng.

873
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,260
Dong Guicheng from Forever Life?

874
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,900
Sir,

875
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,460
all four companies are entertainment companies.

876
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
Yes.

877
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,060
Except for those dancers and friends,

878
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,300
the two of them are mainly concerned

879
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,700
about Han Xing and the entertainment company.

880
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,780
According to their likes,

881
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
labels and comments,

882
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,260
they are the four entertainment companies.

883
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
It seems that they

884
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,340
like to be star dreamers.

885
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,060
Let's go to these companies.

886
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,500
Hello.

887
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,740
OK.

888
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,300
Uncle Xiang went to the port of the village gate.

889
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,740
He didn't find it.

890
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,900
Let's go.

891
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,100
Thank you, sir.

892
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,540
Thank you, sir.

893
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,780
Hello, what can I do for you?

894
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,820
Hello.

895
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,740
The general office is heavily involved.

896
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,140
Senior officer Zhou Junjie.

897
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,980
There is a missing case

898
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,140
that I want to talk to you about.

899
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,740
Dong Xinyue, Liu Huilin.

900
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,260
Have you trained here?

901
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,980
Their plan

902
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,460
was completed half a year ago.

903
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,020
They haven't come here since then.

904
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,260
They came to the audition three months ago.

905
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,980
But they didn't get into the selection.

906
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,620
We just finished the selection

907
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,860
after receiving their registration.

908
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,140
Some of them were selected.

909
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,260
They were supposed to arrange a next-term

910
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,180
to notify the candidates for the selection.

911
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,020
These two girls,

912
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,500
Dong Xinyue and Liu Huilin,

913
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,700
are they your members?

914
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,580
I'm sorry.

915
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,820
I'm the receptionist.

916
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
I don't know the information of other students.

917
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,540
Or it's better to ask the person in charge.

918
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,220
OK.

919
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,620
Do you know

920
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,140
when the person in charge will come back?

921
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,260
I don't know either.

922
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,460
He hasn't been working for a few days.

923
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,220
I can't find him either.

924
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,660
Do you have his address?

925
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,540
I'm not sure.

926
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,340
Help me check

927
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,420
the information of the company's receptionist.

928
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,020
In this case,

929
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,300
please notify him

930
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,860
when the person in charge comes back.

931
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,340
I'll take care of him.

932
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,300
OK, no problem.

933
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,820
Thank you.

934
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,540
You're welcome.

935
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,420
Mr. Zhou.

936
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,260
I'm already

937
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,460
found the person in charge of the county residence channel.

938
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,860
But the person in charge cannot come back

939
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,180
or you can't go back.

940
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,860
Congratulations to такаяiai on being selected.

941
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
Mr. Zhou.

942
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,620
Thank you.

943
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,780
Many thanks.

944
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,260
It's a pleasure to be here.

945
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,380
Zhilun.

946
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,260
Have you checked any of the information?

947
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,180
No.

948
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,300
Depending on the level ofity,

949
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,860
we might get a few Foundation tomato juice.

950
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,780
Go.

951
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,940
Is anyone here?

952
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,900
Can you call the police on time?

953
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,060
Hello.

954
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,660
Excuse me.

955
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,900
Are you Mr. Liu Yufan?

956
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,020
I am...

957
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,900
This is Jiangji Cur through the hospital

958
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,520
A girl was sent into the hospital

959
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,900
Sorry

960
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,500
Sorry

961
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,420
Come in.

962
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,980
Karen.

963
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,980
Sir, who are you?

964
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,180
I'm her father.

965
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,980
What about you?

966
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
You're also a patient's family.

967
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,980
If you're not a patient's family,

968
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,860
please leave.

969
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,020
You can't enter the ward.

970
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,060
Doctor, how's my daughter?

971
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,980
What's her condition now?

972
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,940
She's in a coma for the time being.

973
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,260
But she's under initial examination.

974
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,540
There shouldn't be any major injuries.

975
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,180
It's mainly a sprain.

976
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,420
But I believe this injury

977
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,100
is not the reason for her coma.

978
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,900
We estimate that she'll wake up later.

979
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,660
We'll do a detailed examination

980
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,340
including a magnetic resonance scan.

981
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,140
No need.

982
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,220
I want to transfer to the hospital.

983
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,900
Sir,

984
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,980
before we know what happened to your daughter,

985
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,420
I suggest you

986
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,940
leave it to the hospital.

987
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,980
If you transfer without permission,

988
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,820
it may worsen her condition.

989
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,620
Sister Lian,

990
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,060
call Dr. Ma.

991
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,020
And some more experts

992
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
to take care of her.

993
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,620
Got it.

994
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,620
Dr. Ma,

995
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,580
I've called my private doctor.

996
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,740
You're not here.

997
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380
Since you insist,

998
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,500
please give him the file.

999
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,660
Doctor, I'm sorry.

1000
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,260
I want to ask you,

1001
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
do you remember

1002
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
if you said anything

1003
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,220
before the patient entered the ward?

1004
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,620
She was in a coma when she entered.

1005
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,500
She hasn't woken up.

1006
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,260
When will she wake up?

1007
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,540
When can we ask her questions?

1008
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,780
I can't answer you.

1009
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,660
Maybe after a while,

1010
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,300
or maybe after hours.

1011
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,180
Because we don't know

1012
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,460
what happened to her.

1013
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,820
Guys,

1014
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,260
how is it?

1015
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,900
Right, Anni?

1016
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,860
Two people came back alone.

1017
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,420
She must know something.

1018
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,740
When the hospital called her,

1019
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,500
she said she was wearing Anni's coat.

1020
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
She must know where Anni is.

1021
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,300
OK.

1022
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,420
I'll ask someone to check her stuff later.

1023
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,380
Pack up all the things

1024
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,580
and don't let anyone take them away.

1025
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,700
Dr. Dong, I'm sorry.

1026
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,500
Your daughter's case is not that simple.

1027
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,900
I suspect she...

1028
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,300
It's none of my business.

1029
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,460
Mr. Dong,

1030
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,660
according to the police regulations,

1031
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,940
Article 232 and 63,

1032
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,620
anyone should help the police.

1033
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,260
Otherwise,

1034
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,780
they can be charged with the crime of

1035
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,820
arresting a police officer for six months.

1036
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,780
The police wants to take my daughter's stuff

1037
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,460
to get her consent.

1038
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,820
But she's in a coma now.

1039
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,300
She must be in a coma to get her consent.

1040
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
It's me.

1041
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,460
And,

1042
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,100
have you got the search warrant?

1043
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,060
Or you suspect my daughter is a criminal

1044
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,900
and want to take her stuff back to be a witness?

1045
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Don't talk to me about the law.

1046
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,060
I'm more familiar with the law than you.

1047
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,020
Mr. Dong,

1048
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,540
you called the police for us.

1049
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,060
You...

1050
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,980
My daughter is found now.

1051
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,020
It's none of your business.

1052
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,860
OK. It's none of our business.

1053
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,380
As a father,

1054
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,180
you should understand the feelings of other fathers.

1055
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,340
If your daughter doesn't come back, it's fine.

1056
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,780
Dong Xinyue really knows my daughter.

1057
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,620
Now my daughter's life

1058
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,020
is in your hands.

1059
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,100
Can you help me

1060
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,980
to ask her?

1061
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,500
I'm begging you.

1062
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,820
Can you help me?

1063
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,100
Mr. Zhou,

1064
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,380
since my daughter is back,

1065
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,700
I'll solve the case tomorrow.

1066
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,020
I'm warning you.

1067
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,260
Don't bother my daughter again.

1068
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,940
If they really have a spy

1069
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,020
and have something to do with the black market,

1070
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,300
it's dangerous.

1071
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,500
Don't investigate anymore.

1072
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,380
Solve the case.

1073
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,900
It's heart and kidney again.

1074
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
I suspect that

1075
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,500
there is a huge

1076
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,340
and systematic

1077
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,500
organ販賣 group

1078
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,580
operating in Hong Kong.

1079
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,620
I didn't check it carefully.

1080
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,140
I don't know the situation inside is very dangerous.

1081
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,540
Have you been changed?

1082
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,900
Who is the one

1083
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,900
in the mirror

1084
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,060
with the rain?

1085
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,020
Is there any remorse?

1086
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,300
Without you by my side,

1087
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,300
it's more obvious.

1088
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,300
The falling leaves

1089
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,980
are like the wind.

1090
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,500
I'm tired of chasing

1091
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,900
the perfect world.

1092
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,660
No one can take me away.

1093
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,380
Who is in the far end?

1094
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,780
Who will fight for the world with me?

1095
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,860
Oh.

1096
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,260
Is there anyone

1097
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,020
to guard for me?

1098
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,780
I don't need too many reasons.

1099
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:46,140
In the dark, the fireflies light up.

1100
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,260
I don't retreat.

1101
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:57,060
The small road is my place.

1102
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,460
Until the end.

1103
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,260
Is there any remorse?

1104
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:16,780
Without you by my side,

1105
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
it's more obvious.

1106
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,780
The falling leaves

1107
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,180
are like the wind.

1108
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,980
I'm tired of chasing

1109
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:42,180
the perfect world.

1110
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,900
No one can take me away.

1111
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Who is in the far end?

1112
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,100
Who will fight for the world with me?

1113
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Oh.

1114
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,500
Is there anyone

1115
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,300
to guard for me?

1116
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,100
I don't need too many reasons.

1117
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,500
In the dark, the fireflies light up.

1118
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I don't retreat.

1119
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:20,300
The small road is my place.

1120
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,100
Until the end.

1121
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:42,100
Oh.

1122
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,900
Who can take me away?

1123
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,700
Who is in the far end?

1124
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,100
Who will fight for the world with me?

1125
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Oh.

1126
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,500
Is there anyone

1127
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,300
to guard for me?

1128
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,100
I don't need too many reasons.

1129
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,500
In the dark, the fireflies light up.

1130
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I don't retreat.

1131
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:22,500
The small road is my place.

1132
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,300
It doesn't matter.

1133
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:41,500
As long as you're here, it's OK.

1134
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm sorry.

1135
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm sorry.

1136
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
