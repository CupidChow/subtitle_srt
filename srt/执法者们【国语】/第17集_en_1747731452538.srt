1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
You're fighting with me?

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,680
You've won a lot.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,000
It's your wife's turn.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Stop it!

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm already very tired of living here.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Do you believe me?

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
I believe you.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm not a bad guy.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Take your friend away.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
No need to care.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,280
We'll find a way to get out of here.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,520
We must get out of here safely.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,560
You're not going to get out of here?

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

41
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

43
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm not going to get out of here.

49
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,080
Don't ignore me.

50
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,200
Go away.

51
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,600
You saved my life.

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,660
I am so grateful to you.

53
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,080
My name is He Tianyu,

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,460
Thanks.

55
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,260
multiply by two.

56
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,300
I appreciate you.

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
See you.

58
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Tianyu.

59
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,160
My name is Viya, Chow Pui-min.

60
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
We barely made it here.

61
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
You can't let them catch us.

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,040
I have a good sister-in-law outside.

63
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,280
Her name is Li Yamin.

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,400
I'll try to find her as soon as possible to save you.

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Li Yamin?

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,560
Rachel?

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
They're here. You should go.

68
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I can't leave.

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
My husband is still here. I have to find him.

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
You hide. I'll see where they are.

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
They're over there!

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Chase them!

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't let them escape!

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
They're here! Don't let them escape!

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Hurry up!

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't bother me!

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Hurry up!

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
No!

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Don't move!

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Hurry up!

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Miss Choi, the fugitive on the ground is dead.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
The other fugitive, He Tianyu, was taken away.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Send him to the study.

84
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes.

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
The 24th camera has a problem.

94
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Off-stop camera.

95
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
You go out and check.

96
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Where did you find it?

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I saw something strange in the ship.

99
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:29,960
It's a

100
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
control room.

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
The ship is not in the air.

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Please take a look.

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Roger.

104
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Great!

105
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Great!

106
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Lydia, I found your work in the fire-fighting is particularly good.

107
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
The control force is just right.

108
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Are you looking for someone to teach?

109
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
It's actually very simple.

110
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Every night, I take a towel and wet it with water.

111
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Grab both arms and one stroke.

112
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
If I practice more, I can practice more.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Is there really such a way?

114
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
I'm just kidding.

115
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm just kidding.

116
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
I'm just kidding.

117
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm just kidding.

118
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I'm just kidding.

119
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I'm just kidding.

120
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Is there really such a way?

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm just kidding.

122
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I've been learning from the coach for a few years.

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I know a player.

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
He has a good route plan.

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,960
He's very accurate in how many parts he plays.

126
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
At least he can hit Birdie.

127
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
You're talking about me again?

128
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Mr. Dai.

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Mr. Dai.

130
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Have you played baseball before?

131
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
First time.

132
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Lily.

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Lily, this is Lily.

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Lily is a player.

135
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
She's got good skills.

136
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
When will you get together to play?

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Let's play again.

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Yes, we must.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Okay.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
That's all for today.

141
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I won't bother you.

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Bye.

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Bye.

144
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
How do we play?

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
It doesn't matter.

146
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
If you play well, you'll get better.

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
What?

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
They're talking in the VIP room.

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I don't think they care about me.

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
They're not from the same team.

151
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Thank you.

152
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Be careful.

153
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm not leaving.

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm here to save you.

156
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Let me out.

157
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I need to find my wife.

158
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
There are CCTVs all around.

159
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
If you go out, you'll be in trouble.

160
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
It's none of your business.

161
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I'll go find my wife.

162
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I have news to tell you.

163
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Ka Sui, hold on.

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Ooh, I did Siu- jumped

231
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
I guess

232
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Charlie Sui on the victimless of Lou酴蓉

234
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,300
Low Mikawa diamonds

235
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Nicht Official

236
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,960
The case of the big group has been a problem for the PC team.

237
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Finally, we found a high-level spy in the police.

238
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Well done, team.

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Thank you, sir.

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
The file has been passed to DOJ.

241
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
I will talk to the procurator over there

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
about how to charge Lu Wing Tong.

243
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Didn't he already admit the crime?

244
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Although he admitted that he used his power

245
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
to order his subordinate to commit the crime

246
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
in the case of the big group and the police.

247
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
But he also brought out

248
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
another very important matter.

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
There is another spy in the police.

250
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
It's Lu Wing Tong's superior.

251
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
And this person is the one who really has a connection

252
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
with the big group.

253
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Lu Wing Tong is already a police officer.

254
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
So he is a top-level spy.

255
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Assistant director, deputy director, even one.

256
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Does he have any evidence?

257
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
If it's true,

258
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
we will report it directly to the C.E.

259
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
The biggest problem is

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,960
that we don't know where Lu Wing Tong is.

261
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
We gave him a nickname, X.

262
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Lu Wing Tong's connection with X

263
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,960
is the same as his connection with his subordinate.

264
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
It's through the server of the game

265
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Guwak Ganghu.

266
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Can we use the same method

267
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
to find X?

268
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
After the X case was brought to the court,

269
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
it seems that he deliberately broke up with them.

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
He has never been online.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
After the incident with Hu Shao,

272
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Lu Wing Tong tried to contact him.

273
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
But he didn't respond.

274
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I remember that he was particularly close to Ouyang Gun.

275
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
In the police case,

276
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I saw Ouyang Gun

277
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
and Lu Wing Tong.

278
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,960
There are always two groups in the police force.

279
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
One is Ouyang Gun, the police officer,

280
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,960
and the other is Lu Hux, a former student.

281
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
It's a big time.

282
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Before we have any evidence,

283
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
we should keep it.

284
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Tim, this case is under your charge.

285
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
If you need anything,

286
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I can send someone to backup your operation.

287
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Yes, sir.

288
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Hello, sir.

289
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
This is a file of Lei Huxing.

290
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
It contains all the cases he has been through

291
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
and who he worked with.

292
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
This is Ouyang Gun's.

293
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
If you need anything, let me know.

294
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Jenny,

295
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
can you do it later?

296
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Okay.

297
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Any special actions?

298
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Yes, special actions.

299
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,960
But it's not a public matter, it's a private matter.

300
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,960
The room and the bathroom are done.

301
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Mrs. Wong,

302
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't know which documents you want.

303
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I'll help you with it.

304
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
You can share it later.

305
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
We'll put everything in the dustbin

306
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
and keep it.

307
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I promise you I won't throw anything away.

308
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Haoyan,

309
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
forget it.

310
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Throw it away.

311
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
We're not throwing away your stuff.

312
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
We just want to clean it up.

313
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Actually, I've thought it through.

314
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Since he's gone,

315
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I've left so much stuff here.

316
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
It's not going to make him happy.

317
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I believe your father-in-law is in heaven

318
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,960
and doesn't want to see me like this, right?

319
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I should get up and get back on my feet.

320
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Then your father-in-law will be happy to see me like this.

321
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
You two are so nice.

322
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Let's go eat dinner tonight.

323
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I'll live here.

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Okay?

325
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Okay.

326
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Mrs. Wong, do you need any help?

327
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I know how to cook.

328
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Why don't you ask Haoyan to cook for me?

329
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Just a word.

330
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Haoyan likes soup.

331
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
It doesn't matter what's in the soup.

332
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,960
The most important thing is the red dates.

333
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
He likes red dates.

334
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,960
So he'll drink the soup after you make the red dates.

335
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Mrs. Wong, the food is ready.

336
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
It's done? Thank you.

337
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Haoyan, I know your father-in-law is in heaven.

338
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,960
He's worried that no one will take care of you.

339
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
I'll go.

340
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Jenny, this girl is nice.

341
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't say that.

342
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Sorry.

343
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Take it.

346
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Thank you.

347
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I'll return it to you after I die.

348
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
No need.

349
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Hello, I'm Jenny.

350
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm here to see the investigation chief's post.

351
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I've read your profile.

352
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Don't say anything.

353
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I just want to know how much sacrifice you can make for ICAC.

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
If your family is the犯, will you arrest them?

355
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I will.

356
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Everyone will answer like this.

357
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I hope you'll become the investigation chief in the future.

358
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
I'll be waiting for you.

359
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I'll be waiting for you.

360
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm really here to see the investigation.

361
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Mr. Gao.

362
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I returned your jacket.

363
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Thank you.

364
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
You did well.

365
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Really?

366
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
I always feel that I'm worse than I expected.

367
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Actually, it's okay.

368
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Give yourself some confidence.

369
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Thank you, sir.

370
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You taught me when I first came to ICAC.

371
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
The most important thing in investigation is to persist.

372
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Do you remember?

373
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Good girl.

374
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Let me help you.

375
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Don't touch me.

376
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Jenny.

377
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
It's me.

378
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
It's me.

379
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Mr. Gao.

380
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Mr. Gao.

381
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm fine.

382
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm fine.

383
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
If I hadn't come here,

384
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
how could I have arrested so many people?

385
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
You're just like my basketball team.

386
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Where did you buy it?

387
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
It's down below.

388
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
How much?

389
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Just a few dollars.

390
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I know the soup is not for sale.

391
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
You made it yourself.

392
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
If you like soup, I can make more.

393
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Thank you for always caring about me.

394
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I want to say that

395
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
we're just a boss and a subordinate.

396
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
This relationship will not change.

397
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I have something to tell you.

398
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Yes, I like you.

399
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I understand that you don't accept me.

400
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
But if you don't accept me,

401
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
it doesn't mean I can't continue to like you.

402
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
This is Chui Jiayin.

403
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
He's been a public servant for three years.

404
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
He was a businessman in Dalang for a few years.

405
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Dalang again?

406
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Do you think he knows Rachel?

407
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I don't think so.

408
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,960
But even though he's in the same prison,

409
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
he might not know her.

410
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Bye.

411
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Ah Bong, what's going on?

412
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Mr. Chow's case is so complicated.

413
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
You have to help him.

414
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
You want me to help?

415
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Ask Mr. Zhang.

416
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
He's not answering.

417
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
You're so stubborn.

418
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
You guys don't play with me.

419
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I'm just holding on to Mr. Chow.

420
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
When he comes back,

421
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
I'll go out to work.

422
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Do you think everyone can hold on?

423
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Only those with the ability can hold on.

424
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Right.

425
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
By the way, the boss is very strict.

426
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
He said that the meeting will be held later.

427
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
And he will reorganize all the military cases.

428
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
He will be able to catch the criminal.

429
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes.

430
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm going to go to the police station.

431
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
I'll be back in a minute.

432
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
I'll be back in a minute.

433
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
You're so stubborn.

434
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
The chief is dead.

435
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
And the young man has been sentenced to a long time.

436
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
It's better to close the file.

437
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
He's done so much.

438
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
This case is the reason

439
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
for the high-level threat of the terrorist.

440
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
We can't just give it a try.

441
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Yes.

442
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
But the truth is,

443
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
the information is broken.

444
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
What else can we do?

445
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
If Mr. Chow is here,

446
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
he will definitely be in the dark.

447
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,960
If his wife can't find the criminal,

448
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
you guys should think about

449
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
how tough Mr. Chow is.

450
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
No one can think of anything.

451
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
No one can think of anything?

452
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I wonder if he will...

453
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
What a nonsense.

454
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Sorry.

455
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Let's go out and do something.

456
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Okay.

457
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Let's go.

458
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
What's going on?

459
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm not sure.

460
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Rachel.

461
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Why didn't you answer my call?

462
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I thought I made myself clear last time.

463
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Who was that?

464
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
You followed me.

465
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
I can't run into you?

466
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Are you trying to avoid me?

467
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
It's none of your business.

468
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Don't come any closer.

469
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
I know he's your friend.

470
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
But I have to remind you,

471
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
he's most likely

472
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
the murderer of Gong Yongcheng.

473
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
If you know anything,

474
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
just tell me.

475
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I can help you.

476
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
If I killed him,

477
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
how can you help me?

478
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I don't want to drag you into this.

479
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
If you insist,

480
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
this is your answer.

481
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Eight years.

482
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I can't get over him.

483
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I won't make it this time.

484
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
This world has no destiny.

485
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
No reward or consequence.

486
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Since you can't deal with them,

487
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I'll take my own way.

488
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
You must take your own way.

489
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Okay.

490
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll take my own way.

491
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm a woman.

492
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm a woman.

493
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm a woman.

494
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm a woman.

495
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm a woman.

496
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll use my own method to take revenge.

497
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
What's wrong with that?

498
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,400
But you're killing people now.

499
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Murder is eternal.

500
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,840
For this kind of responsibility,

501
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,000
you're in jail for the rest of your life.

502
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,040
Do you think it's worth it?

503
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,440
My mother passed away.

504
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,040
I can't even see her last face.

505
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,960
Yes, I should say I don't have a face to see her.

506
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,400
But anyway, from that moment on,

507
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
I swear to God

508
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
I'll do nothing for the rest of my life

509
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,120
until I bite them to death.

510
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,080
You either call the police or leave here.

511
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,280
I've done everything.

512
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,280
It's none of your business.

513
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,040
Two years ago, I started to follow the plan

514
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,520
to kill in the middle of Gong You Cheng's prison.

515
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,960
Recently, his workers said

516
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
his kidney was almost gone.

517
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,320
He was still worrying about where to get it.

518
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,800
Sister Cao, if you want,

519
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,280
I can gradually increase the dose

520
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,960
so that he can recover faster.

521
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
No need to wait.

522
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
Once Gong You Cheng dies,

523
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,360
the Grand Grandfather will soon be sent back to the country.

524
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,960
I've gathered most of his information,

525
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,800
but I want to fight for the time.

526
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,160
The more I know, the better.

527
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Thank you.

528
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,960
But we still need one more person

529
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,080
to get the Grand Grandfather back.

530
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
I know.

531
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I know.

532
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,120
We still need one more person

533
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,640
who can't really get the Grand Grandfather back.

534
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,760
Rachel, look who's here.

535
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,560
He said he'd come back to help you.

536
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
I don't know when I can come back

537
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
after I get out of the prison.

538
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,760
Please take care of Luo Qiao for me.

539
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
I will.

540
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,640
I hope he'll wake up and see the toys.

541
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
He'll know I came to visit him.

542
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,640
This time, it's the easiest way to get his criminal evidence.

543
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,320
If Da Wing Keung can trust you,

544
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
and can understand his father,

545
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,000
you must be very careful.

546
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I know.

547
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
He has his father there.

548
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,000
He can use his phone and go online.

549
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,720
I'll contact you in another way.

550
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,360
But if...

551
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
If anything happens to me,

552
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,960
you must take care of Luo Qiao for me.

553
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,040
I won't promise you.

554
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,160
You won't be in trouble.

555
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,600
And no matter how I look at it,

556
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,040
it's not my mother's material.

557
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,680
How can I take care of her for you?

558
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Don't worry.

559
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,800
When you come back,

560
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,560
Luo Qiao will definitely wake up

561
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
and wait for you.

562
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,920
Li Shou...

563
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
It's me.

564
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,200
I met your father.

565
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,640
The policeought that he...

566
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
My dad?

567
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,680
And he did nothing,

568
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,080
did nothing.

569
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,680
I don't need to be cool,

570
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,920
whatever it takes to save my dad.

571
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,000
If I found his call just now,

572
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
the police will be overquoted,

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,840
but this case will be dealt with by him.

574
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,240
Speaking of which,

575
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll remember you+.

576
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,040
Fine.

577
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
It's me.

578
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Sisi?

579
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
The grandmaster has come.

580
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,040
He's still holding the police and his wife.

581
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
It seems to be a good idea.

582
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Is there a way to get them out?

583
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
I'll try.

584
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
But...

585
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
That's our plan.

586
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
I understand.

587
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,040
But Wing-kang is still a good candidate for the grandmaster.

588
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't think we should put the gun on him.

589
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Just do it.

590
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,040
I have evidence to prove that the grandmaster is a treasure.

591
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
You should be careful when you use Da-wing-kang.

592
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
I understand.

593
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
He doesn't have a heart.

594
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I'll use his computer to send you the evidence.

595
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Okay.

596
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Once it's done, you'll find a way to get out of here.

597
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Rachel.

598
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,040
But if I fail, will you go with Plan B?

599
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,040
I'll wait for him to come to the court and settle the case at the golf club.

600
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Last time, I was beaten by the big shot.

601
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
I was beaten for my actions.

602
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
I won't let the grandmaster die so easily.

603
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
I want him to experience what is called a life in vain.

604
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
And even kill you.

605
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
I want him to die a life of misery.

606
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
There's one more thing.

607
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
I want to tell you.

608
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
What is it?

609
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
It turns out...

610
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Ria was caught by them.

611
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
When I found her...

612
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I...

613
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I couldn't save her.

614
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I'm sorry.

615
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
I did something wrong.

616
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm sorry.

617
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I'm sorry.

618
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
We can't let her die in vain.

619
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Yes.

620
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Don't worry.

621
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
I'll do as you say.

622
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I'll check the numbers for you.

623
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
No problem.

624
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Thank you.

625
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
You're welcome.

626
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Good night.

627
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Okay.

628
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
The chief of the military and public affairs.

629
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
He's been sick for the past few years.

630
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
He's been in the hospital for a few days.

631
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
He's been in the hospital for a few days.

632
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
He's been in the hospital for a few days.

633
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
He's been in the hospital for a few days.

634
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
He died of acute kidney failure before he was put in the hospital.

635
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
My judgment is that his death is suspicious.

636
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,040
But we can't find anyone who's been involved.

637
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Gong Youcheng is dead.

638
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,040
We mainly report his nephew, Dennis, Ong Mingwei.

639
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
The charge is...

640
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
He's been selling gunpowder and bullets for free.

641
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,040
He also handed the gunpowder and bullets to the people he was looking for.

642
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,040
And he's been taking the money from the people he was looking for.

643
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't get it.

644
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,040
You can't find anything during this time.

645
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Mr. Ouyang, don't be so anxious.

646
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Let the newbies finish their story.

647
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Although Ong Mingwei was willing to be the witness,

648
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
we can't sue Gong Youcheng.

649
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
So we won't be asking the judge for his help.

650
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
He will face 20 years of imprisonment.

651
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Have you talked to the DOJ?

652
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Yes, sir.

653
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
We've reached an agreement.

654
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Mr. Lui, I thought this meeting would be a new progress.

655
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Why does it sound like someone is using Dennis to make a close file?

656
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Mr. Ouyang, I'd like to know why you have such a judgment.

657
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,040
We've arrested Gong Youcheng and Ong Mingwei.

658
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
One is the mastermind, the other is the suspect.

659
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
And the other is the original suspect.

660
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I believe we've found the gunpowder that leaked out of the market.

661
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Gong Youcheng is dead.

662
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,040
We haven't received any reports of gunpowder discovery for months.

663
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,040
So my judgment is that the investigation of the military is complete.

664
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Can you explain why Ong Mingwei said

665
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
he was kidnapped out of the sea?

666
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Ong Mingwei's words are just verbal statements.

667
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,040
There's no evidence to prove his words are true.

668
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Even if they are true,

669
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
my judgment is that Ong Mingwei

670
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,040
killed him because he was dissatisfied with Gong Youcheng.

671
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Ong Mingwei is a middle-class man.

672
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Why is the investigation over here?

673
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Mr. Lui, is this how you do things?

674
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,040
In terms of procedures, evidence and facts,

675
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,040
I think his judgment is not problematic.

676
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
This case has been over for months.

677
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
There's no progress.

678
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
It's no fun to investigate further.

679
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
What's more,

680
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,040
it's just a verbal statement to the public.

681
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,040
This is a good opportunity.

682
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,040
If you have any questions, Mr. Ouyang,

683
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
or we can hold on.

684
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
If you don't want to continue investigating,

685
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I don't mind asking my team to pass the file

686
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,040
and let the people over there follow up.

687
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Ouyang is the person you're looking for.

688
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
He's your superior.

689
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,040
He's the police who has been directing you to do things.

690
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
That's right.

691
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Looking back at your previous good deeds,

692
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
you've always been contacted by your superior.

693
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
How do you know that's Ouyang?

694
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
I remember what happened a year ago.

695
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,700
At the time, the police needed to change a batch of new small

696
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,280
and old

697
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,040
and Ouyang was in charge of the tender.

698
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
When I was receiving the tender,

699
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I found a company that wasn't very famous.

700
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I asked him if he needed to change another one.

701
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
He said he didn't need to.

702
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,040
In the end, the company was marked.

703
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,040
It was called the United Arab Emirates.

704
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Then we used these new small and old

705
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,040
companies to get the money.

706
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
It was all a mess.

707
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,040
We even joked around and didn't know if we'd been cheated.

708
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,040
If the stock is really a problem,

709
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
that means that the police's internal communications

710
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
have been being eavesdropped.

711
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Who knows?

712
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
No one's listening.

713
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I'll go find him.

714
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Ask Ricky to check the United Arab Emirates.

715
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Yes, sir.

716
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm sorry.

717
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
I'm sorry.

719
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I'm sorry.

720
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm sorry.

721
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm sorry.

722
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I'm sorry.

724
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm sorry.

725
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
I'm sorry.

728
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm sorry.

731
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Is it his birthday?

732
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,040
Could it be the day he went to jail?

733
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I'm sorry.

734
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm sorry.

736
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm sorry.

737
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm sorry.

738
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm sorry.

740
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040

Why are you looking for me?

Look after him, I'm going to get him.
