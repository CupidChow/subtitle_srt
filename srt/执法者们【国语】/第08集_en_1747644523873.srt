1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The girl from the Third Branch has returned.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But who caught her?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Where did she go?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How did she come back?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We don't know.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Jenny, have you ever been an undercover?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Beauty, what are you doing?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let me go!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let me go!

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Huang Junxin and Zhang Zonghan have been protecting each other.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not easy for them to point out each other.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sometimes, everyone has interests to be so united.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But when their interests conflict,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that's not what they say.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Zhou San, the report is here.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm here.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm here!

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm here!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My daughter!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're awake!

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's okay.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm afraid.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's okay.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,720
Who will guard me?

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,560
I don't need too many excuses

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,800
Lighting up the fireworks in the dark

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
I won't back down

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,600
If you are all by my side

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Until the end

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Episode 16

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
Mr. Liu, Dong Guicheng sent a letter to you.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Dong Guicheng?

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm going out.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Hello.

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Liu, the senior inspector of the Central Investigation Team, Zhou Junjie, wants to see you at the reception.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But he didn't make an appointment in advance.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
It's okay. Please let him in.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Liu.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Zhou San'er, you came just in time. Dong Guicheng, he...

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,600
There was a traffic accident about the human body organs.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,800
We used the DNA of the body to compare it with your DNA.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
The report is out.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
The body is my daughter's?

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
The door.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Mr. Liu, Mr. Dong is not at ease to see you now.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
No, I have something to ask him in person.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Mr. Dong asked me to say thank you.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
That's why I gave you a cheque.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Thank me for what?

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Because Miss Dong came back safely.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
She's awake.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
She's awake?

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Can I see her?

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm not going to see her.

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm not going to see her.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can I see her?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
I just want to ask her something.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,600
My daughter can't wait any longer. She's going to die soon.

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
You want me to see Miss Dong. I only need five minutes.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,600
I have no choice.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,600
Hello.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Open the phone and answer the phone.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
Mr. Liu, Zhou San'er.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
I hope you won't bother us anymore.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm also a father.

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
I only said this because I pity you.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
The reason I gave you the cheque

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
is to thank your daughter for saving my daughter.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Stop asking questions.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Don't bother us anymore.

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
My daughter's most important thing is to rest.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,400
We won't owe each other anymore.

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
That means you know where my daughter is?

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Dong Guicheng!

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you don't leave now, Mr. Dong will apply for a ban.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Ban? Ban what? Ban my daughter?

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
You can't solve this problem.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
I really have no choice.

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
So much food.

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,600
It's a pity that I'm about to have an operation.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,200
I can't eat such greasy food.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
I prepared some clear soup for you.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
If you're worried, you can eat it.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
No need to trouble yourself.

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,200
You said that you have to eat fresh food.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,400
You have to eat the best food.

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,600
If I didn't ask you to stay in Hong Kong and help me with the problem,

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
you would have changed.

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,200
You helped me, so I will help you.

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,000
The steel you wanted will soon be gone.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,600
After we take this batch of goods, our big plan will soon begin.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,400
I heard that Ricky died, right?

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
In fact, in the past ten years,

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Ricky has also done a lot for the group.

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,000
He must die. He didn't offend me.

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,000
It only affected everyone.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
Rules are rules.

101
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
Then I don't need to die.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Ricky knew that Dong Gui Cheng was looking for his daughter.

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
He even contacted Dong Gui Cheng privately

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,200
to secretly take over the third group.

105
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
This guy is not familiar with him.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200
Daddy!

107
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Miss!

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Daddy, come and save me!

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
He wants the 300 million.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a big problem for me.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Mr. Dong, we finally have a chance to meet.

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Do you know that Dong Gui Cheng's app, Forever Life,

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
is very useful?

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Now, all the live broadcasts in Southeast Asia

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,800
are using his app.

116
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you know that this app is very useful?

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,200
How much can the membership data in this app be worth?

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
I know that you like to drink Taki.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
I especially found someone from Mexico to bring it to you.

120
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
It's a rare bottle.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
How much is this glass of wine?

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
300 million?

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Mr. Dong, I'm using you as a friend.

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
This bottle of wine is from the National Ceremony.

125
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
It's specially used to receive foreign aid.

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't even buy it with money.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,200
Didn't we agree on 300 million on the phone?

128
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,600
What else do you want?

129
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
You're mistaken.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
I didn't call you.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
What do you want?

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
You said 300 million and then you said it wasn't you.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,600
How much money do you want to get to release my daughter?

134
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
You figure it out.

135
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
We're both businessmen who do business.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
I didn't catch your daughter.

137
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know where your daughter is.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
But I'm just taking you as a friend.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,800
So I'm trying my best to get your daughter back.

140
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Daddy!

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Daddy!

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,600
Come and save me, Daddy!

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
300 million isn't enough. I'll give you 500 million.

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,200
I just want my daughter back.

146
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Money isn't the most important thing to me.

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
What I want is

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
your forever life.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
With the data of forever life,

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
our business can get bigger and bigger.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,400
I'll do all the background checks on all of its member data.

152
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,600
After further investigation,

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
the high, middle, low,

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
the entire market will be mine.

155
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Plus the population of Malaysia.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We'll split up and investigate.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Find out who the club is.

158
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Angus and the other members will find out where the goods went.

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Yes, sir.

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
Gosser,

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Li Zheng Si, Raymond Liu and the Hong Kong Island Investigation Team are waiting for you.

162
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
You mean

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,000
only Dong Gui Cheng and his wife know where Annie is?

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
That's why I'm here to help you.

165
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
You want to arrest Dong Gui Cheng as my ICAC

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and force him to confess?

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Gosser, I'm now officially reporting you as the suspect.

168
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Dong Gui Cheng is now trying to use the 5 million dollar cheque

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,400
to bribe Li Zheng Si, the attorney of the criminal investigation department.

170
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
It's enough to build a reasonable suspicion

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,200
that he has violated the law to prevent bribery.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Your financial account...

173
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Wait, Gosser.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
We'll go back to the way things were.

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
Should we go to his daughter first?

176
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
I haven't finished yet.

177
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Yesterday, I received a file from the police.

178
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,400
They arrested a wanted criminal at the border of the Luo Lake.

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,400
After they identified him, his name was Cai Guo Qiang.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Xiao Qiang?

181
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,800
According to the report, he was poisoned in the mainland and wanted to escape to Hong Kong.

182
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
But his colleagues caught him.

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You brat.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
Where is he now?

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,600
At the intersection of the pier and the center of the flow.

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
He admitted everything.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He used your name to borrow money from the financial company.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,400
So, from the perspective of the ICEC,

189
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
you have no more suspicions.

190
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
How about this?

191
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Let's have an ICEC

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,000
and police cooperation.

193
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
The cooperation is over.

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,000
ICEC's senior investigation chief, Gao Haoran,

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Dong Gui Cheng is suspected of violating the law to prevent bribery.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
We want to see him.

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Mr. Dong.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Police, Law Enforcement Department, ICEC.

199
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,600
You three came to me. Do you want to arrest me?

200
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
I really have a reputation.

201
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Mr. Dong's identity is respected. Of course, you must treat him well.

202
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Don't try to scare me by finding a crime.

203
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Give up. I won't let you see my daughter.

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,000
Mr. Dong Gui Cheng, you did give a cheque to the financial company

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
to bribe the public official.

206
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
Don't talk nonsense.

207
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm a friend of the public prosecutor Liu.

208
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I should thank my friend for giving him a red envelope.

209
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
But I didn't expect him to sue the ICEC

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
and get me fooled.

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Mr. Dong, I'm just a public prosecutor.

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,000
When I receive such a large amount of money, I will definitely pay you back.

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
I don't want to argue with you.

214
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Why don't you just tell me frankly?

215
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Are you not willing to give up and insist on seeing my daughter?

216
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Mr. Dong, I don't want to cause you trouble.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
I just want to find my daughter.

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Everyone is a father. You should know very well that you lost your daughter's ambition.

219
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Although I can't take out three hundred million and make a blackmail like you,

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I won't give up until I can't find my daughter.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,800
You won't know how many corpses are involved in this.

222
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,000
Even if I ask you something, you can't save your daughter.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Even if there are only corpses left, I still want to find her.

224
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,400
This is the responsibility that I, as a father, should take.

225
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,000
I admit that for so many years, I haven't been able to fulfill my responsibility as a father.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,200
I don't know what she likes.

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I don't know who she knows.

228
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,400
This time, I am responsible for her disappearance.

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Mr. Dong, I know that those gangsters have illegal transactions involved, right?

230
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,400
I really pity you, but I really don't want to be a burden.

231
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
You are right.

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,800
As a father, seeing your daughter being healthy and safe is already very happy.

233
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I don't want my daughter to disappear again.

234
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Mr. Dong, don't be so naive.

235
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
A gangster will only do it for the first time, but will do it for the second time.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I will take this five million dollar cheque as if I have taken it.

237
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
I will return it to you as a chance to meet your daughter for ten minutes.

238
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Then, let's just forget about this matter.

239
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Mr. Dong, I beg you.

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Carrie.

241
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,600
This lawyer uncle is Ani's father.

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
He wants to know what happened.

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
Can you tell him?

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,800
I am sorry, Mr. Wu Gang.

245
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Okay, okay. It's fine. It's fine.

246
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,800
I am sorry.

247
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
You saw it too.

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He is very emotionally unstable right now.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't push him so hard.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I am sorry.

251
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
I am sorry.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,400
It's not my fault.

253
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
It's not my fault.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
I am sorry.

255
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I know that this kind of thing will happen.

256
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,000
I know that you are not going to let this happen.

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,800
I know that this kind of thing will happen. You don't want it either.

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
I am sorry.

259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,400
It's not my fault. I am sorry.

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Even if this time, it wasn't Ani,

261
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
it could be someone else.

262
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
I believe that there are many people who have the same fate.

263
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,400
I am sorry. I am sorry.

264
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
If you don't want to see anyone else have the same fate as you,

265
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
you must tell the truth.

266
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
I know that you are very brave.

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
No one will blame you.

268
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Ani has never blamed you.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I believe that your father will not blame you either.

270
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Daughter, just say it.

271
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
It might really save someone.

272
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
Okay?

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,800
Can you really save Ani?

274
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
As long as you can say it, I will definitely save her.

275
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,200
I know Ani from street dancing.

276
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,400
So very soon, we became good friends.

277
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,000
We would make a date every week to practice dancing.

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Later, we heard that there are many new dance companies online

279
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,600
that will arrange girls from Hong Kong to train in Korea.

280
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
We looked for a lot of places.

281
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
And finally, we found Fei Shou.

282
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
One day, Boss Ricky suddenly appeared.

283
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
He said that he will be organizing a training camp in a small island in the suburbs of Hong Kong.

284
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
He wanted to choose a student who performed well to go in to train.

285
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,400
I heard from them that as long as they can go in to train,

286
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,800
they will have a big chance to go to Korea.

287
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Later, Ani and I were arranged to go to the training camp.

288
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,400
That training camp was very far away.

289
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
We were arranged to go to the training camp.

290
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,200
That training camp was on a deserted island.

291
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,800
That island was very mysterious.

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
When we arrived at the training camp, they said that they wanted us to focus on training

293
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
and not to have contact with outsiders.

294
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,200
The first day of training camp

295
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
The first day of training camp

296
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
The first day of training camp

297
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
The first day of training camp

298
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
The first day of training camp

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
The first day of training camp

300
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
The first day of training camp

301
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
The first day of training camp

302
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
The first day of training camp

303
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
The first day of training camp

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,600
Until one day, Ani and I wanted to sneak out to explore this island.

305
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Ani, have you noticed that recently,

306
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,800
staff often secretly put things in the forest?

307
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400
I think this is definitely not right.

308
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
Why don't we go back? I don't want to be expelled from school.

309
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
If you're scared, I'll go by myself.

310
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,400
Be careful.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
How are you?

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Be careful.

313
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay.

314
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Okay.

315
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Hurry.

316
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Hurry.

317
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Let's go.

318
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Stop.

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Get in.

320
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Hurry.

321
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Carrie.

322
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Where is this place?

323
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't know. Be careful.

324
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are we being locked up here?

325
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
It's cold.

326
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Come on. Put on my jacket.

327
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
What are you wearing?

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
No need. I'm not cold. You can put it on first.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
It's all because of me.

330
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,400
I dragged you into the water.

331
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
I really am...

332
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Forget it. I'm like this too.

333
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm curious about everything.

334
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
I don't know what to do now.

335
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Come here.

336
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
Let go.

337
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,800
Let go of me. What are you doing?

338
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Carrie.

339
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Carrie.

340
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Carrie.

341
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
It's okay. It's okay.

343
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Daddy is here. It's okay.

344
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
It's okay.

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,600
It's okay.

346
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
It's okay.

347
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,400
It looks like you know Raymond very well.

348
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I've known him for a long time.

349
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
You know him from work?

350
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,200
I've known him since I graduated from the MBA.

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,200
Mr. Dong, cherish your daughter.

352
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Lawyer Liu, you are a very capable person.

353
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
If this can be resolved,

354
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
welcome to join me.

355
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
With your ability, you don't need to be a civil servant anymore.

356
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Mr. Dong, I think you've misunderstood.

357
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm not working for the government.

358
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
I work for justice.

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,000
So I won't bow to evil.

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Mr. Gao, thank you for this time.

361
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Your daughter, do I owe her death?

362
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,400
And...

363
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't push yourself too hard.

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Do your best if you can do it.

365
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Don't blame yourself if you can't.

366
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,600
Zheng San, let's go.

367
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
Don't you know each other?

368
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
You talk so formally.

369
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Come, record a speech with me.

370
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Don't swallow it.

371
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
I won't.

372
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I told you to swallow it.

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Rikki's club was taken by the company.

374
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm afraid it won't have any effect.

375
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
What are you afraid of?

376
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm afraid that if we keep investigating,

377
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,400
we'll find the old friends.

378
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
We've found the old friends.

379
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,800
Even the training camp was found out.

380
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
When did you become so timid?

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
In the past ten years,

382
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,600
when have you not seen ICAC or the police?

383
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Don't worry.

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Anyway, tomorrow, the sun will rise from the east.

385
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,200
I'm just asking.

386
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
You're the most experienced in dealing with the police and the company.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
Although you're no longer in the same boat as you,

388
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
the good thing is that the girl still has a scar.

389
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,200
In a few days, she'll have an operation.

390
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
After the operation,

391
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,800
she'll recover and drink your favorite wine.

392
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
We followed Dota for a few days.

393
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,200
We found that she goes to Gongyou City's house at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

394
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
We've checked.

395
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Gongyou City has a serious illness.

396
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,800
So she rarely comes back to the company this year.

397
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,200
That means Gongyou City should be a patient of Dota.

398
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,600
She might be a potential buyer of Black City.

399
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
We've contacted the customs officer.

400
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
We found the wine that was suspicious.

401
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
We sent it to the restaurant called Viva.

402
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Wine can adjust the temperature and humidity.

403
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
It's best to store these medicines.

404
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
I'll apply for a search warrant and go in to search.

405
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,800
Dota is like usual. He goes to the hospital every day.

406
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,200
After work, he goes to eat and watch movies with his wife.

407
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
He's no different from the average person.

408
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
He doesn't need to go to the hospital or get a check-up.

409
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He's so calm.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,600
It feels like he's prepared for everything.

411
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Is he ready for the operation?

412
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,000
These are the people we caught from the club that day.

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
We found that they have a common point.

414
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,200
They're all from a company called Fly-Sing Entertainment.

415
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
You mean Fly-Sing is in charge of this club?

416
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I've checked the background of Fly-Sing's boss, his name is Ricky.

417
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,400
But he was found dead at home last week.

418
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,600
How did he die?

419
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,000
I think I should ask Zhou.

420
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,200
I was going to talk to you in your office.

421
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
But there are so many people in the office.

422
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
It's safer here.

423
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,000
I understand.

424
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
You've found a lot of things.

425
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Part of it.

426
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Some of them need to be supplemented by the police.

427
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,200
A while ago, Madden River reported a sea-view corruption case.

428
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,400
We believe that the group behind the corruption is Fly-Sing.

429
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Fly-Sing again?

430
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Fly-Sing involved the girl who was abducted.

431
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,800
The corruption of the sea-view and illegal organ trade.

432
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,400
We were going to investigate from this line.

433
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,000
But it's a pity that their boss Ricky is dead.

434
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
You have a good track on this case.

435
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Everything has something to do with Fly-Sing.

436
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,000
It seems that we really need to do it again.

437
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Okay, let's sort out everything again.

438
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay. This Fly-Sing Entertainment Company

439
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,800
is actually a stylish entertainment company.

440
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
But actually, it's run by

441
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,400
a place called Wonderland's illegal sex place.

442
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
There are a group of people in Fly-Sing Entertainment Company.

443
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,200
They usually ask them to work in the club.

444
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
But the main purpose is to entertain

445
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
those honorable customers, government officials,

446
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,400
and business partners.

447
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
I suspect that they are involved in human trafficking.

448
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
They caught some young people and put them on an unknown island.

449
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So they are going to perform organ transplant surgery on the island.

450
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Organ transplant requires anti-methyl.

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
A normal doctor can't get the medicine in the hospital without any reason.

452
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
That means that the medicine has to be transported from other places.

453
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
So they used Zhang Zonghan and Huang Ju Xin,

454
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
two airport officers.

455
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
After the medicine is transported, it will be sent to this bar.

456
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,400
I have applied for a search warrant. I'll go up there to take a look.

457
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,600
They used so much manpower and material strength to do such a big thing.

458
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Those patients shouldn't be ordinary people. I've checked.

459
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Gong You Chen and Ricky are all waiting for the organ transplant.

460
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
That means that their potential customers are like them.

461
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
They are all rich people.

462
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Ricky's death is related to the death of our central case group.

463
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
But let's not worry about these things. Let's think about it first.

464
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,800
What does a rich person need to perform organ transplant surgery?

465
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
A doctor with power.

466
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Dota Zeng is Gong You Chen's main doctor.

467
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It's very likely that he's helping them to perform some illegal organ transplant surgery.

468
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,800
Also, the place where the surgery is done.

469
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
Based on the time and transportation,

470
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,000
he shouldn't be far from the place where they are being held.

471
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,800
That means that my daughter should still be on the island.

472
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
But Ricky is dead.

473
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,800
The only clues left are Dota Zeng and Gong You Chen.

474
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,200
Based on Gong You Chen's condition, I believe that he will perform surgery in a short time.

475
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,800
If we follow him, we can definitely find the place where the officer and the surgery will be done.

476
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,200
Don't worry. I'll arrange for my colleagues to keep an eye on them.

477
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,000
We'll work together. After the search warrant is issued, I'll go to this bar to take a look.

478
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
I'll see if there are any clues.

479
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Thank you.

480
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,800
If there is any news, please notify me immediately.

481
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't worry.

482
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Which boss?

483
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
What is it?

484
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,800
ICICI's Senior Investigation Director Gao Haoran.

485
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
You are suspected of violating the anti-corruption law.

486
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Providing benefits to the customs officers to transport illegal drugs to Hong Kong.

487
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
I want to ask you to go back and help me.

488
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Call an ambulance.

489
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
I'm here.

490
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
What's up? Why are you looking for me?

491
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Come.

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I have some information.

493
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,800
Although I don't know what the case is about,

494
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,600
it's all related to Qian Feng Group.

495
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,600
So it's all related to Grandfather Dai?

496
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes.

497
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm not sure.

498
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm not sure.

499
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm not sure.

500
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
So it's all related to Grandfather Dai?

501
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,000
I suspect Grandfather Dai sent someone to kill Ricky.

502
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,800
The court said that the person who killed Ricky was a leftist.

503
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,200
The killer who fought with me last time was also a leftist.

504
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,400
If they really are selling the organs,

505
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Gong You Cheng and Grandfather Dai have business.

506
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
It's unreasonable to wait for so long.

507
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,200
Also, even if Ricky can't help Gong You Cheng,

508
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
he won't die.

509
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,600
But if he loses his hand, it's not certain.

510
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Didn't Dong Xin Yue say that he went to a remote island?

511
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
There are docks in all three places.

512
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,200
Could it be that he went from these three places?

513
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,800
Da Pu, Ma An Shan, and Xi Gong.

514
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Which dock is he from?

515
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Don't worry. I've arranged some colleagues to go with me tomorrow.

516
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Okay. Let's go to the docks together tomorrow.

517
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,400
Yes.

518
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
It's just a dock. How dangerous is it?

519
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Xiao Lin, Tie Nan, you go to Ma An Shan Niu Dock.

520
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Qiang Ge, Black Bull, you go to Da Pu San Men Zai Dock.

521
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
I'll go to Xi Gong Royal Dock.

522
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Xi Gong Royal Dock. Everyone, split up.

523
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,200
Inform me immediately if you have any news.

524
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,200
Wow, brother, you've gained a lot.

525
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Yes, I'm quite lucky today.

526
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,800
I can tell.

527
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Oh, right, I want to ask.

528
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,600
Are there any islands nearby?

529
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
Even you guys won't go?

530
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,200
We'll go to any island.

531
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Hey, handsome guy, there are so many people today. Is it usually like this?

532
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,200
Yes. The government is doing some deep travel. There are people everywhere.

533
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Are there any islands nearby that no one has been to?

534
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,600
No. Everyone has been to every island.

535
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Zhou Si Er, we didn't find anything.

536
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,400
These are the documents that the wine cellar took back.

537
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Everyone, look at them one by one.

538
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
If you have any goods from Mexico,

539
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
the information about the anti-missile medicine, and even the words of the island's leader,

540
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
inform me immediately if you find anything.

541
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes, sir.

542
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
There's not a single one.

543
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,800
That's right.

544
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,600
There are guests.

545
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,800
Hey, where do you want to go?

546
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Have you seen a man in his forties

547
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,200
who is wearing a suit?

548
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,600
No, I haven't seen him.

549
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Then, where does this boat go?

550
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Usually, it goes to the tower gate or the Chijing.

551
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,800
But looking at you guys, it doesn't look like you're going to climb a mountain.

552
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,000
Then, is there any remote island that no one has been to?

553
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
There's a Longwei Island.

554
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
But on that island, there's not even a snake.

555
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,200
No one has been there.

556
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Thank you.

557
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,400
You're a boatman, right?

558
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

559
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
Please don't go to Longwei Island.

560
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,800
I haven't been there for half a year.

561
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm telling you in advance. I don't care if you send me or not.

562
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,200
Okay, okay. Just send me there.

563
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Okay, okay. Get on the boat.

564
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Thank you.

565
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
What are you doing?

566
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Don't go.

567
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
Stay here and wait for the news.

568
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
No, I have to go.

569
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,200
If your daughter is really on the island, it means there's a danger.

570
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
If you go with me, I have to take care of you.

571
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,200
My daughter is missing now.

572
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Can you let me take the responsibility of being the father?

573
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,400
I understand. I don't want to drag you guys down.

574
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
After you get hurt, you just have to save my daughter.

575
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,000
Don't worry about me.

576
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
I understand your feelings.

577
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
But the police have the responsibility of the police.

578
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,600
We are protecting the citizens.

579
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
If there's a danger on the island, I'll let you go.

580
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
That's impossible.

581
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Anyway, you stay here.

582
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Go.

583
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
What are you doing? I told you not to go.

584
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
I understand.

585
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
The police have your responsibility.

586
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,400
But I have the rights of the citizens.

587
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
I have the freedom to move.

588
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,200
After I get on the island, I'll be responsible for myself.

589
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
Okay?

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,200
Let's go.

591
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Stop.

592
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
But she has a customs approval.

593
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
This batch of wine is fine.

594
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,400
Sorry, I was careless.

595
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
It's fine.

596
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,400
Okay, everyone is tired. Let's take a break.

597
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,200
Please.

598
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,800
Please.

599
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Check which dock is the fastest to Longweizhou.

600
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
Huangshi Dock.

601
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Huangshi Dock.

602
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Coming.

603
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Gao Zhiyuan.

604
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,000
No signal.

605
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't know what will happen later.

606
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Let's act carefully.

607
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,600
Let's go.

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,280
The

609
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
An Ning, didn't you say your father is the big lawyer?

610
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,200
I'm begging him to give me some time.

611
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,000
I will definitely return the money to you.

612
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yan Hong Ling, come out!

613
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No! No!

614
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Come out!

615
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Help!

616
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm telling you to get out!

617
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yan Hong Ling, come out!

618
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Calm down. It's me.

619
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Calm down.

620
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,200
Police, don't be afraid.

621
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
Fatty, take them away.

622
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,000
Come with me.

623
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Go.

624
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Hurry up.

625
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Let's find that girl first.

626
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
Let's find that girl first.

627
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you know An Ning?

628
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,400
Do you know where she is?

629
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,600
She was taken away.

630
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Where did she go?

631
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,800
She went to the operating room. She's nearby.

632
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,000
You guys go first. Be careful.

633
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Help!

634
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Don't move!

635
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Let me go!

636
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
Let me go! Help!

637
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
An Ning! An Ning!

638
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't hit him!

639
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Be good!

640
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
Daddy!

641
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Daddy!

642
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Let me go!

643
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Help!

644
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,200
Let me go!

645
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
We are still investigating the source and purpose

646
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,800
of the military weapons that are related to this discovery.

647
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I think that these cases

648
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,800
have a reasonable reason to suspect that they are related to Qian Feng Group.

649
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Is that so?

650
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Xu Si Si's case

651
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
escaped a wanted criminal.

652
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,200
This time, I also met him on the island.

653
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,000
I think that it's definitely not a coincidence.

654
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Wang Zhen Xiong took advantage of it

655
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,600
and leaked the witness's location.

656
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I believe that it's not a single case.

657
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,200
There must be other police officers involved in it.

658
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Even the senior officers of the police team.

659
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
That's why I officially applied for a case investigation

660
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
against Wang Zhen Xiong and the police team of the corrupt Wu Group.

661
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
Gao Si Er, we've repaired Wang Zhen Xiong's phone.

662
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
Look, there's a clue.

663
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Did you change

664
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
the person

665
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
in the mirror

666
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
who is

667
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
in the mirror

668
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
in the mirror

669
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
in the mirror

670
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
in the mirror

671
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
in the mirror

672
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
in the mirror

673
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
in the mirror

674
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
in the mirror

675
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
in the mirror

676
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Without you

677
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
the season by my side

678
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
the season by my side

679
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
is more obvious

680
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
is more obvious

681
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
The fallen leaves

682
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
The fallen leaves

683
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
are also

684
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
tired

685
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
tired

686
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
tired

687
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
to chase

688
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
to chase

689
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,040
the perfect

690
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
the perfect

691
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
the perfect

692
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
world

693
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
No one can take me away

694
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
No one can take me away

695
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
in the faraway end

696
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
No one can give me

697
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
my hand for the world

698
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Is it

699
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,080
Is it

700
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Who guards for me

701
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Who guards for me

702
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
no reason is needed

703
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm sorry.

704
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
I'm sorry.

706
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm sorry.

707
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm sorry.

709
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm sorry.

721
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm sorry.

722
