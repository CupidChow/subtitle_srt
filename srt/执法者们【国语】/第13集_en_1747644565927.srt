1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who is the one you want to exchange with?

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Who can take me away?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Who is in the distant end of the world?

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who can exchange hands with me?

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is there anyone?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Who can guard me?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't need too many reasons

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lighting up the fireworks in the dark

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I won't back down

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Smile if you're all around me

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
From beginning to end

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The King's Avatar

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Excuse me

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Sir, this way please

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Find four Chinese men on the sea

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to prove that they are the seaman colleagues

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sir, how is my wife?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Did you find her?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jie

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We haven't found Madam He yet

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We're trying our best to find her

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Madam He will definitely take over Tianxiang

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We've informed the sea division

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Experts will analyze the water flow and find her

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sir

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The experts from the sea division are here

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't worry

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Jie

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sir

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Jie

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sir

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We've just found out the latest news

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A ship of a seaman and a boat of a pirate ship

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
has been shot down

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There was also an explosion during this period

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Four seaman members have been found

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But the boat of a pirate ship and Tina have disappeared

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A pirate ship was found in the first sea region

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
by a seaman

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now it's bringing it back

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you want to go back and have a rest?

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, I want to stay and wait for the news

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll go back and have a rest

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll go back and have a rest

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll go back and have a rest

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll go back and have a rest

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll go back and have a rest

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go back and have a rest

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll go back and have a rest

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll go back and have a rest

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll go back and have a rest

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll go back and have a rest

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll go back and have a rest

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll go back and have a rest

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where's the den in the heart?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
Where's the combat weapon?

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I don't know

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I can't breathe

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Say it

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't let me go

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Say it.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Don't hit him.

86
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Don't hit him.

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
Where are you?

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,400
Don't hit him.

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,320
I'll say it.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,920
Say it.

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
He's a bastard.

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
Boss.

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Boss.

94
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,080
He's a bastard.

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,160
Where did he go?

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,440
Bastard.

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,520
Where did he go?

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't know.

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't know.

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't pretend to be dead.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Don't pretend to be dead.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
Episode 15

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,720
Mr. Zhou.

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
We'll go to the intersection later.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
No need. I'll do it myself.

106
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Zhou, let them do it.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Okay, I'll do it myself.

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
Doctor, how is he?

109
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
His temperature is stable now.

110
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
You can go in and ask him.

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,280
Okay, thank you.

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,840
Mr. Zhou.

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,560
Calm down.

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I know. I'll go back.

115
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,080
What happened in the sea?

116
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,560
I won't say anything without a lawyer.

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Lawyer?

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
You think you have a lawyer?

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
You've been in the hospital for so long.

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
You don't even have a shadow.

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,320
Where's your uncle?

122
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Where's Dai Zu Fu?

123
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
He didn't show up.

124
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I want to make a call.

125
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Who are you calling?

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
Do you think anyone will listen?

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
Dai Zu Fu.

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,880
He knows you've caused trouble and he's been caught by me.

129
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
Guess what he thinks.

130
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,560
Guess if you can get out of this hospital.

131
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll go to the hospital.

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
Answer me.

133
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,200
Or I'll let you go.

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,080
I'll let you go to the streets and do something.

135
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
I really don't know anything.

136
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
I took this gun to sell it secretly.

137
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
It was originally used to fill the hole.

138
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,600
This gun will be used on the ship.

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,480
But I really don't know where it will be sent and what it's used for.

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
Where did you go without knowing?

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
Dai Zu Fu and his friends are mysterious.

142
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
They don't say anything.

143
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't even know who's on the ship.

144
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,560
You don't know who it is and you're still on the ship with someone.

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
I have no choice.

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
He pointed my head with a gun.

147
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I can't just not go.

148
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Mr. Dai.

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
He said I could offend people everywhere.

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
He sent me a private boat to the sea of the sea.

151
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
Then I went on the ship to help him.

152
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Ship? What ship? Where is it?

153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I knew I wouldn't sit here.

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,160
I really don't know.

155
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Okay.

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I'll trust you first.

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Did you hear that?

158
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Prepare to arrest him.

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,560
The police say that the department of the sea and the fire station

161
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
and the internal sea police

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,560
are still investigating the missing sea officer and the ship

163
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
who were at the waterfront yesterday.

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
They are investigating the missing sea officer and the assistant supervisor.

165
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Due to the suspect in the case

166
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
and the case related to the case of the military service,

167
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,560
the executive officer is highly concerned.

168
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Why didn't you answer the phone?

169
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Did something happen?

170
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Police.

171
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Let's find Gong You Cheng.

172
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Mr. Gong You Cheng.

173
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
We are reasonably suspecting you of selling military goods.

174
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
We are arresting you now.

175
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Your nephew, Ou Ming Wei, has already told us everything.

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
He said that you are the mastermind behind the smuggling of military goods.

177
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
You were the one who paid for it and told him to find a fish plate.

178
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
That fish plate is not used to raise fish.

179
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
It is used to collect military goods.

180
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I have evidence.

181
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
You don't have to deny it.

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I want to see the lawyer.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Mr. Zhou, I have something to ask you.

184
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
What is it?

185
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Mr. Zhou, his lawyer wants to meet him.

186
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
He is dragging me.

187
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
His lawyer asked for an update every five minutes.

188
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
He wants to record it and file a complaint.

189
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
The colleagues outside said that they would not take this responsibility.

190
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Change the police station.

191
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Change the police station?

192
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
And you want to report it to the colleagues there?

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Then report it.

194
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
He has so many cases.

195
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Then we will open the files one by one.

196
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I will deal with it.

197
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
What are you doing?

198
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
You want to meet a criminal?

199
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
No.

200
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I just want to have a chat.

201
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I want to see my client.

202
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
You can see him.

203
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Now the police station is changed.

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Do you want to see him here?

205
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Is it like this?

206
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
My client asked to see the lawyer.

207
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
You, a policeman,

208
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
are blocking my lawyer from meeting my client.

209
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,560
You are also taking him away from the police station for no reason.

210
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
You are blocking him from seeking legal information.

211
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
I believe many reporters are interested in this.

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Your case is related to the crime of多起.

213
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,560
We need to move other police stations to continue the investigation.

214
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
If you want to see him, go to the next police station.

215
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Mr. Zhang, call the reporter for me.

216
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Call 999 to call the police.

217
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
They said that there was illegal imprisonment by the police.

218
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
And we are at the gate of the police station.

219
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
To stop the crime of the crime.

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Do you want to stop the police?

221
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Why would I want to stop you from doing things?

222
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
I just want to see my client.

223
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,560
I will return it to you in five minutes.

224
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Zhou San, let him see you in five minutes.

225
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Don't make things worse.

226
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Dennis has already betrayed you and Boss Dai.

227
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Boss Dai will give up on him.

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
As long as you don't lie,

229
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Boss Dai will help you.

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
You don't have enough evidence to convict me?

231
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Dennis' statement is not enough.

232
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,560
First, Dennis said that Gong You Cheng invested in his company.

233
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
But we don't have evidence to prove that money

234
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
is used to deal with military fire.

235
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Second, the machines and tools found in the fish tank

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
we can say that

237
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
it was the user who illegally used these machines.

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Not Gong You Cheng.

239
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Third, the fish tank is not a fish farm.

240
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
But it's not about Gong You Cheng.

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
What's the difference? We have so much.

242
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I understand. But from the legal point of view,

243
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
we want to...

244
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Don't talk about the law with me.

245
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Is the law important or the people?

246
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
My wife is missing.

247
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't know if she is alive or dead.

248
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
You also lost your daughter.

249
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
You should understand my feelings.

250
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
How about this?

251
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
We'll hand over the evidence to the court.

252
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
We'll try to get her to report to the police.

253
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I'll approve you then.

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
And I'll make a statement to her.

255
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Okay?

256
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Anyway, no matter what happens,

257
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
we'll take the responsibility.

258
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Not just you.

259
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
The defendant is accused of

260
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
illegally operating guns and ammunition.

261
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
The person who gives the guns and ammunition

262
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,560
to the person who has no license to use them

263
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
and the person who gets the false excuse

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
will be arrested.

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Because the case is serious,

266
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
he can't be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

267
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Plus,

268
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
the defendant is likely to

269
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
pose a threat to the public.

270
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
So the prosecution

271
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
is against the defendant's bail.

272
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
The defendant is not guilty.

273
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
The defendant is not guilty.

274
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
The defendant is not guilty.

275
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
The defendant is not guilty.

276
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
The defendant is not guilty.

277
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Your Honor,

278
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
my client

279
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
doesn't have any criminal record.

280
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
He is a very honest businessman.

281
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Plus,

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
the evidence of this case is very vague.

283
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
And the prosecution

284
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
can't find enough evidence

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
to support his charge.

286
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
So my client

287
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
applied for bail.

288
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
And my client

289
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
can provide

290
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
1 million cash bail.

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
She can report to the police regularly

292
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
and hand over all the travel records.

293
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Besides,

294
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
her wife will also hand over

295
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
1 million cash bail.

296
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I hope the above conditions

297
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
can meet the requirements of the bail.

298
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
This case is serious.

299
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
First of all,

300
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
it's a matter of a group of military fire

301
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
that caused the death of people

302
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
and public panic.

303
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
It caused a terrible attack

304
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,560
and a high level of threat.

305
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
The defendant

306
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
has direct evidence

307
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
to prove that the defendant

308
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
is the mastermind of the case.

309
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
He has enough evidence.

310
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Given such a serious case,

311
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
and the defendant has direct connection with the case,

312
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
the defendant will be worried

313
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
that there will be more military fire

314
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
and it will be dangerous for the people.

315
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Besides,

316
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
the defendant has the risk of escape.

317
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
So the defendant

318
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,560
strongly opposes the defendant's bail.

319
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
The defendant

320
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
is another defendant in the same case.

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Isn't it possible that

322
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
he wants to cut the sentence

323
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
or use other reasons

324
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
to frame me?

325
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
In addition to the evidence of the defendant in the same case,

326
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
the defendant also has

327
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
a large waterproof bag

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
purchased by the company,

329
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,560
a large 316-cm stainless steel bucket,

330
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
and small weight-bearing machines.

331
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
There is also evidence that

332
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
the evidence is used

333
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
to store military fire

334
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
at the bottom of the fish tank.

335
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
These environmental evidences

336
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
indicate that the defendant

337
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
must be related to the case.

338
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
So the defendant

339
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
will continue to oppose the defendant's bail.

340
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Is there anything else to add?

341
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
No, Your Honor.

342
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
The defendant is allowed to be fined

343
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
one million yuan.

344
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
One million yuan in the bail.

345
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
And he needs to hand over all the travel documents

346
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
and report to the police station every day.

347
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:43,080
Please bebck your finger at our

348
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:51,560
stand allauns

349
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I haven't seen my family

350
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
since I got также

351
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
for the gun fight incident

352
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
almost the whole month.

353
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
An hour ago,

354
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,240
I was so happy to call my wife

355
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
and tell her that I could go home for dinner.

356
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,000
But why am I still sitting here

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,880
and unable to leave?

358
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,240
It's because of you.

359
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,160
And I just received

360
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,640
dozens of complaints from that lawyer.

361
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,560
And the internal investigation department,

362
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,480
999, TV station,

363
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
and the magazine reporters.

364
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,680
The colleagues in the public relations department

365
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,960
are in a mess.

366
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
Have you considered

367
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,680
the feelings of the other colleagues?

368
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,680
Do you know how much time

369
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,360
the other colleagues spent on you

370
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
to deal with your problems?

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,840
Sir.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,680
I'm doing what I need to do.

373
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,440
You still think you're right, right?

374
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
I know.

375
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
I know you really want to find your wife.

376
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
But you have to calm down.

377
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,200
Do you understand?

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Sir.

379
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,160
Even if you know that the criminal

380
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,280
is related to the case,

381
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,640
can't you get him back?

382
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,680
I mean

383
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,360
everything has a procedure.

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,520
It's not doing things randomly.

385
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,280
Do you know that

386
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,000
you will only disrupt

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
other colleagues' progress?

388
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Now the whole world is helping you.

389
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,360
I hope you understand that.

390
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
I completely understand, sir.

391
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
I won't let you go home for dinner.

392
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Goodbye, sir.

393
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,480
Sir.

394
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
I know you just got scolded by Ouyang Jun.

395
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
I came to see you.

396
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,040
Sorry, sir.

397
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,640
I didn't affect you.

398
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Don't be silly.

399
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Everyone will understand you.

400
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,080
How is it?

401
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Are there any other directions?

402
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,880
For example,

403
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,800
the colleagues of Anis's accomplice.

404
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
It's such a big thing.

405
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
He can't handle it alone.

406
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,320
There are things that can be done.

407
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
But I don't think it's possible.

408
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
I think it's not possible.

409
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,000
You can't do it alone.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
You can't do it alone.

411
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,920
I have.

412
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,720
Then why didn't you catch him back?

413
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,720
I've caught him back.

414
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,800
But he's in the ICICI.

415
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
He's trying to steal our case.

416
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,080
We can go over

417
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
and steal people.

418
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
He caught people back

419
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,920
because he thinks

420
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,960
there's something wrong

421
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,480
with someone inside the police.

422
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,280
Then I won't ask.

423
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
Don't think about it alone.

424
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,720
You can find me if you need help.

425
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,920
Thank you, sir.

426
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
Before I got the job,

427
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,440
I knew some passengers.

428
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,040
I asked them for help.

429
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,200
I asked them to help me check

430
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,080
what strange things

431
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,520
are going on in the industry.

432
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,160
I've been looking for

433
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,360
a suspicious police.

434
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
They seem to have a relationship

435
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,960
with Gong You Cheng.

436
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,320
Maybe there will be some useful clues.

437
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,240
Jian.

438
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,720
Do you know that

439
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,760
I've been with Gong You Cheng

440
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
in a case of short-term care?

441
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,920
At that time,

442
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
the witness and the witness were all in power.

443
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
I thought I could

444
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,080
sue Gong You Cheng.

445
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,680
But

446
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,400
it was the last failure.

447
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,680
I couldn't just punish him.

448
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
I even made a good friend

449
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,240
to be a prison guard for eight years.

450
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,800
I've been very guilty.

451
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,200
I thought I could never

452
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,880
sue Gong You Cheng and Dai Zu Fu.

453
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
I asked myself

454
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,400
if the bad guys

455
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
are really evil.

456
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
I've been looking for

457
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,240
some suspicious police recently.

458
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,800
I've found more and more evidence.

459
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Plus,

460
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,640
the case of Long Weizhou,

461
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,480
I know

462
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,640
that we're going in the right direction.

463
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,960
The bad guys

464
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,560
must be repaid with evil.

465
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,720
I believe

466
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,120
the bad guys

467
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,200
will be repaid with good.

468
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,720
This is called the natural law of the heavenly circle.

469
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,840
Even if he's still

470
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,120
safe and sound,

471
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,640
sooner or later,

472
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,640
he'll be punished.

473
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Thank you.

474
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
I know you all want to comfort me.

475
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,880
But now,

476
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
nothing matters.

477
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,000
I just want to see my wife.

478
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

479
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,400
Is Miss He here?

480
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,600
This is for her.

481
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,800
Give it to me.

482
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
I want to buy flowers.

483
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,680
Next week.

484
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,240
Sure.

485
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
Do you want a new card?

486
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,640
Sure.

487
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Okay.

488
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,000
What do you want?

489
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,040
How are you?

490
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,160
You're not answering your phone.

491
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,120
Any news about your wife?

492
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,720
No.

493
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
Don't worry.

494
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
She'll be fine.

495
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,800
I know some people in Gongyou City.

496
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,160
Do you need help?

497
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,520
Okay.

498
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,360
But you should ask around.

499
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
Don't alert Gongyou City.

500
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I'll follow them.

501
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,600
Okay.

502
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
Be careful.

503
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll keep looking for her.

504
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,840
Mr. Gong,

505
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,440
the car behind us has been following us for a long time.

506
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,440
Ignore it.

507
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,480
Let it follow us.

508
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
I know, Mr. Gong.

509
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,680
Welcome, Mr. Gong.

510
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,200
Mr. Gong,

511
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
it's already cleared inside.

512
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Go, go, go.

513
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,120
Mr.,

514
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,080
the phone.

515
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
The goods arrived at the 15th.

516
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Yes.

517
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,080
This year, we expanded our business in shipping.

518
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
What are you doing?

519
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
You've been with me since this morning.

520
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Do you think I don't know?

521
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
I'm not a thief.

522
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I'm a thief.

523
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Now, do you think I don't know?

524
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I have evidence that you followed me.

525
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
If you don't want me to complain to you and find reporters,

526
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
don't bother me anymore.

527
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,080
You're like a mad dog walking around.

528
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,080
It's useless to do some little things.

529
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Today is April 28th.

530
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I received orders from Gong You Cheng

531
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
to arrange a truck team to help him with the fire.

532
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,080
I've never seen him value a batch of goods.

533
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
So I have a premonition

534
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,080
that this time I will find out a big case.

535
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Be careful.

536
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
I'm going to the warehouse.

537
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
I'll be back in a minute.

538
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Be careful.

539
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
What's this good stuff?

540
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Do you need to go out in person?

541
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Shut up. It has nothing to do with you.

542
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Hello?

543
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Yes.

544
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,080
My Glock 17 has a total of 200.

545
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Now I have my ship to sail out of the sea.

546
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
I'm not going to put this in the warehouse.

547
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I'm going to the warehouse.

548
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I'm going to the warehouse.

549
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
I didn't announce this recording

550
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,080
because I didn't want to alert the company.

551
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Because I know there's a big partner behind it.

552
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
I hope that everyone who gets this recording will be careful.

553
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Since I found this evidence,

554
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
I've already got a clear direction.

555
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
I won't be confused anymore.

556
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Because I believe that my efforts will be of value.

557
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,080
As long as I firmly tell myself

558
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
that I've been doing the right thing,

559
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
that's enough.

560
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
You can find my diary

561
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
to prove that you're a smart person.

562
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
You're still obsessed with the case.

563
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
So you have to believe in yourself.

564
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Don't be influenced by others.

565
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Don't believe in others.

566
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Hello?

567
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Yes.

568
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
My Glock 17 has a total of 200.

569
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Now I'm going to send it out to the sea.

570
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Did you hear that?

571
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
It's clear.

572
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
With this recording,

573
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
can we prove that the evidence is correct?

574
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Although this recording

575
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
may not be a solid evidence,

576
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
but with the witness, Dennis,

577
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
there might be a chance.

578
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Give me some time to think about it.

579
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Oh, right.

580
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Another thing is,

581
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,080
because this case was handled by your team,

582
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
it might not be good for you.

583
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Because the defense will say that you're a suspect.

584
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Now you interfere with the witness and the evidence.

585
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
So I suggest that you hand this case

586
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
to another team.

587
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
My wife is missing now.

588
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I don't know if she's alive or dead.

589
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
You said you want to hand it to someone else.

590
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
I understand.

591
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
But I suggest you be careful.

592
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Jing, this black-spawn case,

593
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
we have a target.

594
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
It's going to be a big step.

595
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Don't worry.

596
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm going to ask him.

597
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Let's go.

598
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Gaozi.

599
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
I checked all the car entry and exit records

600
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
of the police station.

601
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I compared the license plate and police list.

602
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
I think I've found him.

603
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
The guy who entered the gang

604
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
was him.

605
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Lu Yongtong.

606
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,280
I learned a new dish. I'll make it tonight to try it.

607
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
That's good. I have good news to tell you.

608
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
We can really celebrate it.

609
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,080
What is it?

610
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,880
This time, I'm very sure that we can sue Gong Youcheng.

611
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,080
You have new evidence?

612
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,680
But based on confidentiality, I can't tell you.

613
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,480
I can only say that we can sue him for a serious crime.

614
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,280
I really hope that we can successfully put him in jail this time.

615
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,680
What? You don't believe me?

616
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,280
How could it be?

617
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,880
Hurry and sit down. Eat your meal.

618
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,480
It looks really delicious.

619
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
Let me taste it.

620
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,480
What's wrong? What's wrong?

621
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,880
You just finished eating and you're already vomiting.

622
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,080
A'Xin! A'Xin! Hurry and come over and help Master!

623
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,480
Here.

624
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Let me do it.

625
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
What are you doing? If you don't understand, don't touch it.

626
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,680
Husband. Husband, what's wrong?

627
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Husband.

628
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Husband, are you okay? Husband!

629
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
Mr. Gong!

630
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,080
Mr. Gong, it's all your fault! Hurry and get some alcohol!

631
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,080
How could he fall into an emergency?

632
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,480
Didn't Ming Ling say that the surgery was successful?

633
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,680
How could this happen?

634
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,080
Let's wait for the doctor's medical report to come out first.

635
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,080
That A'Xin, did she usually feed you?

636
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm not disabled.

637
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,080
I have hands and feet. I don't need her to feed me.

638
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm also worried about you.

639
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,880
If something happens to you, what about me?

640
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
There's no use worrying.

641
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm very tired right now.

642
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,280
You should also go back and rest.

643
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,080
Take good care of the children.

644
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,680
Okay. Then rest well.

645
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,800
What are you all doing?

646
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,280
What are you all doing?

647
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,340
Someone's beensch 역시 пару beha whoao

648
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,540
No doctor or nurse will come tonight.

649
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,540
Are you surprised?

650
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,660
What's wrong?

651
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,060
What happened?

652
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,820
Let me explain

653
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
why you still become like this

654
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
after you change your kidney.

655
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,180
Because

656
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,300
the antipyretic you take every day

657
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,540
was transferred by my friend.

658
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,220
You...

659
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,340
You...

660
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,420
You two know each other?

661
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,060
There's something that will surprise you.

662
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Actually, we don't just know each other.

663
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,340
A Xin is my

664
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,820
caretaker.

665
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,500
What do you want?

666
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,820
I've given you a lot of money before.

667
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,140
Isn't it enough?

668
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,140
The money is just to compensate

669
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,660
for my loss in prison for eight years.

670
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,140
And you haven't paid me back

671
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,060
my mother's life.

672
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,460
So,

673
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,860
a year ago,

674
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,180
you started to be my personal caretaker.

675
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,700
You just tried to deal with me.

676
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,740
A year?

677
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,780
It's not just a year.

678
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,340
Do you know

679
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,740
how much time I spent

680
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,540
on you to get revenge?

681
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,340
Eight years.

682
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,980
I spent eight years in prison

683
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,140
studying your life

684
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
and the antipyretic every day.

685
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,820
How did you become

686
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,740
what you are today?

687
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,060
Every day in prison,

688
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,140
I read books,

689
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
read newspapers,

690
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,740
and did the report

691
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,940
to study your relationship

692
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,900
with your great-grandfather,

693
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,740
family,

694
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
and characters.

695
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,700
I want to know

696
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,420
everything about you.

697
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,940
Because only in this way

698
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,500
can I get close to you.

699
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,020
Gong You Cheng.

700
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,620
You are from a poor family.

701
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,180
You were just

702
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,660
a common grass root.

703
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,460
When you were twenty-five,

704
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
you went to the factory to work.

705
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,020
You met the boss's daughter.

706
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,340
Finally,

707
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,740
you spent all your effort

708
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,980
to marry a rich man.

709
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,700
You succeeded in marrying a rich man.

710
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,980
With the help of your father-in-law,

711
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,940
you earned

712
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,340
the first bucket of gold in your life.

713
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,660
What you have

714
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,740
is not based on ability.

715
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,940
You lied to me.

716
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,580
You are not capable at all.

717
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,060
Everything depends on relationship.

718
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,020
You...

719
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,140
Shut up.

720
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,460
Go away.

721
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
Mr. Gong.

722
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,860
You are not in good health.

723
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,020
Don't be a troublemaker.

724
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,340
I have never

725
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
offended you.

726
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,780
You did nothing to me.

727
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,340
We have no grudge.

728
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Then why did you

729
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,740
plot against me with this woman?

730
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,980
You

731
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,980
should die.

732
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,020
Don't kill me.

733
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,500
Sister Ruichuo taught me that

734
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,980
this world

735
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,860
should not be controlled

736
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,700
by you power-hungry people.

737
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,420
Help me.

738
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,060
You bitch.

739
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
Come in.

740
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,540
Help me.

741
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,620
Come in.

742
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,580
You...

743
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,140
Mind your own business.

744
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,060
You come here too.

745
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,020
Don't hit me.

746
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
You don't know me.

747
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,100
Why do you help me?

748
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,900
They are powerful here.

749
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,180
You should be careful.

750
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,860
They won't let you go.

751
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,180
I was caught in the trap.

752
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,700
What about you?

753
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,220
You stole things.

754
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,620
I will be out soon.

755
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,580
It's useless.

756
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,100
No one will hire me.

757
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,260
What did you do before?

758
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,780
I was a nurse.

759
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,660
Why did you steal things?

760
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,900
I was stressed.

761
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,620
I thought it was fun.

762
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,300
But the more I lost some weight,

763
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
the more expensive it S got.

764
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,700
As a nurse,

765
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,980
what's the pressure of treatment?

766
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,700
The diesel housing Cheerleading Unter Nathan's With so difficult.

767
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,260
The employment of my boss

768
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,620
andения-absorbing patientsues.

769
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,620
Y-Yali.

770
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,620
You can't just pretend.

771
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Pretend for what?

772
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,220
You have to be more stupid than anyone.

773
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,020
You have to be worse than anyone

774
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,620
to survive in this world.

775
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,420
I didn't plan to kill you this early,

776
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,820
but those police officers kept biting me.

777
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,420
They said that they had enough evidence to convict you.

778
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,620
If you go to jail, you don't have to die.

779
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,020
I won't let you off.

780
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,820
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I wanted you to get rid of this debt in advance.

782
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,220
I'm sorry.

783
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,820
Mr. Dai Zu Fu, you're suspected of murder.

784
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,820
We need you to help us investigate.

785
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,420
I won't waste my time doing something so boring.

786
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,020
Compared to the case of the businessman in Nan Xue,

787
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm the head of the department.

788
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
The head asked me to change my statement.

789
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,620
Why did he do that?

790
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,420
I don't know.

791
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,220
He never tells me the reason.

792
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,620
Do you know how much time my investment took?

793
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,420
I won't allow you to delay it any longer.

794
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,620
Sorry, Mr. Dai.

795
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,020
Sorry?

796
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,220
Sorry is what a loser would say.

797
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,020
Did you catch my wife? Where is she?

798
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,220
It's hard to predict.

799
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,220
I'm sorry.

800
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,820
