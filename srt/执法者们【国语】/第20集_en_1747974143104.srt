1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Head skin is like a ecosystem.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,840
The problem of the head skin needs to be solved from the beginning.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,280
The sea flying fish is controlled by green screen.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,680
The control of the oil is limited by 72 hours.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,080
The water-based oil balance in the head skin.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
The clean room for you.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,720
Sea flying fish.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Weiss Ramen.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Big mouth singing.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Come back with a move.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The show is coming to an end.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's watch the show.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm different from you.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
People can be fine when they die.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're annoying me too.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was caught by the Grandfather by a wandering turd.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't know where it is.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I won't believe that Zhou Junjie is dead.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Grandfather died?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was investigated by the ICC.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I only know Gao Haoran brought people to the police station.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to remind you one thing.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Be careful of the blood.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't you suspect Ouyang Junmeng?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now you're saying that Lei Sa has a problem.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who can take me away?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Who is in the far distance?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Who is with me?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's exchange our hands.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of the world.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid of the world.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid of the world.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid of the world.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid of the world.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid of the world.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid of the world.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid of the world.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm afraid of the world.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid of the world.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid of the world.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm afraid of the world.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm afraid of the world.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid of the world.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid of the world.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm afraid of the world.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm afraid of the world.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid of the world.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm afraid of the world.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid of the world.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm afraid of the world.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm afraid of the world.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm afraid of the world.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Summer

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Come on.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Come out and eat something.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I want to be a witness.

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
I will take your witness as my blessing.

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I've been with him for so long.

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I can't take it.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
The only thing I can do is to testify.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not doing this for myself.

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
I want you to promise me one thing.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
You will make a fund for my remaining assets

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,400
and raise Xu Sisi's son.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
I will give him the best education.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I have no choice, but I can raise the child.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
I can't promise you anything.

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
But I will do my best.

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
Sit.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
I see.

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,000
I understand.

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Thank you.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
The police just informed us.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Zhou Junjie didn't die.

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
That means you're right.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
The whole thing is a conspiracy.

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,800
It's the police who planned it.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
How is Zhou Junjie now?

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
He was caught by someone

81
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,200
and escaped the last time.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And he found Dai Yongqiang.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
I want to reopen the case.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
As long as Dai Yongqiang stops,

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
we can tell the police.

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes.

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
I know.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I will be happy.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The police informed me.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
They found Xu Sisi's body on the sea.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
So you know him.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's none of your business.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
Dai's family is doing bad things.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
No one can stop him.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Someone will be killed.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Dai Yongqiang has promised

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,600
to transfer him to the power plant.

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
He will stop the order to take him to the police.

99
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,200
He will tell your friends and others.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't worry.

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
It will end soon.

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,800
A'Beng.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,400
I was caught by the Ouyang Cere

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
when I was not here.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Is there anything special?

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Nothing special

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
except Ouyang Cere.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Do you think Ouyang Cere is a spy?

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
I really don't know.

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,000
If it's not Ouyang Cere,

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
who do you think it is?

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
It's higher than Madam Lu.

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
It has 45 CSP.

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
16 ACP.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
And 5 SACP.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
It's the leader of Lei's family.

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
You are also concerned about this?

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
I also want to catch the spy.

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
And I can help you.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
I even checked the people in our group.

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
It's none of their business.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Anyway,

123
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
every thing is careful now.

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
I don't know who is the spy.

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Don't be so hard on others.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll go back to the police station.

127
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Tell me if there is anything.

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, Madam Zhang.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've put the gun down.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't do it.

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
You can.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I still have your gun.

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
I've sold the store.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
You should leave here as soon as possible.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't want to get in your way.

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
You should leave.

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
All of us

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,600
are in the final round today.

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
If we don't finish the final round,

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
we will be in trouble sooner or later.

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't worry.

142
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
I will avenge Ruiya.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
It's over.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Do you understand?

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
I don't want you to be like him.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Besides Ruiya,

147
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
I have two more friends to attack me.

148
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
You should listen to me.

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
I've killed many people.

150
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't want to lose you.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Listen to me.

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
My life is full of troubles.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
I just hope you and A Xin

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
will be safe and sound.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm satisfied with your safety.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,600
You also want me to be happy, right?

157
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Android Android

158
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Android

159
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
What?

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
What happened?

161
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Nothing happened.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,880
It's just like the way it is.

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,800
Why?

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Really?

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Didn't you write a lot of comments?

166
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
How did you write them?

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
你們都 mel 상.

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
I recently entered the dance school of the school.

169
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,840
And then there are many small-scale performances.

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
So amazing.

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,080
You just joined the show.

172
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,320
You can go out and perform.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,960
Okay.

174
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll go over and support you.

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,600
Don't be like that.

176
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm like a student.

177
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
And those dances,

178
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm standing on one side.

179
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,280
What's the matter with you?

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,840
Anyway, if you participate in it,

181
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,680
I will definitely come and support you.

182
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay.

183
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,560
In the future,

184
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
when I have more big performances,

185
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
I'll ask you to watch them.

186
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,080
Okay.

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
And now I've thought it through.

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800
I still like dancing.

189
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,120
So I'll dance on one side and learn on the other side.

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
I won't give up.

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,600
You've really grown up.

192
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,520
Before,

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,920
Aunt Rui Chou shared a story with me.

194
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
She said that a girl

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
always wanted to take back what she lost.

196
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,840
But after she took it back,

197
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
she suddenly found out

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,400
that she didn't have the original intention.

199
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
She slowly became another person.

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,280
So she told me to follow my heart

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
and love myself.

202
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
What's wrong?

203
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,720
Nothing.

204
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,760
I told you everything.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Okay.

206
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
See you at the police station in three hours.

207
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,160
Zhou Sen.

208
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
I've only been wearing the ancestral uniform this time.

209
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,560
Guess how long I'll be sentenced.

210
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,280
What will the court judge do?

211
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
Do you think

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,560
I can apply for a sentence?

213
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,160
As long as you're willing to cooperate,

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,200
you can do it.

215
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,560
That's good.

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,320
You know that, too.

217
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to keep my life and come out.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can watch Le Qiao grow up

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
and marry him.

220
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm not a child.

221
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
But I think he can do it.

222
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
I used to wear the ancestral uniform and take care of me.

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,320
I didn't have a choice in many things.

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
You can choose the right one this time.

225
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Zhou Sen.

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,760
I've made it.

227
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,520
Zhou Sen, have a chat.

228
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,720
Okay.

229
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
I'll go back to the police station and take care of the things.

230
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,360
Okay. See you later.

231
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,000
Wait for me.

232
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
The forward shot ran off.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Please stand it aside.

234
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,960
A'bao,

235
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,440
the comentarios have run off.

236
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,800
Two killers are involved.

237
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I suspect he's going to the hospital to see that kid.

238
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Okay, Sister Yin Yuan.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
After the gun was fired, I prepared a gun for you.

240
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
You can use it to help me with the solution.

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You're not really friends.

243
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
How can you say that to a colleague?

244
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Luckily, I got the news.

245
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Just like what Gao Si Er often said.

246
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Don't make trouble.

247
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Bye-bye.

248
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Don't be like that.

249
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Before I leave,

250
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I'll treat you two to a big meal.

251
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
What?

252
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
He likes to eat expensive food.

253
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
I'll have a coffee.

254
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Am I real?

255
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
You're lying.

256
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Who wants to eat?

257
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I know you're lying.

258
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Really?

259
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Because he's having a rest.

260
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
He'll go to Germany later.

261
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
I've never heard you say that.

262
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
In that school,

263
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
there are very few students who are born and raised.

264
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
I didn't expect that they would say that.

265
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Who knows that they're really pregnant?

266
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
When are you leaving?

267
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Hello?

268
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I've always been looking for you.

269
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
But I found a picture of a child

270
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
in the propaganda book of the Eastern District Children's Hospital.

271
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
It turns out that it was taken by the vice president.

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Where is he now?

273
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
He went to the Children's Hospital.

274
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I don't know what he would do.

275
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Brother Wang Qian, come here.

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Si Si, you have to protect me.

277
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,000
However,

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
there's still one time

279
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
that you should revenge them for what you did

280
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
and show yourwww to them.

281
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,520
When you mistake Feng Wei

282
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:20,420
to differentiategas or

283
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
I've taught you for so many years.

284
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Why are you still so stupid?

285
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
You...

286
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
You never thought that I would be here.

287
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Then what you want to get,

288
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
no matter how much you pay, you'll get it.

289
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Isn't it what you taught me?

290
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Little demon,

291
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
why aren't you awake yet?

292
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
That woman is using you.

293
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
You're still young and have a lot of money.

294
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,420
I've been waiting for you all my life.

295
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,420
You're doing this for such a cheap thing?

296
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
You're doing this for such a cheap thing?

297
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
You've been giving us two fathers a lot of years of love.

298
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Because I'm also your cheap thing.

299
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Don't tell me what a father and son you are.

300
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
My name is Zhang.

301
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
I'm not a generation.

302
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
I don't want to accept your business.

303
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
I just want to be a normal person.

304
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
I want to live a normal life.

305
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
I don't want to be like you.

306
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't want to live with you.

307
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,420
I don't want to feel like a good person.

308
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,420
I don't want to stress you anymore as much as I do.

309
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
What does that song mean to a elder soul guy?

310
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
If any of you still have these himself,

311
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
just release him now.

312
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
I'll give you another chance.

313
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,420
You're just a imposter now.

314
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Think of it clearly.

315
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,340
Do you really support inhalation

316
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,460
What do you want?

317
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
You often tell me that you are a father and son.

318
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,220
You are getting more and more willing to leave.

319
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,020
You have done everything you can now.

320
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,220
I don't agree with that.

321
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,940
I didn't have the blood before.

322
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,860
But today, I will definitely take her away.

323
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,860
Go.

324
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,640
I'm scared.

325
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,900
You can't ask me to give you my hand,

326
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,540
Or he would just…

327
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,880
Go,

328
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
go!

329
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,580
Go!

330
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,740
Go!

331
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,680
Go!

332
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,160
Go!

333
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,480
Go!

334
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Exactly.

335
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,600
As imagined,

336
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,220
it's not in your handwriting.

337
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,060
細福把陳老貴的一雙目標

338
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,780
是囚 Jacob's

339
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,860
Check to see whether

340
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,160
a drop of water

341
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
seems to be Omic KEY.

342
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
I'm sure

343
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,320
I'm not thatnasal or���

344
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Move aside! This is the hospital!

345
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Move aside! Move aside!

346
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
Move aside!

347
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Move aside! Move aside!

348
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,340
What's going on?

349
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,340
What happened, Mr. Jiang?

350
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,340
I don't know. There are so many gunshots in the village.

351
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Something happened. The hospital has gunshots.

352
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,340
Have you found Rui Qiu?

353
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll go in first. Be careful when you come later.

354
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
I'll eat outside. Follow me.

355
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Let's go!

356
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Move aside!

357
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Get down!

358
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
Move aside!

359
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Lan Che!

360
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Move aside!

361
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
Rui Qiu!

362
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Rui Qiu, do you know what you're doing?

363
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
I know I was wrong. I was too persistent.

364
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
I was too persistent and I got in contact with many people.

365
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
I owe them.

366
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,340
I only know that this kid was taken care of by someone.

367
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,340
If you take him away, no one will take revenge.

368
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,340
Who are you? Why did you help us?

369
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,340
I'm Si Si's friend.

370
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I've been insisting on meeting you and Dai Zu Fu.

371
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,340
Why did you do that?

372
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
Because I want revenge.

373
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,340
So, the only thing I can do is to save Le Qiao from you.

374
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,340
You have to believe me.

375
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

376
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
We were too late to get the person we were looking for.

377
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Okay, don't talk about that.

378
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
There was a sniper on the other side of the room.

379
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
I wanted to kill Dai Zu Fu.

380
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Look at yourself.

381
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,340
Wait a minute.

382
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Hey, Niu.

383
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
Yes.

384
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
Check the roadside of the killer.

385
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
See if anyone is in there.

386
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,340
And find out if there's a sniper nearby.

387
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Got it.

388
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

389
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I'll keep the sniper. Take a good rest.

390
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Okay.

391
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Wait for me here.

392
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Hey, didn't we say there were two people?

393
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Why are there more than one?

394
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,340
I'm not going to the ship.

395
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
Please give me some time.

396
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
I'll tell him a few words.

397
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Hurry up.

398
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
There's some money here.

399
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
You must keep a low profile when you go abroad.

400
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
And avoid Dai Zu Fu's eyes.

401
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Take good care of Le Qiao.

402
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
Don't come back to Hong Kong.

403
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
Thank you.

404
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
If you help me this time,

405
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
what if the killer finds out about you?

406
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
I'll have a conversation with him.

407
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
Most importantly, don't contact anyone else.

408
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
Thank you.

409
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Let's go.

410
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Police.

411
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Mr. Dai has just been released.

412
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Why are you still here?

413
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
I have something to ask you, boss.

414
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Well, is it a dirty business?

415
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Ask Zhou Si to come in.

416
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Sorry.

417
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
What for?

418
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,340
Mr. Dai only asked Zhou Si to come in.

419
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
I didn't ask you.

420
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
I'm sorry.

422
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,340
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,340
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
I didn't ask you.

431
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
I told your colleague that

432
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,340
I didn't know anyone else but you.

433
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
You rushed in without reason.

434
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
I didn't know what happened.

435
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
I just wanted to ask you.

436
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
Do you know who wants to kill you?

437
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
I...

438
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
I know

439
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
I won't be here now.

440
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Do you think it's useful to catch me

441
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,340
in the court?

442
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Do you really think

443
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
I'm the only one who can do this?

444
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
You're against that traitor.

445
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Did you catch him?

446
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
I thought Dai Yongqiang could only be the one who killed Dai Zufu.

447
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
He helped us find that traitor.

448
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
In the end, he was in a hurry.

449
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
Dai Zufu

450
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
made that hospital

451
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
like a battlefield.

452
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
The police didn't kill him.

453
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
There's no way.

454
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
He didn't shoot the gun.

455
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
The killer wouldn't have shot him.

456
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
And he was so cunning.

457
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
He was in the hospital.

458
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
He knew it wasn't easy

459
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
to let us know.

460
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,340
In the end,

461
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
it's all because Li Yaowen took away Dai Yongqiang.

462
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
He wasted some money.

463
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,340
The number you dialed

464
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,340
is currently unavailable.

465
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Please call again later.

466
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Mr. Zhou.

467
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Mr. Zhou.

468
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Wait a minute.

469
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Thank you, sir.

470
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
He's really capable.

471
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
What's going on?

472
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
Mr. Zhou.

473
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Mr. Zhou.

474
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Mr. Zhou.

475
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Mr. Zhou.

476
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Mr. Zhou.

477
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
Mr. Zhou.

478
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Mr. Zhou.

479
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Mr. Zhou.

480
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
Mr. Zhou.

481
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
Mr. Zhou.

482
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Mr. Zhou.

483
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
Mr. Zhou.

484
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Mr. Zhou.

485
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Mr. Zhou.

486
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I'm the one who's in charge of this.

487
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Thank you, Mr. He.

488
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Brother Qiang, you're welcome.

489
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
You're the one who's in charge of this.

490
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
Mr. Ding.

491
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
What's wrong?

492
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
Mr. Ding.

493
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
Mr. Ding.

494
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Come in.

495
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Mr. Zhou.

496
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Did you find anything about the sniper in the hospital?

497
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
We found the sniper's location.

498
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
It's probably a big sand平

499
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
800 meters away from the hospital.

500
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
800 meters?

501
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
It's far enough.

502
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Yes.

503
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
We haven't found any other clues.

504
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
What about the bullet and the gun?

505
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
We found it.

506
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
We haven't found any.

507
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
If you were the sniper,

508
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
how would you choose to escape the route?

509
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Sorry, sir.

510
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Because there are some clues now,

511
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
I can't push it away.

512
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
It's okay.

513
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Go out.

514
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Yes, sir.

515
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
Is he okay?

516
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
He's fine.

517
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
You're back.

518
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
What's wrong?

519
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
It's too busy this time.

520
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
It's hard to remember.

521
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
What are you busy with?

522
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
I just got promoted.

523
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
I need to do some research.

524
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Oh,

525
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
I haven't congratulated you yet.

526
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
Thank you.

527
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
The case of Danis

528
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
has been passed so quickly.

529
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
It was done with the paper.

530
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
Who's pointing it out?

531
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Lacer.

532
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
He said not to take it.

533
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
By the way, you said just now,

534
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
the sniper from the hospital

535
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
shot from 800 people.

536
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Who else has this gun

537
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
besides the police?

538
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
You're all here.

539
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
Sir.

540
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Sir.

541
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
You're hurt and still come to practice.

542
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,340
No wonder you're in such a good condition.

543
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Not bad.

544
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,340
What's wrong with you?

545
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Sorry, sir.

546
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Don't be sorry.

547
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Just relax.

548
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Actually,

549
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
don't think that

550
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
you're wrong

551
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
when you're in the fight.

552
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
If you think like this,

553
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
you'll be in the corner

554
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
and you'll be wrong all the way.

555
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
In another way,

556
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
every time you're wrong,

557
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
it's all possible.

558
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Let you know

559
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
how to get a right path.

560
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I used to be like this.

561
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Look at him.

562
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,340
He's always the best.

563
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
By the way,

564
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,340
the case of the group of police

565
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
has been arranged by the security bureau

566
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,340
to investigate secretly.

567
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,340
So you don't have to worry about it.

568
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Actually, you two

569
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
are all good police officers.

570
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
The police team needs you.

571
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
So many things happened before.

572
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
It's a torture for everyone.

573
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I hope that these things

574
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
can be over soon.

575
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
We can live a normal life.

576
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Yes, sir.

577
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Then, Zhang Da Zui.

578
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
I'm not...

579
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Be good.

580
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
I don't have any clothes.

581
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
I don't have any clothes.

582
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
You want to eat something healthy?

583
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
I want to eat egg yolk.

584
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
I want to eat egg yolk.

585
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Egg yolk is here.

586
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
My son is still filial.

587
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Zhou Ceng, you're not kind.

588
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Yes, yes, yes.

589
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
But promise me.

590
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
You can only have a bite

591
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
after you finish the porridge.

592
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Okay.

593
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Yes.

594
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
I have no reason

595
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
to do what

596
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
the three of you can do.

597
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
That's good.

598
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
Hey,

599
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
I have something to tell you.

600
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Didn't Dai Zu Fu

601
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
get hurt in the hospital?

602
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Do you think

603
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
anything will happen to you?

604
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
I think A Bang has a problem.

605
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
Think about it.

606
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
You will be in trouble

607
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
if you have a place to live.

608
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Fan Yu ran away.

609
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Find him separately.

610
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
A Bang,

611
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Deng Yongqiang ran away.

612
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,340
I suspect

613
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
he is going to the hospital to see that child.

614
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,340
A Bang?

615
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,340
You are a police officer.

616
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
If A Bang kills me,

617
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
you will be in trouble.

618
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Go away.

619
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I'm sorry, Fan Yu.

620
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
Sorry.

621
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
I was a little late

622
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
because I lost my hand.

623
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
Think about it.

624
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
You've been in trouble

625
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
for such a long time.

626
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Is it your eyes?

627
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
How about I help you follow him?

628
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
See if he believes me.

629
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
No.

630
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
I don't suspect

631
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
my colleague.

632
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
If you look at it from another angle,

633
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm also proving his innocence.

634
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
But

635
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
no money.

636
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Then there is a good video clip.

637
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
Yes.

638
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
And 3,000 dollars.

639
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Thank you.

640
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
Brother,

641
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
you are here.

642
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
Why are you here?

643
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Brother.

644
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Brother.

645
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Brother.

646
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Brother.

647
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Brother.

648
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Brother.

649
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Brother.

650
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I will do it myself.

651
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
You don't worry about me.

652
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Self-harm?

653
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Dai Yongqiang.

654
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
I can't take him back.

655
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
Now I can do it

656
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
by myself.

657
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
And I have found

658
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
the crime of your uncle

659
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:09,340
for so many years.

660
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Do you know that you are going to work in a prison?

661
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
I have not done it.

662
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
Now,

663
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
I don't fear anything.

664
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,140
We can't be so clear.

665
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,980
I don't want you to bear all this alone.

666
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,380
I must help you this time.

667
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,340
We've been investigating Ouyang Jun so highly.

668
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Why haven't we been in a hurry for so long?

669
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,340
If we continue to drag him down, the police will be angry at us sooner or later.

670
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,340
They'll say that we have insufficient evidence and we'll catch him.

671
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,340
We need more evidence from the Law Enforcement Department to make a decision.

672
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,940
I don't think this case is that simple.

673
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,340
We're in a position to make a decision.

674
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,340
When will we see the Law Enforcement Department?

675
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
You don't need to lie to me.

676
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
I've always given you a lot of freedom.

677
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,340
But sometimes you have to be careful.

678
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,340
San'er, I don't want this case to be in the Law Enforcement Department so soon.

679
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
If Ouyang Jun isn't the real內鬼,

680
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,340
all the evidence will be exposed and the real內鬼 will be caught.

681
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,340
What if you can't find anything at the end?

682
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
I'll keep investigating.

683
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Keep investigating? When will you find out?

684
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I know you like to investigate.

685
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
But it's been so many years.

686
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
You can't find anything because of the investigation.

687
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
I just want to tell you that this is your weakness.

688
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
You can't keep the whole court.

689
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,340
You'll never be able to investigate.

690
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
I don't believe in your investigation.

691
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,340
But we also need to explain to the public.

692
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,340
We need to follow the procedures and make a decision.

693
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
If Ouyang Jun is guilty,

694
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
then the court will judge.

695
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,340
Do you think it's useful to arrest me and send me to the court?

696
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Do you really think that I'm the only one who can do this?

697
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,340
Did you catch the real內鬼 in the police team?

698
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,340
You've been following me for days.

699
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Why don't you open the door and see the wound?

700
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
What do you want?

701
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
Do you know who X is?

702
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
I don't know.

703
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
I don't know.

704
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
I don't know.

705
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I don't know.

706
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
I don't know.

707
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
I don't know.

708
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
I don't know.

709
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
I don't know.

710
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
I don't know.

711
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
I don't know.

712
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Do you know who X is?

713
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
What do you mean?

714
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Your wife is dead.

715
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Are you used to it?

716
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Do you miss her a lot?

717
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
That's all I want to say.

718
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Actually, I have another way to delay the investigation.

719
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
Investigate.

720
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
I've said it before.

721
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Don't let them down.

722
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Mr. Dai, I want to go back to help the investigation.

723
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
I'm warning you.

724
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Since you don't have a family,

725
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,340
you can ask your good friend to help you.

726
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Mr. Dai, I want to go back to help you.

727
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,340
I don't know.

728
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,340
I don't know.

729
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,340
I don't know.

730
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
I don't know.

731
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I don't know.

732
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
I don't know.

733
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
I don't know.

734
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,340
I don't know.

735
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,340
I don't know.

736
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I don't know.

737
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
I don't know.

738
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
I don't know.

739
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I don't know.

740
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,120
Go back when you areanner.

741
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Chatting.

742
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Why are youware?

743
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,140
Only if you could change that.

744
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,780
In this world,

745
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,340
who would be your present?

746
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,660
Call Master.

747
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,820
You father and mother.

748
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,920
They are your niece.

Who could have helped you at this hour?
