1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hmm? Mama is so cute.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Outside of danger, there will be a lot of problems.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The new uncle and the new relative are all healthy and beautiful.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They are now in the house to be taken care of.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Mama will take care of it.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Healthy and beautiful.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now we have found the biggest spy in the police team.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Tina's disappearance is related to Dai Zufu.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are many photos in it.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Every one of them can kill us.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But we can't stop until we find out.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If we don't do this, the efforts will be wasted.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You escaped that woman's prisoner. Did you find her?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your husband and you have lost your treasure.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What if your husband dies?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I didn't think about it when I came here.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, hurry up!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't let that cop get in trouble.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who is the person who is in the name of the widow?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who can take me away?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who is in the far-away world?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will return the world to me.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is there anyone who can protect me?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There is no need for too many reasons.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the dark, I light up the fire.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will walk away.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will be your hero.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will be your hero.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will be your hero.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I will be your hero.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I will be your hero.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will be your hero.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will be your hero.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will be your hero.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will be your hero.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will be your hero.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will be your hero.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will be your hero.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will be your hero.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will be your hero.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will be your hero.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I will be your hero.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will be your hero.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I will be your hero.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will be your hero.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will be your hero.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I will be your hero.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will be your hero.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will be your hero.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I will be your hero.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will be your hero.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will be your hero.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will be your hero.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Optimize my best if you can continue to be the hero.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will be your hero.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will be your hero.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will be your hero.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will be your hero.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
I will be your hero.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
From now on,

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will be your hero if you can continue to be the hero.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will be your hero.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will be your hero.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will be your hero.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey,

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm sorry for talking錦.

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Everyone wants me dead.

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,960
If you don't want to let people bully you,

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
you must do it.

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
No one dares to bully you.

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Just a woman?

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
You're so strong.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,200
If you like her,

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,600
I'll find a good husband.

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,760
Mr. Dai, I haven't found Zhu Jingjie yet.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,160
I just want you to find someone.

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,920
Do you want to find her for so long?

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,120
If you can't find her,

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
you can all choose her for me.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Yes.

81
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,880
You're useless.

82
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Okay.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,600
Did you sleep well?

84
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes, I slept well too.

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Next time,

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,560
shouldn't you

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
open the second channel

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,520
on this wedding?

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,320
Don't get angry.

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll help you in the future.

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Yes.

92
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Your Majesty.

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Your Majesty.

94
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
The reporter has been caught.

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
He's here.

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Your Majesty.

97
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,920
C.C. is the chief of the Qingsong Division, Ouyang Jin.

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
When will the marriage be decided?

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Please cooperate.

100
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Will the operation continue?

101
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Please cooperate.

102
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,440
Your Majesty.

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
The news of the people's return to the police is getting lower.

104
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Please cooperate.

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Your Majesty.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Your Majesty.

107
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Please cooperate.

108
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Your Majesty.

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Please cooperate.

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,120
The coffee is finally available.

111
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,920
I'm Gao Haoran, the chief of the high-level investigation team of ICC.

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Today, I invite Chief Deputy Chief Ouyang Jin to come here.

113
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,320
He is the one who has been working for the public.

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
He wrote the investigation.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Please ask if you agree with this contract.

117
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,000
Who is the signature on the contract?

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,320
This is the contract of the police, the wireless transmission and receiver.

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
The one on the contract is my signature.

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you know which company is the contract's report?

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Lianya Communication.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This company is the company under the leadership of the group.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It is now involved in multiple illegal activities.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Why would you put the police such an important communication device?

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
The outside court is giving it to him.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,600
The outside court is using the signature to handle the government's requirements.

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,400
All the considerations are written in white and black.

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
It is based on material supply and purchase rules.

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Not only can I make a judgment.

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
And this contract has been signed a year ago.

131
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,000
The person who was killed on that day used this communication device.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Could it be that the communication device was stolen?

133
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,600
So the road to the witness was leaked.

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,000
I have asked my colleagues to check the wireless transmission record.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There is no leak.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
As for the details, you can check the record.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Besides, you arrested Wang Zhenxiong.

138
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
He has admitted that he has a tracking device.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,200
So the killer knows that the project of Xu Sisi

140
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
has nothing to do with the wireless transmission we have.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
May I ask if you recognize the person in the photo?

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
I do.

143
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
He is my subordinate, Lu Yongtong.

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Lu Yongtong has admitted that

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,600
he has been helping the police to bring the X to the scene.

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,800
And these are all his subordinates.

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
I don't quite understand what you want to express.

148
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
He is your subordinate. He is a criminal.

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
What are your feelings and explanations?

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,600
I admit that my subordinate didn't monitor my subordinate well.

151
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
But I have nothing to do with what he did.

152
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I know that you are a subordinate.

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Lu Yongtong has been with you for ten years.

154
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
And these ten years and the development of Dai Zu's family

155
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,000
can be said to be quite stable.

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,400
We are just the developers.

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,800
It is not right to use your subjective feelings

158
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,600
to judge whether someone is guilty or not.

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
It is not right to be a criminal.

160
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,700
I really hope that you, the ICAC,

161
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
stop being a judge of the subjective attitude.

162
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,200
One is subjective.

163
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,700
If you don't know one thing,

164
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,600
do you know how many people have been here for ten years?

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Because of these people,

166
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,200
they have done wrong things and even lost their lives.

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Mr. Dai.

168
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Mr. Dai.

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Mr. Dai.

170
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Mr. Dai.

171
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Mr. Dai.

172
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Mr. Dai.

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Mr. Dai.

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Mr. Dai.

175
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Mr. Dai.

176
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Mr. Dai.

177
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Mr. Dai.

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Mr. Dai.

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Mr. Dai.

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Mr. Dai.

181
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. Dai.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
We have found the warehouse down there.

183
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
But we still can't find it.

184
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,200
We suspect that it might be on the shelf.

185
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Where is the woman you found in my room?

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Boss Dai took her away.

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
We don't know where she went.

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,000
You can leave.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Okay.

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,300
So shameless.

191
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:21,640
아아

192
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
and you are called a secret.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,920
What about you?

194
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,080
You have a close relationship with Wang Zhenxiong.

195
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Does that mean

196
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
you have a chance to be accepted?

197
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
Are you also a former SAC researcher?

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,480
We found out that

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,680
you and Lu Yongtong's relationship

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
is very close.

201
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
You came to pick him up yourself.

202
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
What did you say?

203
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,160
No matter what,

204
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
work is more important than family.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,320
There is no need to accompany him.

206
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,720
Because he has been worried about his career for years,

207
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,280
he hid his private life from him.

208
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
I asked him to cherish him

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,120
and spend more time with him.

210
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,840
Who is this person?

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
He is your spy.

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,640
You refused to reveal his identity

213
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
and made him appear as a spy.

214
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
He was a hostage.

215
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,160
I know you will use the secret agreement

216
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
to refuse to answer.

217
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,520
But I really want to know

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,520
how you treat your spy.

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Do you know that Zhou Junjie committed suicide?

220
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,480
I know.

221
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,360
Zhou Junjie is indeed a outstanding agent.

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,520
I feel a little pity

223
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
when he left.

224
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
According to the police record,

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
you asked him to stop, right?

226
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes.

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,360
Because his wife, He Tianru,

228
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
caused him to be unwell.

229
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,200
So I think he is not suitable for work.

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,720
Zhou Junjie's missing time

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
and the time he was brought back to the capital

232
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,720
to investigate

233
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,520
are very stable.

234
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,080
I don't know if you think it's too coincidental.

235
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,120
I won't do these unethical guesses.

236
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,000
I only know that at the scene,

237
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
Zhou Zeyu left his aunt and some personal belongings.

238
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,120
But the only strange thing is

239
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,400
Zhou Zeyu loves his wife so much

240
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
that he can even die for her.

241
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,680
Why is he so reluctant

242
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,920
to take her wedding ring?

243
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
Do you know

244
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,760
the transaction record of this gold-out-of-the-court?

245
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,360
I have no impression.

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,520
I don't know.

247
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,720
You made this account.

248
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
I don't know

249
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,680
if I have such an account.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,880
According to the record,

251
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
in the past ten years,

252
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
no one has stopped transferring money to this account.

253
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,360
The total number is 7,920,000.

254
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,000
And the time to transfer money

255
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
and the time to help X

256
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
with Lu Yongtong

257
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,280
is completely stable.

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
Gao Zi, if you don't believe me,

259
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
you can go to the bank to check it.

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,960
What age is it now?

261
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,960
If you want to take a risk,

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
it's not that hard.

263
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,000
Everything is related to you.

264
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
But all our evidence is proof.

265
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,600
You are the biggest guilt in the police.

266
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,080
I came here today

267
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,240
to clarify my innocence.

268
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,600
But now you are doing such a serious execution.

269
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,680
I need to accompany you.

270
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,080
To blame of rapists

271
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,080
or corrupt Studio they were located in

272
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
It's easier for you to lose hope.

273
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
Interview andンダ

274
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Your power is pretty high, don't you

275
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
You never see this situation

276
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
Nice

277
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,840
Such a soft and strong man

278
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,660
This Sami'an's name is much heavier than a rotten egg

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,560
Then удоб

280
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,740
I hit you

281
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
your country's nation

282
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,200
Take the head, return me

283
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,220
Treat Annie

284
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
Go

285
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
or use Hong Kong's professional security power

286
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,560
to ban your ICAC

287
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,040
to investigate any confidential information.

288
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,920
Now,

289
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,200
the legal power is on our side.

290
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,200
These cases

291
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
will be your first blow.

292
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm still considering.

293
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,520
You're still considering?

294
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,200
If you delay for longer,

295
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
the more data you get.

296
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
Only by finding X

297
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
can we have a chance

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
to arrest the Taizu family

299
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,440
and stop Rachel.

300
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
We can even know

301
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,840
if Rachel committed suicide.

302
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Unless

303
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
you think X is not Ouyang Jun.

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Did she tell you anything

305
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,520
in the end?

306
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm not sure

307
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
if Ouyang Jun is X.

308
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,320
But she said something important.

309
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,240
Zhao Junjie loves her wife so much

310
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,920
that she even wanted to die for her.

311
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
Why did she take the ring off?

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
That's right.

313
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
She didn't take it

314
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,000
when they were getting divorced.

315
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
Unless someone helped her take it off.

316
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,800
Let's go.

317
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Zhou Zi.

318
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,160
My wife is here.

319
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,040
Tell me.

320
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
I really don't know

321
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
where your wife is.

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,080
But I'm here to help you.

323
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,080
You think I'll trust you?

324
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,080
Tell me.

325
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,120
Where is my wife?

326
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Where is she?

327
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,240
I don't have time.

328
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
I think you need to call her.

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
I'll call her now.

330
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,840
Hello.

331
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,680
Hello.

332
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:20,920
Hello.

333
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm A Jie.

334
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,880
I got a useless oil tank

335
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
from the Taizu family.

336
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,880
I don't know where it is.

337
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
Help me fix the wire.

338
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,320
Hello.

339
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,440
Did you hear that?

340
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,280
Hello.

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,440
Hello.

342
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,560
Hello.

343
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
He's really dead.

344
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,640
Dairug.

345
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
Check the power supply.

346
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,960
The one who just called me

347
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,880
is from where?

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,640
He's anxious.

349
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,080
He's really dead.

350
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,120
He's still alive.

351
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,040
Don't tell the police

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
about this.

353
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll take this video

354
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
and go to the security director immediately.

355
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,440
Personally,

356
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm afraid

357
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,800
there're no any more

358
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
investigation trouble.

359
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,840
Mr. Dai.

360
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,840
What's the matter?

361
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I'll take you to the nurse now.

362
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
You can see where your wife is at the end of the day.

363
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Mr. Dai.

364
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You go to find Zhou Jingjie.

365
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I'll look into it myself.

366
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Roger.

367
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
My wife is waiting for you.

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'll go to find Zhou Jingjie.

369
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Where is my wife?

370
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
My wife?

371
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Wait a minute.

372
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Take me there.

373
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Take me there.

374
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
No.

375
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
We've been found.

376
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I'm coming.

377
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
You go first.

378
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
What are you doing?

379
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
You're not going to stop me?

380
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Back off.

381
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Back off.

382
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
You go.

383
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Back off.

384
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
You go.

385
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
You go.

386
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
If you want to go,

387
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
you can rely on yourself.

388
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
No one wants to send you off.

389
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Don't stay here

390
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
to make their money.

391
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Go.

392
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Get up.

393
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm the captain now.

394
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I want to go.

395
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Let's go together.

396
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll go.

397
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'll go.

398
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Go.

399
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
What are you doing?

400
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Sit down.

401
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Put down your arms.

402
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Put down your arms.

403
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Get away.

404
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
You can't escape.

405
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Back off.

406
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
What are you doing?

407
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Get in.

408
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Get in.

409
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
What are you doing?

410
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,600
Get in.

411
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,000
Silence, opposing king

412
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,460
Cook here

413
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,820
Did you hear me

414
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,380
What are you doing

415
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,660
당

416
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,500
Go

417
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,080
Why did you put both sides?

418
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,960
Who's in the way?

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
They are fakes.

420
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,300
Wait.

421
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,280
The man over there.

422
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,360
ั้

423
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,280
Just speak.

424
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,320
Back.

425
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,660
Yes!

426
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,400
Littleappox!

427
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,580
Littleappox!

428
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
I'll take you up.

429
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Okay, let's go.

430
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Come, over there.

431
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Go.

432
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
Go.

433
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Go.

434
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Don't move.

435
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
You're quite good.

436
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
You can get out of the way every time.

437
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
But every time,

438
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
you have to leave a piece of stone to clean it up.

439
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
What do you have to do with me?

440
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
What are you doing?

441
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Yao Yao.

442
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
You forced me.

443
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Why did you force Si Si?

444
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Why did you force me to kill people?

445
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Put down the gun now.

446
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
I'll do anything that doesn't happen.

447
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I'm different from you.

448
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
People will die if nothing happens.

449
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
You're even annoying me.

450
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Fine.

451
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,580
Go.

452
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,580
I'll see how long you can last.

453
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Open the gun.

454
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Open the gun.

455
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Wait.

456
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Master.

457
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,580
Master.

458
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I'll give you a ride

459
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
if you want to be with your wife.

460
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
Master.

461
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
My treasured treasured is all over.

462
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Zhao Junjie will come back.

463
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
You have to deal with him.

464
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,580
The press conference is about to start

465
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,580
to respond to the rumors

466
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,580
of the investigation of the nine ICC police members.

467
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,580
Now, we invite the chief of the police, Huang Jingcheng,

468
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
to tell you something.

469
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
First of all, thank you all

470
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
for your concern about the operation of the police.

471
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
I promise

472
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
if there is any harm in the police,

473
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,580
we will act without any resistance.

474
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
We will do it immediately.

475
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
We won't let it go.

476
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Chief, you said that

477
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
it means that there are many harm in the police.

478
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Now, we're still investigating.

479
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
I can't reveal too much.

480
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,580
The police will cooperate with ICAC

481
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,580
to remove the public's doubts.

482
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
I announce again that

483
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Deputy Chief Ouyang Jun has been suspended by the law.

484
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
He is only to inform.

485
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
Is Ouyang Jun really a spy?

486
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
Is he related to the killer?

487
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
The case is investigated by ICAC.

488
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I can't make any comments.

489
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Chief, will the press conference

490
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
be held by the ICAC

491
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
and the ICAC?

492
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,580
I will leave as soon as possible.

493
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,580
During the time that I'm not in Hong Kong,

494
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
I will have Deputy Chief Lei Xue Sen

495
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
to take the position of Chief Ouyang Jun.

496
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
I believe that he can be recognized.

497
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
What will Ouyang Jun do

498
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
to investigate the ICAC?

499
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
So far, the police

500
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,580
can't reveal more details.

501
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Gao Sen,

502
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
Zhou Jun Jie's phone call.

503
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
Ding Xiao Fei?

504
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Who is it?

505
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
It turns out that Ding Xiao Fei

506
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
is Zhou Jun Jie's informant.

507
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
But he is also

508
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
a suspicious person who was missing at the same time.

509
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Two people were missing together.

510
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Hello?

511
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Hello, Lei Sen.

512
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Ah Jie.

513
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Ah Jie?

514
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Are you okay?

515
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
We all thought that you were dead.

516
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Where have you been?

517
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
I was arrested by Deputy Chief Ouyang Jun

518
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
and caught a useless radio station.

519
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
He did a lot of illegal things here.

520
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
Wait for me to come back

521
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
and explain everything to everyone.

522
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Okay.

523
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Where is Deputy Chief Ouyang Jun now?

524
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
He ran away.

525
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
You should try to find this station's phone call.

526
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Then you should find the nearby country

527
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
to see if it can save us.

528
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Okay.

529
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Sorry, Mr. Dai.

530
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Mr. Wei is looking for you.

531
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
Mr. Dai.

532
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
I am Deputy Chief Lei,

533
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Deputy Chief Ouyang Jun.

534
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Now we have a case

535
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,580
about Ouyang Jun.

536
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Please go back and help investigate it.

537
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,580
If you want to know anything,

538
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
I will cooperate.

539
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
We found out that Ouyang Jun

540
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
and your company

541
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,580
have been contacted by

542
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,580
a company called Lian Ya.

543
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
We are looking for you.

544
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
We are looking for you.

545
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
We are looking for you.

546
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
We are looking for you.

547
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
We are looking for you.

548
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Lian Ya has contacted me.

549
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
He came to me privately.

550
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Lei Zan.

551
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Sit down.

552
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Don't stand there.

553
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
I am not used to

554
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
talking to people with my head up.

555
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,580
My company is so big.

556
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
It has so many businesses.

557
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,580
How could I?

558
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Every family has their own experience.

559
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Then it seems that this restaurant

560
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
is also responsible for

561
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,580
the head of my privacy group.

562
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Other businesses

563
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
have already been assigned

564
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
to different heads.

565
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,580
It is responsible.

566
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
I am referring to your company.

567
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
The wireless communication

568
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
and receiving contract

569
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
signed by the police.

570
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
It is not a small amount.

571
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,580
You don't know it.

572
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,580
Really?

573
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
It is not very clear.

574
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,580
It is okay.

575
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,580
I will call the secretary.

576
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
Ask him.

577
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Mr. Da.

578
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
I hope you can cooperate.

579
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Because this time

580
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,580
the relationship is very serious.

581
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Lei Zan.

582
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
You are the deputy director.

583
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
You are still so concerned about the business.

584
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
That's great.

585
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
We can rest assured

586
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,580
that we can do business.

587
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
We won't let others

588
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,580
come to break the deal, right?

589
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
What do you want to eat?

590
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Take Mrs. to see.

591
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
There are no trains.

592
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
There is no boardingший shop.

593
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
Now,

594
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,580
the first delivery truck

595
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,620
of our big business

596
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,580
can waited like this.

597
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Zhou series.

598
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
go to the safe room

599
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
can you give me to a place?

600
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I'm just a lonely person.

601
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm like his only family.

602
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
I really want to see him.

603
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Please feel at ease.

604
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,580
Thank you.

605
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,580
A'Bao, inform the car to change the route.

606
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Thank you.

608
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Leqiao.

609
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Brother, where's my mother?

610
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,580
She's busy.

611
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
She went to work abroad.

612
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,580
So she can't come often to accompany you.

613
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,580
But she told me she wanted to miss you.

614
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
She loved you.

615
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,580
So even if she's not around you,

616
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
you must listen to the doctor.

617
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
Take the medicine.

618
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Hurry up.

619
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,580
She wants to go to the beach and the park.

620
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,580
When you're well,

621
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,580
she'll take you to the foreign country to find your mother.

622
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
When we're together,

623
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
you can meet your mother every day.

624
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,580
We can go to the park and play with the beach.

625
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Okay.

626
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
I'll be well soon.

627
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Good boy.

628
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
Okay.

629
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
It's late now.

630
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Go to sleep.

631
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Go to sleep.

632
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
Mr. Ouyang.

633
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Look after him.

634
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Lei is here to keep him.

635
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
He knows he's with you.

636
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,580
And these comrades will stay here 24 hours.

637
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,580
Mr. Ouyang,

638
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
and Jin Keng Nong,

639
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,580
stay here.

640
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Don't go anywhere.

641
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Why?

642
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Ouyang is being investigated by ICAC.

643
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
If the police really have the internal ghost,

644
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,580
you'll be in danger.

645
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
If the internal ghost finds out,

646
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
it'll be in danger.

647
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Ouyang is being investigated by ICAC.

648
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
Why?

649
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
I don't know.

650
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
I just know Gao Haoran

651
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
took someone to the police station to arrest him.

652
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,580
The police are different.

653
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
They've worked in different departments.

654
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Including the pre-pollution,

655
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
professional training,

656
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,580
and the intelligence of the police.

657
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,580
The policy is correct.

658
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
This is the first time.

659
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,580
I still have a lot of time.

660
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,580
I'll invite Mr. Ouyang to come here.

661
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Let's have a good cup of coffee.

662
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Thank you.

663
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Mr. Ouyang,

664
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
you can leave after the procedure is done.

665
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
Please wait a minute.

666
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
I'll pick you up.

667
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,580
I am parte contributing from ICAC,

668
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,580
now I am part of the case.

669
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
You are neurop infused realize

670
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,580
this case.

671
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
What I talk about is over.

672
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
All your witnesses here are pointing to you.

673
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,260
I can sue you any day

674
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,580
but investigation sector,

675
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,080
they're investigating the case set up Studios.

676
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
Aunt Ouyang,

677
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,780
is that the personal criminal,

678
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
I've never tried to find these evidence

679
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
so easily in the past years.

680
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
It's like I have a pair of heartless hands

681
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
to hand it to me.

682
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Tell me directly.

683
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
This matter is not that simple.

684
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
You want to try me?

685
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,780
I just want to know the whole place.

686
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,780
I want to find out the evidence on the surface.

687
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Okay.

688
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,780
I'll tell you the truth.

689
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,780
You don't just know the secret of the ICAC.

690
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
As a deputy director,

691
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,780
I really want to find out which secret is the secret.

692
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I've already investigated it secretly.

693
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,780
What did you find out?

694
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
I don't have enough clues.

695
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
But I'm sure I can tell you

696
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,780
that it's the high-end secret of the ICAC.

697
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,780
I'm almost ready to make a new one.

698
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,780
My voice is the highest.

699
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I want to pull it off.

700
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Which one do you think is the best?

701
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
Do you have any evidence?

702
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Evidence?

703
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
You've got many evidence to control me.

704
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,780
How reliable are these evidence?

705
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
I'll tell you honestly.

706
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,780
I won't believe that Zhou Junjie is dead.

707
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,780
I think your idea is the same as mine.

708
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
If you need anything,

709
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I'll come back and have your coffee.

710
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Hello?

711
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Where are you?

712
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm back safely.

713
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Where have you been?

714
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,780
Laser is keeping me safe.

715
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,780
What happened to the ICAC?

716
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Many people were locked up there.

717
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
They were doing illegal things.

718
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Where is Dai Yongqiang, his son?

719
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,780
That ICAC that was locked up in the palace.

720
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,780
I have news.

721
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Yes.

722
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,780
I brought Dai Yongqiang back.

723
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Did you find your wife?

724
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,780
Sorry.

725
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Let's talk about details later.

726
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Laser has arranged a safe house for Dai Yongqiang.

727
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,780
I'm going to make him a manor.

728
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,780
I'll find out who is the manor at that time.

729
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Hello?

730
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Are you listening?

731
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
As a friend,

732
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I want to remind you to be careful of the laser.

733
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,780
What are you talking about?

734
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,780
You're suspecting Ouyang Jun, aren't you?

735
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
You said there's something wrong with Laser.

736
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,780
What are you looking for in the ICAC?

737
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,780
Ouyang Jun only helped investigate.

738
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,780
We haven't officially arrested him.

739
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
There have been many evidences.

740
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
All of them are aimed at Ouyang Jun.

741
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,780
And someone said you were dead.

742
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
All of them are fake.

743
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,780
I think someone is hiding behind the back.

744
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,780
You can't say it was Laser.

745
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I know him for years.

746
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
He won't be the manor.

747
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
I didn't say it was him.

748
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
I just want to say that

749
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
you didn't believe anyone

750
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,780
before the whole thing was done.

751
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,780
I just want to tell you that I believe in Laser.

752
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Let's keep in touch.

753
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
I...

754
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Do you think something happened to you?

755
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Relax.

756
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Actually, you shouldn't think that it's a mistake.

757
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,780
If you think like that,

758
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,780
you'll be in the corner of the corner and you'll be in the corner all the way.

759
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Where is the manor you were in the army?

760
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Did you catch him?

761
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,780
Do you think

762
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,780
you can change the person

763
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:49,780
who is in the mirror and is hanging around with you?

764
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,780
Who is it?

765
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,780
Do you think you can be ashamed?

766
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Without you, the miracle around you

767
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
is more obvious.

768
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,780
The promise you made

769
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,780
is the same as the same.

770
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

771
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:33,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

772
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Who is it?

773
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,780
Do you think you can be ashamed?

774
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Without you, the miracle around you

775
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,780
is more obvious.

776
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Who is it?

777
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,780
Do you think you can be ashamed?

778
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Without you, the miracle around you

779
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,780
is more obvious.

780
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

781
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

782
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

783
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,780
Without you, the miracle around you

784
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,780
is more obvious.

785
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

786
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

787
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

788
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

789
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

790
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

791
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

792
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,780
The promise you made is the same as the same.

793
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Is there anyone who will protect me?

794
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,580
I don't need to see my reason

795
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,180
In the dark, the light is gone

796
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,580
I'm not pushing back

797
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm begging you

798
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,780
If you are all around me

799
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,980
You will be the last

800
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,980
Is there anyone who can take me?

801
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,180
Who is in the far-away corner?

802
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,580
Is there anyone who will give me a hand?

803
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:15,780
Is there anyone who will protect me?

804
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,580
I don't need to see my reason

805
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,380
In the dark, the light is gone

806
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:27,980
I'm not pushing back

807
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:36,780
If you are all around me

808
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,180
It doesn't matter everything

809
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,580
You are okay
