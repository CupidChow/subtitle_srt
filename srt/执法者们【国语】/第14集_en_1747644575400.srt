00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Only low level independent necessities I want to be delicious

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,660
I have a lot of opticians

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:12,120
Occasional

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,380
I'm not so hot

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,380
I'm not hot

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,940
Does it hurt?

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,980
Is there no medicine for pain in the body?

8
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:05,180
Oh, is there anyone to guard for me?

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,980
I don't need too many reasons

10
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,380
Light up the fire in the dark

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Don't retreat

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:24,180
If you are in my care

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,180
You will be the last

Episode 16

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,180
Qian Feng and the others provided medical expenses

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,180
to exchange for the body

18
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,180
The exchange condition is to make you admit your crime

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,180
But Auntie has already refused them

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Auntie told me not to tell you

22
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,180
What about my mom?

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,180
Last night, she suffered a heart attack

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,180
and left

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm sorry

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,180
It was because of Mei captain

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,180
that my mom couldn't suffer

28
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,180

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,180
interest Li Ya Wen's崇 did the 4th trial

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,100
Either of you guys didn't get realized or the situation

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,540
back then was so tight already?

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,540
Please stop it.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,740
What were you looking for?

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,300
Which one of you was trying to control me?

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,980
I don't know that now.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,020
As long as you don't believe something you heard again,

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,460
I don't care about it.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,180
You failed.

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,880
Yes.

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,780
I have chosen all the way

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,900
but didn't help you.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,300
And I won't realistically

43
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,020
deal with you.

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,940
It was me who told you to

45
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,700
go meet with a local д macam.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
Because he is the person in charge of this project.

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,300
Then what did he do after he knew about it?

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
He said that he would tell the boss.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,000
But later, I discovered that he didn't tell him.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
He even found a reason to make me fight.

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Later, I heard from other workers that

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,000
that batch of goods was decided by Li Ya Wen.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,600
He and that engineer are colluding to get a refund.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,500
He was afraid that I would expose him and he would be suspicious of me.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,900
Then I want to point out to you, my client,

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
when he knew about the problem of Duan Zhuang,

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
he already informed his boss.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
That is, Gong You Cheng knew about it.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,800
At the same time, he also informed the ICC's chief investigator, Gao Haoran.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
I don't know.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Please take a look at the evidence of the defense.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,200
You saw this document, right?

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
I saw it.

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,400
This document was signed by the boss of Shi Ming Construction, Gong You Cheng.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,200
That is to say, it means that he knows about Duan Zhuang's problem.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The boss signed this document,

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,900
but that batch was decided by Li Ya Wen.

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,600
I want to point out to you that the defendant was signed by the boss's instructions.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,200
He doesn't know about Duan Zhuang's problem. Do you agree?

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,900
Your Honor, I want to send a letter to the chief investigator of the ICC, Gao Haoran.

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,300
At the same time, I also want to hand over the latest evidence of the ICC,

72
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,200
17C.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
Objection.

74
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
We have never received a similar statement.

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
We don't know what this statement is about.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,200
We have officially rejected a similar statement.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
This document is a contract that proves Duan Zhuang's case.

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Who signed this?

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Take a copy of this for the witness.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Lawyer Liu, this document only has a few pages.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
I believe that you will be able to read it soon.

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you still need to be so strict?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Do you still need to wait?

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,040
I want to wait.

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,720
The控方 shouldn't provide new evidence at this stage.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
The defense needs to apply for the case to wait.

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,040
The defense also needs to apply for the trial to leave.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Okay.

89
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,760
Wait for a while.

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
What we can do is

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,480
to apply for the dismissal of the trial.

92
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Because they made a serious mistake this time.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
At this stage,

94
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
there is no new evidence.

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,080
But will this make Tim very troublesome?

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,240
I think you need to figure it out.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,720
You are the one being accused now, not him.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't hold me back.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
I just want this case to end soon.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,520
And I haven't done it.

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
I don't believe I will be in trouble.

102
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
And Tim won't say anything that hurts me.

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
No need.

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Get off me.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,480
I don't want you to bring her to jail.

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
No.

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Director of I.C.A.C,

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,400
do you know this defendant?

109
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,440
We met when we were in M.B.A.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
And became friends later.

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
I will do what I need to do

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
to go to the Ten Commandments Construction to search

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
and get the relevant documents back to SAC.

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,760
Please take a look at the 17C documents in front of you.

115
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,400
Do you recognize this contract?

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,640
This document is the news

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
received by SAC and the Business Investigation Department

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,560
before.

119
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
It's the latest contract

120
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
that the bank got.

121
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Then in this contract signing,

122
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,040
does it show who it is?

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Is it written as Li Yaowen?

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Witness,

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,680
is it written as Li Yaowen?

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,320
Yes.

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
But this contract is very problematic.

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Very problematic?

129
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
Will it affect your judgment

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
because you are friends?

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,200
No.

132
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
Please take a look at the contract signing date.

133
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,160
Can you read it out and tell everyone?

134
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
2014,

135
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,520
October,

136
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
November.

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Take a look at the document 8C next to it.

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,480
Do you recognize this document?

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,760
This is the entry record of Gong Youcheng

140
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,160
who applied for the entry to SAC.

141
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,600
What does it say?

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
From September to November 2014,

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
Gong Youcheng is not in Hong Kong.

144
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
Can I say

145
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,200
that Li Yaowen signed this contract

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,960
on her own accord?

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,600
No.

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
The控邦's charge

149
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,040
is not solid enough.

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,760
She hasn't spoken yet.

151
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,320
Can you let her finish first?

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Say it, witness.

153
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,040
I can't prove what you said.

154
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
The defendant's sentence is established.

155
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,640
He will be jailed for eight years.

156
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,160
I didn't plan to kill you so early.

157
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
But those police officers didn't let you go.

158
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,560
They said they had enough evidence to convict you.

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,560
If you are jailed,

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,560
you don't have to die.

161
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,160
I won't let you go.

162
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm sorry

163
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
for asking you to clear this debt in advance.

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Let me go.

165
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
I can ask someone

166
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
to give you a chance to get out of here.

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
I can't let you go.

168
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
I have a lot of money.

169
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,160
I need to pay a price.

170
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,560
I need to pay a price.

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Do you really think that

172
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
everyone loves money?

173
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
I don't want your money.

174
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I want your life.

175
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
It's useless to kill me.

176
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,960
With your knowledge,

177
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
you can

178
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,160
start a new life anytime.

179
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Let me go.

180
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Don't waste your time on this kind of thing.

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm helping this world to clear out the sins.

182
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,360
How can I waste my time?

183
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm just a businessman.

184
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,160
I can do it

185
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,960
as long as I have the benefits.

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,560
Besides, I have a wife and a child.

187
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
You mention your wife?

188
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
You

189
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
have been using your wife to climb up for decades.

190
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,960
You never loved her.

191
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,960
This is not just about me.

192
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Everyone in the world looks at you like this.

193
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,360
Including your husband.

194
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
You know that

195
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
he looks down on you.

196
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
I wanted to start from your wife.

197
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
I wanted to see him abandon you.

198
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
I wanted to see you be a fool

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
who didn't show up a few decades ago.

200
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
But God stopped me.

201
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
He left faster than me

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
and wanted to send you to jail.

203
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,960
No.

204
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,160
I...

205
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
I've already got a disease

206
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
that's the same as your mother.

207
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,360
I've been punished.

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Besides, I'm so old.

209
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
I went in

210
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,960
and didn't expect to be alive.

211
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,560
You can eat and live well

212
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,360
and avoid your enemies.

213
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
I heard that the hospital in the prison

214
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,560
has better people, equipment and equipment than here.

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,360
That's too cheap.

216
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
I won't let you go to jail.

217
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
No.

218
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
No.

219
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
No.

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
Please.

221
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,560
I didn't want to do this.

222
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,360
I wanted to torture you until you die.

223
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,760
Don't kill me.

224
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
No.

225
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,760
Please.

226
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
You forced me.

227
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
No.

228
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Let me do it.

229
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm more familiar with it.

230
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
No.

231
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Let me go.

232
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,560
Please.

233
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,360
I...

234
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
No.

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
No.

236
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Please.

237
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,960
I gave you this money today

238
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
not because I feel sorry for you.

239
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,960
I appreciate your courage

240
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
and dare to ask for money directly.

241
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
Only the first time,

242
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
not the second time.

243
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Don't worry.

244
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
Not the next time.

245
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
Cheers.

246
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Thank you all for today.

247
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
They will find out sooner or later

248
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,160
that there must be a follow-up.

249
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,760
You should leave Hong Kong as soon as possible

250
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,160
and start a new life

251
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,560
in a place where no one knows you.

252
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Come on.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
You too.

254
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
We won't take your money.

255
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Why?

256
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
We should help you.

257
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
Don't worry.

258
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,960
I took 7 million from him.

259
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't worry about me.

260
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,560
Even if you have 7 million,

261
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,360
you don't need to share it with us.

262
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,760
And you bought so many name tags recently.

263
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,960
I bought all these for you.

264
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Because I know

265
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
if I give you cash,

266
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,960
it may be worse than the bank.

267
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
So I used some money

268
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
to buy some name tags to keep it.

269
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,960
I can sell it when I need it.

270
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,360
I don't take the money for myself.

271
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
I take it for everyone.

272
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
You risked your lives to help me.

273
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I don't know how to make up for it.

274
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
So I've planned to use this method

275
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
to make up for it.

276
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Sister, we should help you.

277
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,960
If you didn't save our lives,

278
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,960
we wouldn't be here now.

279
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,160
We would have been killed in prison.

280
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,960
Yes.

281
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
My life belongs to you.

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,560
I only helped you once.

283
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,160
You can live well now

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
because of your will and effort.

285
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,360
But you helped me a lot.

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,560
But you don't need to give us so much money.

287
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Yes.

288
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,960
You bought a house and a cafe after you fell down.

289
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
You lived the life you wanted.

290
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
You said you wanted to learn a craft.

291
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
You need money to study.

292
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,760
Don't go to that club anymore.

293
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Or I can lend you the club.

294
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
You can return it to me when you have the ability.

295
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,960
You should take the money to serve your mother.

296
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,960
You don't have much time to spend with your parents.

297
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,960
You said you wanted her to live a comfortable life.

298
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,760
I won't leave Hong Kong.

299
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,360
We will advance together.

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
Thank you.

301
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
One step is missing.

302
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
We need to catch her with evidence.

303
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,360
I didn't expect you to be like this.

304
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,360
Why can't the law punish them?

305
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,160
A'jie has worked so hard to find so much evidence.

306
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
How is she doing to find her husband?

307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,160
I know you won't give up.

308
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm more worried about Ruijiu.

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,960
If you can't talk, let me talk.

310
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,760
I'll talk to him myself.

311
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Why are you so late?

312
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Do you want to drink?

313
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
I went to the practice room.

314
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
What's wrong?

315
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm not drunk.

316
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm not drunk.

317
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,160
What's wrong?

318
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,960
Gong Yucheng suddenly got sick today.

319
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,560
He's dead.

320
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,560
I thought I could send him to the court

322
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,360
to clear your name.

323
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,560
With this result,

325
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,160
it might be his retribution.

326
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,160
It's my duty to help you to make him a criminal.

329
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
But I failed.

330
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,560
I failed to help you.

331
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,360
The chairman of the Ten-Ming Construction, Gong Yucheng,

333
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,760
died of acute heart failure last night.

334
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
He's 65 years old.

335
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,560
Gong Yucheng established the Ten-Ming Construction in 1992.

336
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,360
He's the representative of the local architecture industry.

337
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,560
Everyone, cheer up.

338
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Xiao Lin, Gong Yucheng is dead now.

339
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,960
Check if there are any unusual movements on the market.

340
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,360
I know.

341
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
Brother Qiang, help me check

342
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,760
if anything special happened during the Ten-Ming Construction.

343
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,360
Okay.

344
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Others, continue to check the goods and the places of the goods and the places of the goods.

345
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,760
We can't give up. We must find Madam Mai.

346
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,160
Yes, sir.

347
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,560
The autopsy report from Gong Yucheng has come out.

348
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
The forensic doctor said that the cause of his death was a heavy metal supermark.

349
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,560
It caused a heart failure. The cause of his death is suspicious.

350
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
It's just that he was poisoned.

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,360
Recently, many car drivers were hired to work.

352
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,560
I don't know what they're doing.

353
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,160
I don't know if they're going to be in charge of the ancestral talisman.

354
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,160
Oh, right.

355
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,360
Why did Gong Yucheng suddenly die?

356
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,160
The autopsy report?

357
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,760
A snake and a rat.

358
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,960
He's been working with the ancestral talisman for so long.

359
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,360
Why is he still sick?

360
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't worry.

361
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Sister-in-law will be lucky.

362
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,960
The most important thing now is to catch the ancestral talisman.

363
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,560
Mom! Nurse!

364
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,960
What's wrong?

365
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,960
Be careful.

366
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,760
Fortunately, it's just a severe light poison.

367
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
There's only a blister on his face.

368
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,160
Although you do look a little ugly,

369
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,760
at least you'll be able to save your life.

370
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,160
Hey, brat.

371
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,560
If you have time, come back and take care of your mom.

372
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Don't worry about my business.

373
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,760
No.

374
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I promise you that I'll definitely continue working.

375
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,160
Moreover, my mom doesn't want me to work as a delivery man.

376
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,360
She's so irresponsible.

377
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,560
But it's dangerous to help me with my work.

378
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,960
Don't worry.

379
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I didn't die even if I was caught last time.

380
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
That's called being lucky.

381
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,560
Being lucky?

382
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,760
The last time Brother Guang saved you, you were lucky.

383
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,160
Ever since I discovered that Gong Yongcheng was smuggling military goods,

384
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
I've been paying attention to the movements of the car team every day.

385
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,160
But after that day, I never saw them delivering military goods again.

386
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,560
They only delivered some very ordinary things every day.

387
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,360
On May 15th,

388
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,160
today, the car team delivered a large number of decoration tools to the dock.

389
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,560
There were electric drill, electric saw,

390
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,760
even a big machine, and a light machine.

391
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
Where exactly is this place?

392
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Why does it need so much goods?

393
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
It's very strange.

394
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
On May 19th,

395
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,160
today, I saw them carrying a batch of computers onto the ship.

396
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
I asked the ship owner.

397
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,760
All these goods were carried onto one ship.

398
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,560
What use are all the goods?

399
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,760
No one knows where they will go.

400
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,160
I found these clues in a spy diary.

401
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,560
My informant told me that there have been a lot of smuggling activities recently.

402
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,160
The entire sea is full of express ships.

403
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,960
But no one knows where these express ships are going.

404
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,360
They are carrying so much goods out and they need to be placed somewhere.

405
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Can we assume that they have already found a place to go to their base?

406
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
If that's the case,

407
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,760
Madam He might be up there.

408
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,960
Dai Zu Fu and Gong You Cheng have always been on the same side.

409
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,560
Now that Gong You Cheng is dead,

410
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,160
if there really is such a base, Dai Zu Fu will be very worried.

411
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,560
That's why, I want to catch Dai Zu Fu and bring him back.

412
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,160
I want to blow him up and see how he reacts.

413
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Police, let's go find Mr. Dai Zu Fu.

414
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,960
This way, please.

415
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,160
Have you eaten your breakfast?

416
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,760
The doctor said that breakfast is very important.

417
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,360
It can help your brain to think clearly.

418
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,960
It won't waste your time doing some boring things.

419
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,560
Mr. Dai Zu Fu, you are suspected of being involved in a murder case.

420
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,960
We need you to go back and help us investigate.

421
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,760
The forensic report shows that Gong You Cheng has chronic severe metal poisoning.

422
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,360
The cause of death is sudden heavy metal penetration.

423
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,760
Do you know about this?

424
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,560
The police received news that your group is preparing to transport a batch of goods to leave the port.

425
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
Does this include military supplies?

426
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,760
Are you done playing?

427
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I usually look for Mr. Chen.

428
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,360
Mr. He, Mr. Li, and Mr. Liang are fine.

429
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,560
Which one do you want to look for?

430
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,360
Help Mr. Dai arrange a call.

431
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
He wants to look for a lawyer.

432
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,160
I'll look for him.

433
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,560
Did you catch my wife? Where is she?

434
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,760
Can you be more mature?

435
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm asking you where my wife is.

436
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
Do you remember what you ate for breakfast this morning?

437
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,560
Breakfast?

438
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,360
What did you say?

439
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
The delivery date is nine months later.

440
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,560
Actually, you should go out and buy some baby supplies.

441
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,960
But it's not good.

442
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,160
Whether you can be born or become a father is not certain.

443
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,760
It's hard to predict.

444
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
I don't want it!

445
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
Get out!

446
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,160
Mr. Dai, you can't go out.

447
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm not going out.

448
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
Mr. Zhuang!

449
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Mr. Dai, are you hurt?

450
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,560
I need to take my client to the hospital.

451
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,760
I must sue you two!

452
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,560
An Gu Gu.

453
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,760
Gu Gu.

454
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Dai Zufu has been to the hospital to get a check up.

455
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,760
I think the news will be out in less than two hours.

456
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,960
I've already informed the public relations department

457
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,760
to release the news as soon as possible.

458
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
How?

459
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,160
Tell the reporters that we are covering for our subordinates.

460
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,480
Zhou Junjie made a mistake.

461
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,280
He can't count two hands.

462
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,560
But he is also my most capable subordinate.

463
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
Just because he is your subordinate,

464
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,080
that's why I seriously suspect your ability to lead.

465
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,760
I suggest that Zhou Junjie immediately resign.

466
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,720
After all, everyone's position is similar.

467
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,640
I think you are not qualified to suspect my ability to lead.

468
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Actually, everyone knows that this time,

469
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,320
it's because Zhou Junjie's wife is missing that it has affected her mood.

470
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
So before there is no case,

471
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,160
I think we shouldn't act recklessly.

472
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,320
This means that he doesn't know how to deal with his emotions.

473
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,920
He is even more unwilling to continue working.

474
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,640
Enough. Stop arguing.

475
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,920
Sam, I know that you are very loyal to your subordinate.

476
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,600
But the police force has its own system.

477
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,160
I think you should talk to Zhou Junjie properly.

478
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,720
Yes, sir.

479
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,520
Sorry, sir.

480
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
Give me the umbrella.

481
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,920
Godfather, are you okay?

482
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,600
Why haven't you finished it yet?

483
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,920
It's almost done. It's almost done.

484
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,320
Do you know how much time it took me to invest?

485
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
I can't be late anymore.

486
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
Sorry, Godfather.

487
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
Sorry?

488
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
Sorry?

489
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,600
Sorry is what losers say.

490
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
Anyway, I'm telling you,

491
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
do it well.

492
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,200
I will send someone over in a few days.

493
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,320
Treat him well.

494
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
I understand, Godfather.

495
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,200
Lu Yongtong, 42 years old,

496
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
Director of the Human Resources Department.

497
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,320
He joined the police force in 2004.

498
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
He worked in the Huangda County Police Department as a police officer.

499
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
He got promoted in 2015.

500
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,320
He was transferred to the Department of Criminal Intelligence as a police officer.

501
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
After he was promoted to the senior police officer,

502
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
he was transferred to the Department of Poison Investigation.

503
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,920
He got promoted again in 2002.

504
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,320
He became the director of the Human Resources Department.

505
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,720
In terms of private life,

506
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
he married a college classmate after graduation.

507
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,520
He had a daughter in 2010.

508
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,320
She is currently studying at a technical school in the UK.

509
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Because of his clean background,

510
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,920
he has a harmonious family life.

511
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,520
Plus, he has a good job,

512
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,120
so he got promoted very smoothly.

513
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,920
He is now the most capable assistant under Ouyang Jun.

514
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,320
I used to use the backdoor program

515
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,120
to enter his phone positioning system.

516
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,320
I found that his phone

517
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,920
always sends signals at the parking lot.

518
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,720
When I checked the parking lot records,

519
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
I found that his name was always there.

520
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,920
So, he is the chief's possibility.

521
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Actually, based on his current position,

522
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
he is the chief's potential.

523
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
From his diary,

524
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,720
he is definitely capable of

525
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,520
accessing confidential information.

526
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,720
Plus, he is the management of the police.

527
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
He has been trained for many years.

528
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
He is capable of managing,

529
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,320
organizing, and being careful.

530
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,720
He definitely can do it.

531
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,920
But the chief hasn't been online for the past few days.

532
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,120
He might have felt something wrong.

533
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
How can we find his evidence

534
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,520
without disturbing the police?

535
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,720
To prove that he is the head of the mole?

536
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,520
I checked the activity information in the public meeting.

537
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,720
It basically corresponds to the case that happened.

538
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,920
But there are also a bunch of mess.

539
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,720
I asked Lin Kun what it means.

540
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,520
He said that he is the representative of the case code

541
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,720
CSWDIV 2264-780-432.

542
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
It should be the case of the Changsha Bay Police Station

543
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,720
in 2012.

544
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,320
Check the criminal's parents.

545
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,920
See if it has anything to do with Dai Zuofu

546
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,520
or their business partners.

547
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
It's not the first time that the chief

548
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,920
helped a rich kid to solve the case.

549
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,120
According to this investigation,

550
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,320
there might be a discovery.

551
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,520
Yes, sir.

552
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,520
It's so serious.

553
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,720
I wonder if Joseph will be okay.

554
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
He will.

555
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
It depends on whether

556
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
he can be saved or not.

557
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Hello?

558
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Hello, brother.

559
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,120
Come and take Joseph away.

560
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,520
He's bothering us.

561
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,520
I'll be there now.

562
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,720
I'm not eating. Thank you.

563
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,520
I don't want you to faint in my office.

564
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Eat.

565
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Okay.

566
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
Thank you anyway.

567
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
I don't know how to comfort you.

568
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,320
But you're wasting your time here.

569
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
If you find anything,

570
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,920
my colleagues will notify you.

571
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Anyway, I won't bother you.

572
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,520
After eating, you can leave.

573
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,920
Everyone is in the same age.

574
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,520
We are all the same age.

575
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,320
I don't want to be a burden to you.

576
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,920
I don't want to be a burden to you.

577
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,520
I don't want to be a burden to you.

578
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,720
I remember, I couldn't come to ask you.

579
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,520
Don't do this.

580
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm going to call you big brother.

581
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
You're on the hiatus now.

582
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,720
If you know

583
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm watching the B-list TV,

584
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,520
you and I will be complained

585
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,320
of a bad warning letter.

586
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Joseph.

587
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Brother.

588
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,720
Hello.

589
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,920
Help me look.

590
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Joseph.

591
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,320
Don't embarrass him.

592
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
Go home and wait.

593
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,720
If you don't help me, don't interrupt me.

594
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,060
Is this the feeling I started to feel in romantic life before?

595
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,020
Or isn't it what I'm feeling now?

596
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,920
Why is it so again?

597
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,760
or how is it now?

598
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,520
unavailable

599
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Or am I living with a girl again?

600
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,520
No gauntlet

601
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,920
He moves you seriously

602
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Where did you go?

603
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,480
I don't know.

604
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,360
I don't know.

605
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll kill you.

606
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
Compared to the case of the businessman in Nanxue,

607
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,320
it happened to be my 22-year-old mansion.

608
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
The chief asked me to change my statement

609
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,320
and take away the evidence.

610
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,960
Why did he do that?

611
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,080
I don't know.

612
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
He never tells the reason.

613
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,880
The case of the businessman in Nanxue

614
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,760
The Chief of the Department of Investigation

615
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,720
The Chief of the Department of Investigation

616
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
The Chief of the Department of Investigation

617
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,160
Lu Yongtong's family relationship is close.

618
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,520
His life is very regular.

619
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
I haven't found it yet.

620
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,320
I asked the law firm to check his background.

621
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,160
His father is a very ordinary worker.

622
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
He is a criminal and often hurts people

623
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,200
before he reaches 18 years old.

624
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,720
But the strange thing is,

625
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,360
he is always in the police.

626
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,440
This February,

627
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
two months ago,

628
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,320
he committed another case of the businessman.

629
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,760
The victim was badly injured and fainted.

630
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,760
But he is still in the police.

631
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,520
A boy without a background

632
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,320
can go to court every time.

633
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,480
There must be something wrong.

634
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,920
I checked the case of the police.

635
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,840
It's different police.

636
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,480
Only Lu Yongtong is missing.

637
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,560
Lu Yongtong is so careful.

638
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,960
How could he do it himself?

639
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,600
It seems that Lu Yongtong

640
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,880
likes to use his power

641
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,840
to help this boy

642
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,920
to solve these cases.

643
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,600
He almost didn't get sued.

644
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,040
This boy may be his weakness.

645
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,760
Why don't you try to put him in the case?

646
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,120
This is strange.

647
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,240
He shouldn't be always in the police.

648
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,280
Plus, he committed another crime.

649
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,160
It's impossible not to sue him.

650
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,680
And the victim's family complained to the police.

651
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,640
No one followed up.

652
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
What else can the law enforcement do?

653
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,080
The police

654
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,160
will decide it by themselves.

655
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,160
The law enforcement has no right to interfere.

656
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,520
But I can transfer the case

657
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
and see what can be done.

658
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,320
Hopefully,

659
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,600
there must be a way to stop them.

660
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
Even if the case is closed,

661
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,600
we can sue him again.

662
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,240
If it doesn't work,

663
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,000
we can apply for judicial review.

664
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,280
The court will review it again

665
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,760
to see if there was anything wrong with the judgment.

666
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,320
You mean to use public opinion?

667
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,600
But it's not completely safe.

668
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,360
We will be said to be punished repeatedly.

669
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
If we go to court,

670
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,680
there will be many disputes.

671
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I suspect that boy

672
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,280
is related to the police organization.

673
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,760
I want to use him

674
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,280
to get a big fish out.

675
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
Then I can try

676
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360
to ask the police

677
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,520
to see what their reaction is.

678
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,320
But

679
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,680
it may also

680
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,000
alert their accomplices.

681
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,800
It may be more difficult to investigate.

682
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,200
Then we need to find someone we can trust.

683
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,120
It's a pity that

684
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,400
Ah Jie is like this now.

685
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,200
I remember Ah Jie said

686
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
that the person he trusts the most is Mr. Lei.

687
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,720
Let me see what I can say.

688
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,520
Don't worry.

689
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,760
I won't mention you.

690
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,600
Okay.

691
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,080
There are some problems

692
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,200
with this police investigation case.

693
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,440
The boy

694
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,240
is different from the person he has been working with.

695
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,320
In other words,

696
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,080
the police and police

697
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,200
are not effective for him.

698
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,200
If we give this case

699
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
to the law and justice department,

700
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
we will definitely file a lawsuit.

701
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,640
So I want to hear your opinion.

702
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,960
We are really sorry

703
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,360
to bother you with the police and police investigation case.

704
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,720
Or I will follow up on it myself.

705
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
But since this case

706
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,440
has been handled,

707
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,360
it's hard for us to call those parents

708
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,440
to make a decision.

709
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,400
Or is there any proposal

710
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,440
from the law and justice department?

711
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
We can

712
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,200
re-invite him in the process.

713
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,720
But I want to know more about it

714
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,600
and then consider it.

715
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
Then I will be in charge of the team of this case.

716
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,640
I will find the information

717
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,520
of this case for you.

718
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,520
You can directly find him

719
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,600
and pass it to me.

720
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,040
But I'm curious.

721
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,640
Let me ask you.

722
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,520
Why did Liu Zhanyuan

723
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
get involved in this case?

724
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,440
I don't remember.

725
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
It seems that a colleague

726
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
heard it from the I.O.

727
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,120
But I really don't remember it clearly.

728
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,600
It doesn't matter.

729
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I just ask.

730
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,360
But Liu Zhanyuan,

731
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,240
your work attitude now

732
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,600
is really worth learning from us.

733
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,880
Thank you.

734
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,920
Dad.

735
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,240
Mom.

736
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,520
Long time no see.

737
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
It's been so many years

738
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
since ISlậpd cake for you.

739
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,360
Sorry.

740
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Mom.

741
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
Last year,

742
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,040
Ruiralmen and Timothy

743
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,640
handled your funeral.

744
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,440
We

745
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,440
I've never been responsible for being a daughter.

746
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,440
I want you to see Raymond,

747
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
but I don't want you to see me.

748
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
I didn't apply for a funeral.

749
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Because I killed my mother.

750
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
She would rather not take her own life,

751
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,440
and use her own life to exchange for my innocence.

752
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
But it still failed.

753
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
I sacrificed for nothing.

754
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
I'm sorry.

755
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
It doesn't matter.

756
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
I'm too ashamed to see him.

757
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
I think in his mind,

758
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,440
he thinks I'm useless.

759
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Actually, you're already very good.

760
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Uncle left early.

761
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
You know your mother is hard.

762
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
You're very sensible.

763
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
You studied hard when you were a kid.

764
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
You came out to the society, found a job, and made money.

765
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,440
You took your aunt out to play, and bought things for her.

766
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
You love her so much.

767
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
She must feel it.

768
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,440
I can finally see her today.

769
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,440
I'm trying hard to live the life I want.

771
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Don't worry about me.

772
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
By the way, where are you going?

773
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I'll send you there.

774
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Because I have to go back to the office.

775
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
No need.

776
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,440
I called the bus and made an appointment with the landlord.

777
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
What landlord?

778
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm moving out.

779
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Thank you for helping me before.

780
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Move out?

781
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Did I do something that made you uncomfortable?

782
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I just think everything is over.

783
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
My life is back to normal.

784
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I don't want to bother you.

785
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
What about us?

786
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
We're good friends.

787
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
We'll meet again.

788
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Keep in touch.

789
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Aren't you busy, Mr. Dai?

790
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Why are you here?

791
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
What's up?

792
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
I'm looking for your subordinate, Zhou Junjie.

793
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
He's on leave.

794
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
He's not here.

795
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
That's good.

796
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
He's not a good cop.

797
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Hey, you.

798
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Have you received the news?

799
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Let me know if you have.

800
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Ladies and gentlemen.

801
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Welcome to the Black Zone.

802
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Let's see how long he can fight.

803
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
He's prepared.

804
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It's not easy to fight him.

805
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
He's not a good cop.

806
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
He's a good cop.

807
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
He's prepared.

808
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
It's not easy to fight him.

809
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Honey.

810
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Honey.

811
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Honey, help me.

812
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Help me.

813
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Should we let him see his wife?

814
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Of course.

815
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
He likes to see his wife so much.

816
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Let's give him a surprise.

817
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm sorry.

818
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
