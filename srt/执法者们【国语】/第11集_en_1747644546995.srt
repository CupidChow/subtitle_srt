1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
What is a brick?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,000
We suspect that it's most likely to represent the police's name, Brick.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,520
It just so happens that Wang Zhen Xiong was in the PTU in 1994.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,160
So we suspect that the brick they're looking for is the same team member of Wang Zhen Xiong.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,120
There are so many cases about guns within a day.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm sure they'll still be there.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Si Er, I suggest we tell the special forces to use emergency measures to open up the surveillance authority.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,600
If there are gunfights every day, Hong Kong will be completely out of control.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,400
What if passports discover the data?

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
At the moment, we should immediately report to the person-to- Gerent.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
We can put the neuralончaving tree aside and start the investigation.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,080
Whoever denies their involvement in this case needs to pay the price.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,580
Excluding the other assets of Wang Zhen Xiong,

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,580
it would also be bad If I didn't have the 20 key evidence.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,280
Leng Sheng Si made a nonначала sir to serve as the underground forces carving experts.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,300
Mr. Duo,

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,100
Who is the one?

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,900
Who can take me away?

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,700
Who is at the far end of the world?

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,100
Who can fight with me for the world?

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,500
Oh, is there anyone?

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,300
Who can guard me?

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,100
I don't need too many reasons

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,500
Lighting up the fireworks in the dark

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
I'm not afraid of anything

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I smile if you're always by my side

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Until the end

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,100
Episode 2

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,300
Episode 3

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Zhou, I'll give you a delivery.

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Don't you need to pick up Madam?

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
I asked her to come home and I'll accompany you.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,700
You're so generous.

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
No need. Go back and accompany Madam.

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,500
I said I'll accompany you. Why are you so nagging?

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,700
Now the entire district knows that you're saving your wife.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,100
What's this?

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,300
Everyone knows that I'm a cheater.

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,700
If you say it like that, I'll be very sad.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,300
You're not sad, you're a heartbreaker.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
Zhang Jianbo.

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,900
Sir, the interview will start now.

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,300
This is your fifth time to be on the air.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,700
What's the difference from before?

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,100
In the past year, I realized my shortcomings.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,300
I was too obsessed with my education.

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,300
I already felt inferior and lack confidence because of my blood and blood.

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,100
But I understand. Being a police officer is not about your education.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
It's about the heart of being a police officer.

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Then if you become a police officer and an O.C.

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,500
What will your subordinate do if he makes a mistake?

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
We are a discipline force.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,700
We're talking about team spirit.

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,500
We won't give up because the members made a mistake.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,100
But we have to see where he made a mistake.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,300
If there's a violation or criminal act,

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I will persuade him to turn himself in.

58
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,900
If he doesn't listen, I will report him.

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Because I want to be responsible for the whole team.

60
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,700
Very good.

61
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
It's really quite good.

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
There's no problem this time.

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,700
Let's eat lunch together today.

64
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,300
If you succeed, treat me to steak.

65
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,700
Thank you, sir.

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,300
Thank you, sir.

67
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Cook up some juice.

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,700
I'm hating that you have one more plate.

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,300
Perfect.

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,980
Does he know such a good fire?

71
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,880
You sang it very well.

72
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,340
Just now that you were on your significant other dear,

73
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,300
you almost fainted in front of the light of the lamp.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,960
We're so trying to be careful and actually be careful.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,420
1, 2

76
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Is it hard?

77
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,420
As long as I can dance, I can do it no matter how hard it is.

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
Don't be nervous.

79
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
I can do it.

80
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Don't worry, I'm confident.

81
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Take care of me when you get a job.

82
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
You're pretty handsome.

83
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Mr. Zhou.

84
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Sir.

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
Old Bao, come to my office.

86
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Clean it up.

88
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Okay.

89
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,420
Old Bao.

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
Ancestral Palace

91
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Zhou San.

92
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,420
It's said that you've been so famous here.

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
Can I see it?

94
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Say it.

95
00:05:50,420 --> 00:06:16,060
бы

96
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,020
Why is it so heavy?

97
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,700
Haven't you found out?

98
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Come on, pack up and come with me.

99
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,100
How could it be not working?

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,580
I've read all the reports.

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,180
All of them are of the first class.

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,580
It's not the first time.

103
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,220
Do you want me to be promoted

104
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,940
after they retire?

105
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,460
The next-door team,

106
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,580
Buring and A Jian,

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,860
are the ones who play the piano in the room.

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,980
They are promoted.

109
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm worse than them.

110
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,060
You're not bad.

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,180
You did well.

112
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,140
But you were unlucky.

113
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,140
They are comfortable.

114
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,580
We deserve it.

115
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,540
Fair enough.

116
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,740
I'll let you play the piano.

117
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,460
Are you willing to do it?

118
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,980
I've checked the information

119
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,780
of the land registration office.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,940
The warehouse

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,220
of ICIC He Jiaming

122
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,300
is owned by a listed company,

123
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,340
Shi Ming Construction.

124
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,700
This warehouse

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,220
is used to store building materials.

126
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,060
Who is Shi Ming Construction's boss?

127
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,260
Gong Youcheng.

128
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,260
Gong Youcheng again?

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,860
He was involved in the case

130
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,380
of Long Weizhou last time.

131
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,140
It's not a coincidence.

132
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,420
Gong Youcheng was in the field

133
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,540
on the day of the crime.

134
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,300
So he has evidence that he wasn't there.

135
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,700
A man like him

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,060
won't kill people by himself.

137
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,620
Did you get any footage from nearby?

138
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,220
I've checked it.

139
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,340
There's no footage nearby.

140
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,620
The Military and Military Affairs Department

141
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,260
has replied to us.

142
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,460
That gun

143
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,580
should be used by foreign troops

144
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,540
to destroy the gun.

145
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,060
But it was sold abroad

146
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
to do military business.

147
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,460
The firepower

148
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,580
is at the military level.

149
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,020
When I was investigating,

150
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,060
I found something.

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,660
My informant told me

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,260
that Gong Youcheng has a nephew

153
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,540
named Ou Mingwei.

154
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,980
He's 34 years old.

155
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,740
He's been in charge of building materials,

156
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,260
warehouse and transport

157
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
since he came back from abroad.

158
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,460
He's been busy

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,060
with managing the company recently.

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,820
He's very familiar with

161
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,860
the transport company in the Philippines.

162
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,660
Long Weizhou was involved in the case of

163
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,740
the warehouse murder

164
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,020
last time.

165
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,020
I'm afraid

166
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,700
we'll have to meet

167
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,660
Gong Youcheng again.

168
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

169
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,500
They...

170
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,540
Mr. Gong, we meet again.

171
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,340
It's really fated.

172
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,900
Is it a good fortune or bad fortune?

173
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,820
Is your kidney okay?

174
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,540
It's fine. I'm much better.

175
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,060
Then take a good rest.

176
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,420
There are so many employees.

177
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,620
I'm here today

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,540
because of a murder case.

179
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,140
I'd like to ask you for help.

180
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,700
Hazard, I'd like to have a lawyer.

181
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,740
No problem.

182
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm willing to cooperate with the police.

183
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,100
This May,

184
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,460
in the Quanwan District,

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,140
in a waste warehouse,

186
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,900
a ICAC investigator was shot to death.

187
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,260
We've checked it.

188
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,020
This warehouse belongs to

189
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,260
Mr. Gong's Ten Construction Company.

190
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
We're in the construction business.

191
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,340
There are more than 100 warehouses in the Hong Kong and China New World.

192
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,780
I think these are

193
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,860
more clear to my colleagues.

194
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,380
Then your colleague

195
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,700
is your nephew, Dennis?

196
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,140
We found that

197
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
he was in charge of transportation

198
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,140
and managing the warehouse.

199
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,300
He hasn't been to work for days.

200
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
I haven't seen him.

201
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,460
Mr. Gong,

202
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,980
we found an egg shell in the warehouse.

203
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,900
We found an egg head on the victim's body.

204
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,860
It's related to the military fire investigation we're investigating.

205
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,020
We're worried that we'll implicate Mr. Gong.

206
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,100
Will the people who were involved in the military fire

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,860
find a place to hide the gun?

208
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
It happens to be in your warehouse.

209
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,580
The biggest problem now is

210
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,420
that an ICAC investigator

211
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,220
died inside.

212
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,980
Who is he following?

213
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,780
Is the gun for business?

214
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,620
As a good citizen,

215
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,740
I don't know what kind of gun you're talking about.

216
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,820
But if I really see it,

217
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,780
I know it.

218
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,340
I'll notify the police as soon as possible.

219
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,220
The number of cases of the missing population investigation team

220
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
in China's missing population investigation team

221
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,100
is only 50%

222
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,620
and lower than all the teams.

223
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,460
The average number of other people is 80%.

224
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,940
When did he join

225
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,300
the missing population investigation team?

226
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,580
2017.

227
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,860
2017?

228
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,500
Isn't that the year

229
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,940
when the Flying Fish Entertainment was established?

230
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,500
Check the list of the Flying Fish Academy.

231
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,260
How many people are missing?

232
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
The case was handled by Zhong Boxiang.

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,540
Later, it became a mystery case.

234
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,740
It's still hard to find.

235
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,060
Wang Siqing, a business criminal investigator,

236
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,620
once investigated the corruption case of Dai Zufu.

237
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
He was responsible for many of the evidence.

238
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,860
Dai Zufu again.

239
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,540
Are there any other cases?

240
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,340
Yes.

241
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,140
The West Sea Building's vandalism case in 2009.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,940
The Ten-Million Construction Short-Grade Corruption Case in 2015.

243
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,340
And the Super Vacation Blast Case in 2017.

244
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Lin Kun was once sued

245
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,740
for taking advantage of the case.

246
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,500
But the accused refused to make statements.

247
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,940
So the case was closed.

248
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,380
In the past, someone said

249
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
he was familiar with the black community.

250
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,100
But he checked and there was no evidence.

251
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,700
In 2011,

252
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,740
he participated in the 23-ton bomb case.

253
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,340
And the 2007 police

254
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,060
shooting case.

255
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,780
He also participated in it.

256
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,700
Let's summarize.

257
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,220
These three police

258
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,180
have some common points.

259
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,940
First, the rate of breaking the case is low.

260
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,500
Second, many of the cases they are responsible for

261
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
are related to Dai Zufu.

262
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,660
Third,

263
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,660
they have many black cases.

264
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,020
And last,

265
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,220
they are all

266
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,900
in the same team as Wang Zhenxiong.

267
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,140
All kinds of evidence show

268
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,340
that there are group-like detectives in the police.

269
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
They even infiltrate different departments

270
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,540
to cooperate with each other.

271
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
This is a very serious accusation.

272
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,020
The police made systematic mistakes

273
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,020
and led to group-like detectives.

274
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,100
From the background of these three police officers

275
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,460
and the way they handled the case,

276
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
there is indeed a suspicion.

277
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Even it's related to Dai Zufu.

278
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,420
I found a game

279
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,620
called Deception of the World

280
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,740
in Wang Zhenxiong's phone.

281
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,940
I believe they

282
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,380
communicated through this game.

283
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,420
But I haven't figured out

284
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,380
how they did it.

285
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,500
Sir,

286
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,820
I want to apply for a large-scale surveillance

287
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,700
to conduct a search.

288
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,780
What do you think?

289
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,620
I think it's necessary.

290
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,540
If we go to catch them one by one,

291
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,660
we may never

292
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,860
find the behind-the-scenes black hands.

293
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,940
Now in front of us

294
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,380
is a good chance

295
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,980
to make a move.

296
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,340
We have to try.

297
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,940
I think

298
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,900
we have to try.

299
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,940
I understand.

300
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,180
This is a serious accusation.

301
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,660
I need to report to the executive officer.

302
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,580
After the last executive meeting,

303
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,020
I don't know if there will be any hindrance

304
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,460
in the government.

305
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,980
But once there is a result,

306
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,940
I will inform you.

307
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,220
Anyway,

308
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,940
well done.

309
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,980
Very good job.

310
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,580
Hello.

311
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,980
What's up?

312
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,500
Zhou Junjie is here.

313
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,940
He reported that someone was corrupt.

314
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,780
Red wine

315
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
is the best for you.

316
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
But the ones outside

317
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,220
are not as good as vinegar.

318
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,340
Sometimes I'm really jealous of you.

319
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,940
Almost all the good wine

320
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,540
is in your wine cabinet.

321
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,860
You can still

322
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,700
take time to enjoy your life

323
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,060
in the day.

324
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,920
It is your wife

325
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,900
who always

326
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,140
has the best time with you.

327
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,660
The day before yesterday,

328
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,980
our relationship

329
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,560
was surely

330
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,380
just like yesterday.

331
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,960
You must learn more

332
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,540
to know the difference.

333
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,000
I have a whole lot of joy

334
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,380
in the China side,

335
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,100
but

336
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,260
required by your wife

337
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,060
I don't know who it is yet.

338
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,740
But this case is related to the death of He Jiaming, the chief investigator of ICC.

339
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,900
It was because of Jing Yuan's negligence that He Jiaming was shot to death.

340
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,660
So the person who investigated these two cases is related.

341
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,660
I believe that if one of us finds the target,

342
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,660
it will be of great help to solve the case.

343
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,260
What did you find?

344
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,660
I've already locked the perpetrator.

345
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,460
But I don't know why the ICC colleagues went to the crime scene.

346
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Was it to follow the lead of the crime?

347
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,660
Or the police's mole?

348
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,060
Tell me.

349
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,860
I only said it once. If you understand it, you'll have a chance.

350
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,860
If you don't understand it, then dig a hole.

351
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,860
How many people are there in your family?

352
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,460
Dig a little bigger and count your whole family.

353
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,660
Look. These are the differences between me and you.

354
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,260
I grew up in the construction site with red wool, hot water, and gas bricks.

355
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,460
It's different from you rich people.

356
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,860
You know how to eat, drink, and enjoy.

357
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,260
I was born in the lower class and was a monk halfway through.

358
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,860
Actually, you've taken care of the women in the entire house.

359
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,060
Why must you be so concerned about your nephew?

360
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Joseph, you can't provide the police's number and name.

361
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,460
It's hard for us to investigate.

362
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,860
If you know which police is the criminal

363
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,660
or if I find out which department, I'll notify you.

364
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,060
Welcome Joseph to come and provide us with clues next time.

365
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,660
Thank you.

366
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,860
I've already found Dennis. He will give you an explanation.

367
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,860
He not only ate my goods, but also your goods.

368
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
You have to take care of those goods.

369
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Of course. Everyone is on the same boat.

370
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,460
You think he should be taught how to help.

371
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,260
What is wrong and what is right.

372
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,860
I only said it once.

373
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,060
Only smart people have good luck.

374
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Only with good luck, you will have a chance.

375
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,660
Don't worry.

376
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,060
If this matter is handled badly,

377
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,860
my nephew will not be able to handle it.

378
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,260
Received the news. Lin Kun is hiding in a building in the deep water department.

379
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,860
He is a very dangerous person.

380
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,660
Everyone must remain calm and not act alone. Let's go.

381
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,260
I'm going to run away. Give me a few million first.

382
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,660
Please. I didn't run away. What are you afraid of?

383
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,460
ICAC is watching me now.

384
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,660
They think I'm a murderer. I was killed by you.

385
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Look at how much trouble you've caused.

386
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,460
There are guns all over the street. You killed so many people.

387
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Can you get back the Long Weizhou's goods?

388
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,860
I'll give you more money.

389
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,860
You're not. You still want to get back those goods?

390
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,660
You sold so many guns.

391
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,860
You haven't been caught yet.

392
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,060
You haven't been caught yet. It's totally my fault.

393
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,660
It seems like you're the only one helping me.

394
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,060
I can help you clean up your internal organs.

395
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,460
Gao Si'er, there's a situation.

396
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,260
Wait. Don't act alone.

397
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,660
I saw Lin Kun and another person.

398
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,860
But I can't hear what he said.

399
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,060
I'll go in and listen.

400
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,060
A'Pi, wait for the car to arrive.

401
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,660
Calm down.

402
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm looking for a buyer.

403
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,260
I plan to sell that gun like a set.

404
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,460
You have to cover for me.

405
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
Don't tell anyone that someone is selling guns.

406
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,460
You'll benefit from it.

407
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,060
Hey, you crazy bastard.

408
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,860
Do you know how much this bank transfer is gifted by us?

409
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,260
This is not a gate.

410
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,460
Then do you still want to doubt me?

411
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,660
Then you'll find someone to find out.

412
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,860
Which one of us told you to use the dog Mysterious Er sedan?

413
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,660
The one in the front is a dark horse.

414
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
It seems that someone is listening to you.

415
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Help me get in here.

416
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,260
I'll find a place to hide from you.

417
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Call me if you have time.

418
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
If I get caught,

419
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
I will definitely get you out.

420
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Hey, hey,

421
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
figure out who is the big and small king now.

422
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,260
Don't forget,

423
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
what's in our hands?

424
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
I see.

425
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,260
Have you seen him?

426
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,260
Room 9.

427
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,260
We are on the same boat.

428
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

429
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Hey, hey,

430
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
figure out who is the big and small king now.

431
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Don't forget,

432
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
what's in our hands?

433
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Room 9.

434
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
We are on the same boat.

435
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

436
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

437
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

438
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

439
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

440
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

441
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

442
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

443
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

444
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

445
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,460
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

446
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

447
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

448
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
You and your colleague are on the same boat.

449
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
OK.

450
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Then let's have a drink.

451
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Want to drink,

452
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
wait?

453
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Your'e drunk.

454
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
Are you carrots or corpse?

455
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Are you carrots or corpse?

456
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,660
Hey he's over there.

457
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Hey,

458
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
It's not just drinking, right?

459
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm really sorry for you.

460
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,420
I was taught by Dennis.

461
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,860
I made this mistake.

462
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,020
It's my fault.

463
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,140
I promise I will...

464
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,860
Uncle.

465
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,780
You should know that

466
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
my godfather is the one who is always in charge.

467
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,500
It's no use for you to tell me this.

468
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,220
Dennis is not like you.

469
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,980
He is not as capable as you.

470
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,500
So I've been watching him since I was a kid.

471
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,500
Xiaoyao.

472
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
I've always watched you grow up.

473
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,740
I know that you and Dennis

474
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
often play together for a while.

475
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,500
In this situation,

476
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,740
do you really want to watch him die?

477
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,700
But godfather doesn't think so.

478
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,900
I have no choice.

479
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,260
You have a choice.

480
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,420
You are different from your godfather.

481
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,020
You have your own opinion.

482
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,820
With your character and identity,

483
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,020
if you are willing to help,

484
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
you will definitely help us.

485
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,700
Xiaoyao.

486
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,940
You asked him to find me.

487
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,380
I'll think of a way.

488
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,940
Thank you.

489
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,700
Thank you.

490
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,900
The police station is my home.

491
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,020
You are my friend.

492
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,060
A-Se.

493
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,380
I'm the one you've been looking for for a long time.

494
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,660
Dennis Wu Mingwei.

495
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,380
I'm here to surrender.

496
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,220
What do you mean?

497
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,500
A-Se.

498
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,780
Are you deaf?

499
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,060
I'm here to surrender.

500
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,340
I'm here to arrest you.

501
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,260
You've been looking for me for a long time.

502
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,940
I brought the hostage.

503
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,460
Zirui, where is the hostage?

504
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,100
Hello, ladies.

505
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,620
I'm Cecilia Xiong.

506
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,180
You've probably seen me on TV.

507
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,220
Didn't I say

508
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,020
Cecilia and I

509
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,780
stayed in the hotel for seven days and nights?

510
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,460
We even ate in the room.

511
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,580
We didn't go out.

512
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,700
I really have no idea

513
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,060
what happened in the warehouse.

514
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,620
What evidence can prove

515
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,300
that you were in the hotel that day?

516
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,420
I brought the hostage.

517
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,620
You are asking about Cecilia?

518
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,900
And

519
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,420
Cecilia is a top model

520
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,380
and a big star.

521
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,300
She often appears on TV.

522
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,580
She won't tell lies.

523
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,420
I'm talking about evidence, not witnesses.

524
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,940
A-Se.

525
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,980
You found the hotel

526
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,260
to get the surveillance video?

527
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,220
And

528
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,020
the evidence

529
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,620
should be found by the police.

530
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,980
I didn't provide it to you.

531
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,620
Madam,

532
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,180
I need to talk to you.

533
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,500
Ouyang Sir sent me here.

534
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,340
I'll be responsible for the confession.

535
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,980
We've already

536
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,660
recorded half of the confession.

537
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,260
This is Ouyang Sir's order.

538
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,460
You can ask him if you have any questions.

539
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,540
This case

540
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,740
is about the police.

541
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,180
It's not a common case

542
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,380
in your case.

543
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,740
Madam,

544
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,420
you just came in

545
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
and changed your name.

546
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,980
It's hard for us to investigate this case.

547
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,900
This is your case.

548
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,340
If you have any questions,

549
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,700
you can ask your superior.

550
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,540
We don't need to

551
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,580
answer you.

552
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,700
Zhou Sir.

553
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,220
Forget it.

554
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,540
You are a person who is in charge of the air conditioning.

555
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,300
You won't understand the difficulties we have.

556
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,740
You only use power to suppress people.

557
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,700
A person who is in charge of the air conditioning.

558
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
A person who is in charge of the air conditioning.

559
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
He is a person who is in charge of the air conditioning.

560
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,540
He is a person who is in charge of the air conditioning.

561
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,460
Please take good care of your subordinate.

562
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,340
I'm sorry, madam.

563
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,700
My subordinate

564
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,980
is expressing his opinion to me,

565
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
not to object to you.

566
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,940
Thank you.

567
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,820
I'll leave this to you.

568
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,420
She's so beautiful.

569
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,780
She's so elegant.

570
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,260
I'm so scared.

571
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,100
Cecilia is waiting for me.

572
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,660
C- working time.

573
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
So I don't have to wait here.

574
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
Let's get out of here!

575
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,140
This place...

576
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,620
should be abandoned.

577
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,820
We haven't worth anything.

578
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,420
Save this wretch!

579
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,580
Hmm...

580
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,700
Hmmm...

581
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,660
What's that uhm...

582
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
You've been watching Gong You Cheng and Dennis.

583
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
It's meaningless.

584
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Every crime case is equally important to us police.

585
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Dennis and Gong You Cheng must have something to do with Long Wei Zhou's military fire case.

586
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,660
The gun that killed ICAC

587
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,660
could also be the same as that batch of military fire.

588
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Also, Dennis' background is not simple.

589
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
I definitely have a reason to suspect him.

590
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,660
There are too many things involved in this case.

591
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,660
I just don't want your crime team to continue to investigate the case.

592
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,660
You know that you always do bad things.

593
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Yes, Madam. I do do bad things.

594
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,660
But it definitely won't affect the ability of our crime team to investigate the case.

595
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Then, A'Wen does have his own opinion.

596
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,660
We really can't just focus on one person and ignore other investigation directions.

597
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Zhou Si Er is our front-line elite.

598
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
He has his own experience.

599
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,660
We also believe that we have our own professional judgment.

600
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Although we are the one who is in charge of the criminal justice,

601
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,660
you can't underestimate our ability.

602
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Ouyang Si Er, don't misunderstand.

603
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,660
I definitely dare not underestimate your ability.

604
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,660
But the Chief of Staff is very important in these cases.

605
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
How about this?

606
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Since we have debated so many times and discussed so many times,

607
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,660
since everyone has such ideas,

608
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
why don't we investigate together?

609
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
It's for the overall situation.

610
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Okay.

611
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Then, let's investigate each department with all our heart.

612
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
But remember,

613
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,660
the most important thing is to communicate with each other.

614
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
No problem.

615
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Where?

616
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Here!

617
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Come here!

618
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
Wait a minute.

619
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
You're so miserable!

620
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
Come and catch me!

621
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
You!

622
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
Why is there no sound?

623
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Where are you?

624
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
You...

625
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
No need to be like this.

626
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Isn't this your idea?

627
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
You want me to call these women to come to the hotel to have a big fight and practice?

628
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,660
Then I'll really call them up here to have a little fun.

629
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Mr. Dai is already very angry.

630
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,660
I beg you to be more sensible. Don't cause trouble anymore.

631
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Otherwise, I can't even protect you.

632
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
What if you say so?

633
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,660
Take out all your goods.

634
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
As for those that have been sold,

635
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
you have to spit them out and return them to Mr. Dai.

636
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
How can I spit them out if I sell them?

637
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Then give me a new batch of goods.

638
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
New goods?

639
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
The wind is so strong outside. Do you want me to die?

640
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
Do you want to be caught by the police

641
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,660
or die in Mr. Dai's hands?

642
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Otherwise, I'll kill you with one shot now.

643
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,660
I'll explain to your mother after I die.

644
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,660
Sister Xin, I'm coughing. I'll take care of it.

645
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,660
Okay.

646
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
How?

647
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Do you have new clues?

648
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,660
I've checked everything regarding the port, but couldn't find Li Kun.

649
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,660
We will also continue to monitor Wang Si Qing and Zhong Guo Xiang.

650
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,660
It's just that they are all working from connection, no big deal.

651
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,660
Have you verified it or not?

652
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
There aren't any new clues yet.

653
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,220
But they are just working and getting off work. Nothing special.

654
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,180
Have you checked their PTO boss?

655
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,460
I did. He was good after retirement.

656
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,340
Very normal.

657
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,260
Could it be that someone more senior is controlling them?

658
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,140
Gao Sir, I finally found out.

659
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,020
So China wanted to buy a house under the temple but didn't report it.

660
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,780
Also, Wang Si Qin opened a private account but didn't report it.

661
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,660
Wada, even if we can't use the emergency method,

662
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,060
we can't say we don't have enough evidence.

663
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,860
I'll go to the precinct later.

664
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,060
Another intern from the high-ranking senior.

665
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,660
It seems to be the same batch.

666
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,860
This batch of guns are getting more and more.

667
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,660
This is the eighth case of gunfire this month.

668
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,260
Is this batch of guns from the same batch?

669
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,060
Where is the source?

670
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,260
The police are not yet sure of the answer.

671
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,860
A member of the Legislative Council strongly condemned the police for not doing their job well.

672
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,260
These people are threatening the world.

673
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,460
They deliberately challenged the police.

674
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,260
So we have to find evidence as soon as possible to sue Dennis.

675
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
So many guns are left on the market now.

676
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,860
They will be used sooner or later.

677
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,060
Also, the hotel's video must be fake.

678
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,260
But now, Madelieu is using the video to check.

679
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,460
We can't do anything. We have to stop them.

680
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,260
Why are they always so many obstacles?

681
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,660
Have you ever thought about looking for the video of the hotel for other days?

682
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,060
They can do something in one video.

683
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,660
Not every video has it.

684
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,260
Try looking for the video of other days.

685
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,660
See if you can find any clues.

686
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,660
Now you have two things to solve as soon as possible.

687
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,060
First, find Dennis' criminal evidence as soon as possible.

688
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Second, find that batch of gunfire.

689
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,660
If you need any help, just tell me.

690
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,460
Yes, sir.

691
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,660
Also, there are many small actions in the Guoyang District.

692
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Don't let them stop you.

693
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,860
Anyway, I will guarantee you.

694
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,060
You can go and investigate.

695
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,460
Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir.

696
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,460
You're here again. How much did you spend this time?

697
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,660
Take it.

698
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,460
So expensive.

699
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,260
Take it.

700
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,460
You have a share in this. You deserve it.

701
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,860
I really don't deserve such an expensive bracelet.

702
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,460
It doesn't look like a crown even if I wear it.

703
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
How could it be?

704
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,460
You have to dress better and eat better after you get out of prison.

705
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Don't be lazy.

706
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,060
We have suffered a lot.

707
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,260
Thank you.

708
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,060
You're welcome.

709
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,260
Hello?

710
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,460
Hello? Are you off work? I'm here to pick you up.

711
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,660
There is a wedding today. I have to work overtime.

712
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
You don't have to pick me up.

713
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Okay. Be careful when you go home.

714
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,460
Bye.

715
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,860
I haven't told you something yet.

716
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,260
I bought that store.

717
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,860
We have a place in the future.

718
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
You can rest assured on my side.

719
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,860
Everything will be done according to the plan.

720
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,860
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

721
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,260
Excuse me. Aren't there white wine here tonight?

722
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,660
We don't have white wine tonight.

723
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,460
Thank you.

724
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
It's so late.

725
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Yes.

726
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,860
The restaurant is a bit busy today. They're off work late.

727
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,260
I've been to your restaurant.

728
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Why did you lie?

729
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Why did you lie?

730
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Yes.

731
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
I resigned.

732
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,260
I felt that this job wasn't suitable for me.

733
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,660
Then where did you go all night?

734
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,860
I went out to eat with friends.

735
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,460
Stop lying to me.

736
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,260
You just resigned. You don't have any friends.

737
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,060
Actually, I went out to eat with friends I knew in prison.

738
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,660
We just resigned.

739
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,260
You can be honest with me.

740
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,260
I don't know what you'll think.

741
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Do you know that I'm worried about you?

742
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
You spent money without a reason.

743
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,260
You even decided to go to the city alone.

744
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Do you know that you've been acting strange lately?

745
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,260
I'm still thinking if you're not used to new life.

746
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
I'm sorry.

747
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Did I give you a lot of pressure?

748
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
I'm sorry.

749
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Oh, right.

750
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,260
I bought these things for you.

751
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm sorry.

752
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,260
I bought these things for you.

753
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
Dried plum,

754
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,260
and some other supplements.

755
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
I bought these for you.

756
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I know that you come down to drink every night.

757
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,260
I'm begging you. Can you be nice to yourself?

758
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Come.

759
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Don't cry.

760
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,260
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

761
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
No.

762
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,260
All these years,

763
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,260
no one cared about me this much.

764
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
I was so nervous.

765
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Thank you.

766
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
No matter what happens,

767
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I will always be by your side.

768
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
You...

769
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Where are we going to eat?

770
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
We can go to your place.

771
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
I can eat anything with you.

772
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Really?

773
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Really.

774
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
You...

775
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Calm down.

776
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Watch out for the fire.

777
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Fire means your goods are not working.

778
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Put out all guns.

779
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Now every stock has one.

780
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
You think this is the United States?

781
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
First, not every stock has one.

782
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
You can only buy it with money.

783
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Second, there are gun cards in the United States.

784
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
But we don't need them.

785
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
I want to run away.

786
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Find me a way.

787
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Run away?

788
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
To the United States?

789
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
I'm not going to the United States.

790
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Britain?

791
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Canada?

792
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Australia?

793
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Are you trying to trick me?

794
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay, calm down.

795
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
I can help you wherever you go.

796
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
But I helped you.

797
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
You have to help me too.

798
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
How do you want me to help you?

799
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,260
I will go to the oil ship with a group of people.

800
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Don't you have many water-saving friends?

801
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Help me find out when they are working.

802
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
I don't want to be so worried.

803
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,260
There is only one principle to determine whether a person can stay with you.

804
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Is it valuable?

805
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
What's wrong, Gao San?

806
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
Go to the oil ship and wait.

807
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
I'll be right there.

808
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
Okay.

809
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
We are the officers of the government.

810
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,260
We are now officially arresting you.

811
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
I'm sorry.

812
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
I'm sorry.

814
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
I'm sorry.

815
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm sorry.

817
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm sorry.

818
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm sorry.

819
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
I'm sorry.

820
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,260
I'm sorry.

821
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
I'm sorry.

822
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
I'm sorry.

823
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I'm sorry.

824
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
I'm sorry.

826
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
I'm sorry.

827
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
I'm sorry.

828
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm sorry.

829
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm sorry.

830
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm sorry.

831
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm sorry.

832
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I'm sorry.

833
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I'm sorry.

834
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I'm sorry.

835
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
I'm sorry.

836
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
I'm sorry.

837
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm sorry.

838
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm sorry.

839
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I'm sorry.

841
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm sorry.

842
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
I'm sorry.

843
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
I'm sorry.

844
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm sorry.

846
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm sorry.

847
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm sorry.

848
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
I'm sorry.

849
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I'm sorry.

850
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I'm sorry.

852
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
I'm sorry.

853
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
I'm sorry.

854
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
I'm sorry.

856
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
I'm sorry.

857
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260

00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
I'm sorry.

861
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
I'm sorry.

862
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
I'm sorry.

863
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm sorry.

864
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I'm sorry.

865
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,260
I'm sorry.

866
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I'm sorry.

867
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260

I'm sorry.

869
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I'm sorry.

870
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
I'm sorry.

871
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
I'm sorry.

872
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
I'm sorry.

873
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
I'm sorry.

874
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm sorry.

875
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm sorry.

876
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
I'm sorry.

877
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
I'm sorry.

878
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
I'm sorry.

879
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
I'm sorry.

880
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm sorry.

881
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
I'm sorry.

882
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
I'm sorry.

883
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm sorry.

884
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
I'm sorry.

885
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
I'm sorry.

886
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260

894
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260

I'm sorry.

900
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,260
I'm sorry.

901
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,100
I'm sorry.

902
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
I'm sorry.

903
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
I'm sorry.

904
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
I'm sorry.

905
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
I'm sorry.

906
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
I'm sorry.

908
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
I'm sorry.

910
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm sorry.

913
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm sorry.

914
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100

I'm sorry.

919
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm sorry.

921
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100

I'm sorry.

924
