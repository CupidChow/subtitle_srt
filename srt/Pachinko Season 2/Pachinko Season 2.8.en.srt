1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,010
(in Japanese) It's the wheel of history.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,555
That endless churn of cause and effect.

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,935
And really, it's exhausting.

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,022
Which is how Tolstoy saw it as well.

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,983
He understood
that this wheel is made possible

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,944
by the labors of the common man.

7
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,613
That's what makes this novel
so revelatory.

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,823
He speaks truth.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,578
Bando-kun, how do you see this?

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,539
Do you agree?

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,464
I agree that Tolstoy's intent was
to try to portray this theme.

12
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:54,179
However, his execution fell short.

13
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,933
Nakazono-san fails to see this.

14
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,603
In the novel,

15
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,524
the characters are aristocrats
or have close ties to that world.

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,110
What's missing is the kaleidoscope

17
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,114
of the real human experience.

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,950
One that doesn't take its view
from that of the privileged class

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,910
as so many in this room,

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,498
but instead depicts a world

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,585
where the people struggle to endure.

22
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,631
Sure, a good theme,

23
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,051
but the execution is unfortunate.

24
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,930
In my eyes,

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,976
this book is a failure.

26
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,856
Well said, Bando-kun.

27
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,234
You've once again pierced
the veneer of the text.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,987
The rest of you would do well
to follow suit.

29
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,491
Now, let us all turn to Book Nine.

30
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,639
We can't do this here.

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,890
Someone will see.

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,768
I don't care. Let them see.

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,610
But I do need to get to class.

34
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,322
Hurry, Mozasu.

35
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,909
Watch this.

36
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,994
Look, it's working! You did it!

37
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,670
- Nothing to it.
- So simple.

38
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,551
Just some more. Keep going.

39
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,445
That one.

40
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,036
Did you really expect
to get away with it?

41
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,706
Goto-san...

42
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,084
I didn't expect you to be here.

43
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,295
- I thought Thursdays are your--
- Be quiet!

44
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,046
Listen carefully.

45
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,884
Because I like your mother's noodles
so much,

46
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,304
I'm going to show you some mercy.

47
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,640
Come with me.

48
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,395
(in Korean) Did you really do this?

49
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,771
Look at me.

50
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,357
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,863
He'll be punished.

52
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,489
I give you my word.

53
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,074
We'll pay for your losses.

54
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,534
Punishing him...

55
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,161
What comes from it?

56
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,330
Then what?

57
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
We'll be more vigilant,

58
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,168
make sure he tends to school--

59
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,879
Those schoolbooks are not for him.

60
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,094
But he needs to go to school.

61
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,890
What else can he do?

62
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,941
Let him work for me.

63
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,317
At the parlor.

64
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,111
It's honest work.

65
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,990
And he'll come to no trouble there.

66
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,659
I'll see to that.

67
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,246
He's too young.

68
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,207
You are not hearing me, Bando-san.

69
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,751
He is not his brother.

70
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,706
NOTICE OF LOAN PAY-OFF

71
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:41,003
I have a letter here which states
that my loan has been paid off.

72
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,297
This must be a mistake.

73
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,508
I see here
that a payment has been made.

74
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,928
By wire transfer, three days ago
for the entire sum.

75
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,431
But--

76
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,267
Are you able to see
who made the payment?

77
00:07:55,267 --> 00:08:00,147
It looks like
the wire originated from Tokyo.

78
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,358
Solomon Baek. He's the account holder.

79
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,238
Are you sure?

80
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
I am certain.

81
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,453
I see.

82
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,413
Thank you.

83
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,373
Have a good day.

84
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,925
Who knows what kind of things
go on in a pachinko parlor?

85
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,138
I'm just as worried as you are.

86
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:38,434
But Goto-san gave me his word.

87
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,568
He's not family.

88
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,405
He won't look after Mozasu as his own.

89
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,743
What are we to do then?

90
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:59,540
Keep fooling ourselves into believing
he'll follow Noa's path?

91
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,845
It was different during the war years.

92
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,139
We had to do
whatever we could to survive.

93
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,599
Everyone did.

94
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,143
But that is over now.

95
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,939
You actually believe
we are out of the woods?

96
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,650
But why does it have to be pachinko?

97
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,112
Surely there are
more respectable ways to go.

98
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,201
I expected this kind of talk
from my brother-in-law.

99
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,120
Not from you.

100
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,146
TO MR. YOSEB BANDO
OSAKA, JAPAN

101
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,736
FROM MR. CHANGHO KIM
PYONGYANG, KOREA

102
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,641
Do you not like the book?

103
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,894
I love it. It's not that.

104
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,312
What is it then?

105
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,233
To read of all this suffering

106
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,152
and all these desperate people...

107
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,405
It makes me hungry.

108
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,116
It's strange, I know.

109
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,746
Where does this come from?
This ravenous hunger.

110
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,290
What do you make of it?

111
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,214
The characters in this book,
they're not you.

112
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,342
You never have to worry
about going hungry

113
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,220
or living in those squalid conditions.

114
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,099
And yet you want to fill your belly

115
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:28,021
just to prove to yourself
you will never be the one to go without.

116
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:35,028
But even with all that,
with your stomach full and bursting,

117
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,659
you find yourself realizing
you actually tasted none of it.

118
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:46,456
All that food, it tasted like paper.

119
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,089
Take me to your room.

120
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,384
I want you.

121
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,346
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:07,186
I have my weekly dinner appointment.

123
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,481
Ah, your mysterious benefactor.

124
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,027
Don't call him that.

125
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,029
But it's true, isn't it?

126
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,156
He pays for your boarding room--

127
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,203
I do that for us.

128
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,746
And I want to meet him.

129
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,666
I told you, that will never happen.

130
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,585
But what's wrong with him?

131
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,213
Is he some kind of monster?

132
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,262
These past few months
we have been together,

133
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,307
have I ever denied you anything?

134
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,686
- No, but--
- Then allow me this one thing.

135
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,523
It's the only thing I'll ever ask
of you.

136
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,693
You can never meet him.
Do you understand?

137
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,624
Promise me one thing then.

138
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,213
Tonight, when you are
with this mystery person of yours

139
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,340
and you are eating
that very expensive dinner,

140
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,219
you will savor every extraordinary bite

141
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,264
until you are about to burst.

142
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,017
Noa,

143
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:34,022
you and I, let's have it all.

144
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,328
Indeed, we are building a dream.

145
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:54,710
But we're turning this dream
into reality.

146
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,547
Membership will be capped at 500,

147
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,133
and as of 20 minutes ago,

148
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,637
only 47 spots remain.

149
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,980
We expect to break ground in 90 days.

150
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:19,818
And by next summer,
we plan to open the golf course.

151
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:25,240
Excuse me. How will you deal with
the recent labor shortages?

152
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,909
With so much construction in the city,

153
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,745
I hear it is becoming a challenge
to find the human resources.

154
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,622
I assure you

155
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,168
our partners have
the situation under control.

156
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:40,964
We won't have any labor shortages.

157
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,343
Please, go ahead.

158
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,804
There are rumors
of a possible real estate crash.

159
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,682
Do you have a view on this?

160
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,068
My view?

161
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,621
I think it is an amusing rumor.

162
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,335
Because history tells us
that since the end of World War II,

163
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,590
land prices have never fallen
in this country.

164
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:29,137
Here in Tokyo, real estate is king.

165
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,890
And in the very near future,

166
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,434
Japan will overtake
the United States of America

167
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,479
to become the largest economy
in the world.

168
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,399
Think about that.

169
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,943
America as number two.

170
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:48,031
So, really,
what do we have to worry about?

171
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:56,456
Now, who wants to hear about the spa?

172
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:03,255
It will be cast in
the finest Italian marble...

173
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,467
So, I can expect no further issues?

174
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,678
Thanks to your generous support,

175
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,181
the remaining members
of the Diet have come around.

176
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,683
There will be no more obstacles.

177
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,352
Very good.

178
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,146
And the price?

179
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,231
Forty million yen.

180
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,651
I know this is not what you hoped for,

181
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,904
but it's still a good bargain--

182
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,988
Thirty million yen.

183
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,074
No more.

184
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,828
But, Koh-san...

185
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,289
Just because you say so,

186
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,375
it's not that easy to convince
the other Diet members.

187
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,214
Are you expecting someone?

188
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes. A very important guest.

189
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,927
I didn't mean to interrupt.

190
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,304
I can wait downstairs in the lobby.

191
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,597
Not at all.

192
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,225
I wanted the two of you to meet.

193
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,393
Join us.

194
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,147
This is Kurogane-san.

195
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,903
I know who you are.
I see you often in the papers.

196
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,071
Depending on the paper,

197
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,116
I am either the future
of this great nation

198
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,703
or the scourge.

199
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,579
It's all very favorable, I assure you.

200
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,750
And who is this young gentleman?

201
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,878
He is one of the greatest minds
of the next generation.

202
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,176
But unfortunately, too modest.

203
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,388
We'll drill that out of him yet.

204
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,056
And what do you do?

205
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,517
I'm a second-year student.

206
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,519
At Waseda.

207
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,021
- What are your plans for study?
- Politics.

208
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,899
That is a wonderful choice.

209
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,236
If you are as promising as Koh-san says,

210
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:54,575
it shouldn't be too long before I see
your name in the papers as well.

211
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,078
So, what is your name?

212
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,080
Baek.

213
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,624
Noa Baek.

214
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,676
No doubt we'll be meeting again.

215
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,432
I must be going.

216
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,351
Before you go.

217
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,911
The next time we meet,
I expect the number to be 30.

218
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,792
You'll find a little more
than usual today.

219
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,671
I hear you got married
and have a new home.

220
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,510
Consider it my congratulations.

221
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,944
Are you going out again?

222
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,200
I thought it would be good
to get some air.

223
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,671
Is there anything else?

224
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,103
What are these?

225
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,525
They are from him.

226
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,870
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,582
I hid them from you.

228
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,385
Today, we are trying the strawberry.

229
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,513
It is good to try new things.

230
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,148
Did something happen?

231
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,030
My son...

232
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,243
He suspected you of getting close to me

233
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,665
to take our money.

234
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,835
So he hired an investigator
to look into you.

235
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,594
He did what?

236
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,430
He shouldn't have done what he did,

237
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,935
but his motives were good.

238
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,939
He was worried about me.

239
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:40,527
And so, he found something.

240
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,244
The war.

241
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,209
That was a long time ago.

242
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,716
You were young, and yet--

243
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,092
I...

244
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,512
I am a murderer.

245
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,105
What are you doing here?

246
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,530
Still here, I see.

247
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,115
Still cleaning up his mess.

248
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,036
Yoshii-san asked you a question.

249
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,413
Give us a moment.

250
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,166
Do not worry, Sugihara.

251
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,585
I've dealt with him before, haven't I?

252
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,385
I've come to make myself clear.

253
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,473
Stay away from my son.
Cut ties with him.

254
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,891
That's impossible.

255
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,938
Your son is going to
make me a lot of money.

256
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,525
Haven't you already
taken enough from me?

257
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,236
Is that how you see it?

258
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,696
That's interesting.

259
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,657
I never wanted your grandfather's love.

260
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,826
I never asked for it.

261
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,327
That was his choice--

262
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,205
You came to speak about Solomon.

263
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,999
And I'm telling you

264
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,835
he made his choice.

265
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,962
As you did all those years ago.

266
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:26,049
If you have a problem with that,
talk to him.

267
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:30,596
Because whatever this crack is
between the two of you,

268
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,599
it's not on me.

269
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,194
We both know

270
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,739
I could've destroyed you back then.

271
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,700
Instead, I showed you mercy.

272
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,286
So hear me now.

273
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,582
If you bring any harm to my son,
there will be no more mercy from me.

274
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,084
You know what I am capable of.

275
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,253
Understood?

276
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,243
Hey!

277
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,497
Bring me two boxes.

278
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,665
And cigarettes.

279
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,917
Keep the change.

280
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,882
He wants two boxes.

281
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,264
Hey.

282
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,349
I'll take care of this.

283
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,226
Get back to your cleaning.

284
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,654
Yoshii-san, welcome.

285
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,031
And with Mamoru today...

286
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,505
Do you really work here?

287
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,467
But how old are you?

288
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:34,970
Fifteen.

289
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,055
You?

290
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,974
Seven.

291
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,770
Is that your grandfather?

292
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,526
Don't you know who he is?

293
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,446
No, I don't.

294
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:55,616
Mamoru.

295
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,345
Have you finished
The Brothers Karamazov?

296
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,014
Of course.

297
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,390
What did you think of it?

298
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,559
Did you read it?

299
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,187
I read everything you read, Noa.

300
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,272
Whatever your classes require.

301
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,193
Why? You are a busy man, Koh-san.

302
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,072
Because I never had the chance to.

303
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,661
Noa, I was motivated
by your love of books.

304
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:44,248
But those books are not your future.

305
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,880
I'm not going into politics.

306
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,550
I want to be a teacher.

307
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,847
You came all the way to Waseda
to become a teacher?

308
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,724
That's ridiculous.

309
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,061
So many doors are opening for you here.

310
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,437
You just don't realize it.

311
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,231
I do,

312
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,402
but I've determined my path.

313
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:36,884
Who are you?

314
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:40,512
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm here to meet my friend.

315
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,892
What are you doing here?

316
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,685
Who is this?

317
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,230
I am Akiko Nakazono.

318
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,275
A good friend of Noa's.

319
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,194
He invited me.

320
00:28:55,194 --> 00:29:00,032
I wasn't expecting guests,
but please, there's more than enough.

321
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,335
Nakazono...

322
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:16,215
Would your father be Nakazono Hitoshi?

323
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,217
The Foreign Undersecretary?

324
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,844
Yes, that is my father.

325
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,071
Noa, sit.

326
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,211
Do you know who I am?

327
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,798
Certainly.
Noa has spoken so highly of you.

328
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,887
We were just talking about his future.

329
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,430
His future?

330
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,766
What a serious conversation.

331
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:12,187
I believe there is a splendid future
waiting for him.

332
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,106
I sensed it the first time I met him.

333
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,402
But first, he must want it.

334
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,739
Perhaps you can help him with that.

335
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,707
To the future.

336
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,881
Sayo-fucking-nara, Shiffley's.

337
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,508
Hey, man.

338
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,886
When do you fly home?

339
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,512
I'm not going back to the States.

340
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,806
Macau.

341
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,810
- Yoshii-san offered me a job.
- Doing what?

342
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,939
Running his new gaming venture.
Whole thing.

343
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,357
But what about your kids?

344
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,318
Who am I fooling, man?

345
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,573
They made it this far without me,
and they have survived.

346
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,534
Sure, maybe at first.

347
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,287
But are you really serious?

348
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,455
Yeah.

349
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,374
But Macau?

350
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,584
Why not?

351
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,712
I made it through Tokyo.
It's just another stop on the road.

352
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,925
Besides, you and I know the market's gonna
bust here. You should think about it.

353
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,516
I still remember
the first lie you told me.

354
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,893
What was that?

355
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,437
"I'm not here to stay."

356
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,112
You know you're really in trouble

357
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,865
when you start believing your own lies,
by the way.

358
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,367
Thank you.

359
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,495
Another for him.

360
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,207
It wasn't supposed to be a lie.

361
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,293
But thanks to Abe, here I am.

362
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,089
That guy must be
losing his shit right now.

363
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,884
Fine with me.

364
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,220
As long as he's cursing my name.

365
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,392
You don't feel the slightest tremble
of pity for the guy?

366
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,436
Not one bit. Can't afford to.

367
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,568
Thank you.

368
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,286
Fuck it all.

369
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,628
He's nothing like
the monster you made him out to be.

370
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,755
It's not about that.

371
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:45,924
Then was it me?

372
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:51,013
Were you worried
that I would embarrass you somehow?

373
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,349
I asked you to stay away from this!

374
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,979
I want to be part of it.

375
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,689
And I refuse to apologize.

376
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,195
Do you think I'm someone
you can just trifle with?

377
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,490
Some toy to amuse you

378
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,826
because you're a naive, rich girl--

379
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,995
How dare you talk to me this way?

380
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,291
You don't think I see it?

381
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,171
How much you enjoy
stirring up people's reactions.

382
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,007
You and the Korean lover.

383
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,884
What a great scandal.

384
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,470
You're so desperate for attention,

385
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,015
you're pathetic.

386
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,894
I don't care how people see me.

387
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,063
That's the difference between us.

388
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,982
You let others define you.

389
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,276
Think about it.

390
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,154
- Who's really the pathetic one here?
- Leave.

391
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,407
I refuse.

392
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,285
I won't let you go.

393
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,792
I don't want you anymore.

394
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,591
Because I know the truth?

395
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,802
Is that why?

396
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,685
What do you think you know?

397
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,103
You know nothing.

398
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,864
Oh, but you do know, don't you?

399
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,042
That man is your father.

400
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,918
- Koh Hansu is--
- I told you to shut up!

401
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:16,033
I must speak to Koh Hansu at once.

402
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,369
- It is late--
- Let him in.

403
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,007
I'll call for you if I need you.

404
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,014
Let's sit down.

405
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,933
You were never meant to meet her.

406
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,562
Akiko. She broke her promise to me.

407
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,690
So when I tried to end things,

408
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,318
she said the most ridiculous thing
to me.

409
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,820
It's completely...

410
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,282
It makes no sense.

411
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,994
But as foolish as it is
to put merit into her words...

412
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,332
I need to hear it from you.

413
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,501
What did she say to you?

414
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,421
She said...

415
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,552
you are...

416
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,932
my father.

417
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,403
Tell me it's not true!

418
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,625
It's true.

419
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,555
I was a fish broker then.

420
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,850
I traveled between Osaka and Busan.

421
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:10,272
I hadn't stepped foot on my homeland
in nearly 16 years.

422
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,236
I didn't think it would affect me,
but it did.

423
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,866
Did you force yourself on her?

424
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:23,535
Of course not.

425
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,455
But you took advantage of her.

426
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,208
You must have!

427
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,084
Is that what you want to believe?

428
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,714
That I played my wiles
upon a poor country girl?

429
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,426
Instead of accepting that she loved me--

430
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,594
That's not possible.

431
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:44,681
You are a foul man.

432
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,517
Venal!

433
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,268
And selfish.

434
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:52,397
Then, what about you?

435
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,777
Because the blood
that courses through me...

436
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,364
runs in you as well.

437
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,036
Not the blood of that nitwit
you called a father all these years.

438
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,039
Who are you to call me foul?

439
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,791
I saw you.

440
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,961
At the farm that night!

441
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,337
What of it?

442
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,965
What did I tell you?

443
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,385
Look forward.

444
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:22,886
Noa,

445
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,557
always look forward.

446
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:37,025
That day...

447
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,696
I know you heard my words.

448
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,783
You didn't look back.

449
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,205
You are mine.

450
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,419
Noa...

451
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,132
we can finally put an end
to this charade.

452
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,719
Go home and sleep.

453
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,305
When you wake in the morning,
you will see.

454
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,515
Everything will be different.

455
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,186
They will grovel.

456
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,649
I will make it so.

457
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,397
They were the enemy.

458
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,650
That's what we were told.

459
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:06,573
They were going to come
and rape our women, destroy our homes.

460
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,702
I believed them.

461
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:18,252
I thought of my wife,

462
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,713
the children we were yet to have,

463
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,716
and my parents.

464
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,054
They were both still alive then.

465
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:37,688
We were all so exhausted.

466
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,439
And starving.

467
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:49,867
And the heat was merciless.

468
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,623
The bugs, they feasted on us.

469
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:06,550
For all those months,
we were barely alive.

470
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:14,057
Under those conditions,
we were barely human.

471
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:22,733
So I thought,
"We're going to just die like this."

472
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,196
That's what I thought.

473
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,494
And...

474
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,415
when the orders came...

475
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,130
my soul slipped out of my body...

476
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,677
and I did as I was told.

477
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,103
But that wasn't the final order.

478
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,397
There was one more.

479
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,489
"Forget everything."

480
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:14,159
That's what they told us.

481
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:18,914
I followed that order.

482
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,258
We were all fools

483
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,387
to think the past could be forgotten.

484
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,641
What are we supposed to do then?

485
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:44,147
Spend the rest of our lives
chained to it?

486
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:12,009
I wish you well.

487
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,966
And so it is

488
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:57,763
There is no doubt

489
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:03,727
But why all this fuss
For merely asking

490
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:08,273
To stay together for 500 years?

491
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,818
Is this

492
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:18,700
A trick of fate?

493
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,162
That my future

494
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:29,670
Now seems dark

495
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,090
And so it is
There is no doubt

496
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:51,191
Noa.

497
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,569
Why are you here?

498
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:54,653
Mother.

499
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:58,448
What? What's the matter?

500
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,325
Just...

501
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,786
I wanted to see your face.

502
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,000
Has something happened at school?

503
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,626
Is it too hard?

504
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,752
No.

505
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,547
I love it there.

506
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,133
For the first time,

507
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,511
I feel like I can do anything.

508
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,890
Then why...

509
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,516
Tell me.

510
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,393
Why have you come?

511
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,812
I told you.

512
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,148
I wanted to see you.

513
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,865
I'll head back now.

514
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:41,575
Already?

515
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,620
You just got here.

516
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,206
Stay the night.

517
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,665
You can leave in the morning.

518
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,667
I can't.

519
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,211
I must go.

520
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,463
I made plans with a friend.

521
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,928
Then I'll walk you to the train.

522
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,012
It's okay.

523
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,766
I know how long
the day has been for you.

524
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,851
I want you to rest, Mother.

525
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,648
Take good care of yourself.

526
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,484
Noa...

527
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,695
Mother, all is well.

528
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:55,816
Noa.

529
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:57,693
Noa.

530
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,112
Have you seen my son?

531
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,624
Noa! Noa!

532
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,024
Breaking news report.

533
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:41,945
The shocking news of the suicide
of Wae Enterprise CEO, Masaru Abe,

534
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,782
is rippling through
elite financial circles.

535
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,659
Mr. Abe was a prominent figure

536
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:52,331
until recent controversies shadowed
his latest development project.

537
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,419
His body was discovered early this
morning in Chubu Sangaku National Park.

538
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,923
Witnesses at the trail

539
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:05,928
described a man's body falling
from the summit of a cliff.

540
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:10,349
When authorities searched the area,

541
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:14,686
they found Mr. Abe's shoes
but no suicide note.

542
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,773
The investigation is ongoing.

543
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:19,816
Now for the next news...

544
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:25,489
Where could he be
with no money and no one to rely on?

545
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,533
My men are still looking for him,

546
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,451
scouring the entire country.

547
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,078
It's been weeks!

548
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,664
We've been looking everywhere.

549
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:34,998
There are no signs of him.

550
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,669
I'll find him no matter what.

551
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,421
I won't give up.

552
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:45,759
Look at us.

553
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,720
It's our fault.

554
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,599
It was always going to come to this.

555
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:54,768
Stop speaking nonsense.

556
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,353
It's true!

557
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,730
We ruined him.

558
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,815
No.

559
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,778
Sunja, all of your sacrifices,

560
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,280
all of my sins,

561
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,949
we did it for him.

562
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,202
He said he didn't want it.

563
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,540
And I should've known better.

564
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,931
That night...

565
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,561
he came to say farewell.

566
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:44,818
To tell me not to worry,
he needed to say that.

567
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,451
It was his mercy.

568
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,561
He's gone.

569
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,441
There are no signs of him.

570
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,407
Sunja.

571
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,573
Koh-san!

572
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:59,286
Why didn't you tell me
you were back in Osaka?

573
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:02,623
Cheers!

574
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,752
Oh, no!

575
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,589
I'm drunk.

576
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:18,889
Koh-san, do you want to play?

577
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,225
Koh-san?

578
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:23,977
Get lost!

579
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,211
Get on with it!

580
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,597
When I was little,

581
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:47,728
my father told me about the horses
that used to run wild in Yeongdo.

582
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,148
Chollimas.

583
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:54,985
Night and day, they would run.

584
00:53:55,527 --> 00:54:00,365
So fast their shadows couldn't keep up,

585
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,660
and their bodies had to split
from their shadows.

586
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,212
Mozasu,

587
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,380
I...

588
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:18,884
I wonder sometimes...

589
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:23,597
Why do some people in this world
manage to survive

590
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,183
while others do not?

591
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,062
Is it those who find their shadows,

592
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,731
and those who don't?

593
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,778
Because a body

594
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,657
cannot live without its shadow.

595
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,578
Those shadows tell us

596
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,457
where we are.

597
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,216
Whatever it is,

598
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,096
you and I are here.

599
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,475
Though so many of those we have loved
are gone,

600
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,561
we are here

601
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,105
sitting at this table.

602
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,237
And Solomon is here as well.

603
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,014
Excuse me.

604
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,891
Do you need a worker?

605
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,312
I am looking for a job.

606
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:43,403
You're not one of those Koreans,
are you?

607
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,113
No.

608
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:46,990
Not me.

609
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,244
I'm a hard worker.

610
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,496
I promise.

611
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,627
Well then,

612
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,212
let's see how you do.

613
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,306
I forgot to ask your name.

614
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:18,730
It's Ogawa.

615
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,526
Ogawa Minato.

616
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:57,811
PACHINKO
