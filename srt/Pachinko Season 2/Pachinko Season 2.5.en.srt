[worker, in English] I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own eyes.

7
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,472
- You don't believe me?
- When you say that?

8
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,724
It's not your concern.

10
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,270
Hey, did you see? With his bare hands.

11
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,771
[worker 2] Taehoon.

12
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,571

Those Koreans are like roaches.

19
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,883
Every day, they keep multiplying.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,470
When will they stop?

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,265
- [whistle blows]
- Bando-<i>san</i>!

22
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,734
Tell him I want these aisles swept.

23
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
I don't want a speck of dust left.

24
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,780
Make sure he knows that.

25
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,329
[in English] He said sweep the floors.

26
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,874
Do a good job. He'll be watching you.

27
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,712
[in Japanese] He understands.

28
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
Back to your place.

- Sake, please.

[in English] Sir! Here! Join us!

32
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,511
Over here!

33
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,816
Cheers, everybody.

34
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,861
[all] Cheers!

35
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,204
My father used to say,

36
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,666
"When a man has a drink in his hand,

37
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,044
it means his joys turn into sorrow,
and the sorrows turn into joy."

38
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,798
Which one is it for you tonight?

39
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,383
Listen, young man.

40
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,678
I don't mean to hurt your feelings,

41
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,556
but I want to drink in peace.

42
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,475
I'm asking this as your elder.

43
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,894
So allow me that.

44
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,480
[stammers]
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, sir.

45
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,948

46
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,786
Why are you laughing?

47
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,416
I remembered something else
my father used to say.

48
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,212
It has me thinking, how he seemed
to have a saying for everything.

49
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,801
And where is your father?

50
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,804
He's passed away.

51
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,765
From cholera.

52
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,476
It spared me somehow.

53
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,562
[clicks tongue]
My father was not so lucky.

54
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,859
When did you get sent over?

55
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,237
A year ago, maybe?

56
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,407
They put me to work in the mines at first,

57
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,285
but then there was a bad accident.

58
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,624
Don't worry. It won't last long.

59
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,460
This war we're in.

60
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,841
Yes, but what will be left?
Will there be anything to go back to?

61
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,468
What are you talking about?

62
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,387
We do whatever it takes.

63
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,805
That's our country.

64
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,517
[chuckles]
I didn't take you for a patriot.

65
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,061
It's nothing like that.

66
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,270
It's just...

67
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,857
I know where I belong in this world.

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,318
There's no need to overcomplicate it.

69
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,371
I'll be off then.
I see another seat opening.

70
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,630
[clock ticking]

71
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,634
[shift bell blares]

72
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,931
[in Japanese] I come with great news.

73
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:17,229
I am proud to announce
a most important visitor to our factory.

74
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,147
In two days,

75
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,402
one of our Emperor's
distinguished advisors

76
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,406
will honor us with his presence

77
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,868
in recognition
of our dedicated war efforts.

78
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,744
Therefore,

79
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:40,252
we must show our most worthy guest
what this factory is truly capable of.

80
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,011
Banzai!

81
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,846

- <i>a new bomb hit Hiroshima...</i>
- [Yoseb, in English] Taehoon.

90
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,924
I know what
you're planning with that chisel.

91
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,135
It's suicide.

92
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,179
Don't concern yourself.

93
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,933
I would rather not, believe me.

94
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,184
But Taehoon...

[sighs]

96
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,109
Every time I look at you,

97
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,403
you remind me of someone.

98
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,117
My brother.

99
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:37,995
Isak.

100
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,250
I was the reason he came into this hell.

101
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,254
All because of my fear of being alone.

102
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,552
And now...

103
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,681
He's gone.

104
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,851
I...

105
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,353
I told you about my father.

106
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,772
The disease,

107
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,067
it hit my entire village.

108
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,866
Out of 89 people in my village...

109
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,994
I...

110
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,997
I was the only one who made it.

111
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,630
Why?

112
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:35,677
Why am I the only one who lived
when everybody else died?

113
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
Then when the foreman
gave his speech yesterday...

114
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,318
I finally understood why.

115
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,573
For this moment.

116
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,205
It's not.

117
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,083
Don't commit a sin.

118
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,377
Did you say "sin"?

119
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,140
For all your days,
may your cup runneth over.

120
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,603
And I hope the love you speak of...

121
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,732
...will nourish you now
and well into your old age.

122
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
I'm serious.

123
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,328
I wish it for you. Truly.

He has nothing to do with this! Let go!

[Hansu] Calm yourself.

Your family will be back soon.

Who are you?

160
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,637
Koh Hansu is my name.

161
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,020
You're...

162
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,440
...that family friend.

Taehoon... Taehoon, how is he?

164
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,115
I don't know who that is,

165
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,619
but if he was with you in the factory,
then the odds are not good.

166
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,497
You had fortune on your side.

167
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,583
The truck shielded you.

168
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,223
So can I stay here with my family?

169
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,476
The war is over.

Then our country is ours again.

[Hansu] If you're thinking about
going back to Korea, forget it.

It'll be chaos in the coming years.

Only a moron would dare go back there.

You'll stay on the farm
until Osaka is safe.

00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,325
How dare you...

185
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,077
How dare you hang around here?

186
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,623
You have no right to be near Noa!

187
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,875
I have the right because he is my son.

188
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,336
It was my brother who raised your son.

189
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,796
And it was your brother
who left him a pauper.

190
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,173
[Yoseb] Shut up!

191
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,758
[breathing heavily]

192
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,678
Even once more. If you insult
my brother again, I'll kill you.

193
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,891
Even if it means I have to burst out
of what skin I have left.

194
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,519
I'll murder you.

195
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,652
You think I don't know
what kind of person you are?

196
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,825
To earn those clothes,
what kind of work you do...

197
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
You think I will let...

198
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,458
...my family be tainted
by a person like you?

199
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,297
[panting]

200
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,186
You are the head of this family.

201
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,730
I don't dispute that.

202
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,941
I'll be perfectly clear.

203
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,655
I was the one who saved you.

204
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,910
I saved so many of your family,
and not from any goodwill.

205
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,787
Sunja and Noa compelled me.

206
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,124
Because they are mine.

207
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,302
The sooner you understand this,

208
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,137
the easier it will be for you.

209
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,106
Mr. Koh Hansu. Are you leaving already?

210
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,901
Yes, I left another
medicine package on the table.

211
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,155
You should know, it will be the last time.
It's too risky to keep him on it.

212
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,323
I understand.

213
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,743
- I will get him through this.
- [Mozasu] Mr. Koh!

214
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,746
Do you want to see
the wasp nest we just found?

215
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,792
These wasps are so big!

216
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,752
Aren't they, Noa?

217
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,548
Brother! Where are you going?

218
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,675
[Kyunghee] I don't know
what's gotten into Noa.

219
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,385
He hasn't been himself lately.

220
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,305
I wonder if it's the thought
of leaving, going back.

221
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,798
[clicks tongue] Enough!

222
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,426
Why are your hands so shaky?

223
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,597
[Kyunghee] I'll make sure
to steady my hands next time.

224
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,764
[Yoseb] Sunja!

225
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,526
Are you okay?

226
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,195
I am fine.

227
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,421
[Noa, in Japanese]
I guess this is goodbye then.

228
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,549
I'll see you back in Osaka.

229
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,634
[Minoru grunts]

230
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,303
Might be nice to get back.

231
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,933
I've even started to miss my father,
though I'll just get sick of him again.

232
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,392
- [chuckles]
- [Sunja] Noa!

233
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,729
I should go.

234
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,237
[Mr. Kim, in English] Let's go, Noa.

235
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,863
We need to leave.

236
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,579
[Mozasu] Brother!
We almost forgot to take this!

237
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,169
[engine starts]

238
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,918
[Mozasu, in English] Mama...

239
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,587
[Sunja] It's okay.

240
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,425
[Sunja's mother] Is this the place?

241
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,429
[Kyunghee gasps]

242
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,018
[sighs] They've got to be here.

243
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,856
[Sunja's mother]
How will they find it?

244
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,191
[horn honks]

245
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,070
[Sunja] Be careful.

246
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,616
[Sunja's mother] No...
Hey, don't go too far!

247
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,744
Hey, slow down.

248
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,704
[swing music playing]

249
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,083
How you kids holding up?

250
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,840
We must look like aliens to them.

251
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:06,136
You know what?
I bet these will look way better on you.

252
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:07,846
Catch?

253
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,224
[Noa] Mozasu, let's go.

254
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,475
[in Japanese] What is this?

255
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,101
[in English] No. They're yours.

256
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,440
Whoa. See that?

257
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,484
You take care of them, you hear?

258
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,362
[vehicle departs]

259
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,864
[soldiers speaking indistinctly, laughing]

260
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,704
- [sighs]
- They're safe.

261
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,626
[Kyunghee] Noa! Mozasu!

262
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,128
Come eat!

263
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,922
[in Japanese] Time to get up.

264
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,593
Mozasu!

265
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,469
[Mozasu groans]

266
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,263
What are you doing?

267
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,431
[Noa] It's morning.

268
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,905
[gasps, in English]
Take this upstairs.

269
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,489
He must be hungry.

270
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,630
[Sunja's mother] Look at you.

271
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,549
- Always the same.
- [Mozasu groans]

272
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,094
You're always one step behind, aren't you?

273
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,596
Grandma, stop...

274
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,932
What's there to rush off to?

275
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,141
[Noa] Uncle.

276
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,228
I've brought your breakfast.

277
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,357
- [Sunja's mother grunts]
- [gasps]

278
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,150
[Mozasu] Wait, please.

279
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,194
You're not to lift anything heavy.

280
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,946
[Sunja's mother mutters]

281
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,083
Good morning.

282
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:48,549
You need to tell Mr. Koh
that he's working you way too hard.

283
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,801
[Mr. Kim] His business is booming.

284
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,469
It is what it is.

285
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,771
[Kyunghee] You must be famished.

286
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,439
Please, do not bother.

287
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,318
I'm just going to get some sleep.

288
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,002
[Noa] He says he's not hungry.

289
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,093
[sighs]

290
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,536
GOLF RANGE COMING SOON

291
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,715
[Solomon, in Japanese]
Where's Tom?

292
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,885
He'll be here.

293
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,976
[Tom] I am concerned.

294
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,479
It's about Abe-<i>san</i>.

295
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,857
He's carrying too much debt.

296
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,735
Especially to us.

297
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:37,241
I understand Andrew-<i>san</i>'s concerns.

298
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,369
But perhaps we should
approach this more rationally.

299
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,206
This all started from rumors.

300
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,125
If we distance ourselves from Abe-<i>san</i> now,

301
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,712
it would worry or alarm our other clients.

302
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,422
Also...

303
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,342
[scoffs] ...I shouldn't have to remind us,

304
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:59,221
but here at Shiffley's,
we've made almost two billion yen

305
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,723
from our ten-year relationship
with Abe-<i>san</i>.

306
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:08,522
Shouldn't such a client be given the time
to overcome his financial difficulties?

307
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,400
[Tom] This is different.

308
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:16,029
There will be no hotel,
not without Colton.

309
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,116
Then we'll find another partner.

310
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,659
Hyatt's been targeting Tokyo...

311
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,787
Hyatt's not going to touch this either.
The land has lost half its value.

312
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,247
It will rise again.

313
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,666
That's your professional opinion?

314
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,376
[scoffs] Your hunch?

315
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,880
And what happens if they find the bones?

316
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,090
A priest will hold a memorial service

317
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,176
and let the public know
that the right steps...

318
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,220
You really think that past
can be cleared away so easily?

319
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,430
Seriously?

320
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,015
[director] Enough.

321
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,769
[Solomon] So, I've been thinking.

322
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:52,316
It's true that land is tainted,
but it's still worth something.

323
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,026
[chuckles]

324
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:58,238
This bottomless appetite of yours,
will it ever be satisfied?

325
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,406
Golf.

326
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,283
Golf?

327
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,494
An elite, members-only club.

328
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,499
400 billion gross. 300 billion net.

329
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,085
Minimal outlay.

330
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,671
A legitimate business.

331
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,673
Too good to be true.

332
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,259
I don't like it.

333
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,347
Even after Shiffley's calls in that loan,

334
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:28,602
they still need to off-load
that land quickly.

335
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,983
We should bid on it.

336
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,402
I'm not getting into the golf business.

337
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,613
We know what is to come.

338
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,949
All we have to do is set it up.

339
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:47,829
Get the permits going,
presell memberships at 250 million a pop.

340
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,540
The payoff will be huge.

341
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:51,917
[server speaks Japanese]

342
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,843
[Tom, in English] So, uh...

343
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,555
Shiffley's won't call in the loan.

344
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,015
- What? Why?
- Because of your former colleague.

345
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,060
She made a convincing appeal
on behalf of Abe-<i>san</i>.

346
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,229
You have to fucking do something.

347
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,857
I was just trying to fucking do something.

348
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,442
- What do you think I was doing?
- [chuckles]

349
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,405
[in Japanese]
What does it matter? We got our money.

350
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,115
[Solomon stammers]

351
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:26,285
The point is to put the screws to Abe.

352
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,496
Then you have to convince her.

353
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,164
She's your girlfriend, isn't she?

354
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,125
[in English] Wow. What...

355
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,501
What's he talking about?

356
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,546
[in Japanese] You didn't know?

357
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,970
I'm starting to come around
to this idea of yours.

358
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,474
At least the profit angle of it.

359
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,855
But your girlfriend
has to change her tune on Abe.

360
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,107
You think you can do that?

361
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,568
Yes. I'll handle it.

362
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,320
Good.

363
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,323
Better you than me.

364
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,158
Don't you think?

365
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,811
[speaks Japanese]

366
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,026
[in English] Sunja, look at this mess.

367
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,445
I had it all in order
before I left yesterday.

368
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,451
[Goto, in Japanese] Good morning.

369
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:52,079
Goto-<i>san</i>! You are early today.

370
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,747
I sure am.

371
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:57,042
I wake up craving your noodles.

372
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,462
By the way, Bando-<i>san</i>,

373
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,548
are the rumors true?

374
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,134
You're planning on opening a restaurant?

375
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:07,845
[chuckles]

376
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:12,099
Yes. I hear the Americans
will ease the restrictions soon.

377
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,852
We've saved some money to get us started.

378
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:18,063
But it's difficult to find a good space.

379
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,483
In that case, I know the perfect place.

380
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,985
Closer to the train station.

381
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,362
Won't that be too expensive?

382
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,031
The owner owes me a favor.

383
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,951
I'll put in a good word for you.

384
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,120
Are you serious?

385
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,832
You've always taken
such good care of my belly.

386
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,500
Let me do this for you.

387
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,794
Goto-<i>san</i>, you are so kind. Thank you.

388
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:43,755
[Goto] And you, Noa.

389
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,424
Entrance exam is coming up soon.

390
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,342
[chuckles] Next week.

391
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,345
I still have so much to study
but I am doing my best.

392
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,722
Must be nice, Bando-<i>san</i>.

393
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,100
You'll be the envy of the market.

394
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,227
A son who is a college boy!

395
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,272
But, Goto-<i>san</i>, I need to get in first.

396
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,732
What are you talking about?

397
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,650
Of course you're getting in.

398
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,360
Look at your grandmother.

399
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,696
If you don't,

400
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,489
she'll die of disappointment.

401
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:13,493
I can't understand,
but I know it is trouble.

402
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,995
[laughs]

403
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,749
[Goto chuckles, speaks Japanese]

404
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:24,046
- [sniffs]
- [in English] Noa, you'll be late.

405
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,173
Run along.

406
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:39,228
[shopkeeper]
Enjoy! Please come again. [chuckles]

407
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,564
Is that Noa?

408
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,276
- [Noa] Hello!
- [shopkeeper] Get over here.

409
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,487
I need to get to work soon.

410
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:52,115
How nice!
He really is a mother's joy, isn't he?

411
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,161
And everybody knows how hard you work.

412
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,746
Come by and let me make you lunch.

413
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,873
Fill your stomach
with as much tofu as you'd like.

414
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,584
All your favorite toppings.

415
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,712
I get my payment on Friday,
but I appreciate that.

416
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,841
Now what kind of talk is that?

417
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:11,969
You need to feed that smart brain of yours
if you're going to do well.

418
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,887
Just come.

419
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,348
We'll take care of you. Right?

420
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,560
I'll try to get away if I can.

421
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,103
Thank you.

422
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,405
[telegraphs beeping]

423
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,533
[phones ringing]

424
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,618
[typewriter keys clacking]

425
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,748
[Noa, coworker speak Japanese]

426
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,799
BABY SON BORN

427
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,135
NEED 100 YEN. SEND AT ONCE.

428
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,096
MOTHER ILL. COME HOME NOW.

429
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,271
[in English] Did she tell you about us?

430
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,899
- [Solomon] No.
- Hey, I'm just a little...

431
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:09,860
little surprised.

432
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,071
Because the truth is that I f...

433
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:16,116
I fell pretty hard.

434
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,368
And, uh...

435
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,829
I think she was...

436
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,042
I think she was just more
into the transgression of it all.

437
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:29,838
What with her parents being
who they are and all that shit.

438
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:34,718
So...

439
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,181
how are you going to get her to back off?

440
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,858
[murmuring]

441
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:00,202
[soldier] How do you say, "I like you"?

442
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,913
[server, in Japanese] I like you.

443
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,040
[soldier repeats line]

444
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,625
[server] I like you.

445
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,211
[soldier repeats line]

446
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,841
[in English] I take it
that's the quartermaster?

447
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,802
Looks like you don't have
to worry about him anymore.

448
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,679
[Hansu grunts] So it seems.

449
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:23,642
[mutters]

450
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,060
[in Japanese] Raise the lights.

451
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,562
[server speaks Japanese]

452
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,610
[in English] How is he doing?
Do you think he'll be ready?

453
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,197
I can't speak to how much he's learned,
but he barely sleeps.

454
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,286
He could've made it easier for himself.

455
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,580
He's the one who chose this way.

456
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,040
He feels the responsibility
of being the eldest.

457
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,834
I think it speaks highly of him.

458
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,296
What's with you?

459
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,050
You've really become
a part of them, haven't you?

460
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,011
Isn't that what you wanted though?

461
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,225
How much longer do I have to do this?

462
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,686
I've done more than my duty.

463
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,315
I would really like to move out.

464
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,109
This is very surprising to me.

465
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,696
I thought you would shed those feelings.

466
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,202
Once the boy's settled at university,

467
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:27,247
you'll be free to leave that house.
Until then, you stay.

468
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,791
And what if he...

469
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,212
- ...doesn't get accepted...
- That's not possible.

470
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,132
Is that because you're going to fix it?

471
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,560
I'll do anything to help my son,
as you know.

472
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,688
But never that.

473
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,817
This is an important moment.

474
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,195
I need to see for myself
what he is capable of.

475
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,782
So once he gets in...

476
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,993
Then you'll be done with the family.

477
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,499
I understand.

478
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,626
[Hansu] One more thing.

479
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,383
This restaurant idea of Sunja's,

480
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,593
how serious does it seem?

481
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,429
They've been saving every scrap for it.

482
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,851
Noa's tuition is the priority,
but her heart is set on it.

483
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,854
Perhaps you can allow her this.

484
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,025
You can go.

485
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,112
Don't forget to go see Ishida.

486
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,283
I want him to understand
that I am not pleased...

487
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,326
I know exactly what needs to do be done.

488
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,415
You no longer need to explain it.

489
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,204
- Look at you.
- [sighs]

490
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,998
You can't even keep your eyes open.

491
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,088
[sighs]

492
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,300
I'm fine now.

493
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,971
You can't possibly cram
any more in that head of yours.

494
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,015
Get some rest.

495
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,892
I can't yet.

496
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,894
I have to study.

497
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:03,487
Noa.

498
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:11,453
[stammers]

499
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,834
As your mother...

500
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,587
I'm sorry.

501
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,803
Why should you be sorry?

502
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,642
Because this is all too much for you.

503
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:39,648
Working all day at the telegraph office
and then coming home to study all night.

504
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,114
I just wish that
I could've made it easier for you.

505
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,160
Mother.

506
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,621
[chuckles]

507
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:58,292
[sighs] Do not worry about me.

508
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:00,836
I must be really tired.

509
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:03,172
Oh dear...

510
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,591
That money...

511
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,052
I know we could have accepted it.

512
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,265
Mr. Koh Hansu offered it.

513
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,896
But, Mother,

514
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,108
I wouldn't want that to be how I did it.

515
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,529
You understand, don't you?

516
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,073
Oh, dear...

517
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,286
I really do.

518
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:39,958
Go get some rest.

519
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,128
- You don't need to worry about me.
- [chuckles]

520
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,505
Mother, I'm young.

521
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,216
This is nothing for me.

522
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,803
Just be sure you don't stay up too late.

523
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,640
I won't.

524
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:09,738
[sliding door opens, closes]

525
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,368
[sighs]

526
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:26,922
[gasps]

527
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,048
You're here.

528
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:31,051
[grunts]
To buy some tofu to bring home.

529
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,852
[in Japanese] Is business good today?

530
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,188
No more than usual.

531
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,609
[in English] And yet today,
time seems to pass by so slowly.

532
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,862
[in Japanese] Some days are like that.

533
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,155
For me as well.

534
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,824
[in English] You too? Really?

535
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,286
You always seem so busy,

536
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,914
especially with the exam coming.

537
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,417
Yes, the exam.

538
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,335
It's impossible to forget it.

539
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,131
[in Japanese] It's exciting.

540
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,425
That's plenty.

541
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,885
[in English] There's no need.

542
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,803
[in Japanese] It's not much.

543
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:18,182
[in English] And if it gives you strength,
it'll be worth it.

544
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,610
Thank you.

545
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:42,039
[in Japanese] Did you forget something?

546
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,043
[in English] What happens if...

547
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:47,753
...I fail?

548
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,757
The exam, what if I don't pass?

549
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,510
If I don't get in?

550
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,763
They only take
one out of seven applicants.

551
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,432
Those odds don't work in my favor.

552
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,940
You are Baek Noa.

553
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,400
[in Japanese] That's not possible.

554
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,069
[in English] I don't believe it.

555
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:14,029
I'm certain you will not fail.

556
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,931
[Hansu, in Japanese] What is this?

557
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,518
Your father-in-law has
important guests in his room.

558
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:47,563
They arrived an hour ago.

559
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,107
[people chattering]

560
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,368
Join us.

561
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,499
As you all know,

562
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,418
this is my son-in-law.

563
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,382
I have the honor today of having
Kurogane-<i>kun</i> as our guest.

564
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,136
I'm told he's a rising star
in the new party.

565
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,263
You should get to know him.

566
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,475
It's too early to call it
a political party,

567
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,896
but it seems promising.

568
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:32,482
It's only a matter of time.

569
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,111
With men like Kurogane-<i>kun</i>
leading the way,

570
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,698
the Liberal Party will be
a force to be reckoned with.

571
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,535
Just the political party Japan needs now.

572
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,081
What is your party's goal?

573
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,960
[Kurogane]
To restore our nation's pride and glory.

574
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:53,962
What else is there?

575
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,799
The Americans will be leaving soon.

576
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:01,553
Your top priority should be
the transition plan.

577
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:03,764
Speaking of Americans,

578
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,434
I hear they are great friends of yours.

579
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,894
[chuckles]

580
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,979
We made money with them.

581
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:12,898
That is all.

582
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,024
[chuckles]

583
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,108
Right.

584
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,653
American whiskey,

585
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,863
American spark plugs.

586
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,993
I hear you even sell
American toothbrushes.

587
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,538
[group chuckles]

588
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:29,164
Apparently they sell well.

589
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,793
I admit

590
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,797
the Americans have their uses.

591
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:41,009
They're useful in rooting out
the Communists.

592
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,305
Though they're mostly Koreans.

593
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:51,103
The Koreans who refuse to leave
are troublesome for our country.

594
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:54,022
It's a good riddance that so many
went home after the war.

595
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,107
Tell me,

596
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:57,150
what is this meeting about?

597
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,781
We are talking about the resources needed

598
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,701
to support the rise of
Kurogane-<i>kun</i>'s political career,

599
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,453
so he may steer the country
back in the right direction.

600
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:13,792
I want to see our nation restored
to its former glory with my own eyes.

601
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,463
That is my dream for my final years.

602
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:21,800
I promise you.

603
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,927
Unlimited support.

604
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,346
No questions asked.

605
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,237
[people speaking on television]

606
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,951
[doorknob rattling]

607
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,037
[television continues]

608
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,686
[jingle playing]

609
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:19,525
[sighs]

610
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,028
[television turns off]

611
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:36,959
You're home.

612
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,377
[Solomon] I am.

613
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,962
I didn't know you'd be here.

614
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,675
I wanted to surprise you
but I fell asleep.

615
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,885
You work too hard.

616
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,095
[sighs]

617
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,263
I know.

618
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,932
But it's worth it.

619
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,186
We need to get you to bed.

620
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,772
- What? [chuckles]
- [strains]

621
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,107
[exclaims]

622
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,709
I'm sorry I'm not so exciting.

623
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:19,835
[Solomon chuckles]

624
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,211
That's not true.

625
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:26,216
For me, this is the highlight of my day.

626
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:29,344
[chuckles] Is that true?

627
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,138
It is.

628
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,349
[kisses]

629
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,285
[Sunja's mother, in English]
Stop eating, will you?

630
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:55,120
Noa, you need to get going.

631
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:58,540
You'll be late for the exam.

632
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,546
Noa?

633
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,849
[students speaking Japanese]

634
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:03,230
[student] Minoru, wait for us outside.

635
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,148
[chuckles]

636
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:10,988
[proctor]
We are ready to start the exam.

637
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,782
Wait for the minute hand
to reach the half-hour mark,

638
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:17,703
then open your exam book to begin.

639
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,084
Begin now!

640
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:26,003
[pages shuffling]

641
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,192
[broadcaster]
<i>On the morning of the 25th,</i>

642
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:51,528
<i>the North Korean military crossed
the border and shelled South Korea</i>

643
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:56,283
<i>from 11 locations along the 38th Parallel.</i>

644
00:51:56,283 --> 00:52:02,664
<i>In response, President Syngman Rhee
has ordered up his defense forces,</i>

645
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:06,043
<i>and the South Korean Ministry of
National Defense announced retaliation.</i>

646
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:12,382
<i>A red alert was issued
as artillery battles persist.</i>

647
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:17,054
<i>The country has now been
divided against each other,</i>

648
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:18,680
<i>a war between the North and the South.</i>

649
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:35,280
[clock ticking]
