[people chattering, laughing]

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,100
OUR NOA IS GOING TO WASEDA UNIVERSITY!

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,315
[in English] How you used to run
around here as a little boy.

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,194
And that good father of yours
always chasing you around!

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,240
- [Sunja's mother exclaiming]
- [laughing]

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,617
[wrestler, Mozasu straining, grunting]

00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,453
- [Goto cheers, chuckles]
- [chuckles]

8
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,330
A dockworker I know

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,083
sold off everything he owns
to afford a boat ride over.

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,420
Probably taking up arms
against those bastards this very minute.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,464
[activist] If he made it, that is.

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,094
I also hear
that trip over is getting more dangerous.

13
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,221
[radio host
speaking Japanese indistinctly]

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,441
Really, why are you being like this
on such a happy day?

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,485
- You did so well!
- [crying]

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,863
Stop this now.
His mother's not even crying.

17
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,030
[well-wisher chuckles]

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,539
[car door closes]

19
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,961
- [children chattering]
- [Hansu] Here.

20
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,224
So they've all gathered for you, Noa.

21
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:41,977
Apparently.

22
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,021
It's overwhelming.

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,024
You'll get used to it.

24
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,734
This is just the beginning.

25
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,699
Here.

26
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,628
This watch... It's how it all started.

27
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,425
Open it.

28
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,100
[attendees chattering indistinctly,
laughing]

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,230
[Sunja's mother] The food is ready!

30
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,440
It's yours now.

31
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,901
Thank you.

32
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,653
[Sunja's mother] Come sit down!

33
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,072
[Kyunghee] Please join us.

34
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,075
Let's go.

35
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,371
Sunja, don't just stand there. Sit down.

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,962
Pass this along.

37
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,922
[Mozasu sighs] I'll take some, please.

38
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,468
Slow down. Wait for the others.

39
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,387
[Mozasu]
Today, I get to be served first.

40
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,514
[attendees continue chattering]

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,599
[Noa] Please, enjoy the meal.

42
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,603
You should try some liver.
It's fresh. Please try it.

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,899
- [Mozasu exclaims]
- [attendees chattering]

44
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:17,030
- [attendee 2 chuckles]
- [Noa chuckles]

45
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,497
[clears throat]

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,376
[Sunja's mother]
Our Noa, let's cheer him!

47
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,752
[attendees cheering]

48
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,386
You see that? My grandson!

49
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,346
He's going to Waseda!

50
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,393
["Wait a Million Years" plays]

51
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,995
[Naomi, in Japanese]
Please run the numbers again.

52
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,914
Especially the over-allotment scenarios.

53
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,500
We've run those numbers several times.

54
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,586
[Naomi] Check again.

55
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,213
Along with the annual reports.

56
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,425
After all this hard work,

57
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,635
I want to avoid future corrections.

58
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,680
Please have these back by end of the day.

59
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,604
Excuse me.

60
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,315
I apologize for interrupting.

61
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,859
The director wants to see you
in the conference room.

62
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,244
Excuse me.

63
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,540
- You asked for me?
- Ichizaki-<i>san</i>. Have a seat.

64
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,842
We have an urgent matter to discuss.

65
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,011
Does this concern the IPO?

66
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,682
Tom-<i>san</i>, I leave it to you
to explain the matter.

67
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,769
There have been allegations

68
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,396
that you breached security protocol.

69
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,648
Specifically,

70
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,443
leaking confidential client information
about the IPO.

71
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,198
Are you aware of what I am talking about?

72
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,497
I think I have an idea.

73
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,582
So, you don't deny it?

74
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,879
I admit, it was unprofessional of me.

75
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,090
I should've been more careful.

76
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,219
But I assure you
that no sensitive information was shared.

77
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,180
Nothing to jeopardize the IPO.

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,017
Our security department is
still investigating the matter.

79
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,437
Thankfully, the situation was brought
to our attention early enough

80
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,147
to stem further damage--

81
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,859
There would've been no further damage.

82
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,821
Indeed, because Tom has
reassured our client.

83
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,659
You spoke to Kinyuu?

84
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,622
I needed to make sure they heard
directly from us.

85
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,041
It was the right thing to do.

86
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,043
That being said,

87
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,088
there is still the question of the stain.

88
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,467
As I said,

89
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
it was a lapse in judgment.

90
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,221
It will never happen again.

91
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,308
I will call the clients at once

92
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,351
and let them know
we are still on schedule--

93
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,563
[director] You do not seem to understand
the gravity of your situation.

94
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,775
Your actions could've exposed
this firm to serious risks.

95
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,111
And what about your standing?

96
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,031
As one of few women in management,

97
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,408
you are supposed to set an example.

98
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,456
I take that very seriously.

99
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,627
However, if you are telling me that,
because I am a woman,

100
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,004
I must remain unblemished
for my entire career

101
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,422
then that is impossible.

102
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,759
It's also unfair, is it not?

103
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,764
Especially when others have been afforded
a second chance.

104
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,069
Please.

105
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,113
Give me the same chance.

106
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,492
I'm afraid it is too late for that.

107
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,702
We will accept your resignation.

108
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,037
Effective immediately.

109
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,248
It is a shame.

110
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,004
For whom?

111
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,185
[sobs]

112
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,691
[sighs]

113
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,089
[crying]

114
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,230
[in English] It's done. I just got
the authorization to call in the loan.

115
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,524
<i>Abe now has a mark
of 30 million dollars on him.</i>

116
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,360
[Yoshii] How soon till Shiffley's
takes bids on the property?

117
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,446
[Tom] <i>We'll have to see
how much Abe-</i> san <i>fights the loan.</i>

118
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,698
<i>But after that,
everything's already primed.</i>

119
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,325
<i>If we can come in at the number discussed,</i>

120
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>then the auction should be
just a formality.</i>

121
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,080
- [Yoshii] Call us when you know more.
- [Tom] <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

122
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,837
[in Japanese]
It all went down as you planned.

123
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,382
I have to admit...

124
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,012
I didn't think you had it in you.

125
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,058
Looks like I was wrong.

126
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,609
[Hansu] Who is Isamu Yoshii?

127
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,070
[Ryochi] Just some fortunate thug

128
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,280
who did the right favor
for the right person.

129
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,326
Losing those markets will be a hit for us.

130
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,038
[Ryochi] We'll take a hit,

131
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,041
but only temporarily.

132
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,378
Instead,

133
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,674
I want you to think
about those new subway lines.

134
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,098
Has the contract been guaranteed to us?

135
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,642
We've made the deal.

136
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,064
This is a huge step forward for us.

137
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,028
The rest is up to you.

138
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,780
But you know that.

139
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,286
However,

140
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,539
there is one condition.

141
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,919
Kurogane-<i>kun...</i>

142
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,214
He wants to keep the ceremony private.

143
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,594
He would rather avoid a big affair.

144
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,765
What does he mean by private?

145
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,853
He would prefer

146
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,982
you were not present.

147
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,740
That is

148
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,825
unacceptable.

149
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,829
I figured.

150
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,628
But you agreed to it.

151
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,008
I did.

152
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,094
Because it's what must be done.

153
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,699
[Mozasu] Jackpot!

154
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,493
[Noa] That's all there is?

155
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,079
It's just a game of chance?

156
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,289
Didn't you just see what I did?

157
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,500
I calculated the timing of my flicks,

158
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,003
and figured out just the right amount
of pressure-- [chuckles]

159
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,298
You really think you can control this?

160
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,425
This isn't winning.

161
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,553
Then what do you call this?

162
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,806
I'm going to trade these in for prizes.
Wanna come?

163
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,307
I'll stay here.

164
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,831
[Mozasu laughing]

165
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,041
Is that true? [chuckles]

166
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,251
Hey, take this.

167
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,211
Share some with your brother.

168
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,536
[sniffling]

169
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,267
[Kato]
Be careful not to damage the roots.

170
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,061
See?

171
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,729
Still life in it yet.

172
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,109
But will it survive this move?

173
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,822
- I've never had any luck with this.
- [chuckles]

174
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:50,158
You just need to watch it carefully.

175
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,454
Make sure it gets the right amount
of sun and water.

176
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,707
- [Sunja grunts]
- [chuckles]

177
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,130
[grunts]

178
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,798
That place you mentioned...

179
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,341
Connecticut.

180
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,926
Are there many trees there?

181
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,053
So many!

182
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,682
- You wouldn't believe it.
- [grunts]

183
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,517
And so tall.

184
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,063
I wish I could see America for myself.

185
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,817
It's always been a dream of mine.

186
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,403
Why not go then?

187
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,946
Kato-<i>san</i>,

188
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:32,201
you are always going on
about how little time you have left.

189
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,410
[chuckles]

190
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,746
It's not as hard to go as it used to be.

191
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,165
[chuckles] That is true.

192
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,711
But just as expensive, unfortunately.

193
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,797
At least for me. [chuckles]

194
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,469
Everything's getting so expensive here.

195
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,973
It's a wonder how people can afford
to make ends meet.

196
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,727
But that's how it is, isn't that so?

197
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,065
We're told to live a long life...
[chuckles]

198
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,444
...but no one ever told us
how to pay for it.

199
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:16,912
To be honest...

200
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:22,041
I've been thinking about moving in
with my daughter.

201
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,670
She's in Nagoya.

202
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,713
[gasps] Nagoya?

203
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,216
But so far away?

204
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,428
I'm the burden now.

205
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,016
[Sunja sighs]

206
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,689
It's up to you now.

207
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,360
To look after the family.

208
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,903
Stop that talk.

209
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,240
You talk as if
you're disappearing or something.

210
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,702
I'm not disappearing.

211
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,497
[Mozasu] Tokyo's like a hundred times
bigger than this place.

212
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,874
Just wait.

213
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,460
Next time you come home,
you're going to realize

214
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,380
everything here is too small for you.

215
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,174
Listen to you!

216
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,551
So wise all of a sudden.

217
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,597
Let me ask you then, what about you?

218
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,765
What are you going to do without me?

219
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,894
Don't worry about me.

220
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,191
I've got my plans.

221
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,777
I'm...

222
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,029
I'm going to America.

223
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,656
[chuckles]

224
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,616
I'm serious.

225
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,243
As soon as I can ditch school
I'm outta here.

226
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,289
And what's in America?

227
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,334
Big cars.

228
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,669
Big houses.

229
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,882
So much space
you can't smell your neighbor's shit.

230
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,387
And all the sweets in the world.

231
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,139
So, that's it, isn't it?

232
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,602
You want to go all the way over
to stuff your belly?

233
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,689
That's not it.

234
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,819
In America, I don't have to be
the person they see me as here.

235
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,822
That's why I want to go.

236
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,957
He's been living alone
these past few years.

237
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,917
He hardly sees his family.

238
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,586
[Mozasu] His financial status...

239
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,004
How much has he saved?

240
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,383
As you suspected,
no real assets to speak of.

241
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,969
He retired from a printing company
after 30 years.

242
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,512
He lives on the pension now

243
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,014
with a mortgage of 27 million yen.

244
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,892
He lives frugally.

245
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,770
But these past few weeks,

246
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,439
he's taken my mother out to eat often.

247
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,027
I figure he's trying to woo her.

248
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,366
[detective grunts]
So, the question is, what is he after?

249
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,412
But one thing troubles me.

250
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,165
He served in the war.

251
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,585
His generation were all drafted.

252
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,587
[detective] True, but...

253
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,299
very few were put on trial.

254
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,193
It's a loan.

255
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,028
Think of it that way.

256
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,988
What is this?

257
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,825
It's not my son's money. It's mine.

258
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,704
The money I saved
from selling the restaurant.

259
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,168
But why are you giving me this?

260
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:55,380
Because you don't have much time left.

261
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,134
Neither of us do.

262
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,679
I can't possibly take this.

263
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,057
I don't need it.

264
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,520
[Kato sighs]

265
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,281
Perhaps then we can go together.

266
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,328
What do you think?

267
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,872
Will you consider it?

268
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,336
I would very much like
to see America with you.

269
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,341
[Sunja, in English] Dear Lord,

270
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,427
we thank you for the food
you have provided us tonight.

271
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:46,849
We also are thankful for all that
you have so blessed us with.

272
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:51,228
You provide for us and keep us safe.

273
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,357
I know it is selfish
to ask for anything more,

274
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:59,027
but as we prepare
for our Noa to leave his home here,

275
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:03,699
I ask you to watch over him
and keep him safe from harm, my Lord.

276
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:08,704
Many souls get lost in that big city
where he is attending school.

277
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,164
I pray that
as he continues on this journey

278
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:15,544
that You please guide his path forward,
so he may never lose his way.

279
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,338
He is a good boy.

280
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,008
It is all thanks to you, Lord.

281
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,720
That, I am grateful for.

282
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,390
In Your son Jesus' name, we pray.

283
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,309
- Amen.
- [Kyunghee, Mozasu repeat]

284
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,269
[Kyunghee] That was beautiful.

285
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,521
That was wonderful.

286
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,484
Brother, do you think
you'll find food like this at Waseda?

287
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,528
[all laughing]

288
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,698
When you arrive,
find a church that's nearby,

289
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,867
to help you while you're there, all right?

290
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,660
All right.

291
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,496
[footsteps approaching]

292
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,963
[Kyunghee] Yoseb.

293
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,008
I didn't think
you would be ready to eat yet.

294
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,221
The final night with my eldest nephew...

295
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,806
And I'm not invited?

296
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,684
Is that how little respect
I get in this house?

297
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,271
[Kyunghee] My apologies.

298
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,574
[Yoseb sighs]

299
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,917
[liquid pouring]

300
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,681
Is this it?

301
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,559
This is how you send him off?

302
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,769
[sighs]

303
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,566
Uncle, I promise you,
this is a feast to me.

304
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:13,996
[cutlery clanks]

305
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,249
[Yoseb] Have you even tasted this?

306
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,711
Have you? How can we possibly eat this?

307
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,797
Why do you always oversalt the food?

308
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,923
[Kyunghee] I'm sorry.

309
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,510
- I'll make you something else.
- [Yoseb] Don't bother.

310
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,928
It'll be the same as this.

311
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,860
How much longer will you go on like this?

312
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:49,198
What?

313
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,286
Where are your manners? [exclaims]

314
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:58,248
Is this what's happened while I've taken
my eyes off you the last few years?

315
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,709
You need to listen.

316
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,340
If you followed your brother's example,
you would be better off right now!

317
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,466
Uncle, please!

318
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,095
I came up short
when compared to my brother.

319
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,180
I know that.

320
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,976
I'll never be as smart as he is,
or as good-natured or generous.

321
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,230
And he deserves it
because of his hard work.

322
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,525
But Auntie works so hard as well.

323
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,277
- Mozasu, that's enough.
- What did she do so wrong?

324
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,571
Or any of us?

325
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,325
It's not like what happened to you
was our fault!

326
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,618
[whispers] Mozasu.

327
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,590
He's right about it, though.

328
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:52,845
Noa.

329
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:55,597
What's happening?

330
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,725
Mozasu, help me.

331
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,227
[Yoseb] What are you doing?

332
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,770
[Noa] We're taking you out.

333
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,647
Stop that.

334
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:05,941
I said stop.

335
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,026
- Get away!
- Noa.

336
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,405
Uncle, do this for me, just this once!

337
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,199
[grunts] I can't!

338
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,285
[gasping, panting]

339
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,714
Let him be.

340
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,591
He's not ready yet.

341
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,800
Then when?

342
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,220
He hasn't left the house in five years.

343
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,974
How much longer are we to go on like this?

344
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,142
[Sunja] Enough now.

345
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,117
[Yoseb] I'll do it.

346
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,176
I'll do it.

347
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,971
[Mozasu] Be careful.

348
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,976
[Yoseb breathing shakily]

349
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,796
[continues breathing shakily]

350
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,552
I can't.

351
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,267
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,935
Don't give up, Uncle.

353
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,937
Haven't you faced much worse than this?

354
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,272
[Yoseb sniffles]

355
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,481
[sighs] Oh, Yoseb.

356
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,359
[Sunja] Kyunghee... Give him a chance.

357
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,279
[Yoseb breathing heavily]

358
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,128
[crowd cheering]

359
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,050
What is this?

360
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,344
Uncle, we're almost there.

361
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,267
[crowd cheering]

362
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,573
[crowd cheering]

363
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,790
- [whistle blows]
- [umpire, in Japanese] Batter up!

364
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,587
- [spectator] It's that runt again.
- [spectator 2 laughs]

365
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,633
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

366
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,518
[umpire] Strike!

367
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,938
[spectator 3]
Try swinging the bat this time.

368
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:41,990
[umpire] Strike two!

369
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,970
- [spectator 3] He hit it!
- [crowd cheering]

370
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,226
Run!

371
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,688
Run! Go! Go! Go!

372
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,109
[Noa] Faster!

373
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,611
- Keep going!
- Circle the bases!

374
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:26,994
Go!

375
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:28,954
- [cheers]
- Faster!

376
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,877
- [umpire] Safe!
- Home run!

377
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,765
[chattering]

378
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:09,995
[footsteps approaching]

379
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,298
[Sunja, in English]
How did you get the watch back?

380
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,966
[Hansu] The pawnbroker.

381
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,385
I told you.

382
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,095
You were never lost to me.

383
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,806
[Sunja] But why burden him with that?

384
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,601
Sunja...

385
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,063
That watch saved you as it saved me.

386
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,649
Now, it's in Noa's hands.

387
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,365
You don't need to worry for Noa.

388
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,409
He'll flourish. You'll see.

389
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,290
To be honest...

390
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,252
My daughter is the one I worry about.

391
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,466
She's marrying a man who despises me.

392
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,427
He's Japanese.

393
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,728
Is that the reason he despises you?

394
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,940
I suppose that's why.

395
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,444
With these things,
it's hard to be certain.

396
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,450
The things left unsaid may be
more truthful than what is said aloud.

397
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,207
Do you think
he'll be good to your daughter?

398
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,459
I don't know.

399
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,179
[sighs] You said so yourself.

400
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,432
Marriage...

401
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,353
It's just a mere formality.

402
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,024
It seems to have worked out for you.

403
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,360
Is that how you see it?

404
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,282
[chuckles]

405
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,452
Why would you ask me that?

406
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,497
I should go inside now.

407
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,208
The boys will be back soon.

408
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:21,877
Sunja.

409
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,715
Do you remember?

410
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,220
Those days we spent at the laundry cove.

411
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,475
How happy we were then.

412
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,978
But too naive to know it.

413
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,399
I'm rotting inside now.

414
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,863
And the longer I dwell in these shadows...

415
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,159
the more this rot festers inside of me.

416
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,580
I feel it.

417
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,585
What am I to do?

418
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,638
This rot that grows within you...

419
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,725
You must cut it out of you.

420
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,324
Sunja.

421
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,627
Thank you.

422
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:09,318
NADAGAWA NEWSPAPER
AUGUST 3, 1948

423
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:13,780
MASSACRE OF POWS
ON PALAWAN ISLAND

424
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,742
[Sunja] Why did you do this?

425
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,204
Is it because he's poor?

426
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:22,497
I did it because we have money.

427
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:25,834
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

428
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,713
However, isn't it better
to know the truth?

429
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,177
What do you suppose the truth is, then?

430
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,013
Well...

431
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,057
139.

432
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:44,228
That's the number of American POWs
his unit massacred during the war.

433
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,438
How can you possibly say that's okay?

434
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,148
Did you hear me say that?

435
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,987
And how long were you with Etsuko?

436
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:59,868
Solomon is seeing a girl.
He's found a Japanese girlfriend.

437
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,998
Why is it okay for the two of you...

438
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,085
But for me to just have a new friend...

439
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,128
A new friend?

440
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,965
Yes, a friend.

441
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,595
Because I am lonely.

442
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,228
Too many of those I have loved...

443
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,647
They are gone.

444
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,620
Listen to your teacher, understand?

445
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,082
And come back when you miss my food.

446
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,002
- I will.
- Okay, come here.

447
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,300
[Sunja] That's enough.

448
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,511
Mother, we'll miss our train like this.

449
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,687
[Kyunghee]
You'll write us often, won't you?

450
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,606
Otherwise, we'll worry.

451
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:11,690
I will.

452
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,358
I promise.

453
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,529
- [sobs]
- [Yoseb] You heard your mother.

454
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,906
You need to go.

455
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,325
We already said our goodbyes.

456
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:00,822
[sighs]

457
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,249
[sighs, breathes heavily]

458
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,677
Brother!

459
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,807
[breathes shakily]

460
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,602
Don't go.

461
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,730
[in Japanese]
I can't make it without you.

462
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,149
[breathes heavily]

463
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,735
You said it yourself.
You're going to America.

464
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,614
You have your dreams too.

465
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,743
Fight for them.

466
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:48,453
You hear me?

467
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,206
That's all you need to do.

468
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,256
[in English] Look straight ahead, Mozasu.

469
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,302
Always look straight ahead.

470
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,981
[train whistle blows]

471
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:57,749
[administrator] Next in line please.

472
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,379
- Name?
- Bando, Nobuo.

473
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,887
Oh, it's you.

474
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,473
Hey! Bring over that special delivery.

475
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,766
Yes, sir.

476
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,521
[grunting]

477
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,901
[in English] Noa, what is this?

478
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,111
I'm not sure.

479
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:32,117
BANDO NOBUO

480
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,287
[administrator, in Japanese] It arrived
this morning in a chauffeured car.

481
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,997
It surprised everyone.

482
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,271
[in English] You were looking for me, sir?

483
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,565
How long have you and those fools
been hanging together?

484
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,027
I assure you, they are all good men.

485
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,448
And what do those good men have to say?

486
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,743
The war isn't going well for us back home.

487
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:15,953
For "us"?

488
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:18,997
The Northern army.

489
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,501
[sighs]

490
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:27,798
I would...

491
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,926
like to join the Northern army.

492
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,180
Why would you want
to do something so stupid?

493
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,348
It's our country.

494
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,434
Those are our people.

495
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:42,688
Our people are in the south as well.

496
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:47,276
It's the luck of the draw
which side one was born in.

497
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,403
There's no Providence there.

498
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,822
I long to return home, sir.

499
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,908
For people like me and you...

500
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,661
There is no home.

501
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,170
You've made up your mind already?

502
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,172
Yes.

503
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,889
I have one more job that needs to be done.

504
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,934
After that, you're free to go your own way

505
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:22,519
Who is it?

506
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:25,856
No, it's not like that.

507
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:31,236
You're going to help me
make a friend this time.

508
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:46,335
You should head back to your room
and rest.

509
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:50,047
- Mother...
- It'll be easier for me this way.

510
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:51,798
Don't be concerned.

511
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,176
I'll find my way.

512
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:03,810
Noa.

513
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,480
Your grandfather...

514
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,360
When I was young,
he told me he wanted me to fly.

515
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,656
High above in the sky.

516
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:21,370
He said that way, I could see from there
just how big this world really is.

517
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,628
Now it's your turn, Noa.

518
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,090
You'll have to fly high.

519
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:36,969
[chuckles]

520
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:40,973
But can you promise me something?

521
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:44,893
Every so often...

522
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,940
Come back and tell me what you see.

523
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,695
I would like for you to tell me...

524
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,741
...just how big the world is
from up there.

525
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:08,584
Of course I will.

526
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,403
[Sunja breathes shakily]

527
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,459
You're all packed.

528
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,378
Are you going somewhere?

529
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,840
Yes, I'll leave soon.

530
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,259
I'm joining the fight
with our Northern brothers.

531
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:43,053
Why do such a thing?

532
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,682
You're not even from the North.

533
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,685
I can't just stay here
and continue to do nothing about it.

534
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:52,020
You mean like me?

535
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:55,315
You have a family who needs you.

536
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,657
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm grateful.

537
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:06,410
For allowing me into this home.

538
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,747
You should be thanking her.

539
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:16,003
- It wasn't my decision.
- But you gave me your permission.

540
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,087
Did I?

541
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,090
I didn't have a choice in the matter.

542
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,262
[Yoseb sighs]

543
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,188
This thing you want to do...

544
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,649
I cannot understand it.

545
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,194
But in truth...

546
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,240
It's a choice that I respect.

547
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,662
And perhaps...

548
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,715
[inhales deeply] ...it's the reason
why she loves you so deeply.

549
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:09,139
I've seen the two of you.

550
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,476
The way she looks at you.

551
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,438
No matter how much I have prayed for it...

552
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,400
She has never looked at me like that.

553
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:25,113
It was never my intention
to cause you harm, I promise.

554
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,448
But you did, though.

555
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:32,996
[sighs]

556
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,582
I am sorry for it.

557
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:48,762
I'm asking you to stay.

558
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,435
Because if you leave her...

559
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,063
She will shatter.

560
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,860
She's a lot stronger than you think.

561
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,112
[Yoseb]
I don't want that kind of strength!

562
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,408
I don't want her to be a martyr.

563
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,661
And I don't want to be her cage.

564
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,329
She...

565
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,333
She deserves so much more

566
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,295
than what I'm capable of giving her.

567
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:24,423
Kyunghee... She's always deserved more.

568
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:26,758
[sighs]

569
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,304
So tell her...

570
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:41,231
Go tell her.

571
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,445
I'm letting her go now.

572
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,238
Do you hear me?

573
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:53,202
I won't be the wall to stand in her way.

574
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,955
I can't.

575
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,380
[Mr. Kim] Not like this.

576
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,341
Not with you in the deficit.

577
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,131
[sighs]

578
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,342
Mr. Kim.

579
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,429
Yoseb knows.

580
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:57,975
You don't need to worry.

581
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,644
He's made peace with it.

582
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,312
He said

583
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,606
that he'll let you go.

584
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:09,695
Kyunghee.

585
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,745
Kyunghee, please say something.

586
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:22,374
So, the two of you decided
what is to come of me?

587
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,127
Is that what happened?
[breathes shakily]

588
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:28,172
That's not how it was.

589
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,174
[Kyunghee] Then it was a negotiation?

590
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,593
No, of course not.

591
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,262
Kyunghee, you know my feelings for you.

592
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,141
Ever since that night at the farm,
I've never wavered.

593
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,311
I just never thought we had a chance.

594
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,695
Kyunghee?

595
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,616
That night...

596
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,410
I broke my vows.

597
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:00,746
And hours later...

598
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,625
My husband was nearly obliterated.

599
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,628
You can't think it was because of us.

600
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,339
It makes no sense. I know how it sounds.

601
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,967
I've long accepted that.

602
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:16,386
I am aware that
I am meaningless to this world.

603
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,097
But when I learned of the bomb,

604
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:21,141
I stayed up all night praying.

605
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,560
Begging the Lord to save him.

606
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,063
And so I made a covenant.

607
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,650
[sighs]

608
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,612
And my husband returned to us.

609
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:37,616
[sighs]

610
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,287
But I love you. With all my heart.

611
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:45,707
And you love me as well. I know it.

612
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:49,920
And that love...

613
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,006
It terrifies me. [sighs]

614
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,134
[breathes shakily]

615
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,180
[breathes shakily] You will go.

616
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:06,228
You will fight, and you will survive.

617
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:08,939
[sighs] You must.

618
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:16,363
Because the thought of being
in a world that you're not in,

619
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:18,031
I cannot bear it.

620
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:29,710
And when it's all over, come back to us.

621
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:31,420
[sighs]

622
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,883
Bring your wife
and your beautiful children.

623
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,218
You will do that, won't you?

624
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,435
Don't do this.

625
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:00,449
[crying]

626
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,582
[crowd applauding, cheering]

627
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:13,045
[student, in Japanese]
Down with the Americans!

628
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:18,759
They promised to understand
our culture and traditions,

629
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:23,388
only to make us pawns
in their imperialist conquests!

630
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:26,475
Their evil designs have
now reached our campus.

631
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,979
Now is the time for us
to rise up and fight!

632
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,481
Tell me.

633
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,901
Are you brave enough to join us?

634
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:39,154
To demand an end to these vicious purges.

635
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:43,283
- Will you rise with me?
- [crowd applauds]

636
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,285
[student] Then join our fight!

637
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,204
[crowd cheering]

638
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,139
Why did you ask to meet me?

639
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,644
Who are you?

640
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,145
Forgive me for alarming you.

641
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,147
I am Yoshii Isamu.

642
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,403
I've come to thank you
for your help with the markets.

643
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:21,613
How did you get in here?

644
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:23,365
I came in through the entrance.

645
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:26,952
Where is Hansu?

646
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,454
Where is he?

647
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,666
He is there watching us.

648
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,088
[Isamu grunts]

649
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:39,840
[Ryochi groans]

650
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,509
[groaning]

651
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,491
