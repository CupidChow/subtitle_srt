00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,491

Yes.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,544

Hello.

Here. Take this.

[Sunja] What took you so long? [pants]

We're almost out of everything.

Did you see that?

32
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,574
Didn't even have to lift a finger.

- And it's gotten so hot.
- [chuckles]

38
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,950
Perhaps that second margarita
was too much.

39
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,118
I think we may be a little drunk.

40
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,245

you paid for that as well.

45
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,383
I invited you here.

[in English] This wait is so hard.

54
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,917
But I can't decide whether
I want tomorrow to come sooner

55
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,586
or never to come at all.

56
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,670
Goodness gracious!

[Kyunghee] But how can you be so sure?

61
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,598
Even a fool like me knows.

I've had enough!

What's the point in harping on like this?

65
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,858
Nothing's to be done, so why dwell on it?

66

We'll know tomorrow.

67

- [crowd member] That's right!
- [crowd cheers]

77
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,810
They demanded that
we use our hands to do their work.

78
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,606
Hands that have bled and cracked for it,
to build this failed empire of theirs!

79
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,278
Even with that,
they tear down our schools,

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,448
force us to sign our names
in their public registry.

81
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,576
We were left helpless.

You see the shame of it!

And now we are fighting
for our very own lives, for our existence.

85

So today, their war may be over,
but our war is just beginning!

[crowd member] That's right!

94
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,620
Do they expect our people not to be angry
when entire villages are being massacred?

95
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,707
Our children slayed.

96

98
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,096
[activist] But with that said,
we must not blame our Korean brothers.

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,098
They are not to blame,

100
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,642
when we know they have been defiled

101
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,520
by evil Americans
who say they are our liberators!

[crowd] That's right!

103

A fight that is for Koreans!

107
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,620
A fight that is by Koreans!

108
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
For one united country!

109

- Fewer whores on the street.

181
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,217
he had cut his ties from
his grandfather's world.

182
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,302
[Sugihara chuckles]

183
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:07,306
You think the Yakuza are the only ones
to use these dirty tricks?

184
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,810
Leveraging compromised behavior
is part of your world as well.

185
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
It's called human nature.

186
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,484
Who are you?

187
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,320
Really?

188
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,792
[in English] My Korean...
It is not nearly as fluent as yours.

189
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,796
The truth is, I can barely speak it.

190
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,466
[stammers, in Japanese] You're Zainichi?

191
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,761
Like your family,

192
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,890
my grandparents came over before the war.

193
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,351
But...

194
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,271
that is all we have in common.

195
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,567
Let me tell you.

196
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,738
I have known Yoshii-<i>san</i>
for many years now.

197
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,575
He is neither a fickle man nor a gambler.

198
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,663
Nor is he a man who abides
by chaos or uncertainty.

199
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,623
If he has doubts,

200
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,209
he will cut you loose.

201
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,460
And if

202
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,797
he feels compromised...

203
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,717
he will do much worse.

204
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,390
Yoshii-<i>san</i> wants that golf course.

205
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,150
[door opens, closes]

206
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,323
[beeping]

207
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,326
[reporter]
<i>Tsutomu Miyazaki was arrested last week</i>

208
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,329
<i>for the brutal murder of four young girls,</i>

209
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,874
<i>decapitating one of them.</i>

210
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,751
- [Naomi, on phone] <i>Hello.</i>
- [stammers] It's me.

211
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,046
Just calling to hear your voice.

212
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,882
I miss you.

213
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,258
<i>I miss you too.</i>

214
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:10,429
<i>But this filing, it's taking
much longer than anticipated.</i>

215
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,139
You need a break.

216
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,850
How about a quick dinner tonight?

217
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,769
<i>I'd love to,</i>

218
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,273
<i>but I have to wait
until everything gets printed.</i>

219
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,443
<i>But how about this weekend?</i>

220
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,612
- Let's do that then.
- [Naomi grunts]

221
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,156
<i>I have to get back to work.</i>

222
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,491
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

223
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,121
[slot machines rattling]

224
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,831
URGENT

225
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,917
CC INTERNATIONAL BANK

226
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,724
PAYMENT DEMAND. LATE PAYMENT FEES.

227
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,019
- [sighs]
- [Sunja, in English] Mozasu.

228
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,773
I brought you something to eat
from that noodle place you like.

229
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,608
Aren't you hungry? Please, eat.

230
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,776
[Mozasu sighs]

231
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,405
My stomach is still full.
I had a big lunch today.

232
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,366
I don't think I'll be hungry for days.

233
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,243
What did you have for lunch?

234
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,747
I went to a Mexican restaurant
with a friend.

235
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,208
A Mexican restaurant? You?

236
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,710
- Yes, me. I swear.
- [laughs]

237
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,127
Is it really that shocking?

238
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,089
Who is this friend?

239
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,679
A friend I met that I feed the birds with.

240
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,515
- You probably wouldn't understand.
- Birds?

241
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,979
What are you talking about?
[stammers] Are you seeing someone?

242
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,940
We met at the grocery store.

243
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,943
He's a very nice man, son.

244
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:52,322
But you really need to try
that Mexican restaurant.

245
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,199
The food was surprisingly spicy.

246
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,369
And try the margarita while you're there.
[gasps]

247
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,746
It was really strong, you know!

248
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,124
I'm going to go do the back now.

249
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,254
[Mozasu sighs]

250
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,428
[staff, in Japanese]
You can enter this way. Enter this way.

251
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,307
Don't push each other.

252
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,476
Stand in line.

253
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,482
[Sunja sighs, in English]
Where is he?

254
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,401
He should be here by now.

255
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:33,155
[Sunja's mother] Weren't you the one
saying there's nothing to do but wait?

256
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,745
He'll be here soon, alright?

257
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,000
[chattering in Japanese]

258
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,098
WASEDA UNIVERSITY
ACCEPTANCE LIST

259
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,480
[chattering continues]

260
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,211
[chattering fades]

261
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,797
[Mozasu, in English] Mother!

262
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,971
Hooray!

263
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,435
[Sunja's mother] There you are!

264
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,657
[laughs, sobs]

265
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,953
[Kyunghee] I'm so proud of you, Noa.

266
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,164
[Noa] And here's the list of classes
open to the first years.

267
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,709
- [Kyunghee] Why am I so nervous?
- [chuckles]

268
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,339
European and American history.
[chuckles] Theory of Government Bonds.

269
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,841
- British Romanticism...
- [Mozasu] Ugh!

270
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,467
[in Japanese]
Sounds like torture.

271
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,553
Are you sure you want to do this?

272
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,554
[chuckles]

273
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,764
[in English] Enough talking.
Just eat your food.

274
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,559
Nothing useful comes
out of that mouth anyways.

275
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,812
[in Japanese]
Maybe I should run away with you to Tokyo.

276
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:33,317
Even your boring classes
have to be better than all this abuse.

277
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,611
[in English]
What did you say? Huh?

278
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,572
Noa. What is it?

279
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,284
There's a summary of the other costs.

280
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,120
[gasps] What sort of costs?

281
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,372
Fees for entrance,

282
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,501
and for books, student activities,

283
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,629
experimental practice, equipment costs...

284
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,422
What's the total amount?

285
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,926
The total's about 2,400.

286
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,386
[inhales sharply]

287
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,848
Do you mean in addition
to tuition fees and board?

288
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,395
- [stutters] What do we do?
- [sighs]

289
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,775
Perhaps we could ask Mr. Koh
to help with it?

290
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,320
No. I can't accept
anyone else's money for it.

291
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,741
Noa. Don't worry, we'll pay it all back.

292
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,036
I'm sure there's
a telegraph office near school.

293
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,121
If there is, I can get a job there.

294
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,206
[Sunja] No.

295
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,668
I saw how hard it was for you
these past two years.

296
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,545
You're to focus on your studies.

297
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:38,215
- But, Mother, the fees...
- Noa! We'll figure out the money.

298
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,968
Without borrowing from Mr. Koh.

299
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,344
How will you?

300
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,972
[Sunja] You don't need
to concern yourself with that.

301
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,350
Eat your dinner before it gets cold.

302
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,271
Yes, let's eat. Come on. Here.

303
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,439
[Sunja]
Here, have this one.

304
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,581
SAKAI HANDMADE LEATHER GOODS

305
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,020
[elevator dings]

306
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:10,349
[sighs, chuckles]

307
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,224
[in Japanese] Good evening.

308
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,726
I'm not sure if I'm in the right place.

309
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,812
What is the guest's name?

310
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,774
Sir?

311
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,116
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

312
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,886
[no audible dialogue]

313
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,529
[patrons laugh]

314
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,872
[no audible dialogue]

315
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,712
[Sunja's mother, in English]
What are you doing?

316
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,339
Mother.

317
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,970
What's all this?

318
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:17,017
I remembered we had some sugar
from that deal a few months ago.

319
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,395
I thought, it should be enough
to make some candies.

320
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:24,274
If they sell well,
I can try to get some more sugar.

321
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,364
We could set up a second cart
closer to the bus stop.

322
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,117
There are so many young people
and families who take that line.

323
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,668
And what about your plans
for your restaurant?

324
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,385
Then we'll wait a couple years.

325
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,762
When Noa finishes school.

326
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:58,141
Yes, let's see about it then.

327
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,406
Mother.

328
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,283
Sleep. I can do this.

329
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,286
Goodness, do you really think
sleep will come now?

330
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,417
Hurry, bring that over.

331
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:30,757
[sizzling]

332
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:36,597
[Sunja, Sunja's mother speak indistinctly]

333
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,853
[informant, in Japanese] I swear,
if I had known that you knew none of this,

334
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,813
I would never have done this.

335
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,775
But we heard you and the family
were pulling out of the black markets.

336
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:50,903
From whom?

337
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,572
That's what everyone is saying. [gulps]

338
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,286
[Hansu] And this person
who is trying to take over,

339
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,704
what's his name?

340
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,541
[shudders]

341
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,379
You're scared of him? Hmm?

342
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,381
I've heard some things.

343
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,301
Please, I'd rather not get involved.

344
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,806
[grunting]

345
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:21,517
[whimpers]

346
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:22,935
Yoshii Isamu.

347
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,395
I swear that is all I know.

348
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,114
[Hansu]
You find out everything about this man.

349
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:40,035
I want no stone unturned.
I want everything.

350
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,248
[Hansu sighs]

351
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,437
[Solomon]
How long have you been seeing him?

352
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,398
[Naomi] That's not what it is.

353
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,692
[Solomon] Then what is it?

354
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,488
[Naomi] Our families have known
one another for a long time.

355
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:19,950
Since we were little,

356
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,787
our parents got it into their heads
that we'd be the perfect match.

357
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,331
[Solomon] Is that what he thinks?

358
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,711
[Naomi] He thinks
whatever his parents think.

359
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,716
And you?

360
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:41,305
There was a time
when I tried to convince myself.

361
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,851
But not anymore.

362
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,228
But you just...

363
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,523
You went along with it.

364
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,817
They're my parents.

365
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,360
What am I supposed to do?

366
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,948
I know I should've told you.

367
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,327
Yes, you should have.

368
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,212
Is there no way to save this?

369
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,007
[Solomon] Can you promise me

370
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,469
you'll never look away again?

371
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,471
Never again.

372
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,974
Can you do that?

373
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,102
I want to try.

374
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,149
That's not good enough.

375
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,907
In another world, perhaps.

376
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,076
Or if

377
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,286
you weren't you

378
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,665
and I wasn't me.

379
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,752
Isn't that the truth?

380
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,858
I need you...

381
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,030
to call in Abe-<i>san</i>'s loan.

382
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,867
Abe-<i>san</i>?

383
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,827
But why?

385
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,501
No.

386
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,045
The story about the buried bones,
did you leak that?

387
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,548
I never meant to drag you into this.

388
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,717
You have to believe me.

389
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,554
But now, it's not just about the money.

390
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,306
I need him to know.

391
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,891
[stammers] No.

392
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,976
I need everyone to know

393
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,853
that I'm here.

394
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,271
Even if you say so...

395
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,898
I have to ask. Please.

396
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,524
You can't ask me that!

397
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,113
Even if it destroys Abe-<i>san</i>, rumors about
what I did to him would spread.

398
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,865
The whole industry would know.

399
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,450
I'm sorry, but I cannot.

400
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,535
You know that.

401
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:17,127
Then, I'll find a way. You know I will.

402
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,880
And I will have

403
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,927
no choice but to stop you.

404
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,779

Look at your hand.

407
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,349
You need to rest.

[Yoseb breathing shakily]

409
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,211

You wanted to see me?

[Ryochi sighs]

412
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:01,982
Take this away.

413
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,117
What did the new doctor say?

414
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,912
I'm done with all that.

416
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,377
You and I,

417
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,297
we've always talked frankly,

418
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,090
haven't we?

419
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,259
[inhales sharply]

420
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:35,182
You were the one to teach me
the power of plain speaking.

421
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,310
I am grateful for that.

422
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,896
Yes.

423
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,275
Everyone talks too much these days.

424
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,029
They jabber on about this and that.

425
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,866
But the Americans will be gone soon.

426
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,703
And that's when your rising star
takes the stage.

427
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,289
Kurogane-<i>san</i>.

428
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,668
You've made it clear you don't like him.

429
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:06,129
But he understands the work
that needs to be done.

430
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,801
He's still young, but a promising man.

431
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,427
He is ambitious.

432
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,846
[sighs]

433
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,304
I think you are

434
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,308
confusing the two.

435
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,770
The party is still a fledgling.

436
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,482
Allegiances will shift.

437
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,483
Precisely.

438
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,237
All the more reason why...

439
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,577
I plan on sealing it with blood.

440
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,873
Even your loyalty

441
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,085
was bought the same way.

442
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,215
His willingness to accept Keiko,
despite her only being a half-blood,

443
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:55,637
it speaks to his confidence in our family.

444
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,054
I won't allow it.

445
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,141
She's my daughter!

446
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:06,148
It's too late to start acting
like your daughters' father.

447
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,441
[grunts]

448
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,153
We both know

449
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:15,866
there has only been that one son.

450
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:19,536
That hidden life.

451
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,206
Remember this.

452
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,459
For your sake,

453
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,005
I have never touched that family.

454
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:35,260
Do not make me consider otherwise.

455
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,572
[Noa, in English] Mother.

456

Noa.

457

Why are you down so early?

458
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,334
There's something I need to say to you.

459
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,962
What is it?

460
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,505
Are you not feeling well?

461
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,677
I'm not going to Waseda.

462
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,972
I told you not to worry about the money.

463
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,057
I'll take care of it.

464
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:23,976
I don't want it.

465
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,312
Not at the expense of your restaurant.

466
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,231
I won't do that.

467
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:33,527
Noa...

468
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:40,033
The restaurant...
It was just a fool's gamble.

469
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,286
I see that clearly now.

470
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,871
I don't believe you.

471
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,832
It's my duty.
I have a responsibility to this family...

472
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,668
How is going to university
not fulfilling your duty?

473
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:52,754
Noa.

474
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,799
This isn't for you alone.

475
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,094
This is an opportunity for us all.

Think how many years I'll be gone.

477
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,183
We've been through so much already...

478
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:05,726
I can't bear it.

479
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,104
Leaving you to carry all that weight...

480
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,439
That's enough.

481
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,193
Your grandmother is with me,
as well as your aunt.

00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:21,074
- I can feel your disappointment...
- I'm disappointed for you!

483
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,993
You deserve better than this.

484
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,329
And I'll get over it.

485
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,291
This is my home, Mother.

486
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,919
I need to stay here.

He's worried about the costs,
and leaving us here...

00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,228
[Hansu] What are you talking about?

492
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,898
Going to Waseda is not a choice.

493
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,691

You don't think I've tried already?

He won't change his mind.

497
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,245
Because that boy doesn't understand.

498
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:10,207
All those years we barely had food
in our stomachs were for this.

It is time for you to pry his eyes open.

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,898
Make him see
what this world really looks like.

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,920
[announcer speaking Japanese]

538
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,763
[in English] Ever since
you brought that tofu home,

539
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:53,680
I've been curious.

540
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,766
I want to see how they make it.

541
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,609
Ma'am!

542
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,697
[chuckles] I've been meaning to come by.

543
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,282
I hear Noa comes here often.

544
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,369
Let me prepare two plates.

545
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,704
No rush. Do not trouble yourself.

546
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,791
It's no trouble at all. Not at all.

547
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,752
- Please, have a seat.
- Alright.

548
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,514
Mother, why have you brought me here?

549
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:41,562
So I could see for myself
what else you could be considering.

550
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,899
[scoffs] It's not like that.

551
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,444
[Sunja] Look at those hands.

552
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,240
Still so soft and smooth.

553
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,293
When I look at her,

554
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,837
it reminds me
of my early days living here.

555
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,132
I never thought I'd be here this long.

556
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,345
At the time,
your father asked me to join him here.

557
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,514
We were little more
than strangers, really.

558
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:22,311
When we came over,
we both knew so little of the world.

559
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,314
Me especially.

560
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,108
Yeongdo was my world back then.

561
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:35,699
So when your father
started teaching me all about his faith...

562
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,702
I remember it all sounded so strange.

563
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,916
In the beginning,
I struggled with so much of it.

564
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:52,633
But then, he told me about Heaven.

565
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,929
And it all made sense to me.

566
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,475
When I...

567
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:07,731
When I think of Heaven, I see my Yeongdo.

568
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:13,862
I don't know what your Heaven is, Noa.
But what I know is...

569
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,823
This is not it.

570
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,409
If you decide to stay...

571
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,875
I know that you will just sit here
and the memories will burn in your soul.

572
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,421
I can never let that happen

573
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:34,091
because I made a promise to your father.

574
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,013
That no matter what,

575
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,685
I see to it that
you and your brother thrive.

576
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,278
I intend on keeping that promise.

577
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,869
I'm sorry for the wait.

578
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,162
[chuckles]

579
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,499
I hope you like it.

580
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,252
Okay, let me try. [chuckles]

581
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:14,965
Mmm. It's delicious.

582
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:17,759
I can taste all the work
that has gone into it.

583
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:18,844
Thank you.

584
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:24,391
Surely in Tokyo,
the tofu will taste better.

585
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,018
It's such a big city after all.

586
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:34,067
But I hope you remember us
when you have that tofu.

587
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:39,573
I can't imagine how it can
possibly be as good as this.

588
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,744
So when I'm there...

589
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,039
I know I will miss this.

590
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,571
