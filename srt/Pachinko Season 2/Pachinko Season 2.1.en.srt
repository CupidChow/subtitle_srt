or the Americans?

It's still not clear.

12
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,962
I need you to stay behind.

00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,098
If you don't like it,

181
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,102
then my advice is don't be Korean, Noa.

182
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,315
[chuckles]
Even if only in your imagination.

183
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:02,152
[whistling hymn]

184
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,080
[opera music playing]

185
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,374
[guests, in Japanese] Cheers!

186
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,751
I hope you are satisfied now.

187
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,672
With our major contribution
of military supplies.

188
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,550
Yes. Everyone is pleased.

189
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,302
Does this mean

190
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,305
in our next contracts,

191
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,932
our loyalties will be rewarded?

192
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,934
If we don't,

193
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,477
we risk displeasing you, Koh-san.

194
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,021
When you are displeased,

195
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,067
It seems everyone
in Osaka knows what happens.

196
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,777
Speaking for myself,

197
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,113
I prefer to keep all of my limbs.

198
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,449
[guests chuckle]

199
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,452
Rather than worry
about pleasing my son-in-law,

200
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,830
let us all enjoy ourselves.

201
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,876
After all, his generosity is
just as well-known.

202
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,793
Please, enjoy.

203
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,672
Inoue-san.

204
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,925
We have all this rice
piled up in our colonies,

205
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,511
but it's impossible
to get it shipped to us now.

206
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,429
Yes.

207
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,308
I say we strap the rice on the back
of the Koreans, make them swim it over.

208
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,396
Serve those lazy cockroaches right.
[laughs]

209
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,617
Go and see where those two guests are.

210
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,162
They've been gone too long.

211
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,543
- [speaks Japanese]
- [all speak Japanese]

212
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,630
[guest 1] So it's happening then?

213
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,840
[guest 2] It's not confirmed yet.

214
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,760
But some messages have been intercepted.

215
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,347
There are whispers
that the bombings are imminent.

216
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,681
[guest 1] Imminent?

217
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,683
[guest 2] Within days.

218
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,521
Quickly get your family out of the city.

219
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,652
I've already sent mine to the country.
I'm following in the morning.

220
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,659
[guest 1] But first, we can't leave
without eating all that splendid food.

221
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,494
That Koh-san is impressive.

222
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,830
How he manages to find all that food.

223
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,291
[guest 2 laughs]

224
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,385
[Tetsuya]
You really kicked the hornet's nest.

225
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,595
Abe-san is on the warpath.

226
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,889
Believe me, I feel it.

227
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,600
Tonight is his big award ceremony.

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,644
Japan's Businessman of the Year.

229
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:41,937
It's quite the honor.

230
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,566
- Give him my best.
- [chuckles]

231
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,734
[grunts]

232
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,952
[grunts] So, tell me honestly.

233
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,620
How much of the fund have you raised?

234
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,790
[sighs, clears throat]

235
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,625
No way. Zero?

236
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,046
- Zero.
- [chef] Yellowtail.

237
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,261
You should have asked me.

238
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,763
[chuckles] What are you talking about?

239
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,307
I don't want your pity.

240
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,601
I want to help you.

241
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:22,936
You serious?

242
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,774
And to think I was once jealous of you.

243
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,112
You don't need to
open old wounds, Tetsuya.

244
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,655
I realize it's petty of me.

245
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,783
That was always your specialty,
being petty.

246
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,538
[Tetsuya] 200 million.

247
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,918
After all, you're my oldest friend.

248
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,128
I still remember

249
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,717
when I was transferred to the school,
you were good to me.

250
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,136
You could've been cruel

251
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,597
like the rest of them.

252
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,850
The new kid is always an easy target.

253
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,269
But you...

254
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,648
[sighs]

255
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,942
You never played that game.

256
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,443
It's a stupid game.

257
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,612
So it is.

258
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,245
Thank you.

259
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,247
[chef] Abalone.

260
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,133
[leader] Ready?

261
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,679
One!

262
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,141
Two!

263
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,770
- Three!
- [class exclaims]

264
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,440
When those American bastards
set foot on our soil,

265
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,360
we can't allow them to ransack
and desecrate our great empire,

266
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,320
turning it into a sea of flames!

267
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,281
So we have no choice.

268
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,075
We'll take a stand
against those devils, won't we?

269
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,494
[clicks tongue]

270
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,922
- [growls]
- You're doing very well, young one.

271
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,007
[chuckles]

272
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,760
Now, everyone listen carefully.

273
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,432
When we attack today,
don't stab at a straw dummy.

274
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,393
It's our enemy that you're attacking!

275
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,479
Those bastards will send our houses
up in flames.

276
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,107
They'll steal away our children,

277
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:37,571
and God only knows
what other horrors they'll subject us to!

278
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,740
So ask yourselves the simple question,

279
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,744
when you see those savages,
will you let them come for you?

280
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,120
[class] No, sir!

281
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:49,708
Are you going to just let them
tear your family apart?

282
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,959
[class] No, sir!

283
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,545
Get ready! Charge!

284
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,465
Ready? Charge!

285
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,674
[grunting]

286
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,139
Why are you destroying it?
We won't be able to use it again.

287
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,766
Mama, that's the point!

288
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:09,603
Take the enemy down
so they won't get up ever again.

289
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,607
Away you go.

290
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,443
- [leader continues shouting]
- [baby crying]

291
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,244
[leader]
Concentrate I said! Concentrate!

292
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,663
[class grunting]

293
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,669
The truth is, I was curious about you.

294
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:40,551
I wonder how you're doing,
whether you have it good or not.

295
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,428
[children speaking outside]

296
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,181
You married a pastor, isn't that right?

297
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,558
The sickly one.

298
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,228
Well, he recovered from his illness.

299
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,940
We had some good years together.

300
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,110
And then,

301
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,447
one day, the police took him.

302
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,408
Really, for what?

303
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,036
For helping the laborers
fight for better wages.

304
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,959
That happened seven years ago.

305
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,627
[Jiyun sighs]

306
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,506
So then how are you managing?

307
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:24,052
Truthfully, I still consider myself lucky.

308
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,013
I have my brother-in-law.

309
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:31,018
He was drafted to work in
a munitions factory in Nagasaki last year.

310
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,356
The financial support he sent us
was a godsend,

311
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,360
but lately, they've been paying him
in promissory notes.

312
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,282
I only have one more batch of kimchi left.
After that, I'm not sure.

313
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,366
[clicks tongue]

314
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,205
Then there's my mother.

315
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,374
Why? Has something happened to her?

316
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,753
It's been three months
since she wrote a letter.

317
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,089
My mother...

318
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,761
She has no one.

319
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,725
It's a struggle, isn't it?

320
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,772
Even so,
I keep smiling in spite of it all.

321
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,693
I have to smile, or my children,

322
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,072
they will only see a mother's tears.

323
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,574
I do not want that.

324
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,706
Listen, Sunja.

325
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:45,592
I heard a few women here make rice wine
to sell at the black markets.

326
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,553
You and I could--

327
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,721
But isn't that illegal?

328
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,182
You said so yourself.

329
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,352
You have just one batch of kimchi to sell.

330
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,398
And no one can afford to pay me
for their laundry.

331
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,280
Sunja, I'm...

332
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,618
I'm so desperate now.

333
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,126
Don't get me wrong, alright?

334
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,172
I am not judging you,

335
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,756
it's a tough situation--

336
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,133
Never you mind.

337
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,895
Your boys are growing up so well.

338
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,230
[sniffling]

339
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,000
GRAND OPENING

340
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,048
[machines chiming]

341
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,767
Grandma!

342
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,602
Look who's here!

343
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,480
At least you arrived before the opening.

344
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,275
Solomon, you could've ironed it.

345
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,113
- And you wonder why I worry.
- [chuckles]

346
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,032
- [Mozasu] Solomon!
- Dad!

347
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,577
- [in Japanese] How do I look?
- [exclaims] You look sharp!

348
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,829
You both do!

349
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,206
Don't we?

350
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,959
Shiny new business with shiny owners.

351
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,460
Perfect, right?

352
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,212
Congratulations.

353
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,216
[Mozasu] Somehow, it all worked out.
I'm relieved.

354
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,970
So, how's the fundraising going?

355
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,098
I just caught a big fish today.

356
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,433
Remember Tetsuya?

357
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,021
That crybaby who was always
picking his nose?

358
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,649
He doesn't pick his nose anymore.

359
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,235
He just proved he's a true friend.

360
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,446
For someone like him to invest,
it makes it all real.

361
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,282
Is that so?

362
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,325
Look.

363
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,829
Your grandmother and I have been talking.

364
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,373
We don't want

365
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,878
to miss out on a real gold rush.

366
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,470
- [Sunja grunts]
- What is this?

367
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,930
[Mozasu] Just open it.

368
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,313
$700,000

369
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,944
Where'd you get this kind of money?

370
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,615
I took out a mortgage
with this place as collateral.

371
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,158
You took on

372
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,077
more debt then?

373
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,496
What does it matter?

374
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,917
The banks are practically
giving money away these days.

375
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,585
The interest is almost nothing.

376
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:08,962
But...

377
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,839
it's still a debt.

378
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,090
[Mozasu] What is this?

379
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,552
We do this for you
and all you do is complain?

380
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,346
It's not that.

381
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,892
But if anything were to happen--
If I were to fail, this money--

382
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,977
You are my son.

383
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,899
If I can't believe in you,

384
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,402
then who will?

385
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,781
Just do your best.

386
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,951
Don't worry. You'll do well.

387
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,039
[teacher, in Japanese]
Tanaka Akio. Yoshida Isamu.

388
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,459
In second place, Nakamura Minoru.

389
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,462
And in first place...

390
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,465
Bando Nobuo.

391
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,598
We will pick up
where we left off last week.

392
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,934
[school bell rings]

393
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,700
Bando.

394
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,327
A word.

395
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,425
What book are you are reading in class?

396
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,846
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

397
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,848
An American book?

398
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,350
You know it is forbidden.

399
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,353
I am sorry.

400
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,525
Try putting some effort into your work.

401
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,110
Your mind...

402
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,779
it can open many doors for you.

403
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,823
What kind of doors?

404
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,202
A chance to escape these wretched slums.

405
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,245
University, perhaps.

406
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,415
I went to Waseda in Tokyo--

407
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:10,209
But I don't want to get out.

408
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,793
I want to stay here.

409
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,129
Become a pastor.

410
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,632
[sighs]

411
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,012
I hear your father is no longer at home.

412
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,222
He's coming back.

413
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,307
Excuse me?

414
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:27,893
My father...

415
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,103
He's coming home.

416
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,148
That's why I need to be here.

417
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,443
And what if

418
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,612
he doesn't?

419
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,822
I told you.

420
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,324
I won't leave.

421
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,045
[sighs]

422
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:57,798
Here.

423
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,344
I don't need it anymore.

424
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,680
WASEDA UNIVERSITY
ENTRANCE EXAM PRACTICE TESTS

425
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,098
But I'm not...

426
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,017
You know.

427
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,812
I know what you are.

428
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,399
Noa Baek.

429
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,375
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO
OGAWA EIICHI (GO YOUNG HO)

430
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:51,351
[grunts]

431
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,272
[Kyunghee] It's bootlegging.

432
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,858
[Sunja]
But, Kyunghee, what choice do we have?

433
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,195
Our savings are gone,
and there's no money coming in.

434
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,906
Sunja,
if anything were to happen to you...

435
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,115
I'll be careful.

436
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:10,078
I heard that the Economic Police
have informants there.

437
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,539
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous!

438
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,416
I won't allow it.

439
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,128
- Should we starve to death then?
- [sighs] Sunja!

440
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,631
Do you know who does those things?

441
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,965
Hungry people.

442
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,719
Parents trying to feed hungry children.

443
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:30,807
Kyunghee...

444
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,354
I heard Mozasu's stomach growling.

445
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,858
It was very loud last night
while he was sleeping.

446
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,490
Our children also have empty bellies.

447
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:51,995
[sighs]

448
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,333
Do you think I'm not aware of that?

449
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,587
A couple days ago,

450
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,675
I found maggots
living in the ration rice. Maggots!

451
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,098
And what's even worse is that

452
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:17,229
I considered leaving them, with the hope
that it could fill their bellies.

453
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,942
There would be no shame if you did.

454
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,779
Fortunately, we're not there yet.

455
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,450
Kyunghee.

456
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:37,082
Until that time, shouldn't we try to avoid
feeding our children worms?

457
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,166
[sighs]

458
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,008
Promise me one thing.

459
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,680
Every night, you must come home to us.

460
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,435
You know I will.

461
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,146
You know that I will.

462
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:41,396
[siren blaring]

463
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,815
[Sunja] It's just a practice drill.
Let's keep working.

464
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,030
[pachinko parlor guests
chuckling, chattering]

465
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,653
- [bang, muffled]
- [shouting inside]

466
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,865
[baby crying]

467
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,076
You better go.

468
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,620
Don't worry about it.

469
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,079
I'll take care of this.

470
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,165
I'm sorry to make you go alone.

471
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,709
It's fine. I'm good at selling.

472
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,629
But hurry now
before your husband gets angrier.

473
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,380
[husband shouting]

474
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,632
[sighs]

475
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,093
Don't forget.

476
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,846
Show only your smiles.

477
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,311
[shouting continues]

478
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,897
[Jiyun screams, crying]

479
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,284
[in Japanese] Solomon?
- Oh, Tetsuya.

480
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,245
I'm in Osaka now. What is it?

481
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,121
Abe- san...

482
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,793
He heard about my investments.

483
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,088
[stammers] But--

484
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,257
He's threatening to destroy us both.

485
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,384
He claims you're conning me.

486
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,553
What are you saying, Tetsuya?

487
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,471
[Tetsuya sighs]

488
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,598
I'm sorry. I can't.

489
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:23,892
Solomon?

490
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,479
- Are you still there?
- Don't worry.

491
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,606
I understand.

492
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,608
I'm sorry, Solomon.

493
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,943
I know.

494
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:34,987
[Tetsuya speaks Japanese]

495
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,494
Solomon. What are you doing there?

496
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,538
Let's go to the store.

497
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,917
- What?
- The grocery store, come along.

498
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,544
The cake will be ready now.

499
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,462
We need some cups too.

500
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,257
I told your father
not to serve grape juice.

501
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,638
Why are you just standing there?

502
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,515
[in Japanese] I'm going.

503
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,627
- [melody plays over intercom]
- [groans]

504
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,713
[employee speaking Japanese over intercom]

505
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,810
[Sunja, employee 2 speaking in Japanese]

506
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,532
[employee 2] Maybe the person who
took your order couldn't understand you.

507
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,284
[Sunja] They couldn't understand "50"?

508
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,203
[in English]
Grandma, what's going on?

509
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:10,666
I ordered a cake for 50 people,
and this is what I got.

510
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,919
[in Japanese] Isn't this your mistake?

511
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:17,381
Listen, this is a custom order.

512
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,341
It's written here.

513
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,426
But this isn't what we ordered.

514
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,638
In any case,

515
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:28,225
don't blame me for not understanding
half-assed Japanese.

516
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,518
Half-assed?

517
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:33,146
I'm just saying,
if you're going to live in this country,

518
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,192
you should learn our language properly.

519
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,113
[in English]
Let's just go.

520
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,575
[in Japanese]
This isn't about the cake, is it?

521
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,702
I don't know what you're implying,

522
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,955
but if you don't like our service,
please take your business elsewhere.

523
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:50,956
[in English]
Solomon, don't.

524
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,209
[in Japanese] There are stores
for people like you, isn't that so?

525
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,712
What did you just say?

526
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,463
[grunts]

527
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,676
[Solomon] Don't walk away.
I asked you a question.

528
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,804
Who the hell do you think you are? Huh?

529
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,350
I was born here, just like you.

530
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,103
I went to Yale University.

531
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,188
You get it?

532
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,983
I made your monthly salary
in a single day!

533
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:21,820
You are in no fucking position
to put us down! You idiot!

534
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,905
Solomon!

535
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,784
[panting]

536
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,222
[banging on door]

537
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,599
[Jiyun] Anyone home? Please open the door!

538
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,767
[sobs]

539
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,853
The police raided the black market.

540
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,316
Sunja didn't make it out.

541
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,111
- She was arrested! They took her!
- What are you saying?

542
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,489
Where is she now?

543
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:08,033
Where have they taken her?

544
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,869
- [sighs]
- [Jiyun crying]

545
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,084
[inmate]
Let's hope we get the older judge.

546
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:19,628
At least he's fair.

547
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,549
Just hope we don't get the younger one.

548
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,801
That man is cruel.

549
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,872
[guests cheer]

550
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:15,684
Solomon.

551
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,104
What was that? You scared me earlier.

552
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,108
I'm sorry I scared you.

553
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,402
But, Grandma...

554
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,991
It's just too...

555
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,077
It's just become too hard.

556
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,999
I can't do this anymore.

557
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:41,043
I...

558
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:46,173
I can't live always feeling sorry for you.

559
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,217
I can't do it anymore.

560
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:32,052
Time to wake up.

561
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,100
Auntie, what did the police say?

562
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:45,941
Oh, no news yet, I'm afraid.
But the officer promised to look into it.

563
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,283
Could we stay home today?

564
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,618
I'd like to wait here with you.

565
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,249
Your mother would want you both
to go to school.

566
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,168
You know that.

567
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,467
[chuckles]

568
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,728
[in Japanese] Mozasu, wake up.

569
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,439
[Mozasu groans]

570
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,523
[door closes]

571
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,444
[inmate] He's coming. Brace yourself.

572
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,820
What's happening?

573
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,488
He's here.

574
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,959
[in Japanese] Name?

575
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,544
Ryu Kimiko.

576
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,715
[judge] Your third offense.
[scoffs] I see.

577
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,551
[Kimiko]
He tried to run off without paying me!

578
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,053
[judge] Two months' sentence.

579
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,179
[Kimiko] Two months?

580
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,600
- [judge] Name?
- Hayashi Asuka.

581
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,019
[judge]
First offense. Three weeks' sentence.

582
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,729
[Asuka sobbing]

583
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,481
[judge] Name?

584
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:11,985
Bando Nobuko.

585
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:14,947
Oh...

586
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,367
It's you.

587
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:25,165
You may go.

588
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,762
Don't count on your luck next time.

589
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,143
Remember that.

590
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,026
Next.

591
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,237
Name?

592
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,906
[applause]

593
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:03,662
[Abe clears throat]

594
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:09,877
It's a great honor to accept this award.

595
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:13,255
I am humbled

596
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:18,385
to think I have done
anything worthy of such a tribute

597
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:22,890
from so many of my fellow countrymen
whom I admire.

598
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:28,103
[sighs]

599
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,069
[clears throat]

600
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,489
As I was saying,

601
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,243
it's an honor to receive this award.

602
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:48,290
Thinking back on
what we had to overcome to be here today.

603
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,294
A nation once reduced to burned-out ruins.

604
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,463
But from those ashes,

605
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,424
we rose...

606
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,057
Mr. Kim.

607
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,144
I went to the station,

608
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,563
but they said you were already released.

609
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:13,941
But...

610
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,443
how did you know I was in prison?

611
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:19,571
Get into the car.

612
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,826
You want me to get in that car with you?

613
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,788
Where would you take me?

614
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,874
I am not at liberty to say.

615
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,028
[American jazz playing faintly]

616
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:18,398
[footsteps approaching]

617
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:22,027
[gasps]

618
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,786
A mineral found
in the bowels of the earth.

619
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,455
It's called tungsten.

620
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,166
Once processed,
it's resistant to corrosion.

621
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,628
Useful for building airplanes,

622
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,131
missiles and grenades,
as well as other uses.

623
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:45,926
This makes the war possible.

624
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,893
How did you find me?

625
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,732
I didn't have to look for you.
I never lost you, Sunja.

626
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:04,278
Mr. Kim.

627
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:05,946
He works for me.

628
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:10,909
I tasked him years ago
to watch over you and the kids.

629
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,536
Noa specially.

630
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,667
He's a clever boy,

631
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,670
but he's not applying himself.

632
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:25,674
[sighs]

633
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:29,553
What is it that you want?

634
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,475
The bombs are on their way.

635
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,811
It's what they've said for years.

636
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,313
It's real this time.

637
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,982
And it'll happen soon.

638
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,652
Not just smaller bombs
targeting the factories.

639
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,738
They'll carpet-bomb the entire city.

640
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,949
The Americans want
all we've built to burn.

641
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,493
How can you be so sure?

642
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,333
How did I know you were making rice wine?

643
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:04,838
Or that Noa's teacher is Korean
and he pretends otherwise?

644
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,217
It's my job to know what others do not.

645
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,303
It's how I learned
to survive through it all.

646
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,679
Now you must do the same.

647
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,600
I've arranged for you, your sister-in-law

648
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,727
and the two boys
to shelter in the countryside.

649
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,231
I won't leave my husband to rot in jail.

650
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:23,690
Do you understand what I am saying?

651
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:28,487
The Americans are sending in
their planes to destroy this city!

652
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,365
Everything you know will be gone.

653
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,451
You pretend to know what that reality is.

654
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,454
No.

655
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:39,665
You don't.

656
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,084
I do.

657
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:43,961
But as I explained,

658
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:46,755
it's impossible.

659
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:52,427
You would risk your children's lives,
all for some imbecile who got arrested?

660
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:54,304
I'm not going to leave him behind.

661
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,307
I won't.

662
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:04,147
You...

663
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:09,236
You actually care about him, Sunja.

664
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,990
Don't you?

665
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:57,993
Subtitling: DUBBING BROTHERS
