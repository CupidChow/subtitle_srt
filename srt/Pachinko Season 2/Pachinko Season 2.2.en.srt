[child, in Japanese] Ready?

00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,910
- Here we go.
- [speaks Japanese]

5
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,500
I've got this, but stay close.

There'll be no room on the train.

00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,019
[Mozasu] Get them!

[children exclaiming, chuckling]

11
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,274

[children exclaiming]

18
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,859
[child] But I aimed for your heart,
and I got you on the first shot!

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,363
- [child 2] Yeah, I saw it!
- The hell! We blew you to bits first!

20
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,325
And it's my turn to wear the gas mask.

21
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,534
Hand it over!

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,411
[Mozasu] It's that man again.

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,007
[child] That's my house.

24
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,053

26
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,765

[crying]

28
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,903
I'm going home.

29
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,863
You guys as well.

[metal creaking]

31
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,124
His father's body...

32
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,336
Will they ever get it back?

33
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,884
I think it depends on
how much of the body is left.

34
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,850
But, Mozasu,

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,852
remember what Pastor Hu says.

36
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,062
God is watching over us.

37
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,147
You believe that, don't you?

38
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,110
[bystander] Look who it is. [chuckles]

39
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,445
Bando!

Mozasu.

45
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,885
Come help me with the laundry.

46
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,098
Why do you always only call on me, Auntie?

47
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,058
[in Japanese] Never Noa!

48
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,186
[in English]
Because all you do is play around.

49
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,729
Now hurry! [chuckles]

Noa, is that you?

[Kyunghee] Noa.

What is this? Who is he?

67
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,140
I think...

68
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,726

What are you doing here?

90
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,904
I came to beg for mercy.

91
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,953
Tell me, what can I do?

[Abe grunts]

93
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,629
Perhaps you and I are two of a kind.

Both your father and mine

96
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,602
And like you, when anyone stood in my way,

97
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:44,024
I dug in and worked harder, dirtier.

98
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,445
I had to prove to the world

99
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,534
that I was not an inconsequential man.

100
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,036
And now?

I knew you'd get in my way.

108
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,522
Your failure is now on me.

109
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,319
So there will be no mercy.

110
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:36,243
Because I'm using you
to send a message to this town.

111

[in English]
It's me.

124
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,382
It's me.

125
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,426
[grunts] Sunja. [gasps]

126
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,637

Every day and every night
I have prayed for you.

132
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,197
It must've been so hard for you.

133
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,454
When compared to many others,
we were lucky.

134
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,584
I am so grateful to your brother
and sister-in-law.

135
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,587
They have been very good to us.

136
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,046
They tell me...

137
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,009
that my brother has gone away, far away.

138
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,512
I so much...

139
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,724
want to be with him again.

140
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,808

I don't want you to see me like this.

You or the boys. [crying]

145
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,287
[Sunja] Why worry about such a thing?

146
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,708
Now you must regain your strength.

147
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,379
Yes.

148
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,590
It is so tiring.

[breathing shakily]

150
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,180
[Sunja] Get some sleep.

[breathes heavily]

154
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,404
[Sunja]
You rest now. I'll go fetch the doctor.

155
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,907
You'll get better in no time.

156
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,746
[breathing heavily]

157
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,473
[Sunja]
He needs to see a doctor right away.

158
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,268
[Kyunghee]
But where are we supposed to find one?

159
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,354
From what I understand,
they've all been sent to the front lines...

160
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,189
There must be some at the hospitals.

161
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,316
We must find one.

162
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,195
[gasps] Sunja!

163
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,323
[panting]

164
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,452
What if...

165
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,247
What if it's too late?

166
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,125
Shouldn't you be at his side?

167
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,129
You can't be certain
how much longer you'll be together.

168
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:02,384
Kyunghee, have you already forgotten?

169
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,888
He has beaten death before.

170
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,475
If he can get a doctor's care,
he can beat it again.

171
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,020
I know it.

172
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,282
- [knocking on door]
- [dog barking]

173
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,209
[Geumja] You again! Why are you here?

174
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,336
Do you know what time it is?

[Solomon] I have nowhere else to go.

178
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,384
No one else to turn to.

I need to tell you something first.

182

00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,300
You...

185
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,138
You were going to sign and I advised
you not to, so Shiffley's fired me.

186
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,933
Because of that, my visa was revoked.

187
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,227
And so now I'm stuck here.

188
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,522
Not only that, Abe-<i>san</i> is making...

189
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,983
Enough. What about my house?

190
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,574
I had an arrangement with someone.

191
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,617
He had a plan.

192
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,162
He used his connections
to try to force you to leave.

193
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,917
We would buy this plot
as soon as you were gone,

194
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,338
then sell it to Shiffley's
and to Abe-<i>san</i> afterward.

195
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,967
I was relying on that money to get by.

196
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,430
- I was desperate...
- That's a poor excuse, wouldn't you say?

197
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,936
But isn't that how it goes, <i>Halmoni</i>?

198
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,440
We all turn on each other

199
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,526
for the sake of our own survival,

200
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,779
because we don't see
we're doing their work.

201
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,992
It's the same story.
This is what they want.

202
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,453
Forcing us to beg for mercy.

203
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,754
You got it.

204
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,007
You finally figured it out.

205
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,732
[Isak mumbling]

206
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,817
[indistinct chatter on radio]

207
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,829
[speaks Japanese]

208
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,666
[gasps]

209
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,585
It's me, Dad.

210
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,546
Noa.

211
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,008
[grunting]

212
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,388
[strains]

213
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,100
[panting]

214
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,646
Noa... [panting] Go and get Sexton Hu.

215
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,315
[Noa] He's our pastor now.

216
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,527
Pastor?

217
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:53,240
Yes. Pastor Yoo has passed on.
He died a few years ago.

218
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,286
[Isak] I see. [grunts]

219
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,333
Go on.

220
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,337
Bring me Pastor Hu. [gasps]

221
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,924
Quickly. Can you do that?

222
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,427
- Noa?
- Yes.

223
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,601
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

224
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,688
[Kyunghee]
Noa, run to the telegram office.

225
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,566
We must get a message
to your uncle right away.

226
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,483
Auntie...

227
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,321
But I...
Father asked me to bring him Pastor Hu.

228
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
I see.

229
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,702
He must want to pray together.

230
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,746
- OK. Go get him then.
- Yes.

231
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,916
What about me?
I can go to the telegram office.

232
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,756
This is important, you know that?

233
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,299
I can do it.

234
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,718
I can make sure the message gets to Uncle.

235
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,556
[coins jingle]

236
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,746
- [workers chattering]
- [telegraphs beeping]

237
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,462
[in Japanese] Excuse me, I need to send
a telegram to my uncle in Nagasaki.

238
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,382
It's very important.

239
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,015
[clerk] Can you read it?

240
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,526
Twenty-one characters.

241
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,610
Eighty sen.

242
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,034
Check the text to make sure it is correct.

243
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,250
<i>Isak has come home.</i>

244
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,294
<i>He is dying.</i>

245
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,473
- [bell dings]
- [panting]

246
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,975
[Noa, in English]
Pastor! He's back!

247
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,351
Noa.

248
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:30,314
After all these years,
my father has finally come home.

249
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,442
But he's fallen gravely ill.

250
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,156
Please help him. I know you can.

251
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,242
Would you please excuse us for a moment?

252
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,368
Yes.

253
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,330
[Noa] My father's finally come back.

254
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,874
Please, come with me.

255
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,792
Pray together for his health.

256
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,045
Ask God to make him better.

257
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,048
I don't think my prayers are enough.

258
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,009
But I'm sure
your prayers will be answered by the lord.

259
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,554
Noa, you know it's not that simple.

260
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,972
But it has to be!

261
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,229
I always have good intentions.

262
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,272
Am I good?

263
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,526
I've tried so hard to be good.

264
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,614
We must ask the Lord
not to turn his back on us.

265
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,618
Not this time.

266
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,792
I'll grab my things.

267
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,588
[door opens]

268
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,727
[Sunja] He needs a doctor.

269
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,022
That's why I'm here.

270
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,817
[Hansu]
Your priority is to get out of the city.

271
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,112
You didn't even have to ask
who needs a doctor.

272
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,321
You knew.

273
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,907
So tell me.

274
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,203
Was it possible
to have gotten him out earlier?

275
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,041
I made a promise to a prison official.

276
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,336
Safe passage out of the city
for him and his family.

277
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,880
That's how I got Isak released.

278
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,300
Everybody is clamoring to get out of here.

279
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,343
Except you, that is.

280
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,389
[chuckles]

281
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,892
You must be very desperate,

282
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,935
coming to see me.

283
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:33,687
I am.

284
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,196
[sighs]

285
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,324
I'll make you a deal.

286
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,951
I'll get you a doctor.

287
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,370
The best the city has left.

288
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,538
And you,

289
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,210
you and the boys must come with me.

290
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,005
With or without him.

291
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,425
Promise me.

292
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,691
- [indistinct chatter on radio]
- [breathing shakily]

293
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,740
[dish clinking]

294
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,242
[Isak coughing]

295
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:52,933
[chuckles] How easy it is to forget
how hard those years were.

296
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,060
But now look.

297
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:56,937
[chuckles]

298
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,858
After the war ended,
when I bought this plot,

299
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,902
they were practically giving it away.

300
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,863
- [chuckles]
- Huh?

301
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,781
I'm not kidding.

302
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,492
How else could I have afforded this?

303
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:13,453
I wonder why.

304
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,749
There were always strange rumors
about this land.

305
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,420
- What kind of rumors?
- [dog barking]

306
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,883
Such is my fate,
I must feed another mouth. [grunts]

307
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,553
That stomach is a bottomless pit. [sighs]

308
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,684
<i>Halmoni</i>, wait. What kind of rumors?

309
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,812
It was long ago,
I don't recall the details.

310
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,816
Something about a military school
that used to be here.

311
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,778
One day, the trucks started coming.

312
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,281
Loaded with corpses.

313
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:56,747
Why would they bring corpses
to a military school?

314
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,665
Who knows?

315
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:03,045
It was during the war
so no one questioned them at all.

316
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,090
Is that all?
That was the extent of the rumors then?

317
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,136
Don't eat it so fast,
you'll get sick again.

318
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,347
- <i>Halmoni.</i>
- What is it?

319
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,432
You still have more questions?

320
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,059
I told you everything!

321
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,478
It's been years since then.

322
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:23,065
Disturbing the dead...
What's the point of that?

323
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,361
[sighs]

324
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,033
But...

325
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,118
could those bones still be here?

326
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:42,835
<i>Halmoni.</i>

327
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,341
I had to forget it all.

328
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,261
You understand?

329
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,430
I work so hard to forget.

330
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,600
How else could I possibly live here?

331
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,897
But those bones might give us something.

332
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,192
What are you saying?

333
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,112
Don't you see?

334
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,364
This is how we fight back.

335
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,119
This information,
it could be useful to us.

336
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,247
We can stop them from coming after us.

337
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,463
[Mozasu]
See! When he was a little older than me,

338
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,967
he broke a record for doing push-ups
in his neighborhood.

339
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,428
And I bet he's really super rich now.

340
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,721
And...

341
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,975
for you, is it important to be rich?

342
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,060
Well of course!

343
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,940
If we were rich, I would get
the best doctors in town for you.

344
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,276
We'd live in a bigger house.

345
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,905
And if by chance
we still have some money left,

346
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:58,368
Auntie can buy sugar from the black
market and make sugar candies again.

347
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,246
[chokes, coughs]

348
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,956
Oh, Isak.

349
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,959
Are you okay?

350
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,795
[sighing] Yes.

351
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,965
A big house... [scoffs]

352
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,260
Did you know? [sniffs]

353
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,846
I once grew up in a house like that.

354
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,016
One with many rooms.

355
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,270
Even though many of them
were off-limits to me.

356
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,357
I bet I would've been able to sneak in.

357
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,360
[chuckles] Yes, you would have done that.

358
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,364
But the point that I'm making...

359
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,659
The big house is really not what I miss.

360
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:42,829
What I miss
is the people who lived inside it.

361
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,166
You see, a person who is truly rich...

362
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,670
[gasps] ...is not somebody with money,
it's someone who is loved.

363
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:55,050
But, father, why not both?
Why does it have to be one or the other?

364
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,971
I want to be both loved and rich one day.

365
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,514
[chuckling]

366
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,599
[coughing]

367
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,355
- What's going on?
- [sighs] Another power outage.

368
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,024
We have them almost every night.

369
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,526
I'll light a lantern.

370
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,070
[panting]

371
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,159
Here, Father.

372
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,082
So you don't get scared.

373
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,792
[Isak sighs]

374
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,633
[breathes heavily]

375
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,514
Thank you, my son.

376
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,394
[door opens]

377
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,062
Here they are!

378
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,232
Father. [panting]

379
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,744
It brings me joy
to see you again, brother.

380
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,872
[sighs] Pastor, you're here.

381
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,665
Yes, of course I am.

382
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,542
To see him home after so long...

383
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,961
I need to speak with the pastor
in private.

384
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:18,759
[Kyunghee] Come now.

385
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,595
[Isak] Noa, you can stay.

386
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,348
[Mozasu] Father.

387
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:28,435
[Kyunghee] Mozasu,
come help me with the lanterns, okay?

388
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,149
[door closes]

389
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,778
But, <i>Halmoni</i>, if what you say is true,

390
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,448
a company like Colton, I mean,
they'd never purchase this land.

391
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,076
[sighs]
How could you think like that again?

392
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,078
Okay, just hear me out.

393
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,455
Once Abe-<i>san</i> has bought the land,

394
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,917
we spread a rumor
that the bones are buried there...

395
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,419
But we don't know if they're still here!

396
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,546
It doesn't matter.

397
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,756
Even just the rumor will be enough.

398
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,092
It'll send Colton packing for good.

399
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,511
I'm sure of it.

400
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:07,391
And without Colton, Abe-<i>san</i> would be left
holding a substantial loan.

401
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,185
How could you even think of that?

402
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,604
You'll be exploiting the dead!

403
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,107
I'm not responsible
for what happened already.

404
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,733
I have nothing to do with it.

405
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,652
- [dish clatters]
- That's enough!

406
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,238
[sighing]

407
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,290
Then please tell me. What was it all for?

408
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,251
All of that tireless work?

409
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,798
[Isak] It was you...

410
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:41,925
wasn't it?

411
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,305
You're the one who turned me in.

412
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:54,438
Pastor, answer him.

413
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,692
Yes. It was me.

414
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,403
I turned you in.

415
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,449
I have long suspected

416
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,076
you disliked me.

417
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,539
But why?

418
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,878
No, I didn't dislike you.

419
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,052
It's more like despised.

420
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,180
For you,

421
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:32,351
it came easy to be loved by everybody.

422
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,187
But for me...

423
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,151
I was abandoned by my own parents.

424
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,322
It was Pastor Yoo who took me in

425
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,492
when everyone else just wanted to toss me.

426
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,869
He raised me as his own,

427
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,079
and loved me, that is,

428
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,873
until the day you came along, and then...

429
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,918
his love dampened.

430
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,471
[breathes shakily]

431
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,017
So I gave them your name, yes.

432
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,353
[breathes shakily, swallows]

433
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,275
But the satisfaction
I thought I would feel...

434
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,069
did not come.

435
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,573
I turned to fervent prayer

436
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,825
and I prayed for your release.

437
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,785
I prayed every day.

438
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:35,038
You think your prayers got me here?

439
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,168
Your family prayed too of course,

440
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,880
still, I promise you, my voice was
part of that chorus of prayer.

441
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,882
I tried to repent before God

442
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:49,052
and I wanted to make amends to you
and your family, and to Noa as well.

443
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,097
[sighs]

444
00:32:58,437 --> 00:32:59,563
[Pastor Hu sighs]

445
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,775
I want you to know
that with all my heart, I tried.

446
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,035
And I'm aware that I have no excuse.

447
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:14,995
You can never forgive...

448
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,622
I forgive you.

449
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:20,876
[Isak sighs]

450
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,587
I forgive you.

451
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,671
[Noa] You can't...

452
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:28,133
forgive him. How could you? Never!

453
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,011
All those years...

454
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:32,804
Because of him...

455
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,932
You must believe me, Noa.

456
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:38,352
I know exactly
what I have stolen from you.

457
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,353
Get out!

458
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,188
Stay away from us!

459
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,190
- Noa!
- I am so sorry.

460
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,316
Truly sorry, Noa.

461
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,569
[Kyunghee] Pastor, what is going on?

462
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:49,696
- [Isak] Noa.
- [door closes]

463
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:56,745
[Noa] Father.

464
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,251
[breathes shakily] Why?

465
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,509
Who am I to talk about it?

466
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,679
I don't have any idea
what true suffering is.

467
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,435
Going to bed on an empty stomach...

468
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,481
it's unimaginable to me.

469
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,447
Life has been so terribly easy for me,
it's pathetic.

470
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,494
You despise me, I understand that.

471
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,958
When I see the way you look at me.

472
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,005
The way my grandmother does.

473
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,384
I know you have to wonder:

474
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,681
"All that I've been through,

475
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,475
was it all for this?"

476
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:06,982
No?

477
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,069
Surely you would say it was all pointless.

478
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,279
[Geumja sighs]

479
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,121
I'm sorry I've been
keeping you up so late.

480
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,170
I won't come back. I promise.

481
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,176
[Geumja]
I have no regrets about how I lived.

482
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,850
It was a life lived well.

483
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:46,647
[Isak] My sons,
a broken body with broken bones...

484
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:49,441
That is all I have to give you.

485
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,903
But even so, remember this:

486
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,782
That pastor's fate and ours...

487
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,577
is tightly wound together.

488
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,708
Noa,

489
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,588
know that mercy isn't a power,

490
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,549
nor is it a reward.

491
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,425
True mercy

492
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,679
is acknowledging that

493
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,265
there's a price,

494
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,852
a cost that's attached to survival.

495
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:27,563
[coughs]

496
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:30,148
[breathes heavily, coughs]

497
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,486
There is so much
I want to say to you both.

498
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,031
But just remember one thing.

499
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,952
No matter where you are...

500
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:46,290
[sighs] ...no matter what...

501
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,294
you are my sons...

502
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,174
and I am your father.

503
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,802
[coughing, panting]

504
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:07,936
[Sunja] I'm here!

505
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,191
I've brought the doctor.
He's going to help us.

506
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,651
It will be okay now.

507
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,570
- [coughing]
- [Mozasu] Father!

508
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,740
[in Japanese]
This is not good. Clear the room.

509
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:22,492
[Sunja] The doctor will help him.

510
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,953
Mozasu, Noa, come.

511
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,999
[grunts, wheezing]

512
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,557
[wheezing]

513
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,128
[door opens, closes]

514
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,006
Mother!

515
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,307
[in Japanese]
I will be frank.

516
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,271
Your husband's lungs,
they're filled with mucus.

517
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,233
We could drain them in a hospital,

518
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,069
but more concerning,

519
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,322
he has sepsis.

520
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,241
I do not believe...

521
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,621
he has much time left.

522
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,212
[Sunja]
But there must be something you can do.

523
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,882
Please.

524
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,467
If it's the money, do not worry.

525
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,554
Tell him. [breathes shakily]

526
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,557
I can pay whatever it costs.
Don't worry about money.

527
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,018
I'll... I'll get the money.

528
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:14,605
[in Japanese]
Your husband, at most,

529
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,733
he has a few hours left.

530
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,704
What they did to him...

531
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,956
It is a terrible thing.

532
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,083
I am sorry for him.

533
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,607
[Isak] Forgive me.

534
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,611
I didn't know...

535
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,406
how much it would cost us.

536
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,784
There is nothing to forgive.

537
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,039
Those years that you were away,
all those long years,

538
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:20,045
I can't count the times someone wanted
to speak to me of your kindness,

539
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,383
your sacrifice for others.

540
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,555
That is the man I met 14 years ago,

541
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,558
and that's the man I see now.

542
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,478
The world may have changed...

543
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,316
you have remained the same.

544
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,907
Sunja, I want to see... [wheezing]

545
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,494
the boys grow up together.

546
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,125
Sunja... [gasping]

547
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,420
I want to hold you.

548
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,964
My wife.

549
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,509
I just want... [gasping]

550
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,347
All I want is to live.

551
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:17,186
[wheezing] So much.

552
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,691
I am dying to live.

553
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,947
[wheezes]

554
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:32,993
[grunts]

555
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,204
When I am gone

556
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,459
you must find someone.

557
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,131
Please don't say such things.

558
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,634
You have so much

559
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,847
love to give.
You have so much love to give.

560
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,308
This I know.

561
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,645
To be loved

562
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,524
and to be honored also

563
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,360
by my husband, it...

564
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,574
it has been everything to me.

565
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,953
[groans]

566
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,456
But how will...

567
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,668
How will you go on?

568
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,338
[sighs]

569
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,593
Do not worry about us now.

570
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,139
I can give you my word.

571
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:39,893
Our children

572
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,939
will live good lives.

573
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,652
Noa and Mozasu will...

574
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,948
thrive, both of them.

575
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:58,579
[chuckles]

576
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,914
[Sunja sighs]

577
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,212
[sighs]

578
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,674
[wheezes]

579
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,641
[sighs]

580
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:58,138
[Sunja] <i>There will never be
another man like your father.</i>

581
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,267
<i>You must never forget that.</i>

582
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:05,479
<i>Never.</i>

583
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,669
[sobs]

584
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,759
[in Japanese]
What are you doing here?

585
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,135
[Solomon]
The deal's done.

586
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,180
She'll sell to Abe and Colton
for 1.4 billion yen.

587
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,642
We'll get a 10% fee.

588
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:10,646
But know this.
That hotel will never be built.

589
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,649
Because we're going to sink it.

590
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,026
And Abe-<i>san</i> will know

591
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:20,864
I'm the one who did this to him.

592
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,547
[sniffles, sighs]

593
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:42,135
[siren blaring]

594
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,724
[attendee]
It's not a drill! It's a real air raid!

595
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,601
[attendee 2]
Hurry to the bomb shelter!

596
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,729
- Hurry, run!
- [attendee] Hurry!

597
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,189
What are you doing? We must go!

598
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:55,315
[attendee] Run! Let's go!

599
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,818
- [in English] Mother...
- [Mozasu] Mother!

600
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:58,902
Sunja!

601
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,196
- [in Japanese] But my husband!
- Run!

602
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,408
[in English]
No, I can't leave my husband!

603
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:08,161
- [siren continues]
- [people clamoring]

604
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:35,856
[siren continues]

605
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,077
