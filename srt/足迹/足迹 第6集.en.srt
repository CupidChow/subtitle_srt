[Episode 6]

3
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,710
You okay?

4
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
What are you trying to do?

5
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
What do you think?

6
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,630
I've already taken care of everything.

7
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,390
You'd better not do anything now.

8
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,720
You've taken care of it?

9
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,280
How?

10
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,410
By bowing and scraping

11
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,930
with that fake smile?

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I have my own methods.

13
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,430
I don't have time to explain to you now.

14
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,630
I have my methods too.

15
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,070
Don't get in my way.

16
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,680
Cheng Ao.

17
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,000
Everything comes to him who waits.

18
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,090
If you go after Dong now,

19
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,090
break his arm and cripple his leg,

20
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,750
you might feel it's resolved.

21
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,640
But will Siyun's hospital be able to open?

22
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,700
We'll need Dong's help in the future.

23
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,970
He's not the only

24
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,180
powerful one in Shanghai.

25
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,120
There are plenty of ways and people

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,910
who can help Siyun open her hospital.

27
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,710
Like who?

28
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,190
You or me?

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,820
It isn't that jerk anyway.

30
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,600
Let's stop arguing.

31
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,870
Nothing serious happened, right?

32
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,690
I promise if there's a next time,

33
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,790
I'll deal with him together with you.

34
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,690
It's quite lively down there.

35
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,450
Yes, it is.

36
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,710
Miss Lin.

37
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,210
Mrs. Shen, I'll be going now.

38
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,930
Alright.

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,760
Mrs. Shen.

40
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,470
Where did you go just now?

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,630
Aunt Nan.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Siyun just went to
see under-secretary Dong.

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,300
Dong is too bold.

44
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,330
He tried to take advantage of Siyun.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Who introduced under-secretary Dong
to Miss Lin?

46
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,750
I think it was me.

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Miss Lin.

48
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,070
I understand your original intention
for opening a maternity hospital.

49
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,000
And I know how important

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,330
this hospital is to you.

51
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,950
As long as it can be opened smoothly,

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,390
no matter how difficult it gets,

53
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,250
I'm not afraid.

54
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
It's hard for a woman to get things done.

55
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,000
But no matter how difficult,
I'll still do it.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Otherwise, why would I
have studied abroad in the West?

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,350
I must open

58
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,120
the hospital.

59
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,490
I'll go with you

60
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,070
to meet those businessmen later.

61
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,190
You two men.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,290
You can't even protect a girl.

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,560
Don't worry.

64
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,550
I won't let this happen again.

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
It's fine now.

66
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,750
It's about time.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,950
I'll go down with you.

73
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,950
Trying to comfort me?

74
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,360
No need.

75
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,310
If under-secretary Dong
had stayed any longer,

76
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,440
he definitely would've regretted it.

You can't hide the look in your eyes
when you like someone.

86
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,840
You'd better make sure.

Cheng Ao.

91
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,760
Do you have feelings for Lin Siyun?

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,240
I just don't like you.

93
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,790
So you're saying
Lin Siyun is better than me?

94
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,740
She is indeed excellent.

95
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,560
Something's wrong. Director Shen.

96
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,170
There's a dead man in the restroom,

97
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,170
covered in blood.

98
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,830
Who's dead?

99
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,640
Close all the exits.

100
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,750
Notify the police station.

101
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,810
Check every vehicle passing nearby.

102
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,430
Alright, let's talk another day.

103
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,120
Sure.

104
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,310
Who would dare
take such a huge risk to kill him?

105
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,250
I bet it's the Eliminate Spies Squad
of the Communist Party.

106
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,040
What do you think?

107
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,970
Not interested.

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,630
Let's go, Siyun.

109
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,789
I need to stay and handle other matters.

110
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,789
Make sure you get Siyun home safely.

111
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,770
As long as she stays away from you,

112
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,960
she'll be safe.

113
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,919
Let's go.

114
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,770
You only know
how to take advantage of others.

115
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,040
Tell me how you found the body just now.

116
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,200
At first I was cleaning near the restroom.

117
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,860
Suddenly,

118
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,530
I heard a yowl.

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,670
So I followed the sound,

120
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,910
and saw that person

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,730
already lying on the floor.

122
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,920
Did anyone

123
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,640
pass by here before that?

124
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,290
I...

125
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,840
don't remember.

126
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,670
Think again.

127
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,650
I remember now.

128
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,660
A man in a western-style servant's uniform

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,080
walked out of the restroom
around that time.

130
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
What happened tonight

131
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,070
is our Shen family's fault.

132
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,170
Please, everyone, go home first.

133
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,510
Tomorrow my wife and I will personally
call on you to apologize.

134
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,150
We're truly sorry for this.

135
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,130
Director Shen.

136
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
Distinguished guests.

137
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
You don't need to investigate further.

138
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,370
I'll see you out.

139
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,590
No need.

140
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,740
We can't let our matters

141
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,510
interfere with your duties.

142
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,650
The investigation must continue.

143
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,280
Mr. Zeng, thanks.

144
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,030
If there's nothing else,

145
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,910
I'll take my leave.

146
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,550
All right.

147
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,720
Thank you.

148
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,920
This certificate was issued
just the day before yesterday.

149
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
Orders just came down from above

150
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,520
that anyone with certificates
issued within the past 7 days

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,720
must be taken to
the station for questioning.

152
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,270
Take him away!

153
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,630
Yes, sir.

154
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,440
Wait, bro.

155
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
Just a moment, excuse me.

156
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,770
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,120
This gentleman came with me.

158
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,830
He's Mr. Zeng's friend.

159
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,930
Who are you?

161
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,260
I'm Mr. Zeng's adopted son,

162
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,890
Cheng Ao.

163
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,440
Sorry,

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,360
but we have strict orders

165
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,580
to thoroughly check everyone.

166
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,550
Bro.

167
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,860
This gentleman is

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,150
a friend of my son.

169
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,000
He and my son

170
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,410
may leave with me, right?

171
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,540
Of course, Mr. Zeng.

172
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,440

You're worried about him.

Who is Mr. Gu exactly?

191

Why would the police want him?

My property here is in a prime location.

It's perfect for

A hospital?

Yingying is just a child.

How could she run a business?

219

Even if I opened a restaurant for her,

220
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
she'd only come with her friends,

221

eating and drinking all day
without making any profit.

222

A hospital is different.

223

I've already had experts evaluate it

224

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,710

What's your relationship?

242
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,830
I met him in the shantytown last time.

243
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,850
He's their spokesperson.

244
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,290
I sat with him inside for a while

245
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,380
and found he's quite knowledgeable.

246
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,670
But his awareness and knowledge

247
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,320
don't really match his circumstances.

248

So I was curious about him.

That's all.

than let one Communist escape.

Many young people were killed
just like that.

Without a country, there's no home.

The Japanese have occupied Manchuria,

and now they want North China.

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,600
must be disinfected regularly.

345
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,860
This area must be kept clean at all times.

346
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,040
Also, pay attention to
the mothers' emotions.

347
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,440
You must be patient.

348
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,520
Don't let them feel anxious

349
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,790
or upset.

350
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,350
Help them maintain a pleasant mood

351
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,280
as they welcome their babies here.

352
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,520
Liu,

353
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,110
remember to open the windows and curtains

354
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,310
every day when you come in.

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,880
So the delivery room
gets proper ventilation and fresh air.

356
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,670
Okay.

357
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,800
Read the handbook

358
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,840
I've given you all carefully.

359
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,270
Dr. Lin,

360
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,820
men aren't allowed in here.

361
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,660
Director Lin.

362
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,080
I'll step outside for a moment.

363
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,600
What are you doing here?

364
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,560
I've come to see

365
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,710
the famous

366
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,260
Sinan Maternity Hospital.

367
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,150
Girls, take some time
to get familiar with the place.

368
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,160
No men allowed.

369
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,160
Isn't this place not officially open yet?

370
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,070
What's wrong?

371
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,350
What are you thinking about?

372
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,280
This used to be the kitchen, right?

373
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,340
The first time I came here,

374
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,100
someone walked
from the living room to here,

375
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,160
grabbed a kitchen knife
and went upstairs to attack me.

376
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,810
So fierce.

377
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,750
You guys drove me to it.

378
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,160
Pretty good.

379
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,140
You've gone
from a kitchen knife to a scalpel.

380
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,140
By the way,

381
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,640
I bought flower stands.

382
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,740
When you officially open,

383
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,540
I'll have Cheng bring them over.

384
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,750
Also,

385
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,200
if you need,

386
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,830
I can be your legal advisor.

387
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,000
My hospital isn't even open yet,

388
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,550
not making any profit,

389
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,830
I can't afford to pay you.

390
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,800
Who said anything about money?

391
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,370
Aunt Nan and I are both your benefactors.

392
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
Hello?

393
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,290
Hello,

394
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,450
I'm looking for Ao.

395
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,750
Cheng Ao,

396
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,260
phone for you.

397
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,960
For me?

398
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,750
Yes.

399
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,540
Hello?

400
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,350
Hey, bro,

401
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,750
so you are there after all.

402
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,680
I couldn't find you,

403
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,440
so I called Miss Lin's place.

404
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,260
How did you get this number?

405
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,740
I...

406
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,720
I got it

407
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,320
when we were
collecting debts from her family.

408
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,150
You haven't changed your number?

409
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,300
I will soon.

410
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,970
What's the matter?

411
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,760
Bro,

412
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,720
my brother Xiaoshan is in trouble.

413
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Can you help me out?

414
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,130
I don't deserve such praise.

415
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,920
I should serve the party and country

416
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,380
even at the cost of my life.

417
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,620
Understood.

418
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,070
I'll arrange it right away,

419
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,270
and will definitely
give you an answer tomorrow.

420
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,750
Okay.

421
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,580
Goodbye.

422
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,270
Do me a favor.

423
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,110
Have a seat and tell me.

424
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,610
I have a young relative

425
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,070
who joined a training camp

426
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,660
organized by the Shanghai military,

427
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,120
and was suddenly arrested

428
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,870
on charges of
collaborating with Communists.

429
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,410
What did he do?

430
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,200
During training,

431
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,260
an instructor was preaching that

432
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
we must first eliminate internal threats
before fighting external ones,

433
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,070
and to win the war,

434
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,970
a soldier's primary duty

435
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,230
is to eliminate the Communist Party,

436
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,330
and only secondarily

437
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,990
to resist Japanese invasion.

438
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,870
The kid didn't understand and asked

439
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,500
why wiping out
the Communists was considered

440
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,640
the first priority over resisting Japan.

441
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,740
Just that one question,

442
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,870
and he was arrested.

443
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,400
Wasn't the kid right?

444
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,770
Isn't this what all Chinese people feel?

445
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,920
How could they charge him
with being a Communist sympathizer?

446
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,120
If you put it that way,

447
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,520
then millions of Chinese people

448
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,690
would all be Communists.

449
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,530
Bro, stop right there.

450
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,530
Don't let anyone hear you.

451
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,830
You don't need to
explain these principles to me,

452
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,510
regarding the Chairman's strategy,

453
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,310
in my position,

454
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,200
I can't express any opinions.

455
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Just tell me directly

456
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,110
what you need me to do.

457
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,310
I've made inquiries.

458
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,310
The kid is still being
held at the military school,

459
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,070
about to be transferred
to the Military Police.

460
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,750
Once he's transferred
to the Military Police,

461
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,950
his chances are slim.

462
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,550
You have many connections.

463
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,720
Help me get him out.

464
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,420
Good heavens,

465
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,400
this is such a serious matter!

466
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,130
I don't have that kind of power.

467
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,750
The training camp address

468
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,950
and instructor's name are here. Hurry.

469
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,930
Well...

470
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,990
What else are you taking out?

471
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,900
Cheng Ao.

472
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,160
You're quite practiced

473
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,350
at this game.

474
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Alright.

475
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,720
I'll help you

476
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
with this matter.

477
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,400
Leave the training camp address

478
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,380
and instructor's name

479
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,170
here.

480
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,970
Take your money back.

481
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,640
We're close friends.

482
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,720
Besides,

483
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,260
this isn't something money can solve.

484
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,630
Take it back.

485
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,240
Wait.

486
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,650
For tonight's booze.

487
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,710
Look at you.

488
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,950
You still drink?

489
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,910
Your stomach is already bad.

490
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,270
Give me two more bills

491
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,050
to buy stomach medicine.

492
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,540
Shut up.

493
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,240
I'm leaving.

494
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,380
Wait for my news.

495
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,870
Doctor.

496
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,220
How is my brother doing?

497
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,210
Three broken ribs, ruptured spleen,

498
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,670
and neurological damage.

499
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,950
Bro.

500
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,790
Please help me.

501
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,240
I want to sue them.

502
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,140
Stay with your brother first.

503
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,220
I'll go back to my office for a moment.

504
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,700
Bro.

505
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,510
Xiaoshan's case
has gained public attention,

506
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,810
surprisingly many people from
all walks of life are supporting him.

507
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,070
Mr. Lu has been working very hard on this.

508
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,070
Xiaoshan is an anti-Japanese youth.

509
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,640
He has the people's support.

510
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,680
Those dark forces can't stop this.

511
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,880
What are you talking about?

512
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,240
Director Shen, you're here in person.

513
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,770
Am I not welcome?

514
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,070
Of course you are.

515
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,900
Hello, Director Shen.

516
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,750
Cheng.

517
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll go to the court
to get the documents, bro.

518
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,270
So?

519
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,550
How confident are you about this trial?

520
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,070
What's more important about this case

521
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,600
is winning public support.

522
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,920
Wait a minute.

523
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,890
Why are you

524
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,320
so interested in this case?

525
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,610
From what I know about you,

526
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,130
you should be keeping your distance.

527
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,370
The great Attorney Cheng
finally asks for my help,

528
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,370
so I should put in some extra effort.

529
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,900
Take a look at this.

530
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Where did you get this?

531
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,600
Never mind where I got it.

532
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,260
This will definitely help you
control people's minds.

533
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,210
But Cheng Ao,

534
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,130
this is as far as
I can help you with this matter.

535
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,400
The rest is up to you.

536
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,630
Let me warn you.

537
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,910
This isn't nearly as simple as you think.

538
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,200
I've done some research,

539
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,130
and that kid is incredibly brazen.

540
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,510
He can't just be

541
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,900
a simple patriotic youth.

542
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,300
There must be political forces behind him.

543
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,070
Let me give you some advice:

544
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,270
stir things up, let them fight each other,

545
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,220
keep your distance,

546
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,390
and you won't lose no matter who wins.

547
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,160
That's a lot of information.

548
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,640
Shen Yiqun.

549
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,710
Is this guy

550
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,010
your political rival?

551
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,280
Pretty much.

552
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,630
No wonder.

553
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,230
I'm leaving.

554
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,820
Thanks.

555
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,890
You're welcome.

556
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,070
Auntie, I'm back.

557
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,480
Yi.

558
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,850
Come on, give it to me.

559
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,310
Auntie, your hospital
is doing really well.

560
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,910
I can finally move back home.

561
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,280
Miss Lin,

562
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,520
long time no see.

563
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,920
You are Zhou?

564
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,760
I just came to help Yi move in.

565
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,580
Yi,

566
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,200
I've moved all your stuff in.

567
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,710
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

568
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,390
Okay.

569
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,180
Miss Lin, I have matters
to attend to at school,

570
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,510
I'll come visit another day.

571
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,020
Okay.

572
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm leaving.

573
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,990
Goodbye.

574
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,200
Auntie, what are you smiling about?

575
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,130
You tell me.

576
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,310
Alright,

577
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,010
let me show you your room.

578
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,530
Okay.

579
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
This room in our house

580
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,620
has been converted into nurses' quarters.

581
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,550
The hospital just opened
and isn't making much profit yet.

582
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,850
Once we start earning money,

583
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,760
we'll rent a place outside,

584
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,370
but for now, we'll have to make do.

585
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay.

586
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,480
Liu,

587
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,190
which bed is reserved for Yi?

588
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,350
This bed is unoccupied.

589
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,550
It's reserved for Yi.

590
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,170
Thank you.

591
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,920
Auntie, this place is really nice.

592
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,620
Can I invite my classmates over?

593
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,310
You can't go to the treatment areas,

594
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,440
just stay in the dormitory,

595
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
and don't disturb others who are resting.

596
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,750
Got it.

597
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,330
You tidy up here.
I need to get back to work.

598
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:50,860
Okay.

599
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,490

if you were in my position,

628
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,250
you would take this case too,

wouldn't you?

630
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,870
In my lifetime,

631
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,600
from the Qing Dynasty to
the Beiyang government to the Republic,

632
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I've seen incompetent governments

633
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,480

But no matter what,

Japan

640
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,110
is China's number one enemy.

648
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,520
for saying just one sentence
during training,

649
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,080
was detained and beaten severely,

650
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,960
has not yet recovered enough
to leave the hospital,

651
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,490
and cannot appear in court.

652
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,480
I imagine everyone is curious

653
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,510
about what kind of

654
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,170
treasonous statement he made

655
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,330
to suffer such punishment.

656
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,940
During the training session,

657
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,720
the instructor repeatedly emphasized

658
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,110
that to resist foreign aggression,

659
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,240
we must first pacify internal unrest.

660
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,160
First, establish internal stability,

661
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,990
and then

662
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,000
focus on resistance.

663
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,940
Xiaoshan didn't understand,

664
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,400
what's the cause and effect here?

665
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,440
Nonsense!

666
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,800
This student was sent by the Communists

667
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,920
to sabotage us.

668
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,490
He was acting under Communist orders.

669
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,730
He admitted it himself.

670
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,190
Yet you're defending him.

671
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,690
Are you a Communist too?

672
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
Before I came today,
a government official

673
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,470
told me almost the same thing.

674
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,990
He said Xiaoshan's motives
go beyond simple patriotism.

675
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,250
He must have
powerful forces behind him,

676
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,710
and he was sent by the Communist Party
to subvert patriotic students.

677
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,090
But the truth is,

678
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,920
you're suppressing
a genuinely patriotic student.

679
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,940
I'm Wu Xiaoshan's classmate,

680
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,290
from Heilongjiang.

681
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,070
Now I can't return home,

682
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,570
because the Japanese have occupied it.

683
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,590
Our relatives back home
have become slaves in a conquered land.

684
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,970
Xiaoshan is not a Communist,

685
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,260
and neither are we.

686
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,000
We just want to defeat the Japanese devils

687
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,390
and liberate the Northeast provinces.

688
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,390
I don't want to be a slave
in a conquered country.

689
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,500
I want to go home!

690
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,070
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

691
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,030
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

692
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,150
Order in the court!

693
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,480
Your Honor,

694
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,780
I would like to ask the defendant,

695
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,730
are you truly Chinese or not?

696
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,800
Why am I imprisoned

697
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,440
just for expressing my patriotism,

698
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,300
beaten, cursed, and humiliated?

699
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,250
Why do you insist I'm a Communist

700
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,300
when I declare

701
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,230
my resistance against Japan
and love for my country?

702
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,230
Let me tell you,

703
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,920
I am not a Communist.

704
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,010
But I do support the Communist Party's

705
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,280
anti-Japanese stance.

706
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,790
That is typical Communist rhetoric.

707
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,630
The school's investigation of you

708
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,360
is entirely based on
your communist tendencies.

709
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,150
What has the school done wrong?

710
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,830
You're young and naive,

711
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,510
where did you get these ideas?

712
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,820
Someone must be influencing you.

713
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,890
Wu Xiaoshan has made it very clear

714
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,070
that he supports the Communist Party's
resistance against Japan.

715
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,590
What's wrong with
supporting resistance against Japan?

716
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,840
Not wanting our beautiful homeland
to be taken by enemies,

717
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,170
what's wrong with that?

718
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,500
What's wrong with
not wanting our homes trampled upon?

719
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,920
If you insist

720
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,120
that he has powerful forces behind him,

721
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
then yes, he does.

722
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,230
You.

723
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,070
You.

724
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,000
You. You. You. You all.

725
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,850
Including me,

726
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
we are all part of this force.

727
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,740
This powerful force is 400 million

728
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,490
Chinese compatriots who refuse
to be slaves of a conquered nation!

729
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,670
Cheng Ao, I'm heading
back to the newspaper.

730
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm going to write an article

731
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,540
and try to get it published
in the next day or two.

732
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,140
Okay.

733
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,410
Thank you for your hard work.

734
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,470
We're all Chinese.

735
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,700
Today's court hearing
was truly impressive.

736
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm off.

737
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

738
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,070
Ao.

739
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,470
Do you think

740
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,070
we can win this case?

741
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,270
I can't guarantee it.

742
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,490
Why the long face?

743
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,800
Public opinion is already on our side.

744
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,230
Didn't Mr. Lu say

745
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,980
that people are
very concerned about this case,

746
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,260
and it's having such a big impact?

747
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,390
So why are you still looking so gloomy?

748
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,480
Xiaoshan.

749
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,660
In fighting this lawsuit,

750
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,970
besides seeking justice for you,

751
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,740
isn't it just as important

752
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,070
to convey to the public

753
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,000
that you patriotic youths stand firmly
against Japanese aggression?

754
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,760
I understand, Ao.

755
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,320
I have another thing

756
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,250
I'd like to ask for your help with.

757
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,800
Sure.

758
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,050
My classmates and I

759
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,920
are planning to return to the Northeast

760
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,320
to join the anti-Japanese volunteer army.

761
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,760
No problem,

762
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
I'll make the arrangements for you.

763
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,510
Thank you, Ao.

764
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,320
Are you tired today?

765
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,610
What would you like to eat?

766
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,590
Let's go together,

767
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,250
my treat.

768
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,590
I'm hungry too.

769
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,110
Let's eat together.

770
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,320
You idiot,

771
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,060
can't you read the room?

772
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,680
Did Miss Lin invite you to dinner?

773
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,240
She wants to treat Ao to dinner,

774
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,700
and you're just
going on about being hungry.

775
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,150
It's fine.

776
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,960
Let's go together then.

777
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,270
Ao said

778
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,240
it's fine,

779
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,680
so let's go together.

780
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,600
So

781
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,690
let's go together.

782
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,550
No thanks, bro.

783
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,130
We're going for noodles.

784
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,260
You go with Miss Lin.

785
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,420
You're not coming?

786
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,230
The three of us can go.

787
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,080
Bro.

788
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,890
I'm not really hungry,

789
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,110
but I need to help Xiaoshan.

790
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,340
How can I let you support him?

791
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,030
Come, bro.

792
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,110
Weren't you going to eat noodles?

793
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,510
I can help him, it's fine.

794
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,630
Miss Lin.

795
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,030
Please, go ahead.

796
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,840
Take it slow.
