[Episode 10]

3
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,229
Hungry?

4
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,830
Haven't had dinner?

5
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,580
I'm not in the mood.

6
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,010
Guess the talk didn't go well.

7
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,160
Tell me about it.

8
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,520
They really have no idea

9
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,180
about the Japanese
strength and capabilities.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,860
Do you think...

11
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,270
my dad was really
killed by the Japanese?

12
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,480
We've got plenty of men,

13
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,750
but we're no match for the Japanese.

14
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,290
Pistols are no match for machine guns.

15
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
That warlord Zhang in the northeast—

16
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,930
wasn't he powerful?

17
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,970
Didn't he still get killed
by the Japanese bomb?

18
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,190
Now Master just

19
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,710
got a new son late in life.

20
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,190
In his mind, he's still

21
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,080
some hot-blooded young guy.

22
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,070
We need to splash some cold water on him

23
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,030
to distract him.

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,350
Once his energy is diverted,

25
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,110
he won't have time
for the workers' strike.

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,680
How do we do it?

27
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,190
No way.

28
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,880
That's my brother.

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,480
"Boiling beans on beanstalks—

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,730
the beans weep, burned by their own kind."

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,940
I'll take all of these.

32
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,200
Wrap them up for me.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,860
Madam Yanhong.

34
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,870
Siyun.

35
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,870
Waitress,

36
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,070
bring me your most expensive necklace.

37
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,720
Who is this?

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,380
This is my sister-in-law.

39
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,240
Madam Yanhong.

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,320
Bring me another expensive one.

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Here, Siyun.

42
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,340
This is for you.

43
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,800
The other one is for your sister-in-law.

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,750
You've helped me a lot

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,360
with my baby's matters.

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,380
Thank you, Madam Yanhong.

47
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,780
I can't accept this gift.

48
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,030
I provided medical treatment.

49
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,120
Mr. Zeng has already
paid the consultation fee.

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,390
That's not the same.

51
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
Even though he's paid you,

52
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,829
this is my gift.

53
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,829
Please take it.

54
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,200
It's not that expensive.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,060
I really can't.

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,160
I will keep

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,460
your baby in mind.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,320
Alright, I won't force you then.

59
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,870
Once my baby's born,

60
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,270
I'll prepare a proper gift for you.

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,860
You must accept it then.

62
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,520
Siyun,

63
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,630
let me tell you,

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,870
all those little ailments I had before,

65
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,830
they've vanished.

66
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,750
I guess that's what they call
"good news brings good health."

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,810
Congratulations.

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,040
I know what you're thinking.

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,680
That I only married the old man for money.

70
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,790
Or what else?

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,310
Of course I'm in it for the money.

72
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,640
Isn't it good to be rich?

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,630
With money,

74
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,510
I can buy whatever I want.

75
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,920
My child and I

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,600
can live a good life.

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,130
That's why

78
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,980
a woman

79
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,500
has to be shrewd.

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
I didn't have a choice.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,950
So if I had to choose—I'd choose money.

82
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,190
Siyun,

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,920
do you think my baby

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,430
will be a boy or a girl?

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
That I can't tell.

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,990
Can traditional medicine predict it?

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,460
I don't know.

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,120
What if it's a girl—

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
does that mean less money for me?

90
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,750
Forget it. I won't think about it.

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,770
I'll just burn incense every day

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,520
when I get back to pray for a boy.

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Alright, I should go now.

94
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,880
Take good care of yourself, Madam Yanhong.

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Okay, I won't see you out.

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,270
My belly is getting bigger.

97
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,159
I need to buy more new clothes.

98
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,120
Let's go, Sis.

99
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,409
It was this necklace just now, right?

100
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,380
Siyun,

101
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,120
it's such a nice necklace.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
Why didn't you accept it?

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,000
Taking gifts from others is a burden.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
It doesn't feel easy.

105
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,770
Then here's an idea.

106
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,010
Next time you

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,870
treat those rich ladies,

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,080
take me with you.

109
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,380
You might feel awkward, but I don't.

110
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,780
I'll accept them for you.

111
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,190
Dr. Lin! Dr. Lin!

112
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,680
Come with me quickly!

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,140
Madam Yanhong's not good!

114
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,170
What happened?

115
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,900
Madam Yanhong,

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
what's wrong?

117
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,830
My belly hurts.

118
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,480
I just bled.

119
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,310
Do you think I'll be alright?

120
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
Fu,

121
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,060
call a car.

122
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,950
We're going to the hospital.

123
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,510
Okay.

124
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,600
Sis, I'll accompany
Madam Yanhong to the hospital.

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,630
You call the hospital

126
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
and tell them to prepare for surgery.

127
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,600
Also,

128
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,940
notify Cheng Ao to come to the hospital.

129
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,659
Alright.

130
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,800
Relax.

131
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,310
Give the patient a blood transfusion.

132
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,190
Call the anesthetist.

133
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,450
Get ready for surgery.

134
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,120
Am I going to die?

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,640
No.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,890
Don't be nervous.

137
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,800
Take deep breaths.

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
We'll give you blood.

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,420
Once the anesthetic's in, it won't hurt.

140
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,870
Director,

141
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,390
maybe you should step out.

142
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,850
People outside
are insisting on seeing you.

143
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,220
I'll step out for a moment.

144
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,620
I'll be right back
to perform your surgery.

145
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,070
Dr. Lin.

146
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,070
Siyun,

147
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,240
what's going on?

148
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,040
When I was at the department store today,

149
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,670
I ran into Madam Yanhong.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,310
She suddenly felt unwell.

151
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,070
After examination, we found out

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,270
she's showing signs of miscarriage.

153
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,070
But...

154
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,270
she was fine
when she left home this morning.

155
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,870
How could this happen?

156
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,470
She's still hemorrhaging.

157
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,870
The situation is critical.

158
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,000
What about the baby?

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Answer him!

160
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,330
I'm sorry, Dr. Lin.

161
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,290
Please go ahead.

162
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,260
We can only save

163
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,340
either the baby or the mother.

164
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:47,720
Yanhong.

165
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,040
Save the mother.

166
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,930
Wait.

167
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,000
Dr. Lin,

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,820
save the baby instead.

169
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,450
Here's a small gift.

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,530
Thank you for your help.

171
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,210
Director, her blood pressure is dropping.

172
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,120
Almost unmeasurable.

173
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
If we force delivery,

174
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,510
we might not be able to save the mother.

175
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,130
[Emergency Room]

176
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,770
Is it a boy or girl?

177
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,880
Madam Yanhong's condition

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,120
has stabilized.

179
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,030
What about the baby?

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,150
The baby...

181
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,700
didn't make it.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,390
What did I just tell you?

183
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,710
I am a doctor.

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,600
I had no choice.

185
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,490
Didn't you say there was a choice?

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,600
Father.

187
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,320
Get out of the way!

188
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,150
Something's wrong here.

189
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,020
We need to investigate first.

190
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,850
Move!

191
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,170
Take him away!

192
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,200
Get out of here!

193
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,900
Father!

194
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,950
Father, I beg you.

195
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,000
Father, don't shoot.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,190
Father!

197
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,060
Father, you can't shoot!

198
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,890
Father!

199
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,030
Father, you can't kill her!

200
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,460
Father!

201
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,770

Father!

207
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,550
Cheng Ao,

208
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,930
from today on,

209
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,270
your 20-year relationship
with our Zeng family

210
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,630
is over.

211
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,890
Are you okay?

212
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,390
I'm fine.

213
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,190
Yanhong will recover, right?

214
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,990
She's not even 20 yet.

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,860
Her body should recover quickly.

216
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,870
She can have children again.

217
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,750
That's good.

218
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,410
What are you sorry for?

220
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,620
You didn't do anything wrong.

221
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,150
If it were me,

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,450
I would've chosen the same.

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,180
I just find it all
so sudden and bewildering.

224
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,270
Dalun suddenly

225
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,970
started working with the Japanese.

226
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,900
My father

227
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,240
suddenly cut ties with me.

228
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,870
I used to think

229
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,030
I could handle many things,

230
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,480
face all kinds of situations.

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,420
I just don't know what to do.

245
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,210
and been deceived.

246
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,660

Siyun,

270
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,600
when are you free

271
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,960
these next few days?

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
When are you free?

273
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,200
What's up?

274
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
I want to treat you to dinner.

275
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
My treat—you set it up.

276
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,190
I'm busy.

277
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,840
Do you know who contacted me?

278
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
Zeng Dalun.

279
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,850
He's doing really well now.

280
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,320
And what's that

281
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,910
got to do with me?

282
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,270
You're close with Cheng Ao,
and he's close with Dalun.

283
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
Help me set up

284
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,400
a dinner with him.

285
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,790
If I could work with him,

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,480
wouldn't our family be better off again?

287
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,880
You know,

288
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,920
Zeng Dalun is quite influential now.

289
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,640
He's very close with the Japanese.

290
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,359
With the current situation

291
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,740
being so tense,

292
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,030
if I could connect
with the Japanese through Zeng Dalun,

293
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,840
wouldn't that be
double insurance for our family?

294
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,850
I understand better than anyone

295
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,650
what it means
to adapt to changing circumstances.

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,280
Please leave immediately.

297
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,050
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

298
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,440
You know me well enough.

299
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,590
Dalun,

300
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
the investigation into Communist supplies

301
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,750
is now in its final stage.

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Most of Shanghai's docks
have been checked.

303
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,680
Now I want to inspect your family's dock.

304
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,720
Our dock?

305
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,160
No way.

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,270
My father isn't pro-Communist.

307
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,800
He only hates the Japanese.

308
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,240
Dalun,

309
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,680
your opium trafficking

310
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,270
has been reported to the higher-ups.

311
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
Cooperating with Shen Yiqun this time

312
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,890
is your chance to make amends.

313
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Cooperate?

314
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,480
Why should I cooperate with Shen Yiqun?

315
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,740
Who does he think he is?

316
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,750
I've done

317
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,790
more work for the Revival Society

318
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,850
than he has lately.

319
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,550
Dalun,

320
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,880
it's good for young people
to have passion.

321
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,680
But politics isn't just about fighting.

322
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,630
What matters most is brains.

323
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,000
I understand.

324
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,400
So according to you,

325
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,790
the deputy director position
is basically Shen Yiqun's?

326
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,030
Not necessarily.

327
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,790
You might still have a shot.

328
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,270
What's crucial now is whether we can seize

329
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,270
that shipment of medicine
the Communists are moving out of Shanghai.

330
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,590
If you can track down this shipment,

331
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,250
the deputy director position

332
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,790
should be yours.

333
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,600
Just bear with it for now.

334
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,400
Having you work with Shen Yiqun

335
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
is also what our superiors want.

336
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,630
Thank you for your guidance, Director.

337
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,010
That's more like it.

338
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,300
Remember this,

339
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
the grievance

340
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,490
is just a temporary thing.

341
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,550
I have high hopes for you.

342
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,310
Do your best.

343
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,830
I'll get to it.

344
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,320
Go on then.

345
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,720
Cut back on smoking.

346
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Thank you, Director.

347
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,140
Jin,

348
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,750
set up a meeting with Mr. Sada for me.

349
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
Tell him

350
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,180
I need to see him urgently.

351
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,640
Seems Director Liu's words
can't be trusted.

352
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,310
I've never trusted him anyway.

353
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,510
So, what's your plan?

354
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,680
Take this carton of cigarettes.

355
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,780
Thank you, Young Master.

356
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,590
Mr. Sada,

357
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,440
we've worked together for a long time—

358
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,720
from the Northeast to Shanghai.

359
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
Our business dealings
have always gone smoothly.

360
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,450
That's true.

361
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,760
Let's drink to our friendship.

362
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,270
I have an idea

363
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,240
that not only keeps our business going,

364
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,700
but also strengthens
my cooperation with the Empire of Japan.

365
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,070
Mr. Zeng,

366
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,250
we've been friends for years.

367
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Of course I'd welcome deeper cooperation.

368
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,210
But may I ask,

369
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
how exactly do you plan

370
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
to achieve this?

371
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,510
Shen Yiqun and I

372
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,960
are competing for
the deputy director position.

373
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,550
You know what kind
of person Shen Yiqun is.

374
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,070
He has always been anti-Japanese.

375
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,000
If he becomes the deputy director,

376
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,440
it would certainly

377
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,100
be all harm and no good for you.

378
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,590
But if it's me,

379
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,940
the Kuomintang's door

380
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,420
would be your back door.

381
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,550
Whatever intelligence you need,

382
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,920
I can easily provide.

383
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,590
That's thoughtful of you, Mr. Zeng.

384
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,390
Since you've spoken so frankly,

385
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,530
we will definitely help you win

386
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,810
this position.

387
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,750
I will do my utmost.

388
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,110
Mr. Gu,

389
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,610
you wanted to see me?

390
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,790
The contact I usually work with
has been arrested.

391
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,270
The situation is extremely urgent.

392
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,200
Both the medicine and myself
need to be transferred.

393
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,240
I'll make arrangements.

394
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,960
Be careful.

395
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,170
It's so late.

396
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,730
I just finished a meeting.

397
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,990
The meeting was about

398
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,590
deploying forces throughout the city
to eliminate the Communists.

399
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,720
Our principle is
to capture them alive if possible,

400
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,320
but shoot to kill
at the slightest resistance.

401
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,080
Why are you telling me this?

402
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,220
You know this person well, don't you?

403
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,100
He's on our elimination list.

404
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,940
Once he's captured...

405
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,830
I don't know if you're familiar

406
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,490
with our torture procedures,

407
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,540
but no one can withstand them.

408
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,240
Within 3 days, he will definitely reveal

409
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,770
everyone connected to him.

410
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,410
Aren't you afraid saying this

411
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,030
will get you in trouble?

412
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
I have no choice.

413
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,270
Here are two steamer tickets.

414
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,980
Take Siyun and leave Shanghai.

415
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,910
Go to Chongqing.

416
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,160
I'll think about it.

417
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,510
Cheng Ao,

418
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,010
just think it through.

419
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,150
Make your decision quickly.

420
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,050
I'm leaving.

421
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,810
Why such a hurry?

422
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Stay for a drink.

423
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,240
Another time—

424
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,840
once things settle down.

425
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,400
[Law Firm File]

426
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,950
Why did you suddenly ask me to meet here?

427
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,730
When I'm working,

428
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,850
it's all so fake.

429
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,590
After so many years in politics,

430
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,110
meeting different people every day,

431
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,850
saying different things to everyone,

432
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,920
sometimes I don't even know

433
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,440
if what I'm doing is right or wrong.

434
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,840
It's just so exhausting.

435
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,170
This place is nice.

436
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,550
It helps me relax.

437
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,990
Have you ever thought

438
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
it's your own ambition

439
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,290
that's turned you into this?

440
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,370
My ambition is big, yes.

441
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,100
But who doesn't have ambition?

442
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,720
I've tried to control it—

443
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,680
but I can't.

444
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,070
This is for you.

445
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,790
A gift.

446
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,070
I bought a house in Chongqing
for you and Cheng Ao.

447
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,200
I've seen the house. It's really nice.

448
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,920
You love dogs, right?

449
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,830
The yard is perfect for that.

450
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,420
And don't feel pressured.

451
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,880
Both your names are on the deed.

452
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,200
You know what I mean.

453
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,030
I'm suggesting that you could

454
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,560
leave Shanghai for a while.

455
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,900
It's so dangerous now,
bullets flying every day.

456
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,560
What if one day a bullet, bang!

457
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,640
I'm not saying it would hit you.

458
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
But what if it hits Cheng Ao's head?

459
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,800
That would be terrible. I'd be devastated.

460
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,000
No one is get shot.

461
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,030
That's good.

462
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,440
What's good?

463
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,000
You're so good to Cheng Ao.

464
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,440
Take it.

465
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,380
I can't accept this house.

466
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
Why not?

467
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,640
Why should I?

468
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,960
Does Cheng Ao know about this?

469
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,110
I just went to see him.

470
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,830
I told him about it.

471
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,550
He knows.

472
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,920
Alright, I'm not teasing you anymore.

473
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,960
I didn't buy this house for you two.

474
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,310
I just helped you pick it.

475
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,590
I paid on your behalf.

476
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,880
Just now in Cheng Ao's office,

477
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,270
he already paid me back.

478
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,680
And honestly, it's pretty expensive.

479
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,540
I might not even afford it myself.

480
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,940
Cheng Ao treats you

481
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,840
really well.

482
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,430
Now you can accept it, right?

483
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,440
I've had a lock specially made.

484
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,790
Here's the key.

485
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,070
When things settle down someday,

486
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,160
I'll come visit you in Chongqing.

487
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
But promise me—

488
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,060
save me a room.

489
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,750
Don't turn me away when I come.

490
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,320
Alright, you go home first.

491
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,910
I'll stay here a bit longer.

492
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,830
Wait.

493
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Be happy!

494
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,830
Shen Yiqun!

495
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,010
Who should not be hurt?

496
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,830
Cheng Ao.

497
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,630
Young Master,

498
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
we didn't find Cheng Ao's medicine.

499
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,690
That's impossible.

500
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,710
Search!

501
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,390
Yes, sir!

502
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,430
Dad.

503
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,510
Zhi,

504
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,660
where did you

505
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,020
get this deed from?

506
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,680
I'll count to three.

507
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,480
One—

508
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,920
Two—

509
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
I'll tell you.

510
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,740
Zhi has confessed that

511
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,680
Zeng Dalun gave her money

512
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,720
and a property deed

513
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,560
to put abortion medicine

514
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
into Madam Yanhong's chicken soup.

515
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,990
I see.

516
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,310
You may go now.

517
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,980
Dr. Lin,

518
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,110
please have a seat.

519
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,110
The other day,

520
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,380
you were frightened.

521
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,450
I'm truly sorry about that.

522
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,240
Lately, I've been thinking about

523
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,440
Cheng Ao

524
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,330
and Dalun when they were children.

525
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,870
Those two boys

526
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,000
always loved running around
in the courtyard

527
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,240
back and forth,

528
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,950
never sitting still.

529
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,960
A child’s nature shows the adult to come.

530
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,550
Dalun has

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
been mischievous since childhood.

532
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,960
As for Ao,

533
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,310
he has always been very steady.

534
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,200
Dr. Lin,

535
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,790
can you forgive me?

536
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,400
Here's a small gift from me.

537
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,680
Please don't refuse it.

538
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,420
Take it.

539
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
It's from Father.

540
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,960
Dad,

541
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,980
I did it,

542
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,840
but it was to protect you.

543
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,480
Dad,

544
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,350
have you seen Cheng Ao?

545
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,920
Do you want him dead too?

546
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,880
Dad,

547
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,110
how could I?

548
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,460
You and Cheng Ao
are the closest people to me.

549
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,000
Ao has a shipment of goods.

550
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,040
If you give me that shipment,

551
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,510
I will get promoted.

552
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,440
By then, what's mine

553
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,730
will be yours and Cheng Ao's too.

554
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,400
Go!

555
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,360
I'll say this one last time.

556
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,100
No dealings with the Japanese.

557
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,030
The medicines and equipment
are all packed.

558
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,430
Ready to depart anytime.

559
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,840
Mr. Cheng,

560
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,760
I hope one day

561
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,360
you will join us.

562
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,310
Those with determination

563
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,350
will eventually find their path

564
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,670
toward the right goal.

565
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,260
Take care once you leave Shanghai.

566
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,840
Mr. Cheng,

567
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,030
farewell.

568
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,190
Cheng Ao,

569
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,060
if there were more people like Mr. Gu,

570
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,040
our country would have hope, wouldn't it?

571
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,960
I believe so.

572
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,860
We must strive to be like him.

573
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,680
On August 13th, 1937,

574
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,810
the Battle of Shanghai broke out.

575
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,410
Sinan Maternity Hospital

576
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,900
has been used during the war,

577
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,300
receiving injured soldiers and refugees.

578
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,690
[Our Forces Strike Back,
Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses'

579
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,370
[Shanghai Suburbs, August 1937]

580
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,720
To protect our homeland,

581
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,960
to protect our families—

582
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,920
today

583
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,730
we march to the front.

584
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,400
Maybe today we fight,

585
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,200
and tomorrow we never come back!

586
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,380
But as soldiers,

587
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,510
as sons of China,

588
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,920
we do not fear death.

589
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,320
Trained for 1,000 days,

590
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,880
used in one moment—

591
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,960
now

592
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,840
it's our turn to fight!

593
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,550
Left face!

594
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,960
Quick march!

595
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,780
Director, more wounded are coming in.

596
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,660
What do we do?

597
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,030
Put them in the main ward.

598
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,030
Clean their wounds,
disinfect and bandage them.

599
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,630
Gather those who need surgery.

600
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,030
I'll come over as soon as I finish here.

601
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,760
Understood.

602
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,950
I'm really smart, you know.

603
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,590
Do you know what these mirrors

604
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,550
are for?

605
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,390
In a couple of days,

606
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,800
when Japanese planes come,

607
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,260
we'll place these mirrors

608
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,130
at the most important
National Army positions—

609
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,890
grain depots,

610
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,340
command posts,

611
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,630
and arsenals.

612
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,040
When these mirrors reflect light,

613
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,320
the Japanese planes

614
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,040
will hit their targets with precision.

615
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,000
This glass is quite sturdy.

616
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,670
Go break it.

617
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,510
Okay.

618
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,880
Nobody move!

619
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,480
Get down!

620
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,550
Stop right there!

621
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,550
Dad,

622
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
I'm negotiating with the Japanese,

623
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,840
trying for a ceasefire.

624
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,850
They've agreed.

625
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,070
As long as the National Army

626
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,530
withdraws from Shanghai,

627
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,630
they promised to treat our people well.
