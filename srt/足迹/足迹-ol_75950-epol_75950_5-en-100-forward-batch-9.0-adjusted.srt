3
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,710
Miss Lin, we're here to see the house.

4
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,640
I saw your

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,210
house-for-sale ad in the paper,

6
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,810
so I asked Aunt Nan to come with me
to take a look.

7
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
I've also been wanting

8
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,220
to thank you, Mrs. Shen.

9
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,150
You certainly should thank Auntie Nan.

10
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,210
If it weren't for her supporting you,

11
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,230
the outcome between you

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,310
and your brother
might have been different.

13
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,480
Don't say that.

14
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,030
I was just speaking fairly

15
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,520
from an objective standpoint.

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,980
It wasn't that important.

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Well,

18
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,080
I still owe you thanks.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,190
Mrs. Shen,

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Miss Shen,

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,930

22
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,530

Miss Lin,

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,700
I heard from Mr. Cheng that

41
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,170
you settled with your brother
out of court.

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,170

00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,050
Yes.

55
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,270

many well-known businessmen

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,079

73
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,800
Since you're looking for investors,

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,430
why not go there and give it a try?

75
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,470

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,190

84
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,360

That area is full of
makeshift shelters that laborers

from the countryside built themselves,

98
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,540
causing all sorts of problems.

99
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,430
The government has been trying to clear it

100
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,310
and move the nomads out.

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,270
But once some are gone,
others just keep coming.

102
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,870
With no other choice,

103
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,130
the government issued

104
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,230
this final eviction notice.

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,660
Unexpectedly,

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,310
a fire broke out last night,

107
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,970
and all those people ran to...

108
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,590
You think I don't know this?

109
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,510
Am I blind or deaf?

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,240
Huang,

111
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,909
how old are you this year?

112
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,680
Have you no shame?

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,420
You're shameless.

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,720
Yes.

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,870
Are you even human?

116
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm beginning to think you're not.

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,800
All sorts of problems?

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
If there weren't so many problems,
would this mess be dumped on me?

119
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,630
"Once some are gone,
others just keep coming?"

120
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,680
You're so shameless.

121
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,040
You should kneel before their doors,

122
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
begging them to leave one by one.

123
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,270
Did you do that?

124
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,040
You're right.

125
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,310
What's the point
of bowing and nodding to me?

126
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,040
Go handle it!

127
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,190
go fix it!

128
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,950
Yes, I...

129
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,510
Get out!

130
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay.

131
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,930
Isn't this my buddy Cheng Ao?

132
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,870
So?

133
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,530
Have you decided about
coming to work in my department?

134
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,850
Where was Huang standing just now?

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,130
Here.

136
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,130
You were sitting, weren't you?

137
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,770
Sit down.

138
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,300
What are you doing?

139
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,010
Pretend I'm Huang

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,390
and yell at me like you just did to him.

141
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,790
I want to see how it feels,

142
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,920
so I can decide if I can work for you.

143
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Come on.

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,190
Do all lawyers

145
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,480
like eavesdropping

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
on people?

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,940
Where's this confidence coming from?

148
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,200
What's the point
of listening to your insulting nonsense?

149
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,070
Lawyer Cheng,

150
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
those words

151
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,390
make you seem rather uncultured.

152
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,780
Not really.

153
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,160
I only talk to you like this.

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
So tell me,

155
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,970
why are you here?

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,430
Don't you always want to serve the country

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
and do something for the people?

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,490
Perfect timing.

159
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,360
There's something I need you to do now.

160
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,750
What is it?

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,060
Come with me. I'll tell you on the way.

162
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,980
Where are we going?

163
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,790
Someone set fire in the shantytown
last night.

164
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,550
Did I ask you to speak?

165
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,640
Who did it? Have they been caught?

166
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,020
It doesn't matter who did it.

167
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,800
What can you do even if you catch them?

168
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Their objective is clear:

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,390
they're dissatisfied with the government.

170
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,240
What's most important now
is calming these laborers

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,100
so they don't cause more trouble.

172
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,230
So why do you need me?

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,430
These people at the bottom of society

174
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,360
distrust the government completely.

175
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Cheng Ao,

176
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,490
you're in a gang

177
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,710
and you're a lawyer.

178
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,160
You'll be more persuasive
when communicating with them.

179
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I need you to

180
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,870
have a good talk with them.

181
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,000
So you just want to use my status
as a gang member, huh?

182
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,270
Director Shen has always admired

183
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,870
your character and ability.

184
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,240
This task of calming the people
is a heavy responsibility.

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,120
He can only

186
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,900
trust you with it.

187
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,960
Huang,

188
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,340
you finally said something right.

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,630
You little brat!

190
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,510
You just yelled at someone, didn't you?

191
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,120
Yes.

192
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,670
What's wrong with a kid
throwing coal at the car?

193
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,480
Did it hit you?

194
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,390
No.

195
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,000
Then why did you yell at him?

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,790
Why did you yell at a child?

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
If someone yelled at your child,

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,030
how would you feel?

199
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,600
That's just a child.

200
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,550
Apologize.

201
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,580
Why are you apologizing to me?

203
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,260
Apologize to the person

204
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,320
you just yelled at.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,790
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,670
I'm sorry, everyone.

207
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,550
Huang,

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
is this how you do your work?

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
You should be uniting everyone

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,700
and thinking about what's best for them.

211
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,420
Got it?

212
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,250
Got it, got it.

213
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,510
I... I...

214
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,870
I'll definitely change.

215
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,360
I'll definitely do better next time.

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,890
Don't you work for Mr. Zeng?

217
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,410
Are you also working for the government?

218
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,900
Yes.

219
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,670
I work for Mr. Zeng.

220
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
I'm here

221
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,740
mainly to cooperate with the government

222
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,500
to see what you need

223
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,000
and how I can help.

224
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Do you have a representative
who can give me more details?

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,220
Gu!

226
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,100
Gu!

227
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Gu, come here.

228
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,200
You're good with words.

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Talk to him.

230
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,910
Hello.

231
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,810
Here's my business card.

232
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,380
This is Mr. Shen

233
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
is a government official.

234
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm here mainly to assist him.

235
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
My last name is Gu.

236
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,600
Gentlemen, let's talk inside.

237
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,280
No need.

238
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,470
Let's talk right here.

239
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,870
You must be here to solve problems.

240
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,480
So you have to understand the conditions

241
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,750
in our shantytown.

242
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,080
Since you're already here,

243
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,740
let's talk about it in detail.

244
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,910
Otherwise, how will you know

245
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,910
the real lives of the common people?

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,390
Cheng Ao,

247
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,550
please go inside

248
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,870
and get more details about it from Mr. Gu.

249
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,550
I didn't bring any cigarettes.
I'll go buy a pack.

250
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,610
I'll be right back.

251
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,670
Wait.

252
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,590
I've got cigarettes and a lighter.

253
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,530
He's got cigarettes and a lighter.

254
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm not used to this brand.

255
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,990
Director Shen is not used to this brand.

256
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,790
Yes.

257
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,630
Director Shen
lives quite the privileged life.

258
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,790
Let's go, Mr. Gu.

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,810
Are you stupid?

260
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,660
Yes,

261
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm stupid.

262
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
Come.

263
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,610
Please come in.

264
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,840
Wait a moment, please.

265
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,390
Cheng.

266
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,420
Okay.

267
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,960
Here.

268
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,210
Have a seat.

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,530
Are you curious about
why I have so many books,

270
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,120
or do you not understand

271
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,520
why a laborer would read?

272
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,550
I am curious.

273
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,490
Mr. Cheng,

274
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,690
you just started working
for the government, right?

275
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,960
Why are you saying this?

276
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
The government officials I've seen

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,390
aren't like you.

278
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,480
To be honest,

279
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,000
no government official

280
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,960
has ever come to my place.

281
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,790
You're the first,

282
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,550
and probably the only one.

283
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,250
I'm not really a government official.

284
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm just here to help out.

285
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,730
No wonder.

286
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,550
Before I came here,

287
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,270
I had certain expectations
about the shantytown.

288
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,400
But after experiencing it firsthand,

289
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,620
I realized your suffering

290
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,580
is far worse than I imagined.

291
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,630
I'm glad to hear that.

292
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,790
So, how do you think these problems
should be solved?

293
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,150
I have a conscience,

294
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,080
but I'm not very optimistic

295
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,790
about this issue.

296
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Indeed.

297
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,550
Most people
are quite pessimistic nowadays.

298
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,040
But the more it's like this,

299
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,030
the more we need to be optimistic.

300
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,600
Mr. Gu,

301
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,250
you're one of the few.

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm just...

303
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,650
an optimist.

304
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,680
Jin.

305
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,780
Have a seat.

306
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,370
I'll stand, Master.

307
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,480
Any news from the young master?

308
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,490
I heard he's doing business
with some friends from the Northeast.

309
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,600
What kind of business?

310
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,930
I heard it's a fur trade.

311
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,390
These businessmen from the Northeast

312
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,650
seem to think highly of the young master.

313
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,060
Send him some money.

314
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,510
Tell him

315
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,000
not to associate with the Japanese.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,550
Okay,

317
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,090
I'll pass the message.

318
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,790
What about Ao?

319
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,730
What's he been up to?

320
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,630
Mr. Shen has been trying to get Ao

321
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,160
to work for the government.

322
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,670
He went there today.

323
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
That's good news.

324
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,510
Ao is smart and capable.

325
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,200
He can handle

326
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,000
working for the government.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,630
Master,

328
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,720
I heard Miss Lin is building a hospital,

329
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,380
but she's not using our funds.

330
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,090
Should I ask Ao about this?

331
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,660
No need.

332
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,850
Cheng Ao always knows what he's doing.

333
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,080
Although Miss Lin isn't using our funds,

334
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,150
as long as her hospital is completed

335
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,480
and turns a profit,

336
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,080
her brother
will naturally pay back the money.

337
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,410
He's handling it

338
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,510
very well.

339
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
You may go now.

340
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,910
I'll take my leave then, Master.

341
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,820
Sis,

342
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,730
here's a letter from Yi.

343
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,590
She asked me
to make sure I pass it to you.

344
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,680
Look at it.

345
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Yi's handwriting is so beautiful.

346
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,660
It's so elegant.

347
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,750
Do you think

348
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm too useless

349
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,550
as a mother?

350
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,150
My child can't even come home.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,530
Yi will blame me, won't she?

352
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,790
Yi won't blame you.

353
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,200
She's a smart kid.

354
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
You're right.

355
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,250
As long as she's doing well.

356
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,200
Let's not talk about this anymore.

357
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
How are you doing?

358
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,849
Are you still planning
to open the hospital?

359
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,530
Yes.

360
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm looking for investors now.

361
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,000
When the hospital is completed,

362
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,329
please come and help out

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
if you have time.

364
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,810
Sure.

365
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,010
As long as you don't mind having me.

366
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,420
I can take on hard work.

367
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,530
Sis, you're an excellent woman.

368
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,690
Be more confident in yourself.

369
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,420
Okay.

370
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,880
Mr. Gu, would you mind

371
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,890
recommending a few books to me?

372
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Mr. Cheng, what kind of books

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,590
do you usually read?

374
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,920
When I was in school,

375
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,750
I read books on law, literature,

376
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,680
and poetry.

377
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,560
But after graduation,

378
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,270
I mostly read documents and newspapers.

379
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,880
Then let me recommend some books

380
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,740
on Western philosophy, history,

381
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,950
and economics to you.

382
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,590
Great.

383
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,640
Thank you.

384
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,850
It's in English?

385
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,940
Well, as an optimistic
and knowledgeable young man,

386
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,590
how do you view

387
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,360
the current situation?

388
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,020
How should I put it?

389
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,750
I never expect the government

390
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,000
to solve the problems quickly.

391
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,080
But someone has to raise the issues first.

392
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,280
Looking at human history as a whole,

393
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,710
there has been progress.

394
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,640
However, this progress
doesn't happen all at once;

395
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,480
it's

396
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,050
a step-by-step process.

397
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,320
Sometimes, we may get lost,

398
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
take wrong turns,

399
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,920
or even go backward.

400
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,360
But those with determination

401
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,780
will always find the right direction

402
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,730
and reach the correct goal.

403
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,660
That

404
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,170
is progress.

405
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,320
Let's go.

406
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,330
Let's go out for a walk.

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,520
Okay.

408
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,790
There's enough for everyone.

409
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,400
Thank you.

410
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't worry. There's enough for everyone.

411
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,270
Thank you.

412
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,870
Thanks.

413
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,260
We made it, Ao.

414
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,260
Thank you.

415
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,880
Are you all upset

416
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,810
because your houses burned down?

417
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,160
It's okay.

418
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,160
I'll set aside

419
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,800
part of my monthly earnings

420
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,520
to help you build new houses.

421
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,550
Then you'll be able to live comfortably,

422
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,640
happily,

423
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,710
with enough to eat and warm clothes.

424
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,240
Don't be sad anymore, okay?

425
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,810
Are you handing out money?

426
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,350
My buddy Cheng Ao
really knows how to get things done.

427
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,240
Look, everyone's face

428
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
is glowing with happiness.

429
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,250
Mr. Gu,

430
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
the brother I brought today

431
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,270
has really helped a lot.

432
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,400
Wouldn't you agree?

433
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,780
Mr. Cheng,

434
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,480
thank you.

435
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,750
It's the least I could do.

436
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,830
The bag.

437
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,420
Your bag.

438
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,710
This is...

439
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,450
my money?

440
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,840
I left home in a hurry
and forgot to bring money.

441
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,140
You really know how to get things done.

442
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,590
Where did you find my bag?

443
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,450
I don't know.

444
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,400
I found it in the car.

445
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,370
Thanks.

446
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,130
We'll be going then.

447
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,130
Hold on to it.

448
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,960
Everyone, get some rest early.

449
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,310
Let's go.

450
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,790
You still have money?

451
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,390
Want to give some more to everyone?

452
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,480
I'll bring it myself another day.

453
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,740
No need for you to go through the trouble.

454
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,110
Why are you so quiet, Shen Yiqun?

455
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Lawyer Cheng, please stop asking.

456
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
It was my fault for not keeping
a better eye on Director Shen's bag today.

457
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,440
Huang, that's where you are wrong.

458
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,850
How could Director Shen blame you?

459
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,330
Our Director Shen is generous.

460
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,130
He puts people first
and loves to help others.

461
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,840
This little bit of money
means nothing to him.

462
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,570
Lawyer Cheng is right.

463
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Thank you, Huang.

464
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,780
Come to my office later.

465
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,000
Cheng Ao,

466
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,130
I really didn't misjudge you.

467
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,640
Your way of doing things
is unconventional,

468
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,590
but the results are always successful.

469
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,200
Come join our department quickly.

470
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
We'll team up and work together.

471
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,160
With Huang by your side,

472
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,300
you're good to go.

473
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,920
Who is it?

474
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,310
Miss Lin, it's me.

475
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,850
Cheng?

476
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Why are you here?

477
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,680
Well, our boss

478
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,000
called your house, but no one answered,

479
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,000
so he sent me to tell you something.

480
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,030
What is it?

481
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
He wants to know

482
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,960
if you can take a leave
from the hospital tomorrow.

483
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,690
He wants to take you somewhere.

484
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,590
Where to?

485
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,550
He didn't say,

486
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,380
but he mentioned you should bring

487
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
your medical tools and medical kit.

488
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,240
Okay, the time works for me.

489
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,790
Well,

490
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,510
I'll call him back later.

491
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,440
Alright. I'll be going then.

492
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,200
Okay.

493
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,810
Goodbye.

494
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,440
Miss Lin! Miss Lin!

495
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,370
Please stop moving them, will you?

496
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,480
Please stop.

497
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,110
Why?

498
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,830
You don't need to ask why.

499
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,440
Look, your forehead is covered in sweat.

500
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,680
You are sweating, right?

501
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,400
We've got so many brothers here.

502
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,100
-We can handle this ourselves, alright?
-It's okay.

503
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,900
I'm not tired.

504
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,000
This is Mr. Gu.

505
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,310
This is Miss Lin.

506
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,000
Miss Lin is a gynecologist.

507
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,030
She has basic medical knowledge.

508
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,770
She can help examine everyone

509
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,690
and check your health condition.

510
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,820
Nice to meet you, Miss Lin.

511
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,160
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gu.

512
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,270
To be honest,

513
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,640
we do have a woman here
who just gave birth

514
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,110
and has a persistent high fever.

515
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,640
Could you please take a look at her?

516
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,070
Sure.

517
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,550
Liu.

518
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,510
Take Dr. Lin to see Juan.

519
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,350
Sure.

520
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,160
This way, please.

521
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,720
Let's go.

522
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,070
Mr. Cheng.

523
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,200
Excuse me, Mr. Gu.

524
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,750
Cheng.

525
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,120
Ao.

526
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,780
You're quite strong, huh?

527
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,750
Well, I was just...

528
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,750
Skip lunch today.

529
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,670
Carry a couple more bags. Go.

530
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,110
What?

531
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,830
Go now.

532
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,350
Mr. Cheng, thank you.

533
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
With all this rice and flour,

534
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,090
you've really helped us a lot.

535
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm just doing what I can.

536
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,250
I know the situation here,

537
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,840
but I don't know
how many of these shantytowns

538
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,030
there are in Shanghai

539
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,350
or in all of China,

540
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,270
and how much I can help

541
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
or for how long.

542
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,790
Any act of kindness is precious.

543
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,130
I understand what you're saying.

544
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,470
For impoverished communities,

545
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,210
there should be
a complete social security system.

546
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,880
That's something you government officials

547
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,010
need to work hard on.

548
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,120
No.

549
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,550
You're not a government official.

550
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,950
You're just helping out.

551
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,350
Mr. Gu, do you think

552
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm cut out to be an official?

553
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,160
I don't care if you become
an official or not in the future.

554
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,070
I just hope you keep doing

555
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,980
what you're doing now.

556
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
If even people with a conscience
don't act,

557
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
then our country has no hope.

558
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,200
Your wife's infection was caused

559
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
by the midwife
not properly sterilizing her hands

560
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,060
and scissors during childbirth.

561
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,610
I don't have enough medicine with me now.

562
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,160
I'll apply some medication first.

563
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,000
You can bring her to Zhongde Hospital
tomorrow,

564
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,210
and I'll change her dressing then.

565
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,810
We need to go to the hospital?

566
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,970
She's been like this for a week.

567
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,260
If this continues,

568
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,330
your wife's life will be in danger.

569
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,200
Going to the hospital
costs a lot of money, right?

570
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,030
Don't worry.

571
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,520
I don't charge patients

572
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,720
from the shantytown.

573
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,970
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

574
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,210
Come in.

575
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,160
What's wrong?

576
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,070
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

577
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,920
Are all these your children?

578
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,680
Yes.

579
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,590
How many kids have you had?

580
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,240
10.

581
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,400
4 survived.

582
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,780
How old are you?

583
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,000
27.

584
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,790
How old were you
when you had your first child?

585
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,720
14.

586
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,860
Doctor,

587
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,840
I think I'm pregnant again.

588
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,910
Have you checked?

589
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,830
I've been pregnant ten times.

590
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,890
I have experience.

591
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,520
It hasn't been long
since you had this child, has it?

592
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,580
It's been 3 months.

593
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,750
This is very dangerous for you.

594
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,310
It could easily cause uterine rupture.

595
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,160
So, doctor,

596
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,750
I want to ask

597
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,570
if you can help me with an abortion.

598
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,000
The government regulations state

599
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,460
that abortion is illegal.

600
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,240
Doctor, please help me.

601
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,000
In this big fire,

602
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
we lost everything.

603
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,030
I'm pregnant now,

604
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,070
and my milk supply isn't good.

605
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,350
If I don't go out to work,

606
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,790
my children will die.

607
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,240
Tomorrow, I'll bring you

608
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,730
some formula and glucose.

609
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,960
From now on, I'll be responsible

610
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,440
for your children's food.

611
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,500
Thank you, doctor.

612
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,040
Also...

613
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,240
Tired?

614
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,590
You're very kind.

615
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,350
So are you.

616
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,780
We're the same.

617
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,430
That's why we can be friends.

618
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,160
Friends?

619
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,300
Aren't we friends?

620
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,720
Then what are we?

621
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,750
What relationship besides friendship

622
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,070
would allow you

623
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,030
to be driven home in my car?

624
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Do a lot of girls like you?

625
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,630
I don't know.

626
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,410
It doesn't matter.

627
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,330
I only care about the person I like.

628
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,670
What about you?

629
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,790
Same here.

630
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,990
What?

631
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
You didn't see me?

632
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,130
What a coincidence.

633
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,720
You two arrived at the same time.

634
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,520
It's not that.

635
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,070
We came together.

636
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,930
Cheng Ao drove to my place to pick me up.

637
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,400
Next time, I'll pick you up.

638
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
His car is no good.

639
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,370
It's too old, uncomfortable to sit in.

640
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,260
She hasn't sat on the back of a bike
for a long time.

641
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,590
Do I only have a bicycle?

642
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,790
Siyun,

643
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,070
I heard from Aunt Nan

644
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,300
that you're looking to meet some people

645
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,880
who can invest in your hospital.

646
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,030
I can introduce someone to you.

647
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,110
You know him.

648
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,240
He has influence in many of the big banks

649
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,110
in Shanghai.

650
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,020
It's that Under-Secretary Dong.

651
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,790
I've met him.

652
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, you have.

653
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,230
Is he reliable?

654
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,320
Absolutely.

655
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,110
Not only does he have
strength and influence,

656
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,570
but also an excellent character.

657
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,890
He's very respected

658
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,680
in our government units.

659
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,680
Go find him. I just saw him.

660
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,930
He's on the second floor.

661
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,130
Just mention my name.

662
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,240
Okay.

663
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,830
Go ahead.

664
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,880
Cheng Ao.

665
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,040
This is great.

666
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,880
From now on, we'll divide the work.

667
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
You handle picking up

668
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,510
and dropping off Siyun,

669
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
and I'll help her

670
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,040
with work-related issues.

671
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
You think you are quite something,
aren't you?

672
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,780
Don't block the doorway.

673
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,960
I wouldn't say I'm anything special.

674
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,760
We just each have our strengths.

675
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,030
Miss Lin,

676
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,510
what are you doing here?

677
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,840
Under-Secretary Dong?

678
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,510
Hello.

679
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,350
Hello.

680
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,200
Miss Lin,

681
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,590
how is the progress with the hospital?

682
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,720
Didn't we agree

683
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,030
that you'd invite me
to the opening ceremony?

684
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,890
I've run into some difficulties.

685
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,590
Difficulties?

686
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,680
What kind of difficulties?

687
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,410
Just tell me.

688
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,480
If I can help,

689
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,400
I'll do my best.

690
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,200
I've already found the doctors, nurses,

691
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,350
and the location.

692
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,880
I just need the investment.

693
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,360
I've visited a few banks,

694
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,680
but they've all rejected me
with various excuses.

695
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,440
I know

696
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,120
you're a shareholder
in several major banks.

697
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,630
If you're willing to help me

698
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,890
by making a connection with these banks,

699
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,640
that would be a huge help.

700
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,030
You could also invest yourself,
if you'd like.

701
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,070
I see.

702
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,310
How about

703
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,570
we find a place

704
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,010
to discuss this over tea?

705
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,790
Sure.

706
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,620
After you.

707
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,930
Ao,

708
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,910
I heard from Jin

709
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,860
that you've been working
for the government lately.

710
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,680
Yes.

711
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,600
A few days ago, Shen Yiqun took me

712
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,070
to visit the shantytown.

713
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,230
I saw that the place

714
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,440
was really uninhabitable at the moment,

715
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,100
so I just offered a bit of help.

716
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,640
Father, if you have time,
you should go take a look.

717
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,720
I think they need

718
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,310
philanthropists like you

719
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,110
over there.

720
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,170
Great.

721
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,350
Young people

722
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,920
should have ideals and ambitions.

723
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,270
Alright.

724
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,250
Find some time
to take me there and have a look.

725
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,210
Alright. That's wonderful.

726
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,240
Sir,

727
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,520
here's your tea.

728
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Your tea.

729
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,750
Enjoy.

730
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,900
Wait.

731
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,470
Sir, you look very familiar.

732
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,590
Have we met somewhere before?

733
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,880
Father, are you mistaking him
for someone else?

734
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,400
Sir, you must have mistaken me
for someone else.

735
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,070
May I...

736
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,070
know your name?

737
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,090
My name is He Yaozu.

738
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,530
In the 16th year of the Republic of China,

739
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,240
I met a young man in Nanjing.

740
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,730
His name was Luo Yinghan.

741
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,440
He was a student leader

742
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,480
with strong organizational skills

743
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,230
whose speeches

744
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,640
were very inspiring.

745
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,880
He looks a lot like you.

746
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
Sir, I think you must have mistaken me
for someone else.

747
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm from Jiangxi.

748
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,750
I've never been to Nanjing,
nor have I ever been educated.

749
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,070
I'm just an ordinary waiter.

750
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,560
Nice to meet you.

751
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,450
Nice to meet you too.

752
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,240
It seems I really have mistaken you
for someone else.

753
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,110
However,

754
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,030
Mr. He, if you have the chance

755
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,750
to meet Luo Yinghan in the future,

756
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,880
please tell him

757
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,219
that I admire his talents

758
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,239
and respect his character.

759
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
If possible,

760
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,030
I could

761
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,679
help him find a very good job

762
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,560
with a high salary.

763
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,130
Alright, if I get the chance,

764
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,940
I will definitely pass on the message.

765
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,670
Thank you.

766
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Enjoy, sir.

767
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Miss Lin,

768
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,280
I can help you establish this hospital.

769
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,540
But what's in it for me?

770
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,060
You can become a shareholder
in the hospital.

771
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,460
We can work together
to ensure its success.

772
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,670
I'm not interested in running a hospital.

773
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,880
Then what do you want?

774
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,890
I didn't mistake him for someone else.

775
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,250
I just don't understand

776
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,400
why he's here.

777
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,280
Father,

778
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,280
you're talking about...

779
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,230
The waiter

780
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,710
who just claimed to be He Yaozu.

781
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,710
He disguised himself well.

782
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,010
However,

783
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
he can't fool me.

784
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,780
I served in the army
during the Qing Dynasty,

785
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,380
and I've fired foreign guns.

786
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,410
In the Republic of China,

787
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,220
I followed General Wu

788
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,820
and led over 1,000 soldiers.

789
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,560
Just now, when I shook his hand,

790
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,540
I could feel that his hand
had been holding guns for years.

791
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,670
So,

792
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,400
what exactly does he do?

793
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,920
He's a Communist Party member.

794
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,990
No matter what he calls himself.

795
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,920
Father,

796
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,310
we can't carelessly label someone

797
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,540
as a Communist.

798
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,510
He was that student leader from back then—

799
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,190
leading street marches,
petitions, and protests—

800
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,960
very active.

801
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,000
He really does have organizational skills.

802
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,810
In the 16th year of the Republic of China,

803
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,360
Chiang Kai-shek launched
the anti-Communist purge.

804
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,290
He was arrested.

805
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,360
I thought he must have died young

806
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,250
and was sorry about it
for quite some time.

807
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,640
I didn't expect he'd actually survive.

808
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,490
He must have suffered a lot.

809
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,440
Father, what did you mean

810
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,630
when you said

811
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,170
you'd find him a job?

812
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,440
I meant it sincerely.

813
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,800
He truly is very capable.

814
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,320
If he can be of use to us,

815
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,050
that would be great.

816
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,550
But if not—

817
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,000
remember,

818
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,840
we must never offend someone like him.

819
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,290
We're living in chaotic times.

820
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,840
To survive and thrive,

821
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,940
we absolutely cannot afford
to offend capable people,

822
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
no matter which party

823
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,820
they belong to.

824
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,360
Understood.

825
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,510
Mr. Zeng.

826
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,220
Director Shen.

827
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Cheng Ao was just talking about you.

828
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,440
Thank you for giving him the opportunity

829
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,190
to contribute
to the victims of the disaster.

830
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,800
Mr. Zeng,

831
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,480
Cheng Ao is a very resourceful person.

832
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
If it weren't for him,

833
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,620
the issues in the shantytown

834
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,550
wouldn't have been resolved so smoothly.

835
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,750
Let me introduce you.

836
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,670
This is my cousin, Major Zheng.

837
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,330
He now works for Commander Ji.

838
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,840
Major Zheng, it's a pleasure to meet you.

839
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,760
Nice to meet you.

840
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,630
Nice to meet you.

841
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,170
Major Zheng, are you here

842
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,280
on official business
or is it something personal?

843
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I came here with my commander.

844
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,160
What a promising young man.

845
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,000
Alright, you guys go ahead and talk.

846
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,860
I, as an old man, won't interrupt.

847
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,590
Commander Ji will be here soon.

848
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,590
I'll go pick him up.

849
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,120
Go ahead.

850
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,910
Have you been busy with work lately?

851
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,940
Not really.

852
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,220
Such a big event—

853
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,740
even your father attended.

854
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,360
He is

855
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,820
your cousin's commander?

856
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,440
Yes.

857
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,320
This man
has a mysterious and complex background.

858
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,070
He was once
a senior Communist Party member

859
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,920
but later defected to the Kuomintang.

860
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,730
I heard that in recent years,

861
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,880
the Chairman set up a secret organization

862
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,410
targeting the Communists,

863
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,040
and he's one of the leaders.

864
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,190
Just last month,

865
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,910
more than 20 Communists

866
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,070
were caught by their organization.

867
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,270
The Communist Party hates him to death.

868
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,960
He's a turncoat.

869
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,300
If the Japanese give him some benefit,

870
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,740
he'll become a traitor.

871
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,170
You think he doesn't know

872
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,570
what kind of person he is?

873
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,670
A person either never betrays
or betrays countless times.

874
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,470
No one will ever truly trust him.

875
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,190
His life isn't easy.

876
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,110
The Communist "Dog Beating Squad"
has been keeping a close eye on him.

877
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,840
He rarely shows up

878
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,370
at public events like this.

879
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,410
See? He even

880
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,960
brought two people with him here today.

881
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,000
Dog Beating Squad?

882
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,410
You don't know it?

883
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,090
It's an organization the Communist Party

884
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,650
set up to root out traitors.

885
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,590
His name is definitely high

886
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,550
on their list.

887
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,520
They're watching him this closely,

888
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,920
so why does he still dare to show up?

889
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,190
The fact that he shows up

890
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,800
means there's something attracting him.

891
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,760
Let me test you.

892
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,700
What do you think it is?

893
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,380
Look at that clueless expression of yours.

894
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,710
Power

895
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,800
and women.

896
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,480
Then isn't he just like you?

897
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,590
Shut up.

898
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,080
I heard what you two were saying.

899
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,500
When did you learn to eavesdrop?

900
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,590
Dad told you

901
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,770
not to talk about politics in public.

902
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,400
I wasn't.

903
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,460
I was teaching him.

904
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,480
Nonsense.

905
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,480
Does Cheng Ao need you to teach him that?

906
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,280
Then I'll teach you.

907
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
I'll teach you...

908
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,490
Don't get physical.

909
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,880
It's good
that Lin Siyun didn't come today.

910
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,730
She's here.

911
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,170
She's meeting someone
your brother introduced her to.

912
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,510
Who did you introduce her to?

913
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,650
Under-Secretary Dong.

914
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,650
That old pervert?

915
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,340
He's hit on so many girls in our class.

916
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,280
You...

917
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,800
Miss Lin,

918
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
I've always admired you.

919
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,110
You're educated, beautiful,

920
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,360
and smart.

921
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,950
You should know what I want.

922
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,790
Don't go.

923
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,110
We can discuss terms.

924
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,090
I can give you a house,

925
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,980
money,

926
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,590
and a life of comfort.

927
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,170
As for the hospital,

928
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,350
if you're interested,
you can run one for fun.

929
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,080
How about it?

930
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,400
Under-Secretary Dong,

931
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,460
please step aside.

932
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,110
You're here anyway.

933
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,370
You're not a little girl anymore, right?

934
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,890
Miss Lin,

935
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,670
I like you. Let's just have some fun.

936
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,510
I'm telling you, struggling won't help.

937
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,970
What game are you playing?

938
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,800
You dare stab me?

939
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm telling you,

940
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,000
this isn't over!

941
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,000
Under-Secretary Dong,

942
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,020
what happened to you?

943
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,280
Who did you introduce me to?

944
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,540
Look what she did to me.

945
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,720
You...

946
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,090
Don't mind him. He's always like that.

947
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,900
Don't stoop to Siyun's level.

948
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,440
Please calm down.

949
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,030
I can't calm down. I'm telling you.

950
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,230
As long as I'm around,

951
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,200
she will never

952
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,800
be able to open that hospital.

953
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,190
Let's not talk about the hospital now.

954
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,920
She was definitely wrong
to have stabbed you.

955
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I'll make sure to teach her a lesson.

956
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,930
How about this?

957
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
I'll take you to the hospital now.

958
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,880
Tomorrow,

959
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,560
I'll visit you at your residence

960
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,760
with 3 gold bars.

961
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,960
Three gold bars,

962
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,760
and you think that's enough
to deal with me?

963
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,920
Who do you think I am?

964
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,860
You've misunderstood me.

965
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,190
You're in a high position;

966
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,840
surely this small gift is nothing.

967
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
This is just a token of my sincerity.

968
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,210
Under-Secretary Dong,

969
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,440
I heard

970
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,840
your son has always wanted
to attend military academy.

971
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,700
How about this?

972
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,030
Leave it to me,

973
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,360
and I promise
to arrange everything properly

974
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,480
so your son can go with honor.

975
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,110
Additionally,

976
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,760
he'll receive

977
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,630
special attention from his teachers
at the academy.

978
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,710
You can make this happen?

979
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,480
Absolutely.

980
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,000
Good.

981
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,240
You said that.

982
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:01,960
Yes.

983
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,550
I'll be expecting you tomorrow night.

984
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,190
Alright.

985
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,960
Well,

986
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,190
let me take you to the hospital.

987
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,650
No need. I'll go by myself.

988
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,710
Take care.

989
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,800
Are you alright?
