[Episode 7]

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,350
Zhaoyuan.

4
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,000
Fine, Zhou Zhaoyuan, Zhou Zhaoyuan.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
I want to apply to military school

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,039
and serve on the front lines
against the Japanese.

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,820
That's great.

8
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,380
Then you're sure
to become an excellent soldier.

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,790
Don't laugh. I mean it.

10
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,150
I mean it, too.

11
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,590
If you need it,

12
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,530
I'll write you a recommendation letter.

13
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,520
Right now, all I want is to graduate
from middle school as soon as possible.

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,630
There was a man in the Song dynasty

15
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,810
who saw his crops weren't growing,
so he pulled them up

16
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,960
and went home exhausted.

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,090
What does that mean?

18
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,630
Pulling up seedlings
to help them grow never works.

19
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,400
See?

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,450
You really should read more books.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,150
I'm done with you.

22
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,800
Are you mad?

23
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,300
No.

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,350
I'll take you out for butterfly cookies.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,670
Two boxes.

26
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,120
Okay.

27
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,980
Deal.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,750
Let's go.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
Thanks for helping me this time.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,730
What do you mean?

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,770
It's a gift for your grand opening.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,910
Have a seat.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,550
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,079
I used to be selfish

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,750
and foolish,

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,630
always blind to my own faults.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,730
Coming back to the old house

38
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,400
seeing it like this

39
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,240
makes me truly happy.

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,160
And seeing
your maternity hospital doing so well,

41
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,590
I'm genuinely

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,060
happy for you, too.

43
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,400
I mean it.

44
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,640
Since Mom is staying at your place,

45
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,840
you should take good care of her.

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
I understand.

47
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,070
Mom's staying with me

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,030
and is being well taken care of,

49
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,120
so don't worry.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,850
Your sister-in-law

51
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,399
cooks three meals a day,

52
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,560
and all of them Mom's favorites.

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,070
When I have time,

54
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,960
I also take her out for walks

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,100
and chats.

56
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,430
Mom's really happy.

57
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,710
It's just that sometimes

58
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,640
she talks to herself,

59
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,600
saying she misses you a lot.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
Why don't you go visit her

61
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,950
when you're not busy?

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,750
I'm really sorry.

63
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,830
This gift

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,430
isn't expensive.

65
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,770
Just think of it as a small token

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,950
of my appreciation for your grand opening,

67
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,600
okay?

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,270
Please take good care of Meina.

69
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,500
She's very delicate,

70
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,390
and since it's her first pregnancy,

71
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,750
please look after her.

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,040
Meina?

73
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,240
Shao Meina?

74
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,680
The relative
Sis brought over yesterday?

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,390
Yeah.

76
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,630
What's your relationship with her?

77
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,670
No, our mom

78
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,500
is really happy this time.

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,310
I mean...

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,530
Mom asked

81
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,070
if you could

82
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,360
waive that fee for her.

83
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,830
We're all family.

84
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,460
Can't you just waive the fee?

85
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,560
Sis,

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
what are you doing?

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,630
Siyun is here.

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,420
Her feet are swollen,
so I'm soaking them for her.

89
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,820
Come with me to my office.

90
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,750
You go ahead then.

91
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
When you come back,
peel two apples for me.

92
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,110
Get out of the way.

93
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,630
What are you looking at?

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,230
I'm not done washing my feet.

95
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll help you.

96
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,600
Why are you so afraid of your sister?

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,730
Didn't you say this hospital is yours?

98
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,040
She's just helping you out, isn't she?

99
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm not afraid of her.

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,900
She's my little sister.

101
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,430
I was being nice to her.

102
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,360
You're not lying to me, are you?

103
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,790
Why would I lie to you?

104
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,990
I've been running this hospital
for quite a while.

105
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,820
Why did you wash her feet?

106
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,830
All I can do

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,000
is take care of the Lin family.

108
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,430
You don't need to do things like that!

109
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,510
It's fine.

110
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,570
I can endure it.

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
You can endure it?

112
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,409
For how long?

113
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,480
For a lifetime?

114
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll endure it...

115
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,300
for as long as it takes.

116
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
Mr. Cheng.

117
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,440
One of the few optimists.

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,820
I'd like to ask you a favor.

119
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,650
Some of my student friends

120
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,450
want to join
the volunteer army in the northeast.

121
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,630
Wu Xiaoshan?

122
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,350
Yes.

123
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,480
Sure,

124
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,390
I'll make the arrangements.

125
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,360
Thank you.

126
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,570
I'd like to ask you a favor, too.

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,550
We urgently need a batch of medicine

128
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,880
and medical equipment.

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Here's the medicine list and the deposit.

130
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,270
I only have one month

131
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,600
to gather and send them
to the front lines.

132
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,840
It's not easy to find
such a large quantity

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,610
of medicine and equipment.

134
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,400
I'll figure something out.

135
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,530
Keep the money.

136
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,970
I'll cover the cost.

137
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,840
That's a lot of money.

138
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,190
Consider it a token of my appreciation.

139
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,080
Fine.

140
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,110
I'll contact you

141
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,200
in a month.

142
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,350
Take care.

143
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,630
Cheng Ao, Cheng Ao.

144
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,250
Come and eat.

145
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,200
You're back.

146
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,510
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

147
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,910
I wanted to surprise you.

148
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,410
Go get Master.

149
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,360
Okay.

150
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,270
Come try my pickled cabbage pork stew.

151
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
This pot, half a pig,

152
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,840
and a few pounds of pickled cabbage—

153
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,950
I carried them all back
from the Northeast.

154
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,630
Here.

155
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,030
Did you go to the Northeast to be a chef?

156
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,030
Of course not.

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,750
I only cook for family.

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,630
Dad.

159
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,200
You're back.

160
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,240
You're only back because
you squandered all your money, right?

161
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
No, that's not it.

162
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,150
Call her Mom.

163
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,630
Mom.

164
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,490
It's your turn.

165
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,460
Madam Yanhong.

166
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,550
This is Dalun.

167
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,550
But don't believe

168
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,350
a word he says.

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,790
This is Cheng Ao,

170
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,360
our family's great lawyer.

171
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,840
Father, you're really something.

172
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,870
I just got back,

173
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,180
and suddenly
there's another little brother.

174
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,650
You're still
so full of energy at your age.

175
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,650
Enough nonsense.

176
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,550
Say it. Why are you back this time?

177
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,150
I came back to look after you.

178
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,650
I can't afford that kind of care.

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,870
Seriously,

180
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
I came back

181
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,990
with a government job this time.

182
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,270
Wherever you work,

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
don't cause me any more trouble.

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,400
Don't worry.

185
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,540
It's good to have you back.

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
How were things
with the Japanese in the Northeast?

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
Cheng Ao, what are you talking about?

188
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,870
How could I ever have dealings with them?

189
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,270
Dad taught us from childhood

190
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,070
never to deal with the Japanese.

191
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,010
Dad, I've always kept that in mind.

192
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
So, what did you cook?

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,060
Let me see.

194
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
Have a seat, Yanhong.

195
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,600
Dalun,

196
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,600
have the brothers sit and eat.

197
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Everyone, come sit and keep eating.

198
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Cheng Ao,

199
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,580
I was gone for just a while,

200
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,400
and now I have another brother?

201
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,840
How would I know?

202
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,960
It's my first time seeing her, too.

203
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,430
How do you know it's a boy?

204
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,350
I've actually looked into this.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,030
If the belly is pointy, it's a boy.

206
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,490
If it's round, it's a girl.

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,020
Hurry up.

208
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,600
Coming.

209
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,920
Here, Father.

210
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,080
Here, Mom.

211
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,020
Thank you.

212
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,710
Thank you, my dear.

213
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,240
Dad.

214
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Why not sit there?

215
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,680
I just got back,
so I wanted to sit close to you.

216
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,580
Aren't you hot?

217
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,030
This jacket's yours now.

218
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,120
Is it good?

219
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,430
Did you rob a salt vendor or what?

220
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,240
Try it yourself.

221
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,030
Yeah, it seems a bit salty.

222
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,910
Just a bit?

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't drink too much.

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,280
[Sinan Maternity Hospital]

225
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,030
Who are you?

226
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,990
I'm Lin Jinghan's daughter.

227
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,630
Oh, it's you.
Lin Jinghan told me about you.

228
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,320
I brought you some food.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,450
Did you make all this yourself?

230
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,750
There are vegetables, meat, and soup.

231
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,550
Go ahead, eat.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,260
You're so thoughtful.

233
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,260
My dad said

234
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,690
we should treat you well.

235
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,240
Things were better before.

236
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,200
At least this house was still ours.

237
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,480
What did you say?

238
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,410
When Grandpa was alive,

239
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,030
our family was very wealthy.

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Later, my grandpa passed away,

241
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
and my dad ran up a lot of debt,

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,460
so this house was mortgaged
to his creditor.

243
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,640
He used all the money
from selling the house to pay off debts.

244
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,000
Not a single penny was left.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,790
He still hasn't paid off the bank loans.

246
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,790
My dad's broke.

247
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,480
He's got nothing but debt.

248
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,390
You're saying Lin Jinghan's broke?

249
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,790
Isn't this hospital his?

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,270
This hospital isn't my father's.

251
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,630
It belongs to my aunt.

252
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,230
It has nothing to do with him.

253
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,390
He still owes the money
for your hospitalization.

254
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,080
Dad.

255
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,250
What are you doing here?

256
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,360
I came to bring her food.

257
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,310
Food's here. I'll get going.

258
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,880
Come, sit here.

259
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,330
What did she come here for?

260
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,110
Your daughter just told me

261
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,660
that you're broke,

262
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,940
and this hospital isn't yours either.

263
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,400
Was she telling the truth?

264
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,170
Of course not!

265
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,670
She lied to you.

266
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,970
That kid never tells the truth.

267
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,080
Jinghan, be honest with me.

268
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
I'm with you,

269
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
carrying your baby

270
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,460
because I love you for who you are,

271
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,390
not for your money.

272
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,510
Even if you're broke,

273
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,720
it doesn't matter.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,250
We can still earn together.

275
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,080
But I hope the one I love

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,720
tells me the truth

277
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,880
and doesn't lie.

278
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,390
I'll tell you the truth.

279
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,950
Promise you won't get mad?

280
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,660
Sure.

281
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,290
Couples should be honest with each other.

282
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:38,990
Yes,

283
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,890
I did lie to you.

284
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,440
But wasn't that because I love you?

285
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,010
I...

286
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,800
I just...

287
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,110
I was just afraid that in my state,

288
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,150
I'd lose you.

289
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm not having this baby!

290
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,890
I never should've married
a woman like you.

291
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Sis,

292
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,829
I don't pity you.

293
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,210
I care about you.

294
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,859
I know you want to be
a good daughter-in-law to the Lin family,

295
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,790
and a good mother to your children.

296
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,089
But sometimes, when it's necessary,

297
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,680
you need to be selfish

298
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,080
and think more about yourself.

299
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,280
I understand what you mean.

300
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
I've thought about that too.

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,290
Whenever Lin Jinghan acts ridiculously,

302
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,940
I really want to take my kids

303
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,440
and leave the Lin family
without looking back.

304
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,720
But where could I go?

305
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
Back to my parents' home?

306
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,400
I can already picture the villagers

307
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,250
drowning me with their gossip.

308
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,110
I can hardly support myself.

309
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,920
I can't let my kids suffer with me, can I?

310
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,810
It's not that you can't—

311
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,690
you just don't dare.

312
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,830
You still have me.

313
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,830
Mom, I avenged you.

314
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
What do you mean?

315
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,930
You'll see when we get there.

316
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,460
Let's go.

317
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,820
Hurry up.

318
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,530
Why is your nose bleeding?

319
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,590
Yi's soup is good.

320
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,110
I just had a few sips.

321
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,110
Are you okay?

322
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,990
I'm fine.

323
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,280
Then let me tell you something.

324
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,960
Go ahead.

325
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,040
I already covered the medical bills

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,450
from the past few days.

327
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,960
But the hospital shareholders said

328
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,510
if you don't pay the rest,

329
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,570
they'll sue you.

330
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,600
You could even be detained.

331
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,130
Don't bring that up with me.

332
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,770
My baby's not even born yet.

333
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,370
Why should I pay the rest now?

334
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,720
Besides,

335
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
don't treat family like outsiders.

336
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,440
We're family.

337
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,550
Asking me for money

338
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
only hurts our feelings.

339
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Auntie, you already tried talking to him.

340
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,570
My dad just won't listen. Let's go.

341
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,380
Wipe your nose.

342
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,480
What should we do?

343
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Are they really going to detain you?

344
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,960
Actually,

345
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,500
our house is pretty comfortable.

346
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Why don't we just go home?

347
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,880
Besides,

348
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,860
If I get detained,

349
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,110
no one will take care of you.

350
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,730
You still need care after childbirth.

351
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,160
Sometimes you put up with the small stuff
for the bigger plan.

352
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
How did I marry such a useless man?

353
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,560
Honey...

354
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,320
Do you want me to slap you again?

355
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,370
Let's pack up.

356
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,790
Stay right there.

357
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,310
Zeng Dalun.

358
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,920
Why are you back?

359
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,430
When did you get back?

360
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,290
I just got back.

361
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,570
Hold on. Why are you dressed like that?

362
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,110
Shouldn't you be in a long gown

363
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,170
with a bunch of sidekicks behind you?

364
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,000
You came here today—

365
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,010
Did you get yourself into trouble again?

366
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,890
That mess with Xiu last time—

367
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,450
you caused such a big scene!

368
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,400
Your father's been
cleaning up after you every day.

369
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,660
You're the eldest son of the Zeng family.

370
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,610
Can't you give your family a break?

371
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,910
So tell me, what is it this time?

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,940
Let's see if I can help.

373
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,870
No need.

374
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,750
I found a job.

375
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,880
With your status,
you don't need to find a job.

376
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,510
Just don't cause your father more trouble.

377
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,440
I'm working for Mr. Dai now.

378
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,510
Mr. Dai?

379
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,270
Which Mr. Dai?

380
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,880
How many Mr. Dais do you think there are?

381
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,610
Dalun,

382
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,200
it's been ages

383
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,570
since we last met.

384
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,590
How about this?
Tomorrow night, dinner's on me.

385
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,720
Let me throw you a welcome party, okay?

386
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

387
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,620
Hello?

388
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,240
This is Shen Yiqun.

389
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,830
What's wrong?

390
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,720
Do me a favor.

391
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,310
Set up a dinner for me and Zeng Dalun.

392
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,800
Why do you want to have dinner with Dalun?

393
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,320
Don't ask why.

394
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,400
Just set it up for me.

395
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,670
I'll have someone send you
the address tomorrow.

396
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,150
Alright, got it.

397
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,700
[Registration Counter]

398
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,480
I never thought

399
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,790
you'd actually open a hospital
on your own.

400
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,250
And it's doing quite well.

401
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,740
That's thanks to Mrs. Shen's foresight.

402
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,270
I planned to leave without a word,

403
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,330
but then I thought,

404
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,070
I should come and see you one last time.

405
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,110
Where are you going?

406
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,200
I'm going abroad to study.

407
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,000
That's great.

408
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,330
What will you study?

409
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,160
Aren't you going to ask me?

410
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,510
What are you going to study?

411
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm going to New York to study finance.

412
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,080
You should work hard.

413
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,080
When I'm back from the U.S.,

414
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll buy your hospital.

415
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,830
Goodbye, Lin Siyun.

416
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
I thought she'd study medicine.

417
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,720
Why?

418
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,670
To follow in your footsteps.

419
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,110
You're so outstanding.

420
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,140
Every girl in Shanghai

421
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,270
sees you as a role model, right?

422
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Didn't you notice

423
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,180
she didn’t even look at you just now?

424
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,420
Do you know why?

425
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,350
Why?

426
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,460
Cheng Ao,

427
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,010
you've lost your charm.

428
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,670
Mom, if you keep living in that house,

429
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,440
Dad and his mistress will drive you crazy!

430
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,160
Why don't you come work with Auntie?

431
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
Look at Mrs. Chen—she can't even read

432
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,560
but she's learning
to be a midwife with Auntie.

433
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,830
Mom, don't you see?

434
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,640
Dad never treated us
as decent human beings.

435
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,100
He sold me to the Zhu family

436
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,700
just to pay off his gambling debt.

437
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,580
And now he's even making you
take care of his mistress,

438
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,640
which triggered your heart disease!

439
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,440
Mom, my little brother's still so young.

440
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,550
We all need you.

441
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,720
Dr. Lin,

442
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I have something important to ask.

443
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,170
That's quite a lot.

444
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,920
These medicines and equipment
are hard to get,

445
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,480
and they're all under quota limits.

446
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,330
The amount you're asking for is so large.

447
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,520
Even if I gave you
the hospital's entire stock,

448
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
it still wouldn't be enough.

449
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,590
How about this?

450
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,690
I’ll find a way.

451
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,410
I'll order more under the hospital's name.

452
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,240
I only have one month

453
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,100
to gather this batch of medicine.

454
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,940
Your hospital alone
definitely won't cover it.

455
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,590
If I go to the national hospital,

456
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,390
it surely will raise suspicion.

457
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,680
So I'm thinking of
going through foreign hospitals,

458
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,850
like the missionary hospital
or the Red Cross hospital.

459
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,890
Do you have connections there?

460
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,440
I know people at both.

461
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,790
But the quantity
you're asking for is huge.

462
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,670
You'd better come up
with a convincing reason.

463
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,550
Why are you buying

464
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
so much medicine?

465
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Getting medical supplies is obviously

466
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,090
for saving lives and doing good deeds.

467
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,520
What good deeds?

468
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,270
I can't tell you right now.

469
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,480
You're asking me for a favor,
and you won't even tell me that?

470
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
I'll tell you when the time is right.

471
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,310
What's wrong with you?

472
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,710
Asking for a favor,
but only telling half the story.

473
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,070
What's wrong with you?

474
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,490
You're way too curious.

475
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,390
I'm not curious

476
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,820

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,900
You got here pretty early.

511
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,720
Since I'm having dinner
with my two best brothers,

512
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,180
of course I had to come early
to set things up.

513
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,520
Cheng Ao,

514
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,200
since you invited us,

515
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,480
you should take the main seat.

516
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,130
Sit.

517
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,640
Dalun,

518
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,670
come and sit here.

519
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,430
Give me your glass.

520
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,890
Alright.

521
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,280
My two brothers,

522
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm a few years older than you two,

523
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
so let me say a few words first, okay?

524
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,310
I came early,

525
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,500
so I went ahead and ordered the dishes.

526
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,030
There are meat and vegetables,
quite a feast.

527
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,510
Cheng Ao, for this first glass,

528
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,570
don't drink it yet.

529
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
I want to toast Dalun.

530
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,680
Dalun,

531
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,070
you've been away for quite a long time.

532
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,790
You must've suffered a lot

533
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,070
and faced some hardships out there,

534
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,750
right?

535
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,200
But now you're back,

536
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,540
and we're here to welcome you home.

537
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,170
Cheers.

538
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,550
Cheng Ao, let me tell you.

539
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,480
Dalun's done well in his study.

540
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,110
He came back with real accomplishments.

541
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,920
Now he's working for Mr. Dai.

542
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,160
Trust me,

543
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,590
in two years at most,

544
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
Dalun will definitely be

545
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,400
the top leader in our department.

546
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,510
By then,

547
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,540
I'll serve you with all I've got.

548
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,180
Alright, it's time to eat.

549
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,550
Let's raise our glasses

550
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,000
and make a toast.

551
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,070
Cheers.

552
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,790
Shen Yiqun.

553
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,920
I really hate you.

554
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,950
You should know that, right?

555
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
I really had no idea.

556
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,110
Did I do something wrong

557
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,960
that upset you?

558
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
Tell me and I'll change.

559
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,530
Cheng Ao.

560
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,310
Don't you find him annoying as well?

561
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,310
Let's eat.

562
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,030
Shen Yiqun.

563
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,000
Look how hypocritical you are.

564
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,640
You always tell people
what they want to hear.

565
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,520
Especially when you meet someone,

566
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,380
you always put on that fake smile.

567
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,770
It's disgusting.

568
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,270
It makes me sick.

569
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,030
You know what?

570
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,480
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

571
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Do you think you deserve to dine with me?

572
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,880
Who do you think you are?

573
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,000
Stand up.

574
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,790
Go take a piss

575
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,210
and take a look at yourself.

576
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,510
Were you even born a human?

577
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,110
Dalun.

578
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,110
You don't want to eat properly, huh?

579
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,710
Then let me treat you to something else.

580
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,610
You brought the military police
to dine with me?

581
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,440
No,

582
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,510
Cheng Ao, don't get the wrong idea.

583
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,720
We're brothers.

584
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,510
I trust you completely.

585
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,440
But him?

586
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,580
He's not worthy.

587
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,920
Zeng Dalun.

588
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,170
You still don't know your place.

589
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,960
You've only been
in the Shanghai circle for a few years,

590
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,890
and you're already this arrogant?

591
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,080
A gang has its rules,
and a family has its own laws.

592
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,420
In terms of seniority,

593
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,280
you're nowhere close to me.

594
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,820
Take him out.

595
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,080
Teach him a lesson.

596
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,270
Alright, alright.

597
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,430
Dalun, apologize to him.

598
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,150
Do you think this is acceptable?

599
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
You're really tough.

600
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,870
When you act tough like this,

601
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,080
it actually scares me a little.

602
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,980
I can't just let a tiger
return to the mountain.

603
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,750
So...

604
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,140
you'd better not leave.

605
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,060
Kill him.

606
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,710
It doesn't take two guns to kill one man.

607
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,590
Come on.

608
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,880
Tell your men to do it.

609
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,630
Come on.

610
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,420
Come on!

611
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,680
Dalun,

612
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,370
let's go.

613
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,940
You didn't bring
the military police this time?

614
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,360
It was my fault

615
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,490
for bringing you two together for a meal.

616
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,410
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,780
I just hope you're not mad.

618
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,480
Wait a minute.

619
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,150
This is the first time

620
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,080
I've ever drunk like this for a man.

621
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,110
The last time I drank like this,

622
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,110
I was 20 years old.

623
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,330
I drank like that for a girl.

624
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,710
She was going to study abroad,

625
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,440
and I rode my bike to see her off.

626
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,760
Where are you going?

627
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,090
I'm going to see a movie.

628
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
Sis,

629
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,670
I really didn't expect

630
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,330
Yi could convince you and Mom.

631
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm quite surprised.

632
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,150
She's your mother's eldest grandchild.

633
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,480
Don't you know her well?

634
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,320
Siyun.

635
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,700
I don't know anything about this.

636
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,150
Can I really make it?

637
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,590
Sis,

638
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
don't be nervous.

639
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,890
I'll teach you step by step.

640
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,410
Siyun,

641
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,400
thank you.

642
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,810
Don't be formal with me.

643
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,550
Alright, I won't be formal then.

644
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,510
I'll definitely try my best to learn.

645
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,030
Let's go

646
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,760
Let's go.

647
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,040
Dalun, what happened to your hand?

648
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
It's nothing.

649
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,150
I got injured during a mission.

650
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,150
It's good that it's nothing serious.

651
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,800
I have something to tell both of you.

652
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,280
We've recently received intel

653
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,680
that the Communist Party

654
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,470
is planning several
large-scale operations in Shanghai.

655
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,880
I want both of you to investigate it.

656
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
You must find out

657
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
exactly what they're plotting.

658
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,550
Director,

659
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,070
I've received intel on this too.

660
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,230
The moment I got the message,

661
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,510
I sent people to investigate.

662
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,440
I believe we'll have results soon.

663
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,320
Jin.

664
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
This is a list

665
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,040
of Communists I've recently captured,

666
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,190
including some pro-Communist people.

667
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,510
Recruit those we can,

668
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,600
and for the rest,

669
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,590
arrest them all.

670
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,200
Those who resist publicly,

671
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,590
kill them all.

672
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,410
But...

673
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
do not reveal your identity.

674
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,400
Yiqun,

675
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,970
Dalun's been working
at the periphery for us.

676
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,610
You two must stay united

677
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,960
and work diligently together.

678
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,090
The organization is fair
with rewards and punishments.

679
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,950
Director, rest assured,

680
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,110
we'll work hard

681
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,330
and stay united.

682
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,250
Good. Cheers.

About that batch of medicine
you mentioned last time,

685
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,930
I've thought of a solution.

686
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,480
Sichuan is currently

687
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,230
suffering from famine and plague.

688
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,720
We can hold a charity fundraiser

689
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,560
for the disaster victims
under the hospital's name.

690
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,140
First, we can actually help the victims.

691
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,330
Second, it gives you a cover

692
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,030
to collect the medicine
and equipment you need.

693
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,740
You can blend in legitimately

694
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,070
without arousing suspicion.

695
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,200
I thought of that too.

696
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,680
With such a large demand,

697
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,590
a charity fundraiser is the only option.

698
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,070
And with this excuse,

699
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,870
we can also contact
the local Red Cross hospital.

700
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,960
They must have

701
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,090
a large quantity of this type of medicine.

702
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,230
We're on the same page.

703
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
That solves the supply problem.

704
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,670
But with the current drug controls,

705
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,480
have you figured out how to

706
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,010
move them from Shanghai
to your destination?

707
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,480
Not yet.

708
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,560
Let's watch the movie first.

709
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,280
Someone's following us.

710
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,250
Don't look.

711
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,080
It could be one of Zeng Dalun's men.

712
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,230
Cheng Ao,

713
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,080
your hands are sweating.

714
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,430
There's no Zeng Dalun's people
here at all, right?

715
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,610
Maybe I was mistaken.

716
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,320
It's nice holding hands
while watching a movie like this.
