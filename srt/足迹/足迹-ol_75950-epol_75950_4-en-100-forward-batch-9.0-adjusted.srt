the result will be the same.

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,800
I know that

118

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000

Miss Lin, your broken engagement

123
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,040
did stir up some prejudice,

124
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,790
but

125
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,680
the educated scholars

I may not be a man of status,

131
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,960
Today I'd like to offer you some advice

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
in my professional capacity.

133
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,620
Mr. Qiao has given his orders.

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,390
All Chinese banks in Shanghai

135
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,890
will shut their doors to you.

136
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,610
Have you considered

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,510
the consequences?

138
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,270
If you overthink things,

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
you'll never get anything done.

140
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm having coffee with you.

141
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,760
Won't Miss Shen mind?

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,360
Overthinking

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
means nothing gets done.

144
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,900
Besides, there's

145
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,030
nothing special between her and me.

146
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,360
You know the Zeng family
can provide loans,

147
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,270
right?

148
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,440
Yes.

149
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,630
Mr. Zeng may come from the underworld,

150
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,070
but

151
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,180
he's still a traditional man

152
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,210
who values integrity.

153
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,680
Your brother can't repay the money

154
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,340
because he lacks the ability.

155
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,790
Mr. Zeng is naturally unhappy about it.

156
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,590
But you're different, Miss Lin.

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
I've done some rough research.

158
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,870
Opening a private maternity
hospital in Shanghai

159
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,120
can be profitable.

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
At the very least,

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,410
it won't lose money.

162
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,620
Isn't Mr. Zeng

163
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,890
afraid of crossing Mr. Qiao?

164
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,080
Now I'm sitting here

165
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,700
discussing this with you.

166
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,390
Doesn't that answer your question?

167
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,720
I don't mean to look down
on you or Mr. Zeng.

168
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,570
I just want my hospital's background

169
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,350
to stay as clean as possible.

170
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,600
If that's the case,

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,260
regarding Mr. Zeng's matter,

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,340
I won't push it.

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,740
I can give you another advice.

174
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,590
Since all Chinese banks in Shanghai
have shut their doors to you,

175
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,190
you could try foreign banks.

176
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,210
When I was studying in England,

177
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,159
I had a classmate

178
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,460
who works at a British bank.

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,060
I can introduce you to him.

180
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,000
But to get a bank loan,

181
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,910
you'll need collateral.

182
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,470
I have nothing to my name.

183
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,580
What can I use as collateral?

184
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,370
Real estate, for example.

185
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,860
Lin Jinghan would never agree to that.

186
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,010
But you own a share of

187
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,370
the Lin family house,

188
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,600
Miss Lin.

189
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Otherwise?

190
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,690
Do you have any other options?

191
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,850
Why are you helping me

192
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,050
and giving me advice?

193
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,630
Maybe because

194
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,470
the way you held that knife
was unforgettable.

195
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,670
Are you okay, Mom?

196
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,750
Don't worry.

197
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,500
Lin Siyun,

198
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,750
did you deliberately
make the floor so slippery?

199
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,080
Were you trying to kill me

200
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,440
or our mother?

201
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,510
Come on.

202
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,600
Come out.

203
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,020
I need to talk to you.

204
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,320
You know you have
a fourth aunt in Suzhou, right?

205
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,050
Fourth aunt?

206
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Here's the thing.

207
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,390
Our house is going to be sold

208
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,720
to pay off debts,

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,580
and we all have to move out.

210
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
But fortunately,

211
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,870
our fourth aunt in Suzhou
is willing to take you in.

212
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,930
I actually think this is a good thing.

213
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,630
Because in Suzhou,

214
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,080
no one knows the shameful mess

215
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,670
you made in Shanghai.

216
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,630
If someone takes a liking to you,

217
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,980
you might still
marry into a wealthy family.

218
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,240
Wouldn't that be nice?

219
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,040
I have a share in this house.

220
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,950
You haven't read Father's will, have you?

221
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,810
It's written there, plain as day.

222
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,920
The house and all assets belong to me,

223
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
and I'll take care of our mother.

224
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,660
It also states that for the
unmarried daughter of the Lin family,

225
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,060
I need to provide monthly living expenses.

226
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,790
But now I wonder

227
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,700
if you were married

228
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,230
or not.

229
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,030
It doesn't matter.

230
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,600
If you have any difficulties in the future

231
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
or any problems, just come to me,

232
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,240
okay?

233
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,950
I want to see the will.

234
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,640
Go ahead.

235
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Anytime you want.

236
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,790
It's kept at the lawyer's office.

237
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,670
10 days.

238
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,320
In 10 days,

239
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
someone from Suzhou will come to get you.

240
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
Get ready

241
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,360
and pack your things.

242
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
Don't leave behind any gold

243
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
or valuables.

244
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,870
Lin Jinghan, you're ridiculous.

245
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,330
Why should I follow your arrangements?

246
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,390
You're a public disgrace—
do you even realize that?

247
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,600
All of Shanghai

248
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,870
knows your name.

249
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,660
It's even in the papers.

250
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,890
You're like a broken drum—

251
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
everyone takes a swing at you.
Do you get it?

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Going to Suzhou is your best way out.

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm doing you a favor.

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,080
Fine.

255
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,490
Thank you for your concern.

256
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,780
I need to rest now.

257
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Just one more thing.

258
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,260
you don't need

259
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,030
to worry about Yi.

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
I've already spoken

261
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,860
with Zhu's old lady...

262
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,670
Did you understand what I said?

263
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,930
Sweet dreams.

264
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,290
Mom.

265
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,040
The will indeed states

266
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,480
that all of Mr. Lin's property

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
shall be inherited by his son, Lin Jinghan

268
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,090
and any future grandsons.

269
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,960
For unmarried daughters
and granddaughters,

270
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,400
monthly living expenses must be provided,

271
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
but this is canceled upon marriage.

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,300
This is not my father's handwriting.

273
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
He would never

274
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,070
have written such a will.

275
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,630
Mr. Lin says

276
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,520
that when your father wrote his will,

277
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,580
he was seriously ill with weak hands,

278
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,970
so he had to ask someone
to write it for him.

279
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,030
Please take a look.

280
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,360
Is this signature authentic?

281
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,870
Even if it is my father's signature,

282
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,970
does that

283
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,710
make this will valid?

284
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,530
Mr. Wang, were you present at the time?

285
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,030
Was there a notary there?

286
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,010
Your father's will has always

287
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,890
been handled by another lawyer.

288
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,720
After Mr. Lin passed away,

289
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,480
that lawyer left our firm

290
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
and disappeared.

291
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm so sorry.

292
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,120
The lawyer disappears
at such a critical moment.

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,730
What a coincidence.

294
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
Mr. Wang,

295
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,560
I want to sue Lin Jinghan.

296
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,610
I will not recognize this will.

297
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,490
[Six Arts Hall]

298
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,860
[Ju De Hall Restaurant]

299
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,590
Can't you really take this case?

300
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,090
You're one of the most
well-known lawyers in Shanghai.

301
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,070
In the short time we've been sitting here,

302
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,360
Lin Siyun has already seen

303
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,480
5 lawyers.

304
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Even Lawyer Xie turned it down.

305
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,870
I doubt anyone in Shanghai

306
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,280
will dare take it.

307
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,390
I wonder who she's trying

308
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,550
to sue anyway.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Based on my experience,

310
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,670
your chances of
winning this case are very low.

311
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,290
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
Miss Lin's family
has fallen on hard times—

313
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
she has no way out.

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
But she's strong.

315
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,330
I admire

316
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,000
women like her.

317
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,160
Cheng Ao,

318
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,910
do you feel sorry for her?

319
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,200
Yes, I do.

320
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,250
But with her personality,

321
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,790
I don't think she needs anyone's pity.

322
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,470
How do you know
what her personality's like?

323
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,550
We had coffee.

324
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,630
Where?

325
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Upstairs yesterday.

326
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,940
What's wrong?

327
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,820
I've never even had coffee upstairs.

328
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
You should try it.

329
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,390
I meant with you.

330
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,460
Mrs. Shen,

331
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,380
I once read your interview in the paper,

332
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,000
where you said

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,720
that the progress of Chinese society

334
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,270
must start with
the standing of Chinese women.

335
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,080
If Chinese women have no standing,

336
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,480
then

337
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,380
Chinese society

338
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,870
will have no future either.

339
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,930
Yes, I did say that.

340
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,820
You remember it so clearly.

341
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,150
Many great thinkers

342
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,030
But

343
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,840
the way you put it
was simple and powerful,

344
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,030
and very moving.

345
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,880
Impressive.

346
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,160
So you all think Lin Siyun is great, huh?

347
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,250
Who's prettier, me or her?

348
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,240
Of course you are.

349
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,400
I wasn't asking you.

350
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,390
You tell me.

351
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,670
Lin Siyun.

352
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,900
Do people in your group have bad taste

353
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
or just bad eyesight?

354
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Probably both.

355
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,250
I have another case.

356
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,390

357
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,770

358
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,580
Bye, Mr. Cheng.

359
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,790
Yingying,

360
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,630
what's wrong with you today?

361
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,230
I've always been like this.

362
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
And Cheng Ao—

363
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
he contradicted everything I said.

364
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,570
Did he act like this because he likes me?

365
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,270
Aunt Nan.

366
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,860
Maybe.

367
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,690
Miss Lin.

368
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,370
I've been waiting for you.

369
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,390
I was thinking...

370
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,790
I was looking for you too.

371
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,750
Looking for me?

372
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,350
If you want to file a lawsuit,

373
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,620
you can consult me.

374
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,210
Let's talk in my office.

376
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,200
I want to sue my brother.

377
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,140
Lin Jinghan is suspected of forging a will

378
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,320
and seizing property
that belongs to me and my niece.

379
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,120
What did Xie and those lawyers

380
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,190
say just now?

381
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,120
They said

382
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,760
since I broke off my engagement

383
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,860
and now want to sue my own brother,

384
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,360
I have a bad reputation

385
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
among the upper class

386
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,790
in Shanghai.

387
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,650
Any lawyer with a shred of dignity

388
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
would refuse to take my case.

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
I'll help you.

390
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,320
Thank you.

391
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,810
Can you afford the legal fees?

392
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,030
How much?

393
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,170
I charge 3 times what Xie does.

394
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,930
Can I pay in installments?

395
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,170
Let's win the case first.

396
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,910
Lin Siyun.

397
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:35,329
Mom.

398
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,560
Why aren't you in bed yet? It's so late.

399
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,090
I need to talk to you.

400
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,660
Are you really going to sue your brother?

401
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,970
Yes.

402
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,400
It's not too late

403
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
to change your mind.

404
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,540
Your fourth aunt will come
pick you up tomorrow.

405
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,030
We're still family.

406
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm not going to Suzhou.

407
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm staying in Shanghai,

408
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,030
staying in this house.

409
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
This is my home.

410
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,080
My father left it to me.

411
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,380
Your father is dead.

412
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm still alive.

413
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,270
From now on,

414
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,730
you're no longer my daughter.

415
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,830
Fine.

416
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,560
You're not

417
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
just selfish,

418
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,270
also cruel and vicious.

419

Think of me however you like.

420
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,960
Don't you forget.

421
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,790
I gave birth to you

422
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,390
and raised you to who you are.

423

You ungrateful wretch.

514
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,370
this case?

515
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,590
Dancing with me

516
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,550
won't help

517
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,330
the case directly.

518
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,360
What do you mean then?

519
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,310
But

520
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,990
in certain settings,

521
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,780
it might be useful.

522
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,110
There's a charity gala this Sunday.

523
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,300
Many influential women will be there.

524
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,070
Mrs. Shen's charity gala?

525
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,070
Exactly.

526
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,720
Mrs. Shen is a very progressive woman.

527
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,690
If you talk with her,

528
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,850
I believe she'll understand

529
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,780
and support you.

530
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,170
I see.

531
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,310
You want

532
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,640
these progressive women

533
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
to support me in their own way

534
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,690
for this lawsuit.

535
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,570
Smart.

536
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,170
I don't think I need to dance with you.

537
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,240
As for dancing,

538
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,520
that's up to you.

539
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,840
I find it so hard to talk to you.

540
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,510
Pillager.

541
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,270
Come in.

542
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,900
Sit.

543
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,920
Get out.

544
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,070
I didn't invite you.

545
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,570
What kind of attitude is that?

546
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,710
Siyun is my good friend.

547
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,990
Show some respect.

548
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,690
This gala is hosted by Aunt Nan.

549
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,720
So what?

550
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,170
Why don't you go outside with her

551
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,200
and have a private chat?

552
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Where are we supposed to go?

553
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,590
Aunt Nan paid for this. Did you?

554
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,400
You never stop

555
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,070
talking about money.

556
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,790
Moneygrubber.

557
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,240
I just don't get it.

558
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,070
I'm your sister.

559
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,270
So you do remember you're my sister.

560
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,960
Why are you always picking on me?

561
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,790
You're so nice to her,

562
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,790
but does she even care about you?

563
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,350
Whether she cares about me is between us.

564
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,350
I'm done talking to you.

565
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,480
You always upset me.

566
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,110
You can talk sometime.

567
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,820
Come on, make some space.

568
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,310
Qiao Shijun.

569
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,310
Come in.

570
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,490
Sit here.

571
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,730
Stand up.

572
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,870
Mr. Qiao,

573
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,200
tell us

574
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,020
what's really going on
between you and Miss Lin?

575
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,820
Miss Lin has done nothing wrong.

576
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,370
It's all my fault.

577
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,080
That's it?

578
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,220
Go on.

579
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
Thankfully, Mr. Cheng found
those letters of mine

580
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,890
and stopped me from
making mistakes in time.

581
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,590
My lifestyle

582
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,400
may be acceptable to many girls,

583
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,440
but Miss Lin isn't one of them.

584
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
Continuing would only hurt her.

585
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,200
The way things are now

586
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,060
is the best outcome for everyone.

587
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,000
Miss Lin, Mr. Cheng,
I'd like to offer a toast.

588
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,480
Well,

589
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,060
if there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving now.

590
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,400
On behalf of the organizers, I declare

591
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,540
the charity gala
for Jiangnan disaster relief

592
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,930
begins now!

593
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,810
♪ Raise the wine—come on,
drink with joy, cheers! ♪

594
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,300
♪ Share the feast—come on,
sit and laugh, cheers! ♪

595
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,290
♪ Play the games, drink it down,
happiness overflows ♪

596
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,980
♪ Smooth winds, full blessings,
long life—pair by pair! ♪

597
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,330
Mrs. Shen,

598
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,610
I've already planned
tomorrow's front page.

599
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,480
We'll

600
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,360
put your big photo

601
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
on the front page.

602
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,270
No need.

603
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,320
Tonight is about charity,

604
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,350
not me.

605
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,660
Got it.

606
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,750
Cheng Ao, over here.

607
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,330
Mrs. Shen.

608
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,610
Miss Lin.

609
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,360
This is an authentic work by Liang Qichao.

610
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,790
Miss Lin, what a thoughtful donation.

611
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,790
On behalf of the hosts,
thank you for your generosity.

612
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Lin Siyun,

613
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,240
given your family's situation,
why do this?

614
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,710
If this piece is truly valuable,

615
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,110
you should keep it for household expenses.

616
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,670
I'm just being practical.

617
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,320
Unless

618
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,850
you're trying to win Aunt Nan's favor.

619
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,650
Yingying,

620
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,030
never question others' good deeds.

621
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,050
Miss Lin wouldn't act
without careful thought.

622
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,510
How do you know her so well?

623
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm her lawyer,

624
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,220
and she's my client.

625
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,000
A lawyer knows their client.

626
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
Nothing wrong with that, right?

627
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,790
Miss Shen is right.

628
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,860
I truly don't have
anything impressive to show,

629
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,440
but I never intended
to live off this calligraphy either.

630
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,590
As for

631
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,930
pleasing Mrs. Shen—

632
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,030
of course.

633
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,940
Everyone here tonight,

634
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,070
man or woman,

635
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,440
high or low,

636
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,790
who doesn't want to please

637
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,720
our gracious, beautiful hostess?

638
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,450
Siyun, don't take it to heart.

639
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,980
My sister is quite spoiled. I...

640
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,020
Shut up.

641
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,160
Miss Lin,

642
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,720
I've been following

643
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,240
your case closely.

644
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,710
I've written an article supporting you,

645
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,970
published under a pseudonym, of course.

646
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,310
I'd like you to read it sometime

647
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,770
and give me your thoughts.

648
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,190
Remember,

649
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,950
you're never alone.

650
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,750
Many educated women of status around me

651
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,080
are all supporting you.

652
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

653
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,080
So many little schemes,

654
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,960
not only for Aunt Nan,

655
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,100
but for men as well.

656
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,650
Are you talking about me?

657
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,650
Exactly.

658
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Pillager,

659
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,520
won't you invite me to dance?

660
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,360
Where are you going?

661
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,070
Going home.

662
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,390
Don't be mad.

663
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,270
If you want to dance,

664
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,150
I'll dance with you.

665
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,870
Get lost.

666
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Aunt Nan, how should we

667
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,480
deal with Yingying?

668
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:53,960
She's being

669
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,290
so disrespectful to me.

670
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,460
That's because your dad spoiled her.

671
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,550
Thank you.

672
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,270
I should thank you.

673
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,600
This time when we're dancing,

674
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,520
you at least look me in the eyes.

675
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,230
What? Looking you in the eyes?

676
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,590
I said I should thank you.

677
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,810
This time when we're dancing,

678
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,540
you at least look me in the eyes.

679
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,170
How did I look at you last time we danced?

680
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,800
Show me.

681
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,570
That's because
I didn't know you well before.

682
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,400
It's okay.

683
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,480
From now on,

684
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,690
there will be plenty of time

685
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,040
for you to get to know me better.

686
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,370
Zhaoyuan,

687
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,410
are you planning to join the army?

688
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,960
Yes.

689
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,640
If the Japanese

690
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,460
dare to cross the Huangpu River,

691
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
I'll fight every single one of them.

692
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,370
But that would be very dangerous.

693
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,720
It is dangerous,

694
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,270
but we can't be bullied anymore.

695
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,200
The foreigners just
send 3,000 or 5,000 men,

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,550
and we get occupied,

697
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,810
followed by ceding territory
and paying indemnities.

698
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,160
We need to make the world

699
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,070
see China in a new light.

700
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,640
Hearing you talk like this,

701
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
I feel somewhat ashamed.

702
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,860
All I think about every day
is family affairs.

703
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,290
There's nothing wrong

704
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,070
with caring about your family.

705
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,380
Joining the army
is just my personal choice.

706
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,110
You can have your own goals too.

707
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,580
Zhaoyuan,

708
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,680
you're quite different
from my other classmates.

709
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,790
May I draw you?

710
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,450
Just don't make me look ugly.

711
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Then I won't.

712
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,010
I was just kidding.

713
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,720
Go ahead.

714
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,150
-Don't laugh.
-I'm sorry.

715
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,409
Take a look. Did I make you look ugly?

716
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,690
Do you want the truth or a lie?

717
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,060
The truth, of course.

718
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,280
This is

719
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
even better

720
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,120
than the real me.

721
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,650
Yi,

722
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,400
you drew Zhaoyuan's eyes so beautifully.

723
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,630
Can you draw one of me too?

724
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,360
Sure,

725
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,000
just a moment.

726
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,110
See?

727
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,739
I'm not the only one praising you.

728
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
You just said

729
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,650
you only care about

730
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,219
your family affairs,

731
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,000
but turns out you're quite the artist,

732
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,960
drawing so well.

733
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,560
Couldn't this become your goal?

734
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,190
In the future, my goal is

735
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,720
to be a soldier, to fight.

736
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,190
And yours could be

737
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,880
to become a great artist.

738
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
Fine. Whatever you say.

739
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,580
Come on.

740
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,420
Thank you.

741
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,100
Once the trial begins,

742
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,190
there will definitely
be more attention and criticism.

743
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,800
When that happens, try not to read

744
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,060
the reports about you.

745
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,230
There will be all kinds of opinions.

746
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,270
I know you're straightforward,

747
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,400
and asking you not to look

748
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,110
isn't because
I'm worried about your feelings,

749
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,970
but if you respond to each attack,

750
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,440
you'll give those who want to
see you fail exactly what they want.

751
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
It's not worth it.

752
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
Then what should I do?

753
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,190
Not respond at all?

754
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
If you have any ideas,

755
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,770
you can discuss with me.

756
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,980
Focus on the positive things.

757
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,710
Like how much

758
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,800
Mrs. Shen admired you last night.

759
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,760
True.

760
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,960
I never expected Mrs. Shen

761
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,590
to be such an open-minded woman.

762
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,480
She even organized a women's group

763
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,920
to support my lawsuit.

764
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,330
Because you deserve it.

765
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,190
Where are those letters

766
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,520
and diaries of your father you mentioned?

767
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,470
I have them ready.

768
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,840
Here are

769
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,890
my father's diaries and letters.

770
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,630
Good.

771
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,190
My Lady.

772
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,850
Madam's gone to the hospital.

773
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,000
What happened?

774
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
They said it's her heart.

775
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,960
[Zhongde Hospital]

776
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,900
Mom.

777
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,500
Mom, you're awake.

778
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,760
Siyun,

779
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,420
can you not sue your brother?

780
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,250
Mom, please don't say that.

781
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,450
Just focus on resting.

782
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
Can you please not sue your brother?

783
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,510
Mom.

784
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,630
Mom.

785
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,510
Mom.

786
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,490
Can't you just agree with Mom now?

787
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,940
Look at Mom's condition.

788
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,630
If something happens to her,

789
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,760
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life!

790
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,300
Mom.

791
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
Mom, I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

792
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,880
I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

793
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,840
I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

794
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,130
I understand.

795
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,360
Mr. Cheng,

796
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,110
why did you bring me

797
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,150
up to the rooftop?

798
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,930
I need to be with my mom.

799
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,050
I want to have a word with you.

800
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,110
Sure,

801
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,630
let's talk.

802
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,990
I also have something to tell you.

803
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,430
Did you see?

804
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,910
My mom's lying in bed,

805
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,070
hanging between life and death,

806
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,930
and my sister's still fighting me
ver the inheritance.

807
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,190
Isn't that heartless?

808
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,120
Besides, I'm not afraid of going to court.

809
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,080
My father's will

810
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,110
is clear written in black and white.

811
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I'll definitely win.

812
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
Let me remind you,

813
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,600
Miss Lin has many

814
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,690
letters exchanged with your father.

815
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,710
He always supported equality—

816
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,320
sons and daughters share inheritance.

817
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,410
He supported his daughter's
overseas education

818
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,630
and her business after returning home.

819
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,480
He specifically told Miss Lin

820
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,820
that he had set aside funds

821
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,080
specifically for her business opening.

822
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,310
But shortly after Mr. Lin's death,

823
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,910
that money mysteriously disappeared.

824
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,840
Based on this,

825
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,280
first,

826
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,700
I can completely challenge

827
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,950
the authenticity of your alleged will.

828
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,830
Second,

829
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,250
Miss Lin can sue you for

830
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,240
illegally seizing the inheritance.

831
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,430
Alright.

832
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,700
Don't tell me all this.

833
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,710
Do you like my sister?

834
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,630
If you like her, just tell me,

835
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,350
I'll marry her off to you.

836
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,180
But there's one condition,

837
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,610
you'll have to cover some of my debts.

838
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,190
Whether I like her

839
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,630
or not

840
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,400
is none of your business.

841
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,650
Are you even her real brother?

842
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,400
Yes,

843
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,220
I'm her real brother.

844
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,150
We have the same father and mother.

845
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,780
No doubt.

846
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,880
Boss,

847
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,650
I've brought the person.

848
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,180
Director Wang.

849
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,760
It's Director Wang.

850
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,970
You know each other?

851
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,700
Yes, we do.

852
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,840
Let me reintroduce you.

853
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,110
That's not necessary.

854
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,370
We've known each other for quite a while.

855
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,190
Great,

856
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,780
we're quite familiar with each other too.

857
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,890
By the way, Director,

858
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,600
what illness does Mrs. Lin have?

859
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,790
Mrs. Lin isn't sick at all.

860
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,100
He told me to say so.

861
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,200
I see.

862
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,290
Thank you, Director.

863
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,190
Good for you.

864
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,210
Fine.

865
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,370
Even if

866
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,850
I made that up about my mother,

867
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,540
you just heard it yourself,

868
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,320
my sister doesn't want anything.

869
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,630
All the property goes to me.

870
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,160
She's the concerned party,

871
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,270
and you have to follow her wish.

872
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,760
I really can't.

873
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,070
Mr. Lin,

874
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,900
this case is going to trial.

875
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,400
Are you just looking for trouble?

876
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,800
What's wrong with you?

877
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Are you just...

878
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,330
Who do you think you're talking to?

879
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,230
Don't come any closer!

880
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,060
Stay back!

881
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,250
I've trained, you know.

882
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,960
Aren't you guys lawyers?

883
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,330
Mr. Cheng is a lawyer.

884
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,890
I'm not.

885
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,950
What do you do then?

886
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,370
My name is Cheng,

887
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,760
from the Zeng's.

888
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,430
You better check it out.

889
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,430
It's the same Zeng you owe money to.

890
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,670
Boss,

891
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,230
what's it gonna be—arm or leg?

892
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,280
Ask Mr. Lin.

893
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,880
Mr. Lin,

894
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,070
pick one.

895
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,380
Arm or leg?

896
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,030
I'm asking you. Arm or leg?

897
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,970
Sorry about that, Mr. Lin.

898
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,830
It went off accidentally.

899
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,430
I'll settle.

900
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,120
Mr. Cheng,

901
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,450
I...

902
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,690
I'll never bully my sister again.

903
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,720
I'll give her back her share

904
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,050
of the estate right now.

905
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,480
Is that okay with you?

906
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,870
I'm okay if you say it's okay.

907
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,280
It's up to you.

908
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,130
Okay. It's okay with me.

909
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,210
Well, if there's nothing else,

910
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,580
I'll be leaving now.

911
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,890
Look at him—scared stiff like a fool.
