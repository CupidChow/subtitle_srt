[Episode 6]

3
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,710
You okay?

4
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
What are you trying to do?

5
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
What do you think?

6
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,630
I've already taken care of everything.

7
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,390
You'd better not do anything now.

8
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,720
You've taken care of it?

9
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,280
How?

10
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,410
By bowing and scraping

11
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,930
with that fake smile?

12
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
I have my own methods.

13
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,430
I don't have time to explain to you now.

14
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,630
I have my methods too.

15
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,070
Don't get in my way.

16
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,680
Cheng Ao.

17
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,000
Everything comes to him who waits.

18
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,090
If you go after Dong now,

19
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,090
break his arm and cripple his leg,

20
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,750
you might feel it's resolved.

21
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,640
But will Siyun's hospital be able to open?

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,700
We'll need Dong's help in the future.

23
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,970
He's not the only

24
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,180
powerful one in Shanghai.

25
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,120
There are plenty of ways and people

26
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,910
who can help Siyun open her hospital.

27
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,710
Like who?

28
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,190
You or me?

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,820
It isn't that jerk anyway.

30
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,600
Let's stop arguing.

31
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,870
Nothing serious happened, right?

32
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,690
I promise if there's a next time,

33
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,790
I'll deal with him together with you.

34
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,690
It's quite lively down there.

35
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,450
Yes, it is.

36
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,710
Miss Lin.

37
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,210
Mrs. Shen, I'll be going now.

38
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,930
Alright.

39
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Mrs. Shen.

40
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,470
Where did you go just now?

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,630
Aunt Nan.

42
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,960
Siyun just went to
see under-secretary Dong.

43
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,300
Dong is too bold.

44
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,330
He tried to take advantage of Siyun.

45
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,160
Who introduced under-secretary Dong
to Miss Lin?

46
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,750
I think it was me.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Miss Lin.

48
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,070
I understand your original intention
for opening a maternity hospital.

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,000
And I know how important

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,330
this hospital is to you.

51
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,950
As long as it can be opened smoothly,

52
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,390
no matter how difficult it gets,

53
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm not afraid.

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,960
It's hard for a woman to get things done.

55
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,000
But no matter how difficult,
I'll still do it.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Otherwise, why would I
have studied abroad in the West?

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,350
I must open

58
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,120
the hospital.

59
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,490
I'll go with you

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,070
to meet those businessmen later.

61
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,190
You two men.

62
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,290
You can't even protect a girl.

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,560
Don't worry.

64
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,550
I won't let this happen again.

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
It's fine now.

66
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,750
It's about time.

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,950
I'll go down with you.

73
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,950
Trying to comfort me?

74
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,360
No need.

75
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,310
If under-secretary Dong
had stayed any longer,

76
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,440
he definitely would've regretted it.

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,270
You can't hide the look in your eyes
when you like someone.

86
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,840
You'd better make sure.

better than my daughter?

Cheng Ao.

91
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,760
Do you have feelings for Lin Siyun?

92
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
I just don't like you.

93
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,790
So you're saying
Lin Siyun is better than me?

94
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,740
She is indeed excellent.

95
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,560
Something's wrong. Director Shen.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,170
There's a dead man in the restroom,

97
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,170
covered in blood.

98
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,830
Who's dead?

99
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,640
Close all the exits.

100
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,750
Notify the police station.

101
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,810
Check every vehicle passing nearby.

102
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,430
Alright, let's talk another day.

103
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,120
Sure.

104
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,310
Who would dare
take such a huge risk to kill him?

105
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,250
I bet it's the Eliminate Spies Squad
of the Communist Party.

106
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,040
What do you think?

107
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,970
Not interested.

108
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,630
Let's go, Siyun.

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,789
I need to stay and handle other matters.

110
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,789
Make sure you get Siyun home safely.

111
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,770
As long as she stays away from you,

112
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:47,960
she'll be safe.

113
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,919
Let's go.

114
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,770
You only know
how to take advantage of others.

115
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,040
Tell me how you found the body just now.

116
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,200
At first I was cleaning near the restroom.

117
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860
Suddenly,

118
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,530
I heard a yowl.

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,670
So I followed the sound,

120
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,910
and saw that person

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,730
already lying on the floor.

122
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,920
Did anyone

123
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,640
pass by here before that?

124
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,290
I...

125
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,840
don't remember.

126
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,670
Think again.

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,650
I remember now.

128
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,660
A man in a western-style servant's uniform

129
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,080
walked out of the restroom
around that time.

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
What happened tonight

131
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,070
is our Shen family's fault.

132
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,170
Please, everyone, go home first.

133
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,510
Tomorrow my wife and I will personally
call on you to apologize.

134
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,150
We're truly sorry for this.

135
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,130
Director Shen.

136
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Distinguished guests.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
You don't need to investigate further.

138
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,370
I'll see you out.

139
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,590
No need.

140
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,740
We can't let our matters

141
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,510
interfere with your duties.

142
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,650
The investigation must continue.

143
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,280
Mr. Zeng, thanks.

144
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,030
If there's nothing else,

145
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,910
I'll take my leave.

146
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,550
All right.

147
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,720
Thank you.

148
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,920
This certificate was issued
just the day before yesterday.

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,720
Orders just came down from above

150
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,520
that anyone with certificates
issued within the past 7 days

151
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,720
must be taken to
the station for questioning.

152
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,270
Take him away!

153
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,630
Yes, sir.

154
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,440
Wait, bro.

155
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
Just a moment, excuse me.

156
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,120
This gentleman came with me.

158
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,830
He's Mr. Zeng's friend.

159
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,930
Who are you?

161
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,260
I'm Mr. Zeng's adopted son,

162
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,890
Cheng Ao.

163
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,440
Sorry,

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
but we have strict orders

165
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,580
to thoroughly check everyone.

166
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,550
Bro.

167
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,860
This gentleman is

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,150
a friend of my son.

169
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,000
He and my son

170
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,410
may leave with me, right?

171
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,540
Of course, Mr. Zeng.

172
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,440

You're worried about him.

Who is Mr. Gu exactly?

191

Why would the police want him?

My property here is in a prime location.

It's perfect for

Yingying is just a child.

How could she run a business?

Even if I opened a restaurant for her,

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
she'd only come with her friends,

221

without making any profit.

222

A hospital is different.

223

I've already had experts evaluate it

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,710

What's your relationship?

242
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,830
I met him in the shantytown last time.

243
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,850
He's their spokesperson.

244
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,290
I sat with him inside for a while

245
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,380
and found he's quite knowledgeable.

246
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,670
But his awareness and knowledge

247
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,320
don't really match his circumstances.

248

So I was curious about him.

That's all.

than let one Communist escape.

Many young people were killed
just like that.

Without a country, there's no home.

The Japanese have occupied Manchuria,

and now they want North China.

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,600
must be disinfected regularly.

345
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,860
This area must be kept clean at all times.

346
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,040
Also, pay attention to
the mothers' emotions.

347
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,440
You must be patient.

348
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,520
Don't let them feel anxious

349
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,790
or upset.

350
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,350
Help them maintain a pleasant mood

351
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,280
as they welcome their babies here.

352
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,520
Liu,

353
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,110
remember to open the windows and curtains

354
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,310
every day when you come in.

355
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
So the delivery room
gets proper ventilation and fresh air.

356
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,670
Okay.

357
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,800
Read the handbook

358
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,840
I've given you all carefully.

359
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,270
Dr. Lin,

360
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,820
men aren't allowed in here.

361
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,660
Director Lin.

362
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,080
I'll step outside for a moment.

363
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,600
What are you doing here?

364
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,560
I've come to see

365
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,710
the famous

366
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,260
Sinan Maternity Hospital.

367
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,150
Girls, take some time
to get familiar with the place.

368
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,160
No men allowed.

369
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,160
Isn't this place not officially open yet?

370
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,070
What's wrong?

371
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,350
What are you thinking about?

372
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,280
This used to be the kitchen, right?

373
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,340
The first time I came here,

374
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,100
someone walked
from the living room to here,

375
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,160
grabbed a kitchen knife
and went upstairs to attack me.

376
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,810
So fierce.

377
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,750
You guys drove me to it.

378
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,160
Pretty good.

379
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,140
You've gone
from a kitchen knife to a scalpel.

380
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,140
By the way,

381
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,640
I bought flower stands.

382
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,740
When you officially open,

383
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,540
I'll have Cheng bring them over.

384
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,750
Also,

385
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,200
if you need,

386
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,830
I can be your legal advisor.

387
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,000
My hospital isn't even open yet,

388
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,550
not making any profit,

389
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,830
I can't afford to pay you.

390
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,800
Who said anything about money?

391
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,370
Aunt Nan and I are both your benefactors.

392
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Hello?

393
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,290
Hello,

394
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,450
I'm looking for Ao.

395
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,750
Cheng Ao,

396
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,260
phone for you.

397
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,960
For me?

398
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,750
Yes.

399
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,540
Hello?

400
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,350
Hey, bro,

401
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,750
so you are there after all.

402
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,680
I couldn't find you,

403
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
so I called Miss Lin's place.

404
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,260
How did you get this number?

405
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,740
I...

406
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,720
I got it

407
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,320
when we were
collecting debts from her family.

408
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,150
You haven't changed your number?

409
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,300
I will soon.

410
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,970
What's the matter?

411
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,760
Bro,

412
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,720
my brother Xiaoshan is in trouble.

413
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,240
Can you help me out?

414
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,130
I don't deserve such praise.

415
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,920
I should serve the party and country

416
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,380
even at the cost of my life.

417
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,620
Understood.

418
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,070
I'll arrange it right away,

419
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,270
and will definitely
give you an answer tomorrow.

420
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,750
Okay.

421
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,580
Goodbye.

422
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,270
Do me a favor.

423
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,110
Have a seat and tell me.

424
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,610
I have a young relative

425
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,070
who joined a training camp

426
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,660
organized by the Shanghai military,

427
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,120
and was suddenly arrested

428
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,870
on charges of
collaborating with Communists.

429
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,410
What did he do?

430
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,200
During training,

431
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,260
an instructor was preaching that

432
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,000
we must first eliminate internal threats
before fighting external ones,

433
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,070
and to win the war,

434
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,970
a soldier's primary duty

435
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,230
is to eliminate the Communist Party,

436
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,330
and only secondarily

437
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,990
to resist Japanese invasion.

438
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,870
The kid didn't understand and asked

439
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,500
why wiping out
the Communists was considered

440
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,640
the first priority over resisting Japan.

441
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,740
Just that one question,

442
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,870
and he was arrested.

443
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,400
Wasn't the kid right?

444
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,770
Isn't this what all Chinese people feel?

445
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,920
How could they charge him
with being a Communist sympathizer?

446
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,120
If you put it that way,

447
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
then millions of Chinese people

448
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,690
would all be Communists.

449
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,530
Bro, stop right there.

450
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,530
Don't let anyone hear you.

451
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,830
You don't need to
explain these principles to me,

452
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,510
regarding the Chairman's strategy,

453
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,310
in my position,

454
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,200
I can't express any opinions.

455
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Just tell me directly

456
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,110
what you need me to do.

457
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
I've made inquiries.

458
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,310
The kid is still being
held at the military school,

459
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,070
about to be transferred
to the Military Police.

460
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,750
Once he's transferred
to the Military Police,

461
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,950
his chances are slim.

462
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,550
You have many connections.

463
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,720
Help me get him out.

464
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,420
Good heavens,

465
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
this is such a serious matter!

466
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,130
I don't have that kind of power.

467
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,750
The training camp address

468
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,950
and instructor's name are here. Hurry.

469
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,930
Well...

470
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,990
What else are you taking out?

471
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Cheng Ao.

472
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,160
You're quite practiced

473
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,350
at this game.

474
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,960
Alright.

475
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,720
I'll help you

476
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
with this matter.

477
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,400
Leave the training camp address

478
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,380
and instructor's name

479
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,170
here.

480
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,970
Take your money back.

481
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,640
We're close friends.

482
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,720
Besides,

483
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,260
this isn't something money can solve.

484
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,630
Take it back.

485
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,240
Wait.

486
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,650
For tonight's booze.

487
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,710
Look at you.

488
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,950
You still drink?

489
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,910
Your stomach is already bad.

490
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,270
Give me two more bills

491
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,050
to buy stomach medicine.

492
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,540
Shut up.

493
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,240
I'm leaving.

494
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,380
Wait for my news.

495
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,870
Doctor.

496
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,220
How is my brother doing?

497
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,210
Three broken ribs, ruptured spleen,

498
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,670
and neurological damage.

499
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,950
Bro.

500
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,790
Please help me.

501
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,240
I want to sue them.

502
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,140
Stay with your brother first.

503
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,220
I'll go back to my office for a moment.

504
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,700
Bro.

505
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,510
Xiaoshan's case
has gained public attention,

506
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,810
surprisingly many people from
all walks of life are supporting him.

507
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,070
Mr. Lu has been working very hard on this.

508
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,070
Xiaoshan is an anti-Japanese youth.

509
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,640
He has the people's support.

510
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,680
Those dark forces can't stop this.

511
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,880
What are you talking about?

512
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,240
Director Shen, you're here in person.

513
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,770
Am I not welcome?

514
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,070
Of course you are.

515
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,900
Hello, Director Shen.

516
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,750
Cheng.

517
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,720
I'll go to the court
to get the documents, bro.

518
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,270
So?

519
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,550
How confident are you about this trial?

520
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,070
What's more important about this case

521
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,600
is winning public support.

522
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,920
Wait a minute.

523
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,890
Why are you

524
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,320
so interested in this case?

525
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,610
From what I know about you,

526
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,130
you should be keeping your distance.

527
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,370
The great Attorney Cheng
finally asks for my help,

528
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,370
so I should put in some extra effort.

529
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,900
Take a look at this.

530
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,920
Where did you get this?

531
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
Never mind where I got it.

532
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,260
This will definitely help you
control people's minds.

533
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,210
But Cheng Ao,

534
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,130
this is as far as
I can help you with this matter.

535
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,400
The rest is up to you.

536
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,630
Let me warn you.

537
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,910
This isn't nearly as simple as you think.

538
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,200
I've done some research,

539
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,130
and that kid is incredibly brazen.

540
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,510
He can't just be

541
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,900
a simple patriotic youth.

542
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,300
There must be political forces behind him.

543
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,070
Let me give you some advice:

544
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,270
stir things up, let them fight each other,

545
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,220
keep your distance,

546
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,390
and you won't lose no matter who wins.

547
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,160
That's a lot of information.

548
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,640
Shen Yiqun.

549
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,710
Is this guy

550
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,010
your political rival?

551
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
Pretty much.

552
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,630
No wonder.

553
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,230
I'm leaving.

554
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,820
Thanks.

555
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,890
You're welcome.

556
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,070
Auntie, I'm back.

557
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,480
Yi.

558
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,850
Come on, give it to me.

559
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,310
Auntie, your hospital
is doing really well.

560
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,910
I can finally move back home.

561
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,280
Miss Lin,

562
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,520
long time no see.

563
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,920
You are Zhou?

564
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
I just came to help Yi move in.

565
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,580
Yi,

566
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,200
I've moved all your stuff in.

567
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,710
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

568
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,390
Okay.

569
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,180
Miss Lin, I have matters
to attend to at school,

570
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,510
I'll come visit another day.

571
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,020
Okay.

572
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,210
I'm leaving.

573
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:02,990
Goodbye.

574
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,200
Auntie, what are you smiling about?

575
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,130
You tell me.

576
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,310
Alright,

577
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,010
let me show you your room.

578
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,530
Okay.

579
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
This room in our house

580
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,620
has been converted into nurses' quarters.

581
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,550
The hospital just opened
and isn't making much profit yet.

582
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,850
Once we start earning money,

583
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,760
we'll rent a place outside,

584
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,370
but for now, we'll have to make do.

585
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay.

586
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Liu,

587
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,190
which bed is reserved for Yi?

588
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,350
This bed is unoccupied.

589
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,550
It's reserved for Yi.

590
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,170
Thank you.

591
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,920
Auntie, this place is really nice.

592
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,620
Can I invite my classmates over?

593
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,310
You can't go to the treatment areas,

594
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,440
just stay in the dormitory,

595
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,160
and don't disturb others who are resting.

596
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,750
Got it.

597
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,330
You tidy up here.
I need to get back to work.

598
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,860
Okay.

599
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,490

if you were in my position,

628
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,250
you would take this case too,

wouldn't you?

630
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,870
In my lifetime,

631
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,600
from the Qing Dynasty to
the Beiyang government to the Republic,

632
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
I've seen incompetent governments

633
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480

But no matter what,

I still remember I am Chinese.

Japan

640
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,110
is China's number one enemy.

648
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,520
for saying just one sentence
during training,

649
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,080
was detained and beaten severely,

650
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,960
has not yet recovered enough
to leave the hospital,

651
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,490
and cannot appear in court.

652
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,480
I imagine everyone is curious

653
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,510
about what kind of

654
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,170
treasonous statement he made

655
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,330
to suffer such punishment.

656
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,940
During the training session,

657
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,720
the instructor repeatedly emphasized

658
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,110
that to resist foreign aggression,

659
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,240
we must first pacify internal unrest.

660
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,160
First, establish internal stability,

661
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,990
and then

662
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,000
focus on resistance.

663
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,940
Xiaoshan didn't understand,

664
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,400
what's the cause and effect here?

665
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
Nonsense!

666
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,800
This student was sent by the Communists

667
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,920
to sabotage us.

668
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,490
He was acting under Communist orders.

669
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,730
He admitted it himself.

670
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,190
Yet you're defending him.

671
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,690
Are you a Communist too?

672
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,560
Before I came today,
a government official

673
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,470
told me almost the same thing.

674
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,990
He said Xiaoshan's motives
go beyond simple patriotism.

675
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,250
He must have
powerful forces behind him,

676
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,710
and he was sent by the Communist Party
to subvert patriotic students.

677
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,090
But the truth is,

678
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,920
you're suppressing
a genuinely patriotic student.

679
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,940
I'm Wu Xiaoshan's classmate,

680
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,290
from Heilongjiang.

681
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,070
Now I can't return home,

682
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,570
because the Japanese have occupied it.

683
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,590
Our relatives back home
have become slaves in a conquered land.

684
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,970
Xiaoshan is not a Communist,

685
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,260
and neither are we.

686
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,000
We just want to defeat the Japanese devils

687
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,390
and liberate the Northeast provinces.

688
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,390
I don't want to be a slave
in a conquered country.

689
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,500
I want to go home!

690
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,070
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

691
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,030
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

692
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,150
Order in the court!

693
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,480
Your Honor,

694
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,780
I would like to ask the defendant,

695
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,730
are you truly Chinese or not?

696
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,800
Why am I imprisoned

697
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,440
just for expressing my patriotism,

698
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,300
beaten, cursed, and humiliated?

699
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,250
Why do you insist I'm a Communist

700
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,300
when I declare

701
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,230
my resistance against Japan
and love for my country?

702
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
Let me tell you,

703
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,920
I am not a Communist.

704
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,010
But I do support the Communist Party's

705
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,280
anti-Japanese stance.

706
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,790
That is typical Communist rhetoric.

707
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,630
The school's investigation of you

708
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,360
is entirely based on
your communist tendencies.

709
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,150
What has the school done wrong?

710
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,830
You're young and naive,

711
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,510
where did you get these ideas?

712
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,820
Someone must be influencing you.

713
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,890
Wu Xiaoshan has made it very clear

714
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,070
that he supports the Communist Party's
resistance against Japan.

715
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,590
What's wrong with
supporting resistance against Japan?

716
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,840
Not wanting our beautiful homeland
to be taken by enemies,

717
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,170
what's wrong with that?

718
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,500
What's wrong with
not wanting our homes trampled upon?

719
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,920
If you insist

720
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,120
that he has powerful forces behind him,

721
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
then yes, he does.

722
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,230
You.

723
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,070
You.

724
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,000
You. You. You. You all.

725
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,850
Including me,

726
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,240
we are all part of this force.

727
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,740
This powerful force is 400 million

728
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,490
Chinese compatriots who refuse
to be slaves of a conquered nation!

729
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,670
Cheng Ao, I'm heading
back to the newspaper.

730
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,030
I'm going to write an article

731
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,540
and try to get it published
in the next day or two.

732
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,140
Okay.

733
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,410
Thank you for your hard work.

734
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,470
We're all Chinese.

735
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,700
Today's court hearing
was truly impressive.

736
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,340
I'm off.

737
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

738
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,070
Ao.

739
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,470
Do you think

740
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,070
we can win this case?

741
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,270
I can't guarantee it.

742
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,490
Why the long face?

743
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,800
Public opinion is already on our side.

744
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,230
Didn't Mr. Lu say

745
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,980
that people are
very concerned about this case,

746
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,260
and it's having such a big impact?

747
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,390
So why are you still looking so gloomy?

748
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,480
Xiaoshan.

749
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,660
In fighting this lawsuit,

750
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,970
besides seeking justice for you,

751
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,740
isn't it just as important

752
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,070
to convey to the public

753
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,000
that you patriotic youths stand firmly
against Japanese aggression?

754
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,760
I understand, Ao.

755
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,320
I have another thing

756
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,250
I'd like to ask for your help with.

757
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:19,800
Sure.

758
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,050
My classmates and I

759
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,920
are planning to return to the Northeast

760
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,320
to join the anti-Japanese volunteer army.

761
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,760
No problem,

762
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I'll make the arrangements for you.

763
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,510
Thank you, Ao.

764
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,320
Are you tired today?

765
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,610
What would you like to eat?

766
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,590
Let's go together,

767
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,250
my treat.

768
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,590
I'm hungry too.

769
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,110
Let's eat together.

770
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,320
You idiot,

771
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,060
can't you read the room?

772
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,680
Did Miss Lin invite you to dinner?

773
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,240
She wants to treat Ao to dinner,

774
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,700
and you're just
going on about being hungry.

775
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,150
It's fine.

776
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,960
Let's go together then.

777
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,270
Ao said

778
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,240
it's fine,

779
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
so let's go together.

780
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,600
So

781
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,690
let's go together.

782
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,550
No thanks, bro.

783
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,130
We're going for noodles.

784
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,260
You go with Miss Lin.

785
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,420
You're not coming?

786
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,230
The three of us can go.

787
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,080
Bro.

788
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,890
I'm not really hungry,

789
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,110
but I need to help Xiaoshan.

790
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,340
How can I let you support him?

791
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,030
Come, bro.

792
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,110
Weren't you going to eat noodles?

793
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,510
I can help him, it's fine.

794
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,630
Miss Lin.

795
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,030
Please, go ahead.

796
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,840
Take it slow.
