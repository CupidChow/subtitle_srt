00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm Mr. Zeng's lawyer,

173
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,750
Cheng Ao.

174
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,710
I'm here to see Lin Jinghan
about something.

175
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Why is everyone so quiet?

176
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,560
Who's actually in charge here?

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Here's the thing.

178
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,080
Lin Jinghan owes Mr. Zeng money,

179
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,210
and it's been overdue for 6 months.

180
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,640
He mortgaged your house as collateral.

181
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,310
If he doesn't repay the debt,

182
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,550
we'll have to seize your property.

183
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,550
We didn't mean to disturb you today.

184
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,080
We just need to see Lin Jinghan.

185
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,940
How much does Lin Jinghan owe you?

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,330
Lin Jinghan isn't here.

187
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,430
He hasn't been around for a long time.

188
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,650
Search.

189
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,030
Have we...

190
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,030
met before?

191
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,440
I don't know you.

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,560
You're really beautiful.

193
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,510
Yi,

194
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,870
go upstairs and check on your mom.

195
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,030
Call me if she shows any symptoms.

196
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay.

197
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,570
I'll come right up.

198
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,120
How much does Jinghan owe them?

199
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,160
Quite a lot, I think.

200
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,000
It must be a significant amount.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,240
How much exactly?

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
A debt is a debt—we can just repay it.

203
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,820
Where would we get the money
to pay it back?

204
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,450
During the years your father was ill,

205
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,360
everyone avoided us.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,080
Now that your father is gone,

207
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,010
who would even pay attention to us?

208
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,510
Even the banks are snobs,

209
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,380
and they won't grant us a loan.

210
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,690
It hurts.

211
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,670
Xiu,

212
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,310
take my mom upstairs too.

213
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,790
Ao,

214
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,130
no sign of Lin Jinghan on the first floor.

215
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,400
Then search the second floor.

216
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
When you find Lin Jinghan,
break one of his legs first.

217
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,890
Let's go.

218
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,620
It hurts.

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,900
Ao,

220
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,120
we couldn't find him.

221
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,630
This is my bedroom.

222
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,110
You can't go in!

223
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,320
My sister-in-law is inside.

224
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,780
She's about to give birth.

225
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,350
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,910
Lin Jinghan

227
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,330
must come with us.

228
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,110
Try going in if you dare!

229
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,540
Is she going to cut you?

230
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,810
It seems like it.

231
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,730
She wouldn't dare.

232
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,630
He won't hurt you either.

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
I know this man.

234
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,560
He always keeps his word
and handles things professionally.

235
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,090
Here, give me this cleaver.

236
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,440
Be good.

237
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,620
That was scary.

238
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,040
She actually did it!

239
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,600
Do you want me to
shoot a bullet through your dimple?

240
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,450
Are you crazy?

241
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,680
Why are you bullying a girl?

242
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,820
She cut me.

243
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,840
Didn't you bring that on yourself?

244
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,440
Auntie, my mom is in labor!

245
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,180
I'll give you 30 days.

246
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,800
Tell Lin Jinghan.

247
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,609
Get the money ready within 30 days.

248
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,430
This is the final deadline.

249
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,640
Let's go.

250
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,550
Boss says we're leaving.

251
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,310
Get lost!

252
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,500
Are you leaving or not?

253
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,780
Let's go!

254
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,730
I need a quick bandage.

255
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,000
Is it a boy or a girl?

256
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,960
Does it matter?

257
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,060
No, it doesn't.

258
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,550
Siyun,

259
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
with all this chaos at home today,

260
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,720
thank goodness you're here
to help deliver the baby.

261
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,610
Great.

262
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
It's a boy.

263
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,470
Our Lin family finally has an heir.

264
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,750
He's so beautiful.

265
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,750
He looks just like your dad

266
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,720
when he was just born.

267
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,350
I think he looks more like my mom.

268
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
What's wrong with your eyes?

269
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,040
Sister-in-law.

270
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,510
Yi,

271
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,880
get your mother a glass of water.

272
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
Okay.

273
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,640
How are you feeling?

274
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm fine.

275
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,360
Where's Lin Jinghan?

276
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,310
I... I'm here.

277
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,910
Down here.

278
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,350
Here.

279
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,910
Siyun,

280
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,530
are they all gone?

281
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,550
How did you make them leave?

282
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,680
Tell me about it.

283
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,840
How did you get in there?

284
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,000
Mom,

285
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,110
Xiu and Yi,

286
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,200
they lifted the bedboard for me.

287
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,910
In that critical moment,

288
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,240
I crawled in here.

289
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,850
Why didn't you tell me
you owed so much money?

290
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,550
Well, you just got back,

291
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,310
I needed time to tell you.

292
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,480
I just heard

293
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,120
that you're in charge of the family now.

294
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,870
Do you have a good plan
to help me repay the debt?

295
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
You owe the money.

296
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,410
Yes, right.

297
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,790
I didn't mean anything else.

298
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,070
I know I owe the money.

299
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,780
But aren't you
marrying into the Qiao family?

300
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,560
The Qiao family owns a huge bank.

301
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,600
Surely you can help me.

302
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,130
Please help me.

303
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,970
Tell me if you have any good ideas.

304
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,100
You owe the money,

305
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,300
so you pay it back yourself.

306
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,230
What's wrong with her?

307
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,190
Mom,

308
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,070
come here,

309
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,960
come here.

310
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,200
Help me lift

311
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,470
this bed board

312
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,380
so I can get out.

313
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm suffocating down here.

314
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,550
Jinghan,

315
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,150
take a look at your son!

316
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,830
He looks so much like you.

317
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,160
I see him—he does look like me.

318
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,310
Lift the bed board

319
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,000
and get me out—I can barely breathe!

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,440
This child is really beautiful.

321
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,550
Yes, yes, he is.

322
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,270
But I'm stuck in here,

323
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,240
-and I can't even see him.
-He looks just like you.

324
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,110
Hey, I just realized that

325
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,030
you've forgotten your own son
since you got a grandson.

326
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,650
How could you do this to me?

327
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,680
I know I'm in debt,
but you can't treat me like this!

328
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,740
Look at those eyes.

329
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,840
They're exactly like yours.

330
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,130
We came all this way for nothing today.

331
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,030
We didn't collect the debt.

332
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,310
How are you going to explain this
to my dad when you get back?

333
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,160
It's fine.

334
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll talk to him.

335
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,910
You're still so aggressive.

336
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,250
You always act recklessly,

337
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,710
doing whatever you want without thinking.

338
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,750
Since when do you hit women?

339
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,280
I've been different from others
since I was a kid.

340
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,100
Do you know about a hormone

341
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,820
called adrenaline?

342
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,240
My adrenaline levels

343
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
are higher than average,

344
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,070
so I'm prone to high blood pressure.

345
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Is high blood pressure contagious?

346
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,030
Your friend seems short-tempered too.

347
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,410
You're Jin, right?

348
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,790
How's your blood pressure?

349
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,790
It's normal.

350
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,480
That's good.

351
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,920
From now on, when we're out,
speak when you should,

352
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,350
and keep quiet

353
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,810
when you shouldn't.

354
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,270
Jin,

355
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,590
make a toast to Ao.

356
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,030
Ao, here's to you.

357
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,260
Cheers, Cheng.

358
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,270
Get lost!

359
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,980
Say that again, I dare you.

360
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,270
Stop, stop.

361
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,200
I just got back.

362
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,920
How about this?

363
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,790
I'll dance for you guys.

364
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,070
Follow me.

365
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,070
Have some tea.

366
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,310
Shijun,

367
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,690
long time no see.

368
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,420
You've studied abroad too.

369
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,330
Do you approve of arranged marriages?

370
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,010
Do you think we could be happy

371
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,880
if we got married?

372
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,530
When I was in middle school,
I promised Siyun

373
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,040
that I would make her

374
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,870
the happiest bride in Shanghai.

375
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,530
Everyone laughed at me back then,

376
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,110
but I meant it.

377
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,030
A big reason I went to study abroad later

378
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,350
was actually because of Siyun.

379
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,440
I thought we could go together

380
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,600
and look out for each other.

381
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,730
But I never expected

382
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,520
she would go to Germany
while I went to America.

383
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,680
A girl alone in a foreign country

384
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,310
must have suffered much more than I did.

385
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,620
I don't approve of arranged marriages.

386
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,720
But Siyun,

387
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,500
could you give me, Qiao Shijun, a chance?

388
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,280
Let's get to know each other again.

389
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,550
Yes, of course.

390
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,350
Well said.

391
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,500
Marriage is a big deal,
and it should be decided by parents.

392
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,040
Do you remember
when you two were kids, building blocks

393
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,350
and holding hands?

394
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,980
Now that you've grown up,

395
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,740
you even have the same long eyes

396
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,750
and oval face.

397
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
Chin up.

398
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,010
Look at that tall nose bridge.

399
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,530
You two really look alike.

400
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,440
Isn't that what they call
the couples' resemblance?

401
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,550
Uncle Qiao.

402
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,510
Couples who look alike

403
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,580
usually have beautiful children.

404
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
Whether the child looks like Siyun

405
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,590
or Shijun,

406
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,130
they're bound to be good-looking.

407
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,990
Did Mr. Qiao ask for your opinion?

408
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,010
Uncle Qiao,

409
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,030
I think we should

410
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,240
arrange their marriage

411
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,830
in the next day or two.

412
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,960
We should invite
all the influential people

413
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
in Shanghai.

414
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,700
The next day or two?

415
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,270
Tomorrow it is, then.

416
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,060
Isn't that too rushed?

417
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,230
Shijun,

418
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,200
take some time

419
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
to spend with Siyun.

420
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,700
You haven't seen each other
in years, right?

421
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,220
Yes.

422
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,550
Right, right.

423
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,640
Spend more time together.

424
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,400
Go see a movie,

425
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,440
have dinner and chat.

426
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Get reacquainted

427
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,220
and enjoy some sweet moments.

428
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,210
Alright.

429
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,910
We won't take up
any more of your time today.

430

Well... Shijun...

431
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,460
is quite tall.

432
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,070
Well, Mr. Qiao, Shijun,

433
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,080
take care.

434
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,240
I'll see you out.

what would you like to eat?

437
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,240
I'll cook for you myself today.

I'm not late, am I?

No.

443
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,720
I've already ordered for you.

They're all your favorites.

445
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,040
How did you know
these are my favorite dishes?

446
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,280
I wrote them down in a notebook
when we were little.

447
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,300
You... you wrote them down?

448
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,880
I also remember

449
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,960
that before you went abroad, you said

450
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,720
you wanted to open a
maternity hospital when you returned.

451
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,310
I can't believe you still remember that.

452
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,110
Of course I do.

453
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,110
And I think

454
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,350
opening a maternity hospital
has great potential.

455
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,960
There's a real need for it here
in our country.

It's a great choice.

How could I not support you?

461
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,830
Hurry and eat before the food gets cold.

462

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,320
There're so many girls
in Shanghai to have fun with.

513
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,750
Don't tell me
you actually loved that maid.

514
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,280
I did have feelings for her,

515
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,160
but I never thought she'd actually die.

516
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,030
Alright.

517
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,890
Take it easy.

518
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,710
If the sky falls,

519
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,860
my dad will hold it up.

520
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,720
If it falls again, I'll hold it up.

521
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,570
I'll help you with this.

522
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,010
Don't you need to drive?

523
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
No. I don't have a car.

524
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,120
Whose car is it, then?

525
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,720
It's your car.

526
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Young Master.

527
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,070
Hello?

528
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,560
Hello, Cheng Ao.

529
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,640
Who's this?

530
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,000
Guess who I am.

531
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,260
What is it?

532
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,470
That maid from the Lin family
jumped out of my car,

533
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,990
hit her head on the curb,

534
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,870
and she's dead.

535
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,440
I need you to check it out for me.

536
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,240
Her body's at Zhongde Hospital.

537
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,780
Auntie...

538
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
Xiu is dead.

539
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
We'll never see her again.

540
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,960
Miss Lin,

541
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,420
I'm Zeng Dalun's lawyer.

542
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,940
I'm here to express

543
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,050
condolences to the victim's family.

544
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,780
If it's convenient for you now,

545
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
we can have a talk.

546
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,880
Any requests

547
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
or compensation,

548
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,670
you can discuss them with me.

549
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,500
I don't want any compensation.

550
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,510
Please tell Zeng Dalun

551
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,130
that he will pay

552
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,900
for what he's done.

553
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,750
[Memorial tablet of Lin Shuping]

554
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,880
Siyun,

555
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,920
you're back.

556
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,440
How did it go?

557
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,150
How was it?

558
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,230
Siyun,

559
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,550
has the wedding date been set?

560
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,880
What's wrong?

561
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,690
Did you have a fight with Mr. Qiao?

562
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,440
How many times have I told you?

563
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,670
Don't act like a spoiled young lady again.

564
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,000
How could you argue with Mr. Qiao?

565
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,659
Mr. Qiao's such a nice person.

566
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,350
He has such a calm temper.

567
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,670
It must be your fault, right?

568
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,670
Don't you guys care about Xiu at all?

569
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,460
Who?

570
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,880
Xiu?

571
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
I mean, didn't you report it

572
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,710
to the police station this morning?

573
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,550
Leave Xiu's case to the police.

574
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,000
Focus on what matters,

575
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,270
like planning your own wedding, okay?

576
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,750
Xiu was murdered.

577
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,920
I can't get married now.

578
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,870
I understand,

579
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
Xiu was Nanny's daughter,

580
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,320
and Nanny was alawys good to you
when you were little,

581
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,230
right?

582
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,030
When you got sick,
she'd stay up all night watching over you.

583
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,320
I get it.

584
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,440
That child, Xiu, had a hard life.

585
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
But since she's gone,

586
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,020
we should comfort her father.

587
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,110
We'll cover the funeral expenses.

588
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
Would that be okay?

589
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,840
Siyun,

590
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,350
just focus on preparing for your wedding.

591
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,620
As for Xiu's case,

592
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,800
just leave it to Jinghan,

593
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,800
okay?

594
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:08,890
Hello?

595
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,150
Siyun,

596
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,510
my father would like to invite you
to our home for dinner tonight.

597
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,590
Please prepare for it.

598
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,590
I'll have someone come pick you up later.

599
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,400
Shijun,

600
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,630
Xiu is dead.

601
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,950
I need to take care of her funeral

602
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,740
and the lawsuit.

603
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,650
I won't be able to make it to dinner.

604
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,520
Who is Xiu?

605
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,080
My nanny's daughter.

606
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,130
Alright,

607
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,710
then you should
take care of Xiu's matter first.

608
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,910
Don't be too sad.

609
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,110
Take care of yourself
and don't wear yourself out.

610
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,040
My condolences.

611
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,510
Thank you.

612
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,550
Was that my future brother-in-law
on the phone?

613
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,300
Are you having dinner with him tonight?

614
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,610
You should eat, drink,

615
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,550
and enjoy your time.

616
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,250
Why don't you go by yourself?

617
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,390
Is this Dr. Lin Siyun's residence?

618
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,290
I'm Ling, a midwife from Zhongde Hospital.

619
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,470
The director asked me to inform you

620
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,490
that your job application
has been approved.

621
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,140
You can come to the hospital next Monday
to handle the paperwork.

622
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,820
Okay,

623
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,750
I understand.

624
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,160
Was that Shijun on the phone again?

625
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,760
Siyun, listen to me.

626
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,870
Would I ever harm you?

627
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,670
I'm your own brother.

628
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
Let me tell you.

629
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,730
Tonight, you...

630
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,030
Tonight,

631
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,250
you must go to have dinner with him.

632
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
If you offend him,

633
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,590
it'll affect the wedding.

634
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,510
Most importantly,
it's about the Lin family's legacy.

635
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,510
Do you hear me?

636
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,230
Mom,

637
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,620
I want to postpone the wedding.

638
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,890
Why do you want to postpone it?

639
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
Xiu was murdered.

640
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,670
Yes, I'm also sad

641
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,980
that Xiu died.

642
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,550
But at the end of the day,
wasn't she just an outsider?

643
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,680
Can't you tell what's more important?

644
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,280
If you keep messing around like this,

645
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,710
the Lin family will be ruined by you
sooner or later!

646
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,710
Have you no shame?

647
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,050
Is it me ruining the family or you?

648
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,400
Siyun,

649
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,720
just listen to your brother.

650
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,960
Don't worry about Xiu's case for now.

651
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,510
Let Jinghan handle it,

652
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,400
okay?

653
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,690
All he wants is for the Qiao family
to pay off his debts.

654
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,230
How can he be so despicable?

655
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,710
Since you put it that way,

656
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,370
then we need to have a real talk

657
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,670
in front of our mom.

658
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,960
You've had the finest food and drinks
since childhood.

659
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,760
We never mistreated you, right?

660
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,620
That's because of the Lin family.

661
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,750
Sending you abroad

662
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,280
to study,

663
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,880
getting a foreign education,

664
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
having all that knowledge to show off...

665
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,530
that's also because of the Lin family.

666
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,670
People...

667
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,380
shouldn't forget where they came from.

668
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,130
You're right.

669
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,960
The reputation earned
by the Lin family's ancestors

670
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,560
and the upbringing they gave me

671
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,820
mean I must repay them.

672
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,470
But I'm repaying the Lin family

673
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,510
and my parents.

674
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,500
Why should I have to
pay off the debts you owe?

675
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,890
By the way,

676
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
I was sent abroad
on a government scholarship.

677
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,820
I worked to support myself
in Germany for 4 years

678
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,660
and didn't spend a cent
of the family's money.

679
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,820
You've been in business for years.

680
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,760
Have you earned anything?

681
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,880
The Lin family served as officials
for generations,

682
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,770
and remained wealthy for over a century.

683
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,820
Now creditors are coming
to our door to collect debts.

684
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,350
Our reputation is damaged,

685
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,450
and we can't even keep our residence.

686
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,940
Whose fault is this, really?

687
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,530
Who squandered the Lin family's fortune?

688
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,940
Ao,

689
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I'd like to report something to you.

690
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,150
Go ahead.

691
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,000
The day the Lin family's maid died,

692
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Young Master didn't go to the theater.

693
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,950
That son of the Liu family

694
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,550
picked him up to go drinking.

695
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,510
And he took you along as well?

696
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,230
Yes, he did.

697
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,880
Then who drove his car?

698
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,610
I don't know.

699
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,180
Alright, I got it.

700
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,000
Ao,

701
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,710
this is a big deal.

702
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,400
Should we tell Master?

703
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,790
With Dalun's personality,

704
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,690
if he's determined to do this,

705
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,300
telling Master won't help.

706
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,690
That's true.

707
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,850
Dalun...

708
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,010
is hard to deal with.

709
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,760
So what should we do?

710
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,750
Don't worry. Let me think about it.

711
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,380
What do you want?

712
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,150
Do you have coffee here?

713
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,760
No.

714
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,710
Who would drink coffee this late at night?

715
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,240
About Zeng Dalun's case...

716
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,270
you're his defense lawyer, right?

717
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,960
The eldest daughter of the Lin family
came to see me today.

718
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,380
She said she's going to publish a report

719
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,580
alleging that Dalun murdered her maid.

720
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,000
As you know,

721
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,180
our paper has
the biggest circulation in Shanghai.

722
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,110
The Zeng family may be powerful,

723
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,770
but the victim was only a maid.

724
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,170
If this gets published,

725
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,970
it will cause such public outrage

726
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,100
and social pressure

727
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,360
that when you go to court,

728
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,710
hundreds of people will be outside,
blocking the courthouse.

729
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,510
How could you possibly win that case?

730
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,770
It will influence the judge's decision.

731
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,660
So tell me, should I publish it or not?

732
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,120
You must not publish this.

733
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,850
Fine,

734
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,910
I won't.

735
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,760
But,

736
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,220
putting our past as classmates aside,

737
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,800
based on my experience,

738
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,570
this piece would sell extremely well.

739
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,360
If I don't publish this,

740
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,840
what am I supposed to tell

741
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,030
my editor-in-chief when he asks?

742
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,300
How about this?

743
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,730
Lu Yingchen,

744
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,420
I'll buy every last copy
of whatever you publish

745
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,860
in tomorrow's paper.
