[Episode 9]

3
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,759
Mr. Cheng,

4
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,890
a gentleman is waiting for you inside.

5
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:02,910
I've made coffee for you.

6
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,759
No sugar.

7
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,010
What happened?

8
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,610
You've fallen out with Dalun?

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,740
Why do you say that?

10
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,120
Don't you know that Kang Kaisheng
is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

11
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,680
Kang Kaisheng is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Yes.

13
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,680
Shen Yiqun arrested Kang Kaisheng by night

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,870
and reported it to the Nanjing government.

15
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,470
The government immediately issued an order

16
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,400
to treat Kang Kaisheng as a rebel.

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,410
By the time Zeng Dalun arrived,

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,829
Kang Kaisheng had been sent to Nanjing.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now even if Zeng Dalun claims

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,660
that Kang Kaisheng is his man,

21
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,150
the Nanjing government wouldn't
admit their mistake.

22
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,520
Kang Kaisheng is doomed.

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Shen Yiqun said

24
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,130
you and he are on the same side,

25
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,120
and you two worked together
to arrest Kang Kaisheng.

26
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,840
You can't take Shen Yiqun's words

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,910
seriously.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Well done, bro.

29
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,250
You're playing politics now.

30
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,750
If you have any
inside political information,

31
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,350
tell me at the first time.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
But you should know

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,450
playing politics isn't that easy.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,190
Whether you

35
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,590
work with Shen Yiqun

36
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,280
or with Zeng Dalun,

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,730
you have to be careful.

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
I won't work with anyone.

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,550
You are different now.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You won't even be honest with me now.

41
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,210
Fine.

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,750
I understand.

43
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,000
Director.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,470
Siyun.

45
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,870
These two say they're
from the Health Department

46
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,930
and want to see you.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,430
Please come with me to my office.

48
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,030
No need.

49
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,710
We've received reports.

50
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,840
Sinan Maternity Hospital is suspected
of illegal medical practice

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
and violations of health regulations.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,210
Some of your practices even
violated ethical standards.

53
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,070
We have decided

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,520
to order your hospital
to cease operations immediately

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,980
for legal rectification.

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,120
The reopening time

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
depends on the rectification results.

58
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,190
I have government approval
for my operation.

59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,790
Who gave you this authority?

60
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,440
Here is the closure notice.

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,050
Read it yourself.

[Notice of Closing]

63
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,029
Those two people were sent by my father.

64
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,300
He was furious,

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,660
and almost tore the house apart.

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,420
Why?

67
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,710
You prescribed
birth control pills for Aunt Nan, right?

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,790
Yes, I did.

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
He found out.

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,159
All these years, he's been hoping that

71
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,960
he and Aunt Nan could have a baby.

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,560
Has your father ever asked

73
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,490
if Aunt Nan wants to have children?

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,380
Siyun.

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,010
I understand your progressive thoughts.

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,140
But my father doesn't.

77
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,470
He's very traditional.

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,270
Is Aunt Nan okay?

79
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,610
She is fine.

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,640
My father didn't get too angry with her.

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,870
Instead, he directed all his anger at you.

82
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't worry.

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,680
Take

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
these days a vacation for yourself.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,800
Take a good rest.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,860
I'll communicate with my father.

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,820
I'm glad Aunt Nan is okay.

88
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,610
Shen Yiqun.

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,640
Thank you for your concern.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,510
Still worried?

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,150
Yes.

92
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,390
I need to discuss something with you.

93
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,630
The statement on this notice

94
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,480
about Sinan Hospital

95
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
is completely false.

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,480
I didn't do anything illegal.

97
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,270
If we can trace the source
of these rumors,

98
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,360
and file an appeal,

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,510
will Sinan Hospital

100
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,480
be able to resume business soon?

101
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

102
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,960
But according to my experience,

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,120
from filing an appeal
to getting the verdict,

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
it will take

105
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,650
at least three months.

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Three months?

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,430
If

108
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,360
you have trouble tracking

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,080
the source of the rumors,

110
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,950
it might take

111
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
half a year.

112
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,200
So long?

113
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
Besides,

114
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,210
if there are many cases in court,

115
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,480
it might take ten months

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
or even a year.

117
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
How can I keep my hospital running if so?

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,770
My funds won't last ten months.

119
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,430
I have so many doctors and nurses,

120
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,480
and medical supplies.

121
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,150
However,

122
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,670
I do have a quicker solution.

123
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,470
Why are you so annoying?

124
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

125
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,390
Hello.

126
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm looking for Director Shen.

127
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,980
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

128
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,210
I told you already.

129
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,540
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,130
Then please give this photo

131
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,659
to him.

132
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,830
Director.

133
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,190
Come in.

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,950
Get out.

135
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,720
Miss Lin,

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,930
what do you mean?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,720
With Director Shen's intervention,

138
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,960
I believe the hospital's crisis

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
will be resolved soon.

140
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
You're threatening me?

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,310
Director Shen, you're overreacting.

142
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,240
It's just a matter of reciprocity.

143
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,820
Besides,

144
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,190
about Aunt Nan's birth control issue,

145
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,860
I hope you can stop interfering with it.

146
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,060
You want to meddle in my family affairs?

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,510
Then, I have no choice but
to talk to Mayor Zhu

148
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,970
about his family matters.

149
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,650
Thank you for your understanding,
Director Shen.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Dalun.

151
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,920
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
You want to talk to the director?

153
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,320
He probably won't be here for a while.

154
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,190
Why don't you come to my office first?

155
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,270
Let's have a chat.

156
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,330
Kang Kaisheng's incident

157
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,909
was truly a case of friendly fire.

158
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,880
He's too much like a Communist.

159
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,630
Think about

160
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,870
those articles he wrote,

161
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,669
and the things he did.

162
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:46,960
He looked exactly like
a rebel sympathizer.

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,909
I didn't know he was your man.

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Dalun,

165
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,120
although he's been sent to Nanjing now,

166
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,750
don't worry.

167
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,480
I'll go there myself later

168
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
to clear things up,

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
and bring him back to you.

170
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,480
Shen Yiqun.

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,490
What are you most afraid of?

172
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,290
What am I most afraid of?

173
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,870
Given the current situation,

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
what I fear most is that

175
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Japan would launch
a full-scale invasion of China.

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,630
People will be homeless refugees
at that time.

177
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,440
Imagine it.

178
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
When that time comes,

179
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,480
how much will the people suffer?

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm most afraid of venomous snakes.

181
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,760
Tigers and lions don't scare me at all.

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
But venomous snakes

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
always live in dark, damp places.

184
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,770
They will bite you
when you least expect it

185
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
and kill you easily.

186
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,910
Indeed.

187
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,150
Yiqun.

188
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,910
Director.

189
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,080
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm working here.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,270
I saw Dalun here.

192
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,870
So, I came in to chat with him.

193
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,360
You two know each other?

194
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,350
We've known each other since childhood.

195
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,410
We are old friends.

196
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,200
Altough

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,390
you are friends,

198
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,150
let me formally introduce you.

199
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,270
Dalun has joined

200
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,320
our department's special action team.

201
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,870
You two should work closely together
from now on.

202
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,630
What's more,

203
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,870
even Mr. Dai thinks highly of him.

204
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,670
Take good care of him.

205
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,070
Well, well!

206
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,340
Dalun,

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,810
congratulations!

208
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,840
If you need anything,

209
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,670
just let me know.

210
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,400
I'll fully cooperate with you.

211
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,300
Thanks for your kindness.

212
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,600
Now that the Director is here,

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,390
you'd report to him.

214
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,550
I'll head back first.

215
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,200
Come to my place for tea
after you're done.

216
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,670
Okay.

217
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,740
I'll leave, Director.

218
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,790
Good!

219
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
My method worked out, right?

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,030
Thank you.

221
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,280

is very important.

233
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,660
♪ I'll treasure what you gave me ♪

234
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm having dinner with Mr. Zeng tonight.

235
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:52,400
♪ That brightness in the darkness ♪

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,150
You're all busy.

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
But you came to celebrate my birthday.

238
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,550
Thank you.

239
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,870
It's our pleasure.

240
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,360
Our friendship

241
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
has lasted over 30 years now.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
He wasn't even born at that time.

243
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,740
Does your father know
about our relationship?

244
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,870
What relationship?

245
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,310
Why are you making it sound like

246
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,770
we have something to hide?

247
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,700
Will your father like

248
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,440
the gift I prepared for him?

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,750
Don't worry.

250
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,030
He'll definitely like it.

251
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,360
He loves drinking tea,

252
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,500
not to mention that

253
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,390
it's your gift.

254
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't be nervous.

255
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,300
It isn't your first time here.

256
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,440
And you've met him before.

257
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,150
It's different this time.

258
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,790
We came in arm in arm.

259
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,230
It'll get better if you come more often.

260
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,060
So,

261
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,800
whatever happens,

262
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,260
let us support each other.

263
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,180
Father.

264
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,960
Ao.

265
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,240
Dr. Lin.

266
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,190
Come in.

267
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,300
Please, come in.

268
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,390
Mr. Zeng.

269
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,390
Wish you a happy birthday.

270
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,750
Thank you.

271
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Look,

272
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,150
our family

273
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,510
has a lawyer.

274
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,470
In the future,

275
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,750
we will have a doctor.

276
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,840
Today,

277
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm blessed with double happiness.

278
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,980
Congratulations.

279
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,400
Father,

280
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,440
Siyun brought you a gift.

281
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,070
That's very kind of you.

282
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,510
What's this?

283
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,950
Tea.

284
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,360
Foreign tea. Look.

285
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,110
It even has foreign letters.

286
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,800
Put it away quickly.

287
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,090
I told you he would like it.

288
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,150
Cheng Ao, come here.

289
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:05,930
Father.

290
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,610
Thank you, Father.

291
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,670
What are you thanking me for?

292
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,840
It's not for you.

293
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,630
Take it.

294
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,630
It's from Father.

295
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,030
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

296
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,600
It's nothing.

297
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Master, bad news.

298
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,470
A group of people
from the police station are here.

299
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,600
Excuse me.

300
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,240
My friend.

301
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,150
May I help you?

302
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,200
Mr. Zeng,

303
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,380
someone reported that your son,
Zeng Dalun,

304
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,210
is hiding and selling opium.

305
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,150
There must be a misunderstanding.

306
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,480
Our family has strictly forbidden

307
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
opium trading.

308
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,270
Mr. Zeng,

309
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,410
this is an order from my senior.

310
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,760
This is a search warrant.

311
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,480
Have you lost your minds?

312
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,160
Get out of my house now!

313
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,000
If you don't leave,

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
I'll pull out my gun.

315
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,600
How dare you!

316
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,750
Step aside!

317
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,450
Young Master Zeng,

318
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,280
Mr. Zeng,

319
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,410
we came with a search warrant.

320
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,550
If we leave without doing anything,

321
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,600
we won't be able to report back properly.

322
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sure you understand.

323
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,240
Okay.

324
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Do your job.

325
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,300
But

326
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,750
today is my birthday.

327
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,330
I've invited many guests.

328
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,130
Our family values our reputation.

329
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
If you find nothing,

330
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,330
the police station

331
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,670
has to publicly apologize to our family.

332
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,390
Mr. Zeng,

333
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,790
if we find nothing,

334
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,030
I will certainly apologize.

335
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,910
And we'll publish

336
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,250
a front-page apology in the newspaper.

337
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,180
Please proceed.

338
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,750
Search!

339
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,790
Hurry up.

340
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,050
Over here!

341
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,440
Did you do this?

342
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,270
Dad,

343
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,690
I didn't do it.

344
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,090
Please trust me.

345
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,930
Found it!

346
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,790
Take it out!

347
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,630
Let's go!

348
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,550
Take it out!

349
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,100
Mr. Zeng,

350
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,630
please

351
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,010
verify if this is real.

352
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,250
Do what you should do.

353
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,160
Take him away.

354
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,210
It's fine.

355
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,100
I didn't do it anyway.

356
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,200
Alright.

357
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,220
I can walk.

358
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,270
Pack up and take him away.

359
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,480
Hurry up!

360
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,510
Mr. Cheng.

361
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,510
Our law firm has quite a few cases lately.

362
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,550
Could you help us handle some of them?

363
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,410
Here are the relevant documents.

364
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,400
No problem.

365
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,210
That's what old classmates are for.

366
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,730
You helped me a lot before.

367
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,080
This person has asked me for help.

368
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,160
You were too busy.

369
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,960
I recently have

370
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,070
a similar case.

371
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,600
I'll handle them together.

372
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,870
Alright, leave it to me.

373
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,480
Okay.

374
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,550
Cheng Ao,

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,240
when I was paying the fine
at the police station,

376
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,310
I asked around.

377
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,620
They said a lawyer
named Cheng reported me.

378
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,780
We didn't have any conflict, did we?

379
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,620
Even though you don't like

380
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,050
my way of doing things,

381
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,080
you shouldn't stab me
in the back like this.

382
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,150
You know I work

383
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,400
for the government.

384
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,390
My reputation is important.

385
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
After this incident,

386
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,960
I've been bribing officials,

387
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,800
explaining myself and entertaining others.

388
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,120
But I don't even know if these will help.

389
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,110
Shen Yiqun watches me every day.

390
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,880
You deliberately

391
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,940
gave him something to use against me.

392
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,130
Besides, I didn't even do this thing.

393
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,930
Boiling beans,

394
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
with beanstalks as fuel,

395
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,610
the beans

396
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,260
weep in the pot.

397
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,680
We are brothers.

398
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,480
I won't be angry with you.

399
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,380
You're blocking my light.

400
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,440
You had the police

401
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,170
arrest me at Dad's birthday banquet.

402
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,010
I can also choose not to tell Dad
about it.

403
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,240
Do not let him

404
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,110
worry about us.

405
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
He's getting old.

406
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,800
You can see that too, right?

407
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,450
From now on, you'll be
the head of this family.

408
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
And I'll be the second-in-command.

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,750
Cheng Ao.

410
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,860
We need to stick together.

411
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,720
Cheng Ao.

412
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,350
You're so talented.

413
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,000
Dalun.

414
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,150
I am

415
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,590
Jinghan.

416
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,270
I've noticed that

417
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,990
since you returned from the Northeast,

418
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,680
you've become quite famous in Shanghai.

419
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,240
Everyone knows your name.

420
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,830
Your career is really taking off.

421
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,640
I heard that you're now

422
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,680
working at the Revival Society,

423
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,610
and engaging in the opium trade.

424
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,880
I want to make big money with you.

425
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,720
I graduated from business school,

426
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,510
and I want to follow
in your footsteps, Dalun.

427
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,340
I'll follow your lead.

428
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,270
I will do whatever you want me to do.

429
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,680
Jinghan.

430
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,130
Have a drink.

431
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,410
Let me fill it up.

432
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,480
I actually quite like you.

433
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,570
How should I describe you?

434
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,310
You're like

435
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,440
a toothless old dog.

436
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,340
You don't bite,

437
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,850
but you're still quite intimidating.

438
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,590
I can't help you with work matters.

439
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,720
But if you want to come here for drinks,

440
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,640
it's on me.

441
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,750
Get out.

442
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,830
No visitors for the next 30 minutes.

443
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,690
Close the door.

444
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,970
Yes.

445
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,900
I did it.

446
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,790
Is everything in place?

447
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,880
All set, Director.

448
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,710
Let's go.

449
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
This is a search warrant.

450
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,270
Take it out.

451
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,000
Cheng Ao.

452
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,270
When I was paying
the fine at the police station,

453
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,350
I asked around.

454
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,860
I heard it was reported
by a lawyer named Cheng.

455
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,610
You dragged me down,

456
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,250
trying to tie me to you.

457
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,410
You're too afraid to face
Zeng Dalun yourself

458
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,880
because he works for Mr. Dai.

459
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,430
You're quite shameless.

460
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,030
I admit my method

461
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,670
is somewhat despicable.

462
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,760
But to make great achievements,

463
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,480
I should use some tactics.

464
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,800
I know Zeng Dalun is
the one who caused you trouble.

465
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,880
You're concerned about Mr. Zeng.

466
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,070
So, you didn't dare scheme against Dalun.

467
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,930
But I have nothing to worry about.

468
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,710
Since we have a common enemy,

469
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,880
why don't we brothers join forces?

470
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,070
It's a good thing.

471
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,550
Who said we're brothers?

472
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,240
No matter what Zeng Dalun did to me,

473
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,550
it is my own business.

474
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,550
I know.

475
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,960
You grew up together

476
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,860
and have loyalty between you.

477
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,010
But don't we have
something between us, too?

478
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,790
We did.

479
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,660
Before this incident, we did.

480
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,530
Now, when I look at you,
I just feel disgusted.

481
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,310
Cheng Ao,

482
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,200
I never thought

483
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,930
I would hear

484
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
these words from you.

485
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,480
I admit I'm a despicable person.

486
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,130
But without being this way,

487
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,770
how could I ever succeed?

488
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,390
Once I have power in my hands,

489
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,320
I'll share it with you.

490
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,070
Bro,

491
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,790
one of us has to be

492
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,480
the disgusting one.

493
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,830
Now, I've chosen to be the one.

494
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,680
What right do you have to criticize me?

495
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,750
Are you crazy?

496
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,640
Who's crazy?

497
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,160
Who wants your pathetic power?

498
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,960
No matter what happens
between you and Zeng Dalun,

499
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,700
don't get me involved. Got it?

500
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,200
Understand?

501
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,710
Director Shen.

502
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,240
Mr. Zeng.

503
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,290
Mr. Sada.

504
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,790
Your dad refuses to cooperate with us.

505
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,750
He also incited the union workers
to organize strikes.

506
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,200
Do you know all this?

507
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,200
My dad is quite traditional

508
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,310
and conservative.

509
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,110
Mr. Zeng.

510
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,680
Can you persuade your dad
to cooperate with us?

511
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,590
He could make a lot of money.

512
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,790
And we can guarantee your dad's safety.

513
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,110
Your dad has two choices,

514
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
cooperating with us

515
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,000
or being killed by us.

516
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,880
You're threatening me?

517
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,910
That's not my intention.

518
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,790
We are friends.

519
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,400
So, I'm telling you this.

520
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,190
I hope you can consider it.

521
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Why did you ask me to meet at the dock?

522
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,320
When we were kids,

523
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,700
we always played here.

524
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,750
When we were young,
Dad didn't allow us to drink

525
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,410
but we always drank in secret.

526
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,620
Remember that time

527
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,940
when you got drunk and Dad caught you?

528
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,230
He slapped you so hard
that two of your teeth flew out.

529
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,200
Nonsense.

530
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,590
He did slap me.

531
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,510
But my teeth didn't fall out.

532
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,490
Well,

533
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,240
I remember now.

534
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,880
I bought the wine for you.

535
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,070
You did buy it for me

536
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,430
but I never got to drink it.

537
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,440
You finished it all
before you even got home.

538
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
I saved you.

539
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,160
Otherwise, you would've been slapped, too.

540
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
Fine, thank you.

541
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,660
Cheng Ao.

542
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,720
About Xiu,

543
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,280
I didn't tell you the truth.

544
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,200
I know.

545
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,230
About Huang Aniu,

546
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,110
I also lied to you.

547
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
I know.

548
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,640
But today,

549
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,340
I need to tell you the truth

550
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,440
and be honest.

551
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,090
I do have connections with the Japanese.

552
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,740
They now wield considerable
influence in Shanghai.

553
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,400
I can only befriend them
and avoid making enemies.

554
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
It allows me to make money

555
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
without any risk.

556
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,320
I hope you understand that

557
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,770
and help me convince Dad

558
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,990
to cooperate with the Japanese.

559
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,990
What do you think?

560
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,160
Forget about Communism.

561
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,000
If you continue down that path,

562
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,730
it will only lead to your death.

563
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,750
Besides,

564
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,010
our family business

565
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,020
is only in the French Concession.

566
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,150
Soon after the Japanese come,

567
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,550
the French will all flee.

568
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Have you ever had Japanese food?

569
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,440
Tomorrow,

570
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,720
I'll invite Sada

571
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,030
to have a meal with us.

572
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,270
Sada is a nice person.

573
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,430
And

574
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
when you

575
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,440
put the sashimi in your mouth,

576
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,350
you will find the taste

577
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,070
is amazing.

578
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,840
What are you doing?

579
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,680
Where are you going?

580
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
Zeng Dalun.

581
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,870
We're not brothers anymore.

582
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Why?

583
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
Cheng Ao!

584
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,510
Come back!

585
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,570
Help me massage my back.

586
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:23,900
Master.

587
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,890
Mr. Cheng and Miss Lin are here.

588
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,310
Please show them in.

589
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,170
Yes, Master.

590
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Father.

591
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,270
Dr. Lin.

592
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,730
Father, please don't move.

593
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,110
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,640
I'm not feeling well.

595
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,160
Please excuse my negligence.

596
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,220
Please have a seat.

597
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,270
Mr. Zeng.

598
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,160
You don't need to attend to me.

599
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,510
Have you seen a doctor?

600
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,620
Would you like me to recommend
some Western doctors?

601
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,110
No need.

602
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,400
It's an old ailment.

603
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,480
A few doses of Chinese medicine will help.

604
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,240
Miss Lin.

605
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,680
Come sit in my room.

606
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,590
I want you to check on my baby.

607
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,450
Okay.

608
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,240
Yes.

609
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,160
Keep Dr. Lin company for a while.

610
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,610
Take it slow.

611
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,410
Come, have a seat.

612
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,710
Tell me the truth.

613
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,590
Did you report Dalun?

614
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,070
No.

615
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,580
Reporting him wouldn't be wrong.

616
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
I just don't want to see

617
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,110
you two turning against each other.

618
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,030
You lost your parents when you were young.

619
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,030
I've always treated you as my own son.

620
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,200
I hoped you two

621
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,310
would get along well

622
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,950
and support each other.

623
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,139
Dalun is a jerk

624
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,840
who deserves to die.

625
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,880
But I hope the one who kills him

626
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,040
wouldn't be you.

627
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,650
Do you understand?

628
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,949
Have a rest, Father.

629
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,880
Dad.

630
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,070
Stand up!

631
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,320
Are you still hanging around
with the Japanese?

632
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,280
Cut the crap.

633
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,280
You did business

634
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,630
with the Japanese in Changchun,

635
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,160
selling local goods to them

636
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,910
and bringing Japanese products back here.

637
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,570
You think I don't know?

638
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,740
I did it to make money.

639
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,590
Nonsense!

640
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,470
Besides doing business,

641
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,670
what else did you do?

642
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,480
Nothing.

643
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,340
You worked with Huang Aniu

644
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,420
trafficking opium

645
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,950
and had your gang members

646
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,560
attack Cheng Ao,

647
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,220
right?

648
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,960
Zeng Dalun,

649
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,600
you're playing with fire.
Do you realize that?

650
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,230
Dad.

651
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,840
I'm working for the Revival Society now.

652
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,680
I need

653
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,320
money to get things done here.

654
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,550
How can I rise step by step
without money?

655
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,590
But you should not
collude with the Japanese.

656
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,030
That's my bottom line.

657
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,870
I'm not trying to collude with them.

658
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,580
They came to me first.

659
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,930
You incited the union workers to strike.

660
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,030
They gave you two options.

661
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,630
Cooperate with them

662
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,890
and make a lot of money.

663
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,790
Or,

664
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
they'll kill you.

665
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,480
Let them try.

666
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,230
If I am frightened,

667
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,830
I'm not worthy to be your dad.

668
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,150
Dad.

669
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,230
In my opinion,

670
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,110
you are too conservative.

671
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,230
Why are you so stubborn?

672
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,880
You've taught us since we were young

673
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,010
we should not make enemies
with forces stronger than us.

674
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,710
You made the union workers strike.

675
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,030
The Japanese didn't punish you.

676
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,070
Instead, they want to cooperate with you.

677
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,360
What a great opportunity!

678
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,230
I think

679
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
the Japanese influence in Shanghai

680
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,890
is getting stronger and stronger.

681
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,710
You'll have to face the Japanese
sooner or later.

682
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,630
Better sooner than later.

683
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,750
We need to use

684
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,850
the Japanese influence

685
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,510
to become the number one group
in Shanghai.

686
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,400
Get out!

687
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,270
Dad.

688
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,670
After more than 20 years,

689
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,710
your still have so much strength.

690
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:38,990
Alright.

691
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,710
It won't be long

692
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,010
before we see whose judgment is correct.

693
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,670
Old man.

694
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,670
Don't go out these days unless necessary.

695
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,630
Take some men with you when you go out.

696
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,160
Be careful not to be killed.

697
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,590
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

698
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,440
Mr. Cheng,

699
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,520
Master is feeling unwell.
He's asking you to come over.

700
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What's wrong with Father?

701
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,710
Is he okay?

702
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,690
He said he has important matters
to tell you.

703
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,110
Okay, I'll be right there.

704
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,090
Master.

705
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,320
Mr. Cheng is

706
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,510
waiting at the door.

707
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,670
I'll step out first.

708
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,270
Call me if you need anything.

709
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,170
Yanhong.

710
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,190
Sit down.

711
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,540
What I'm about to discuss

712
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,360
concerns you.

713
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,280
Father.

714
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,510
Ao,

715
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,760
have a seat.

716
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,720
I'll tell you something.

717
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,810
Write it down.

718
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,950
I want to change my will.

719
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
All my assets,

720
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,760
houses,

721
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,050
and the land in my hometown

722
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,510
which were originally intended for
my sole heir, Zeng Dalun,

723
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,770
will be divided into four equal parts.

724
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,510
One part

725
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,570
goes to my eldest son, Zeng Dalun.

726
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,480
One part

727
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,390
goes to my adopted son, Cheng Ao.

728
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,590
One part

729
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,430
goes to Xiao Yanhong

730
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,420
and her young son.

731
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,060
The last part

732
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,080
should be donated to my hometown

733
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,620
to build schools

734
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,090
and charity houses.

735
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,590
Thank you, Master.

736
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,350
Have you written everything down?

737
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,150
After it's finished,

738
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,770
I'll sign it.

739
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
Everything is noted.

740
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,990
I'll take my leave now, Father.
