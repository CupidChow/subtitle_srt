00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
Therefore,

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
I'll bear the consequences.

You may be able to stop one newspaper...

173
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,060
but can you stop every newspaper
in Shanghai?

174
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,580
Even if you could stop every newspaper
in Shanghai,

175
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,120
I'd write it, print it,

176
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,180
and distribute flyers myself—

177
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,790
I'll make sure everyone in Shanghai knows

what you've all done.

there's no need to go to all that trouble.

00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,870
He's a man of his word.

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,540
When he says it'll be published,

183
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,070
then it definitely will be.

184
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,450
You can rest assured.

Hello, is this Dr. Lin?

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,400
[Pre-Check]

188
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,140
This is Lingling,
a midwife at Zhongde Hospital.

189
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,840
We've just received a woman
having difficulty in labor,

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,270
and her condition is extremely critical.

191
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,000
But all of our on-duty obstetricians

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,670
have been called away
to see other patients.

193
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,120
So Director Lu asked me to call and see

194
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,930
if you could come over right away.

195
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,590
No problem.

196
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,270
Great.

197
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
What's the situation?

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,790
We've just admitted this pregnant woman.

199
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,910
Her family says she's been in labor
at home for two days and a night,

200
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,440
and most of her amniotic fluid
has leaked out.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,360
Why did they wait so long to bring her in?

202
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,390
The woman came with

203
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,720
her husband and mother-in-law.

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,390
Her mother-in-law is
a traditional midwife,

205
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,360
and they were planning to
deliver the baby at home.

206
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,410
She was only brought in
because there was no other way.

207
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,940
Okay.

208
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,620
Got it.

209
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,980
She needs a C-section.

210
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,430
What?

211
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,600
How can that be acceptable?

212
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,720
This is
my daughter-in-law's first pregnancy.

213
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
If you cut open her belly,

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,550
how will she be able to
have children in the future?

215
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,080
It won't affect future childbearing.

216
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,550
Is there any other option?

217
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,880
This is the only option.

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,390
how is she?

221
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,440
The surgery was successful.

222
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,270
You should go home
and bring some necessities.

223
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,080
She should stay hospitalized for a month

224
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
to fully recover.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,640
Then...

226
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,080
can she still have a second child?

227
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,840
Enough, Mom.

Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

Thank you, doctor.

231
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,240
Back then, my nanny
couldn't receive proper treatment

232
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,970
because of backward thinking,

233
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,560
which is why I later went abroad to study.

234
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,760
I hope I can do my best to prevent

235
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,790
such tragedies from happening again.

236
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh my goodness! What's happening?

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A little hand is coming out!

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,670
Quick! Go get me some salt!

239
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,150
What do you need salt for?

240
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,810
Put the salt on that little hand,

241
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,440
and the baby

242
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,300
will instinctively pull it back.

243
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,630
Mom!

244
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,680
Don't panic.

245
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,360
This is just normal dizziness
from blood loss during labor.

246
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,150
Go heat up an iron weight
until it's red hot,

247
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,750
then bring a bowl of vinegar.

You silly girl,

251
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,250

Why don't you trust me?

I've delivered so many babies.

254
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,330
Let me tell you, in a moment,

255
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,960
when she takes that red-hot weight,

256
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,390
we'll pour vinegar over it.

Once that smell hits her nose,

she'll wake up immediately.

I thought you might not be able to make it

280

because you had to deal with Xiu's matter.

No, thanks.

286
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,270
My parents will be a bit late.

287
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,400
Let's wait for them.

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,790

I'm really happy.

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,670
Happy about what?

291
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,550
I've always dreamed of marrying a doctor.

292

I can't believe my dream came true.

do you know about
the Zeng family's background?

302

See?

326
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,970
My parents and I
share the same aesthetic taste.

327
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
Bring the dishes up.

328
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,240

Go ahead.

335
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,099
I want to open a maternity hospital.

336
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,109
And then?

337
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,880
I studied obstetrics and gynecology
in Germany for 4 years.

338
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,970
The country funded my education,

339
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,670
so I want to give back
by serving the public.

340
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,680
Besides,

341
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,400
from a business perspective,

342
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,790
right now,

343
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,790
90% of births in our country

344
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:38,070
are handled by traditional midwives.

345
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,160
But that carries risks.

346
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,530
If we establish

347
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
a highly professional maternity hospital,

348
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,740
we can help mothers give birth safely

349
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,070
while providing solid returns
to investors.

350
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,350
Uncle,

351
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,830
what do you think?

352
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,840
I think it's an excellent idea.

353
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,880
Write up a proposal,

354
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,970
prepare a budget,

355
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,200
and I'll take a look.

356
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,680
Okay.

357
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,370
I'll help her with it.

358
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,350
Good.

359
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,550
Cheers.

360
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,920
Father wants you to leave.

361
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,850
Leave Shanghai.

362
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,380
Why?

363
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,920
What do you mean, "why"?

364
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't you know what you've done?

365
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,030
I can't defend this case
with a not-guilty plea.

366
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,100
In fact,

367
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,870
this is a case of negligent homicide.

368
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,160
We need the victim's family's forgiveness
and the court's leniency

369
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
to reduce your sentence.

370
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,850
But the plaintiff wants you to
get a severe sentence.

371
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,650
You need to get your luggage ready.

372
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,110
Pack up when you have time.

373
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,300
When should I leave?

374
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,570
The sooner the better.

375
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,130
Just my darn luck.

376
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,120
I just got back,
and now I have to leave again.

377
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,580
Do you have a place in mind?

378
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,740
Northeast China.

379
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,420
Why there?

380
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,750
The latitude there is

381
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,680
similar to where I studied abroad.

382
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,030
I look good in heavy clothes.

383
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,610
Plus, the situation there is chaotic.

384
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,550
"In times of turmoil, heroes rise."

385
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,490
Where's the gift I gave you?

386
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,200
You mean this?

387
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,960
You want it back?

388
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,160
Well, I'll give you two options too:

389
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,730
one,

390
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,270
I keep this and go to Northeast China.

391
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,700
Two,

392
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,420
I return this to you,

393
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,280
and I go to jail.

394
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,370
Keep your head down once you get there.

395
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,300
No one will protect you there.

396
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
I'll miss you.

397
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,790
When I write to you,
remember to write back.

398
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,850
Just don't send me a farewell letter.

399
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,510
Go back and pack up early.

400
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,590
Miss Lin!

401
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,160
Miss Lin.

402
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,370
You don't need to go to court anymore.

403
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,390
Mr. Zeng has already paid the fine
for Zeng Dalun,

404
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,310
and Zeng Dalun

405
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,080
has also left Shanghai.

406
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,490
You arranged this, didn't you?

407
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
Here's the compensation.

408
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,590
Get lost.

409
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,670
None of you Zengs is any good.

410
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,310
Sometimes what you see

411
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,130
isn't necessarily the truth.

412
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,060
What do you mean?

413
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,470
The one who killed Xiu

414
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,610
wasn't Dalun.

415
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,180
Get lost!

416
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,790
You're an accomplice to murder.

417
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,750
If you ever need help,

418
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
just let me know anytime.

419
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,610
You're not only thick-skinned

420
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,220
but also shameless.

421
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,160
Siyun.

422
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,030
I asked you out for no particular reason.

423
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,630
I just wanted to chat with you

424
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
to cheer you up.

425
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,020
After living and studying in Germany
for 4 years,

426
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,480
how does it feel to be back?

427
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,750
It's fine.

428
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,450
"Fine"?

429
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,820
Still putting on a brave face?

430
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,520
You've been through so much
since you came back,

431
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,980
and you think I don't know?

432
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,920
No matter who experienced those things,

433
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,220
they couldn't possibly feel "fine."

434
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,550
But Siyun,

435
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
isn't that just how life is?

436
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,270
Since things have already happened,

437
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,730
we can't run away from them

438
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,650
and can only face them bravely.

439
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,750
If there's anything you need my help with,

440
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,920
just say the word.

441
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,370
Anything at all.

442
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,930
You're going to marry Qiao Shijun.

443
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,950
That's good.

444
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,860
Wishing you happiness.

445
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,810
Thank you, Shen Yiqun.

446
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,880
I really didn't.

447
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,920
You know me.

448
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,240
How could I possibly

449
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
fall for a woman so easily?

450
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,070
That night, she kept pouring me drinks;

451
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,200
after baijiu came beer,

452
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,310
and after beer came wine.

453
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,480
I drank way too much.

454
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,630
When I woke up the next morning,

455
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,070
there was breakfast by the bedside.

456
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,750
A few days later,
she claimed she was pregnant.

457
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,610
How am I supposed to believe that?

458
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,200
That's the whole situation.

459
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,730
Anyway, you have to help me.

460
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,240
How am I supposed to help you?

461
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,840
Isn't this your usual style?

462
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,640
Come on, man, don't joke around.

463
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,550
I was completely wasted.

464
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,120
How could I maintain my usual behavior?

465
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,570
I think this woman is up to something.

466
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,580
It's a trap. She's trying to set me up.

467
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,640
I swear on my honor.

468
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,570
You have honor?

469
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,880
Occasionally.

470
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,270
What if she really is pregnant
with your child?

471
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,000
If she really is pregnant with my child,

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
then she's lucky.

473
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll support her,

474
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,110
and I'll raise the child.

475
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,750
But do you think that's even possible?

476
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,510
We only knew each other for one day.

477
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,310
That in just one day,

478
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,550
a woman would be willing to
have a child for a man she's just met—

479
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,680
it's absurd.

480
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,110
You won't do this for free.

481
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,350
If you can resolve this

482
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,310
without spending a penny,

483
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,750
all this money is yours.

484
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,350
I've got another meeting. I gotta go.

485
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,810
Go handle this right away.

486
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,860
Hello,

487
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,050
I'm looking for Director Shen.

488
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,960
I have an appointment.

489
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,090
My name is Lin Siyun.

490
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,410
I know you.

491
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,560
Please come with me.

492
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,700
Hello, Director Shen.

493
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,130
My name is Lin Siyun.

494
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,750
Please have a seat.

495
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,700
These are my documents for my application
to open a maternity hospital.

496
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,830
Please review them.

497
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,150
Miss Lin, I hope your hospital

498
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,910
will be very successful.

499
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,940
Thank you, Director Shen.

500
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,000
When the hospital opens,

501
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,320
please come with your wife
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

502
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,720
Okay, certainly.

503
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,200
I'll go with Mr. Qiao then.

504
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,380
By the way,

505
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,980
there's one more thing.

506
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,310
My daughter is turning 20,

507
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,950
and I'd like to invite you

508
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,270
and Qiao Shijun to
come to her birthday party.

509
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,040
You young people can

510
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,730
chat and make friends,

511
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,370
okay?

512
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,660
Okay.

513
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,420
Thank you, Director Shen.

514
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,500
I'll take my leave now.

515
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,350
Okay, okay.

516
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,200
Hello,

517
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,600
Miss Dai Xi.

518
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,290
Who are you?

519
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Shen Yiqun

520
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,090
to have a chat

521
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,300
with you, Miss Dai.

522
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,160
Tell Shen Yiqun.

523
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,380
My demands are very clear.

524
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,750
He must publish in the newspaper,

525
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,480
acknowledging me and my child.

526
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,310
He must marry me properly into his family.

527
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,530
I want to be Mrs. Shen.

528
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
My child

529
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,480
must have inheritance rights
to his family fortune.

530
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,570
How much money do you want?

531
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,260
Are you men all this shameless?

532
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,520
I don't want money.

533
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,890
I want legitimacy.

534
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,000
Guess

535
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,920
why I'm here?

536
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,710
He can't give you

537
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,460
the legitimacy you want.

538
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,490
Then I'll see him in court.

539
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
If I suffer,

540
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,780
he won't have it easy either.

541
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,830
When he was pursuing me,

542
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,510
he was so attentive

543
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,310
and full of sweet talk.

544
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,880
And now?

545
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,880
Once he got what he wanted, he changed.

546
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,610
He pursued you?

547
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,040
Yes.

548
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,000
When he was pursuing me,

549
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,110
he promised to treat me well,

550
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,270
to take responsibility for me,

551
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,070
and to marry me.

552
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,110
What did he tell you?

553
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,870
Pretty much the same as you said.

554
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,340
Sister-in-law,

555
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,930
have you named the baby yet?

556
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,920
No. Your brother said

557
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,830
we should consult the fortune teller
who named Yi.

558
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Where's Yi?

559
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,590
I haven't seen her anywhere.

560
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,190
Mom took her to the hospital.

561
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,680
Hospital?

562
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Don't worry.

563
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,730
They went to visit a relative,

564
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,590
you know,

565
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,640
Yi's fiancé.

566
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,680
Wasn't that engagement called off?

567
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,510
No.

568
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,430
Why not?

569
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,070
I don't have a say in this matter.

570
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,450
Your brother makes the decisions.

571
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,510
Grandma,

572
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,500
why are we coming to the hospital?

573
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,510
I'm bringing you to meet

574
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,810
your cousin, whom you've never met before,

575
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,480
Xiong.

576
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,050
W-Why do I need to meet him?

577
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,680
What do you mean, "why"?

578
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,720
He's family.

579
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,340
Just get to know each other.

580
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Alright.

581
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,510
You two kids play.

582
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,810
Grandma will step out for a bit

583
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,670
and come back to pick you up later.

584
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,350
So you're Xiong?

585
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm Yi.

586
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,190
How old are you?

587
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,140
Why are you here?

588
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,640
What illness do you have?

589
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,890
Have you read Andersen's Fairy Tales?

590
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,240
Do you know Darwin?

591
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,370
[Zhongde Hospital: palpitations,
chest tightness, arrhythmia, and dyspnea]

592
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,490
[Congenital heart disease—
VSD with moderate tricuspid insufficiency]

593
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm going to die.

594
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,520
Don't say that. You'll be fine.

595
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,580
Father, you wanted to see me?

596
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,570
Come on, have a seat.

597
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,030
The Shen family sent an invitation.

598
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,130
[To Cheng Ao]

599
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,560
It's for their eldest daughter's

600
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,490
birthday party.

601
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,490
The Shen family is really
riding high lately.

602
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,960
Their eldest son

603
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,290
has just been promoted

604
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,070
to a key position in the government.

605
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,960
They say
it's their daughter's birthday party,

606
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,490
but it's just an excuse...

607
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,170
to show off.

608
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,880
Ao.

609
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,790
You and Shen's eldest son
were classmates in England.

610
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,460
How are you getting along?

611
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,160
We're on good terms,

612
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,750
but

613
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,750
we don't have much contact professionally.

614
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,550
Why not?

615
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,240
I don't know
how to deal with politicians like him.

616
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,460
That's a scholar's pretentiousness.

617
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,110
When a friend of yours becomes successful,

618
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,030
you avoid him,

619
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,640
and that can show your moral superiority?

620
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,400
No matter how high
an official someone becomes,

621
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,530
they still need support from friends.

622
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,920
I'm not asking you to
deliberately curry favor with him,

623
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,030
but there's no need

624
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,940
to avoid him either, right?

625
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,420
Ao.

626
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,550
This family...

627
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,070
will be yours to run in the future.

628
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,930
Take the invitation and go.

629
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,530
Rest early, Father.

630
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,800
Bravo! Bravo!

631
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,080
Nan.

632
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,310
Siyun.

633
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,960
This is Nan.

634
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,240
You can call her Mrs. Shen,

635
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,270
or you can just call her Nan

636
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,110
like I do.

637
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,110
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Shen.

638
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,240
Likewise, Miss Lin.

639
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,750
I've always heard Yiqun mention you,

640
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,640
and I finally get to meet you today.

641
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,750
I've also heard

642
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,470
that you want to
open a maternity hospital.

643
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,170
Yes.

644
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,620
When it opens,

645
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,900
I'd be honored
if you'd come and cut the ribbon.

646
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,030
I'd be delighted to.

647
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,860
But I'm curious.

648
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,660
Why do you want to
open a maternity hospital?

649
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,130
I'm opening this hospital because

650
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,480
giving birth in a hospital is

651
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,220
a luxury many women can't afford.

652
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,030
I want to lower that barrier

653
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,560
so I can help

654
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,250
more ordinary women in labor.

655
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,250
That's very admirable.

656
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,030
To be honest,

657
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,950
before I got married,

658
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,110
I always wanted to establish

659
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,710
a maternity hospital
accessible to all women.

660
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,330
Are you surprised?

661
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,810
When Nan was in college,

662
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,510
she was the student council president

663
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,400
and an activist in student movements.

664
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,040
Protests, strikes, or demonstrations—

665
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,270
she participated in all of them. Right?

666
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,720
In terms of progressive thinking,

667
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,680
she's absolutely on par with

668
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,240
those who studied abroad like you.

669
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,070
It's just a shame

670
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,200
she married my old-fashioned father.

671
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,990
Don't listen to him.

672
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,710
Miss Lin, meeting you today,

673
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,440
I feel like I'm seeing my younger self.

674
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,010
I feel that China's new generation

675
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,610
gives me hope for the future.

676
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,070
Thank you
for your encouragement, Mrs. Shen.

677
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,530
I'll certainly do my best.

678
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Excuse me,

679
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,160
I'm sorry to interrupt,

680
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,380
but are you sure
this is your first time you've met?

681
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,920
I feel like you two are

682
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,150
just like old friends
who've known each other for years.

683
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,480
And you're remarkably similar, you know?

684
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,920
You're both equally beautiful,

685
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,190
and your thinking is so perfectly aligned.

686
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,590
So I think when you're free,

687
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,320
you should hang out together,
grab meals, or go shopping.

688
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,840
Also, when you're starting your hospital,

689
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,130
if there's anything you don't understand,

690
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,300
you can ask Nan.

691
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,630
Sure.

692
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,960
No problem,

693
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,760
anytime.

694
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,790
Alright, I'll leave you young folks.

695
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,739
I still have some things
to take care of downstairs.

696
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,469
Then I'll go give Miss Shen her gift.

697
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,090
She's downstairs. Go ahead.

698
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,110
Miss Shen.

699
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,030
Happy birthday.

700
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,230
Thank you.

701
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,310
Miss Lin, I didn't expect
you would come too.

702
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,710
Have you seen my brother?

703
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,710
Haven't you two been out of contact
for a long time?

704
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,190
We just ran into each other

705
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,500
and chatted for a bit.

706
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,550
My brother is such a catch.

707
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,350
You should really consider him.

708
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,780
Never mind.

709
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,070
I'm not the type to pressure anyone.

710
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,590
Free love, right?

711
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,070
He's very sought after now.

712
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,480
He's doing really well,

713
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,230
rising rapidly
through the government ranks.

714
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,360
Miss Shen.

715
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,600
Happy birthday.

716
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,730
Qiao Shijun, it's you.

717
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,550
Thank you.

718
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,980
Why don't you two dance?

719
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,710
I'll go look around over there.

720
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,860
Siyun.

721
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,450
Shall we dance?

722
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,280
Dance with me.

723
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,850
You hate me?

724
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,360
Some things

725
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,520
that you see

726
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,970
aren't necessarily true.

727
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,400
Marriage is a serious matter.

728
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Are you finished?

729
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,080
If you want to go,

730
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,580
you can go anytime.

731
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,630
I'm waiting for you to bring me good news.

732
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,160
Indeed, there's good news.

733
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,110
First,

734
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,630
Dai Xi truly loves you.

735
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,460
Second,

736
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,350
I'm not dealing with this anymore.

737
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,910
What exactly did she tell you?

738
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,440
Anyway, it's different from
what you told me.

739
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,790
Fine.

740
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,760
Buddy,

741
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,830
I'll be honest.

742
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,840
Dai Xi is now caught up in politics.

743
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,190
I have a political enemy surnamed Liu.

744
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,250
You don't know him.

745
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,400
He wants to use Dai Xi
to smear my reputation.

746
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,150
You know me.

747
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,830
I never stir up trouble.

748
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,430
But this time, trouble came to me.

749
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,320
Liu is a despicable man.

750
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,630
Before all this happened,

751
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,160
I kept my distance from him,

752
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,160
but now that things have unfolded,

753
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,180
I have no choice but to fight back.

754
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm not just going to fight back.

755
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,540
I'm going to defeat him completely,

756
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,920
making him unable to show his face again.

757
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
This is politics.

758
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,090
If you're interested,

759
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,670
I'll teach you all about it another day.

760
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,590
But you have to

761
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,730
help me settle this matter.

762
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,860
We've clinked glasses
but haven't drunk yet!

763
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,390
Brother.

764
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,410
Brother.

765
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,700
Who was that guy dancing with Lin Siyun?

766
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,440
Him?

767
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,070
He was dancing with Lin Siyun?

768
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah.

769
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,400
Who is he?

770
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,640
He's a pillager,

771
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,960
thug,

772
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,960
and murderer.

773
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,970
You'd better not ask about him.

774
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,370
Sounds quite interesting.

775
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,540
What's wrong with you? Interesting?

776
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,250
You'd better stay...

777
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,650
You'd better stay away from him.

778
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,450
Do you hear me?

779
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,400
I like dancing with a pillager.

780
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,400
I just saw Mayor Wang

781
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,440
come with his son.

782
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,220
Go dance with Mayor Wang's son.

783
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,020
Go on, be a good girl.

784
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,830
I won't!

785
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,320
It's my birthday. Can't I speak my mind?

786
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
Since you love dancing so much,
go dance with Mayor Wang's son then.

787
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,230
Hey, you... your brat...

788
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,690
Don't keep pointing at me!

789
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,180
You're back, Siyun.

790
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,280
How was it?

791
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,590
Did you enjoy the party?

792
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,130
Let me show you something good.

793
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,030
A written IOU.

794
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,030
[IOU]

795
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,510
The Qiao family promised

796
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,910
that after your wedding,

797
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
they'll help me settle all my debts.

798
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,490
I really...

799
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,150
I really thank you for this.

800
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,600
I really mean it—sincerely,

801
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,410
genuinely,

802
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,160
from the bottom of my heart.

803
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,770
You single-handedly

804
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,480
saved our Lin family.

805
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,440
But from today on,

806
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,210
you need to start going to bed
and waking up early.

807
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:32,980
Go jogging,

808
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
exercise,

809
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,820
and strengthen your body.

810
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,140
You mustn't fall ill before the wedding.

811
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:41,980
Mom.

812
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
What's going on with Yi's marriage?

813
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
What era is this,
and you're still arranging her marriage?

814
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,460
What will people say if this gets out?

815
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,280
It'll affect Yi too.

816
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
How is she supposed to make friends?

817
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,450
Regarding Yi's marriage...

818
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,050
I don't have the final say.

819
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,560
Whatever your brother says

820
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,480
is what we'll do.

821
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,280
Mom.

822
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,190
If it's inconvenient for you to handle it,

823
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,800
I'll go to the Zhu family myself.

824
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,050
No, no, no need.

825
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,380
I'll handle it.

826
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,570
We completely respect you.

827
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,170
Whatever you disapprove of,

828
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,560
we won't do.

829
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,790
Tomorrow, I'll go talk to Madam Zhu.

830
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,730
And we won't take no for an answer.

831
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,070
Now, if anyone tries to pick on

832
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,400
our Lin family,

833
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,110
I won't stand for it.
