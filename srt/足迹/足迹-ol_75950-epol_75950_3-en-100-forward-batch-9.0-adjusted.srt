[Episode 3]

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,550
Mom,

4
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,350
if you're not comfortable going there,

5
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,940
I'll go to the Zhu family myself.

6
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,100
No need.

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,509
I'll go.

8
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,759
I totally respect your decision.

9
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,620
If you don't want to do something,

10
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,000
no one can force you.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,040
Tomorrow I'll tell Mrs. Zhu.

12
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,120
She has to agree.

13
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,430
If anyone dares to bully

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,590
us,

15
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,970
I'll be the first to stand against it.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Our family is doing so well now.

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,840
Mom.

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,920
Well, Siyun.

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,590
Look at these fabrics.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,470
The Qiao family sent them
for your casual clothes,

21
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,840
all imported from Paris.

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
What do you think?

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,930
Auntie.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,079
Look.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,710
This is the wedding dress
I designed for you.

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,640
Is it beautiful?

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,120
It is designed by you.

28
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,360
It's really beautiful.

29
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,280
The dress is

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,430
not important.

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,870
The key point is Siyun's beauty,

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
elegance,

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
and figure.

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,960
No matter what she wears,

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,360
she's the most beautiful girl in Shanghai.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,630
My aunt will definitely be

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,960
the most beautiful bride in Shanghai.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,310
And I'll be

39
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,240
the happiest brother-in-law in Shanghai.

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,870
Mom,

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,230
you'll be the happiest mother-in-law
in Shanghai.

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,680
Yi,

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,410
do you know what this is?

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,180
When one person succeeds,

45
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,510
even his dog and chicken ascend to heaven.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,030
Who's dog and who's chicken?

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,470
I'm the chicken, and you're the dog.

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,310
No, no.

49
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,010
I'm the dog, and you're the chicken.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,800
No.

51
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,870
I...

52
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,200
I might not have used
the right expression.

53
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
Anyway, you know what I mean.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,870
Happy,

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,790
joyful,

56
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,810
and delighted.

57
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,579
All thanks to Siyun.

58
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,960
Mom.

59
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,900
If there's nothing else,

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,230
I'll go upstairs to bed.

61
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,800
Then I'll go upstairs with Auntie too.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,280
Okay.

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Alright,

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,470
go to bed early, too.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,530
Don't stay up late.

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,680
Get some rest.

67
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm not in a hurry.

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,800
I need to

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,240
gather all the good news

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,300
our family has had.

71
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,120
Tonight,

72
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,910
I want to have a chat with Dad.

73
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,210
Keep your voice down.

74
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,690
Everyone's trying to sleep.

75
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,570
Slow down, Mom.

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Come in.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
And you are?

78
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,570
Hello, Under-secretary Dong,

79
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,720
my name is Lin Siyun.

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,190
Old Shen mentioned you.

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,950
Come on.

82
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,600
Please have a seat, Miss Lin.

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Please, sit down.

84
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,980
Old Shen

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,970
didn't lie to me.

86
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,270
Miss Lin,

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,510
you are truly

88
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
beautiful

89
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,240
and captivating.

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,300
Have you reviewed

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
my documents?

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,830
All the official stamps required

93
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,390
for this approval document are complete.

94
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,330
Your hospital

95
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,890
can now open for business.

96
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,680
Thank you.

97
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,680
When the hospital opens,

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,800
please come with your wife
to honor us with your presence.

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Sure.

100
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,610
Look,

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,430
it's

102
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,560
lunchtime already.

103
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,390
Miss Lin, if you're free,

104
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,920
would you join me for a meal?

105
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,310
I

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
have some hospital matters
to deal with,

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,930
so I'll have to pass.

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Well, next time then.

109
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,190
Let's have lunch together next time.

110
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,260
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

111
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,850
Okay.

112
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,040
Goodbye.

113
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,720
Goodbye.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Cheng Ao.

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,270
You work here?

116
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,850
Yes.

117
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,170
Who are you?

118
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,280
I'm Shen Yiqun's little sister.

119
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,490
Shen Fangfang?

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
My name is Shen Yingying.

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,780
Shen Yingying,

123
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,210
long time no see.

124
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,660
Your gang's office is really nice.

125
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,159
This is a legitimate law firm.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,330
But Yiqun said you're in a gang.

127
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,000
My family is involved with gangs,

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
but

129
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm a lawyer.

130
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,090
Then let me have a look around.

131
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,130
I have a client inside.

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Do you have any case

133
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,050
that needs my help?

134
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,340
Can't I see you without having a case?

135
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,540
If you want cases, my father has plenty.

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,310
He can make you the most famous lawyer

137
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,640
in Shanghai overnight.

138
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,070
Think about it.

139
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
You lied to me.

140
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,350
There's no client at all.

141
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,490
Where's my client?

142
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,670
I'm in a good mood, so I'll forgive you.

143
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,350
Nice chair.

144
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm really curious about you.

145
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,760
Yinqun says you're a gang member,

146
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,290
but you say you're a lawyer.

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,510
Who should I believe?

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll believe you,

149
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,560
since Yiqun never tells the truth.

150
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,600
Are you free tomorrow?

151
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,310
I'd like to treat you to coffee.

152
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,310
I have two cases to handle tomorrow.

153
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,510
Then the day after tomorrow?

154
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,310
I have two cases that day as well.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,310
Then, choose one of these days

156
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,430
and cancel your original arrangement.

157
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,630
As for my four cases,

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
if I don't handle two of them,

159
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,890
someone will go to jail.

160
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,540
If I don't handle the other two,

161
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,000
someone will go bankrupt.

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,680
How about this?

163
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,010
You help me choose a day,

164
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,920
and decide which one to cancel,

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,520
so I can have coffee with you.

166
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,770
Never mind.

167
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,520
Men always prioritize their careers.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,830
I respect you

169
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,160
and understand you.

170
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
I'll come back in a few days
to make an appointment with you.

171
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,220
Goodbye.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
I'll take this place.

173
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,970
When should I pay the deposit?

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,980
You're quite the impatient one.

175
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,710
You can pay the deposit tomorrow
or the day after.

176
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
My husband told me

177
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,730
that you're planning to open a hospital.

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,570
Yes.

179
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,960
A maternity hospital.

180
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
Since you've married into the Qiao family,

181
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,390
why work so hard?

182
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,520
Why don't you enjoy being a noble lady?

183
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,580
It's good for a woman to work hard.

184
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,630
I don't understand.

185
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,950
I suppose everyone has
their own way of living.

186
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,460
Yes,

187
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,200
everyone has their own way.

188
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,200
What are you doing, Siyun?

189
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,260
Come down quickly!

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,000
The wedding is tomorrow.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Hurry down and try on your dress.

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
Coming, Mom.

193
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,420
Siyun, listen to me,

194
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,870
from now on,

195
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,910
you can only drink water.

196
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,600
You can't eat anything else, understand?

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,200
All these clothes are custom-tailored.

198
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,240
Even the slightest change will make
them not fit properly.

199
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
Look at this wedding dress.

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,910
How is it?

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,150
Beautiful, right?

202
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,630
-Auntie.
-Try on the wedding dress first.

203
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,240
Auntie,

204
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,070
there's a letter for you.

205
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,580
[To Qin]

206
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,560
Who delivered this letter?

207
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know. I don't recognize him.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
He just said it was urgent

209
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
and told you to read it yourself.

210
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,510
What are you doing?
Try on the clothes first.

211
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,100
I'll come down after reading this letter,
Mom.

212
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,550
Well, hurry up then.

213
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,580
Who sent it?

214
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,230
I don't know who he is.

215
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Boss,

216
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,330
the letter has been delivered
to the Lin family's servant.

217
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,200
Qin,

218
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
since we parted this morning,

219
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,200
my heart has been restless.

220
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,750
My marriage to Miss Lin

221
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,750
is entirely due to my father's orders,

222
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,410
and I have no feelings for her.

223
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,700
Please don't be upset about this.

224
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,030
You're the only one in my heart.

225
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,840
I've thought it through carefully.

226
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,150
After you graduate from high school,

227
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,030
if you want to continue your studies,

228
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll arrange for you to study abroad,

229
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,460
and we'll go to America together.

230
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,100
If you don't want to continue studying,

231
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,670
I'll buy you a house

232
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,320
and settle you down.

233
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
I

234
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,890
will definitely give you proper status.

235
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,930
Until then, don't overthink things.

236
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,200
Take good care of yourself,

237
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,840
and be sure to eat well

238
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,270
and rest well.

239
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,950
I will surely make you happy.

240
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
I love you.

241
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,090
Your forever love,

242
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,500
Shijun.

243
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,240
Siyun.

244
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Mom wants you to come down
and try on your clothes.

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,050
Why aren't you coming down yet?

246
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,200
Sis,

247
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,240
please tell my mom.

248
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I won't try on the wedding dress now.

249
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,890
I'm going to find Qiao Shijun.

250
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,150
In such a hurry?

251
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
You two are really close.

252
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,940
You're getting married tomorrow,

253
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,960
and you still want to see him today.

254
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,890
I've been through this before.

255
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,890
Women shouldn't be too eager,

256
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,710
but let your man be the eager one.

257
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:16,960
Siyun.

258
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,770
Can you accept that I have other women

259
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,970
after we are married?

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can guarantee

261
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,890
they will respect you,

262
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
and as for all the money you need,

263
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll let you manage it.

264
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,270
When we met,

265
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
you told me you were
a progressive young man

266
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,880
who hates those outdated traditions.

267
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
Why did you lie to me?

268
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,790
Siyun, you are

269
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,490
taking this too seriously.

270
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,030
You weren't like this
when you were younger.

271
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,560
I've always been like this.

272
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,410
People always make progress.

273
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,810
In my relationship,

274
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,550
I want us to love each other equally,

275
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,910
with no room for the third one.

276
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,300
So you're trying to change my views?

277
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,090
Not at all.

278
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,500
I won't try to change anyone's views.

279
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,200
There's no point.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,660
What do you want to do then?

281
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,110
We're not married yet.

282
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,360
You mean you want
to break off the engagement?

283
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,870
Should we tell the public it is you
who end it, or me?

284
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,840
Be honest.

285
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,480
Be honest?

286
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,150
Siyun, you're being too naive.

287
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
Given your family's current situation,

288
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,770
we can still get married

289
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,570
because first

290
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,000
when we were children,

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,790
your father and my father arranged
our betrothal,

292
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,450
and second,

293
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,650
I love you.

294
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,270
Otherwise,

295
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,370
I have many other options.

296
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,320
Be my wife.

297
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,720
You'll gain more than what you'll lose.

298
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,450
My love isn't a business transaction.

299
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,260
Siyun,

300
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,530
you're too arrogant,

301
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,440
which will make you suffer loss.

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm willing to suffer loss.

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Won't you think about your brother?

304
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,310
If you break off the engagement,

305
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,700
he won't be able to pay back
a single cent.

306
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,870
That's his problem.

307
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,790
Fine.

308
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,670
I was wrong.

309
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,250
What do you mean?

310
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,630
We're not right for each other.

311
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,400
We are right for each other.

312
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,440
Please don't be so stubborn.

313
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Stop making a scene,

314
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,240
okay?

315
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,180
Don't touch me.

316
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay, I won't touch you.

317
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,120
Let me tell you, with your temper,

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,390
no man in Shanghai will like you.

319
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,520
That's my business.

320
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,370
You should go now.

321
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,060
Go home.

322
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,430
I'll give you one night
to think it through.

323
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,840
I know you're impulsive right now.

324
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,360
Hello,

325
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,030
Cheng Ao from Pingzheng Law Firm.

326
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,240
It's me, Lu Yingchen.

327
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,760
Tomorrow's front page will be

328
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,840
"Dai Xi's personal account
of living with Shen Yiqun",

329
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,120
with text and photos.

330
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,240
The article has already gone to print.

331
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,170
Has the printing started already?

332
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,330
I'm not sure.

333
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,520
Don't blame me.

334
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,550
I noticed it just now.

335
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,680
I've been out chasing stories all day.

336
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Alright, got it.

337
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,030
Cheng.

338
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,720
Shen Yiqun.

339
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,160
Read the newspaper.

340
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,430
[Secret Story Between a Prostitute
& a Senior Official]

341
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,890
All these newspapers have been taken away

342
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,670
and the printing plates were destroyed.

343
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,510
They've called the police,

344
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,970
so handle it as you see fit.

345
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,390
This is the payment for those newspapers.

346
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,120
Make sure it's transferred to the factory
and newspaper office before knocking off.

347
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,390
You two politicians

348
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,870
use a pregnant woman
as a pawn in your games.

349
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,930
Is that dignified?

350
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,460
Dignity has no place in politics.

351
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,910
But

352
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,410
it's quite enjoyable.

353
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,780
Let me ask you,

354
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,360
in your opinion,

355
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,030
how will

356
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,870
Dai Xi's issue develop

357
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,320
and how should it be resolved?

358
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,120
That's easy.

359
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,930
You're not married.

360
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,280
Why don't you marry her?

361
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,380
Stop joking, bro.

362
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,780
Let me teach you what politics is.

363
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,460
There's only one consequence for Dai Xi.

364
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,760
When Liu thinks she's no longer useful,

365
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,680
he'll kill her.

366
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,850
There's another possibility.

367
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,490
If Dai Xi causes more trouble,

368
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,030
you'll kill her,

369
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,160
right?

370
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,190
I didn't say that.

371
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
You did.

372
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,099
Transfer the money promptly.

373
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:30,730
Have a seat.

374
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,270
Have a seat.

375
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,780
What are you staring at?

376
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,270
Bro.

377
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,390
We're back.

378
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,310
What do you want?

379
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,670
What do you want?

380
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,270
Do you really think Liu and Shen

381
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,280
would turn against each other
because of you?

382
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,830
You're too naive.

383
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,070
Didn't you hear what he said?

384
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,140
If Liu doesn't kill you,

385
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,720
then, Shen will.

386
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,360
Wasn't there a knife at your kidney today?

387
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,960
Keep quiet and follow me.

388
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,400
Do you know who wants her?

389
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,830
I don't care.

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,960
Get lost now.

391
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,590
Are you saying

392
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
that person today

393
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,490
works for Liu?

394
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,960
Why are you talking so much?

395
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
Are you stupid?

396
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,440
Tomorrow Shen will

397
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,170
threaten you with a knife, too.

398
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,240
Let's go.

399
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,110
Are you waiting for me to hold you?

400
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,070
Come on.

401
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,590
Stop dawdling.

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,030
Bro.

403
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,410
Do we have to help Dai Xi?

404
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,650
We gave her money

405
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,440
and helped her leave safely.

406
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,170
What are we getting out of this?

407
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,630
Let's go.

408
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,040
Mom.

409
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,740
The Qiao family is indeed a noble family.

410
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,320
These betrothal gifts

411
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,180
are wonderful.

412
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,920
Yes, indeed.

413
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,830
Hello.

414
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,490
Who's this?

415
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,590
Uncle Qiao.

416
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,040
This is Jinghan.

417
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,600
Go ahead.

418
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,120
No.

419
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,670
I understand.

420
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,850
Don't worry.

421
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,990
I'll handle it properly.

422
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,070
Why are you crying?

423
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,310
What did Uncle Qiao say to you?

424
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,510
Mom.

425
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,460
Could you please call Lin Siyun for me?

426
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,550
Siyun.

427
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,960
Siyun, come down here quickly.

428
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,120
Uncle Qiao called.

429
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,010
Is what he said true?

430
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,640
Yes.

431
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,250
I'm kneeling for you.

432
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,880
I'm begging you.

433
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,280
You don't need to

434
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,430
worry about the schoolgirl.

435
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,810
She has no status whatsoever.

436
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,060
She's a nobody,

437
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,440
and you never have to see her again.

438
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,830
Uncle Qiao said

439
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,030
even if she has a baby in the future,

440
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,090
she won't compete with you
for the family inheritance.

441
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,650
I'm begging you.

442
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,830
Get up.

443
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,480
Don't do this.

444
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,210
If I get up, will you promise me?

445
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,550
Will you?

446
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,650
Siyun.

447
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm asking you to do this

448
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,930
not for myself,

449
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,900
not for the Lin family,

450
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,640
but for you.

451
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,230
If you break off the engagement,

452
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
your reputation will be ruined.

453
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,170
Really.

454
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,800
Jianghan.

455
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,920
I understand.

456
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,680
Siyun,

457
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,640
I understand you.

458
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,470
Many couples

459
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,070
are just for show.

460
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,720
Turning a blind eye to problems,

461
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,240
that's how life goes by.

462
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,920
We're women.

463
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,790
Sis,

464
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,590
I know that.

465
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,280
What on earth happened?

466
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,670
What's going on?

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,830
What schoolgirl?

468
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,350
Mom,

469
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,210
you don't need to know that.

470
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,530
You just have to know that
Siyun understands what's important,

471
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,150
and she's my dear sister.

472
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,830
Young Master,

473
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,630
Mr. Qiao is waiting in the study.

474
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,350
Good.

475
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,160
Be good.

476
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,230
You're the best.

477
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,990
Jinghan.

478
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,470
You don't need to pull me.

479
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,780
I can walk by myself.

480
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,450
You're really my sweetie sister.

481
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,040
Here comes my brother-in-law!

482
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,640
Look how well Siyun is doing.

483
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,640
And you

484
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,250
look quite spirited, too.

485
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Look how cute Siyun is when she smiles.

486
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,490
You two lovebirds should have a good chat,

487
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,160
and work things out.

488
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,150
Alright.

489
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Siyun.

490
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,750
It's been a night now.

491
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,080
Are you feeling better?

492
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,110
I'm better,

493
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,210
and I've thought things through.

494
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,830
That's good.

495
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,770
Couples shouldn't hold grudges overnight.

496
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,830
Can you give me a hug?

497
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,320
Okay.

498
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,310
I love you very much.

499
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,770
I promise I'll treat you well from now on.

500
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,160
Let's have a good life together, okay?

501
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,630
Young Master,

You did this?

511
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,720
You played a trick, huh?

512
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,160
Take it however you want.

You'll pay for this,

as do your brother,

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,160
you still don't understand me.

520
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,680
I keep my word.

521
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,110
You'll regret this.

522
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,570
I never do anything
without thinking it through.

523
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,410
Are you crazy?

524
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,720
Hearing your curse,

525
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,170
I actually find you more genuine.

526
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,510
Meeting a woman like you,

527
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,350
I'm really unlucky.

528
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,720
[When I saw that letter,]

529
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,790
[I wanted to end this marriage]

530
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,200
[with dignity.]

531
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
[But when faced with self-interest,]

532
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,080
[someone has no shame]

533
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,540
[and became a clown in this farce.]

534
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,590
Dear Dan.

535
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,310
Dear Huimin.

536
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,030
Dear Luoyuan.

537
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,830
Dear Xiaojun.

538
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,680
Nice writing.

539
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,070
You've got quite a lot darlings.

540
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,680
Where did you find

541
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,030
all these letters?

542
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,620
That's none of your business.

543
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,130
You gave Lin Siyun the letter, right?

544
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,720
Yes.

545
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,670
Did you also damage my car?

546
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,370
Yes.

547
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Do you need a ride?

548
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,540
You can take my car,

549
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,670
and I can walk back.

550
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,010
No, thanks. I'll walk.

551
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,510
Wait.

552
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,960
Don't you want your letters?

553
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,690
Yes, I do.

554
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,930
What do you mean?

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,140
Check them again?

556
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,000
It has to be careful
when dealing with politicians.

557
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,220
Cheng.

558
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,360
Here you are.

559
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,660
Thanks, Ao.

560
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,450
It's from me.

561
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,240
Politician is just my social identity,

562
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,750
but privately, we're close friends,

563
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,110
who completely trust each other,

564
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,720
right?

565
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,960
Cheng.

566
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,350
Come work for me.

567
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,200
Stop kidding, Director.

568
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,830
I am doing well working for Ao.

569
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,030
See how stubborn he is,

570
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,960
just like him.

571
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,060
I took a look when I came up.

572
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,410
There's not a single client here.

573
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Cheng Ao.

574
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,100
The location of

575
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,380
the house is perfect.

576
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,650
The rent must be expensive, right?

577
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,030
With such a chaotic situation,

578
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,360
business must be tough.

579
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,730
Don't worry,

580
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,330
I've paved the way for you.

581
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,140
Come work in my department.

582
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,640
Let's work together as a team.

583
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,190
I assure you that
you'll be a director next year.

584
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,830
No need for your concern, Shen.

585
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,690
In my business,

586
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,890
different times bring different cases.

587
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm just doing my small business,

588
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,000
focusing on my own job.

589
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,110
Political affairs

590
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,030
are too grand for me.

591
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,330
Only outstanding persons like you

592
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,910
can handle such matters.

593
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,650
Actually,

594
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,930
if you work for me,

595
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,720
you just change your work environment.

596
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,940
But the clients you serve
would be different.

597
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,800
Think about it.

598
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,700
Who do you

599
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,480
serve every day here?

600
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,480
Tom,

601
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,610
Dick and Harry,

602
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,440
right?

603
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
In my department,

604
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,070
we serve the country.

605
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,860
The strategic vision and elevated thinking

606
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,060
will be worlds apart.

607
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,000
Let me ask you something.

608
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,640
Go ahead.

609
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
Are you serving the country,

610
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,390
or Chairman Jiang?

611
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,750
First, we serve Chairman Jiang well.

612
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,080
Didn't you just say you serve the country?

613
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,430
Shen.

614
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,070
I really can't work for you.

615
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,200
First,

616
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,610
I'm not that slick.

617
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,720
Second,

618
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,730
my methods aren't that ruthless.

619
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,400
Third,

620
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,350
I can't tell lies.

621
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,930
Wouldn't you be nervous

622
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,040
with me

623
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
working by your side?

624
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,260
You're now a director,

625
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,310
and your dream is to be a bureau chief.

626
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,590
After I join you,

627
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,450
you might become a section chief,

628
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,580
or even just a clerk.

629
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,860
Is it worth it?

630
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,870
The loss outweighs the gain.

631
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,760
Cheng Ao.

632
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,440
The more you reject me,

633
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
the more I feel

634
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,080
that I need you so badly.

635
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,070
Enough. I have several cases.

636
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,010
Why don't you investigate them with me?

637
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,940
I can't understand those things anyway.

638
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,710
Alright then,

639
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,510
get some rest.

640
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,610
Cheng,

641
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,940
see him out.

642
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,940
Director, please.

643
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,640
Please reconsider.

644
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,080
Lin Siyun.

645
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,670
You're a witch.

646
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,110
Lin Jinghan.

647
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,020
What are you doing?

648
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,220
Nothing.

649
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,770
I just want you to kick this chair for me.

650
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,880
If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.

651
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,510
Go ahead.

652
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,310
Call the police.

653
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,690
Let all people in Shanghai see

654
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
what a shameless woman

655
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,940
the Lin family has.

656
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,720
Or just get out.

657
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,440
Do you even know how to get out?

658
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,970
Put your hands on your head,

659
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,840
crouch down,

660
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,680
push forward,

661
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,070
and get out.

662
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,310
This is my home. I live here.

663
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,040
You know this is your home, huh?

664
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,640
You!

665
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,890
Come over

666
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,490
and kick this chair for me.

667
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Or I'll beat you to death tonight.

668
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,880
Lin Jinghan,

669
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,160
you want to beat a woman?
Are you even a man?

670
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm not.

671
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,000
You drove me to this.

672
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,110
But

673
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,170
even as a ghost, I won't let you go.

674
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,400
It's said that

675
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,670
a leader must be large-hearted.

676
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,160
Mr. Qiao just has several mistresses.

677
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,240
What happened to your tolerance?

678
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,540
Did someone eat it?

679
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,480
I can't be that tolerant.

680
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,230
Mom.

681
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,680
Siyun,

682
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,260
please help Jianghan.

683
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,440
Sis,

684
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,880
let's go upstairs.

685
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,640
No,

686
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,610
I can't go up there.

687
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,750
If I do so,

688
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,480
he'll beat me to death tonight.

689
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,320
Jinghan.

690
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm coming to save you.

691
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,160
Come on.

692
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,610
Don't hold me.

693
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,030
You'll push the chair over.

694
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,690
Don't move.

695
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,400
Step back.

696
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,810
I'll get down by myself.

697
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,350
Lin Siyun.

698
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,790
Wait and see.

699
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,310
Jinghan.

700
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
Where did you get that chair from?

701
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
I'll take it back for you.

702
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,440
And you,

703
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,880
when I asked you to kick my chair,

704
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,010
why didn't you do it?

705
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Wait and see.

706
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,400
Ling.

707
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,160
I told you

708
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,300
to hire midwives,

709
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
How's that going?

710
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,150
We've hired two already.

711
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,409
We still need one more.

712
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,199
It seems impossible to find
someone suitable.

713
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,110
No rush,

714
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,340
take your time.

715
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,790
By the way,

716
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,590
Dr. Lin,

717
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,550
do you know who came

718
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,400
to apply after I posted

719
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,960
the job notice today?

720
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,230
Who?

721
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,710
The mother-in-law
of the lying-in woman in bed five,

722
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,590
Mrs. Chen.

723
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,080
She said

724
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,230
that modern delivery methods are
popular now,

725
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,630
and those wealthy ladies

726
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,840
don't seek their services anymore,

727
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,320
leaving them with only poor clients

728
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,710
or high-risk cases.

729
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,690
After seeing how you saved
her daughter-in-law,

730
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,510
she said your methods are effective

731
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,000
and wanted to be your assistant

732
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,070
to learn from you.

733
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,199
What did you tell her?

734
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
I refused on your behalf, of course.

735
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,110
Look,

736
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,000
you just performed a C-section
on her daughter-in-law,

737
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,150
and she immediately asked you

738
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,030
if her daughter-in-law could still have

739
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,480
other babies,

740
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,430
which shows your thoughts
are totally different.

741
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,510
Next time you see her,

742
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,800
ask her to come over.

743
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
I'd like to talk with her.

744
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,630
Really?

745
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,590
You see,

746
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,560
even a traditional midwife

747
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,800
is adapting.

748
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,650
One's mind can be changed.

749
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,630
Alright,

750
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,110
I'll tell her next time.

751
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,150
Yi.

752
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,520
Sis.

753
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,920
Where are they?

754
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,190
Yu.

755
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,830
Miss, what can I do for you?

756
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,920
Where's my family?

757
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,840
Say something.

758
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,390
I heard from Young Madam

759
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,960
that Miss Yi is getting engaged today,

760
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,620
and her in-laws are willing to help
Young Master pay off his debts.

761
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,560
Where are they?

762
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,920
Mr. and Mrs. Zhu,

763
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,510
and Senior Mrs. Zhu,

764
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,960
let me say something

765
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,890
as a modest spur.

766
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,090
Today is truly a wonderful day,

767
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,710
a joyous occasion.

768
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,840
My daughter Yi

769
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,030
is well-educated.

770
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,920
She has learnt about all the classics,

771
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,070
Zuo's Commentary,
Spring and Autumn Annals,

772
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,920
as well as

773
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,170
natural sciences,

774
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,430
like species evolution.

775
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,780
She picks things up

776
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,070
very quickly.

777
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,170
Dad, why are you keeping talking about me?

778
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,480
It is the first time meeting
Senior Mrs. Zhu,

779
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,740
so I want to praise you.

780
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,400
The Zhu family

781
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,150
values

782
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,230
being benevolent, righteous,
courteous, wise, and trustworthy.

783
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,070
Most importantly,
their financial situation is quite good,

784
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,760
isn't it, Senior Mrs. Zhu?

785
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,510
What does it have to do with me?

786
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,420
Just a chat.

787
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,880
Mom, what is Dad talking about?

788
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,260
Darling.

789
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,120
Yi is asking you.

790
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,190
Tell her.

791
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,710
Yi.

792
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,710
Your father wants you to live
a happy life.

793
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,030
Just listen to him.

794
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,080
Your in-laws have promised

795
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,840
that they'll cover all
your education expenses

796
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,030
from now on.

797
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,020
My in-laws?

798
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,800
Grandma, what are they talking about?

799
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Yi.

800
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,080
Be good.

801
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,030
Be obedient.

802
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,590
Xiong is a good boy.

803
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,920
Your mother-in-law

804
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,120
and grandmother-in-law are very nice.

805
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,760
They will treat you well.

806
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,320
You want to study, and your mother-in-law
has promised

807
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,150
to support your studies abroad.

808
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,170
Do you know about this?

809
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,820
Yes, you're my wife.

810
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,970
Who told you that?

811
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,960
My grandma.

812
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
You shouldn't tell him so.

813
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,440
I have no idea at all

814
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,170
and suddenly I became his wife.

815
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,510
Yi.

816
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,190
Don't you remember what I taught you?

817
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Be respectful to elders

818
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,570
and mind your tone.

819
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,590
Sir,

820
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,470
doesn't Yi know she's getting
married into our family?

821
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,280
She knew.

822
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,070
I didn't know.

823
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,210
Go talk to her,

824
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,070
and persuade her.

825
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,150
What's going on?

826
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,160
Senior Mrs. Zhu,

827
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,440
don't worry,

828
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,240
I'll have a chat with her.

829
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,650
Here, let me pour you wine.

830
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,200
You're asking for trouble.

831
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,440
How dare you?

832
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,630
Get up there!

833
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,320
You dare defy me in front of others?

834
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,070
Dare you defy me?

835
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Dare you do it again?

836
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,920
Get up there.

837
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,580
Kneel down!

838
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,710
You don't appreciate my kindness, right?

839
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,760
You never cherish your chance.

840
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,280
I won't.

841
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,230
What?

842
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,980
I won't marry him.

843
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,800
I paid for your education
and this is how you repay me?

844
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,230
You dare talk back to me in public?

845
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,320
Defy me? Dare you glare at me again?

846
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I won't marry him.

847
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,360
I'll kick you!

848
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,400
Try that again!

849
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,200
I'll kick you!

850
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,230
Stop hitting her!

851
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,940
Where did you come from?

852
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,910
Who are you?

853
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,480
None of your business.
Just stop hitting her.

854
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,230
You are nosy.

855
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,560
Do not poke your nose
where it doesn't belong.

856
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,650
Get out of the way!

857
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,560
Let go of me!

858
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,810
Ouch! Ouch!

859
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,190
If you hit her again,
I'll teach you a lesson.

860
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,510
It hurts!

861
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,000
Let go!

862
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,210
Are you okay, Miss?

863
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,190
That's what you get for showing off.

864
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,920
Try twisting my arm again!

865
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,230
Dare you to try that again!

866
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,600
Meddle in others' business, huh?

867
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,730
Dare you do it again?

868
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,440
Lin Jinghan!

869
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,920
Dare you do it again?

870
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Stop!

871
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,700
This is the concession area.

872
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,090
If you smash his head

873
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,500
and get arrested by the police,

874
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,440
you'll go to jail.

875
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,760
Don't give me that nonsense.

876
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,360
I've weathered all kinds of storms.

877
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,820
Go ahead, call the police.

878
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,590
You are the shame of the Lin family.

879
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,530
Are you okay?

880
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,390
It's fine now.

881
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,050
It should be here.

882
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,670
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

883
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,930
I didn't feel the pain before,

884
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,860
but now it's starting to hurt a bit.

885
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,110
I'm sorry.

886
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,450
Thank you for today.

887
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,200
Here you are.

888
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,240
-What's your name?
-What's your name?

889
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm Yi.

890
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,800
Nice to meet you.

891
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,030
Zhou Zhaoyuan.

892
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,830
I'm her aunt.

893
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,320
Hello.

894
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,700
Mom, I'm home.

895
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,060
Mom?

896
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,670
Yi, come here.

897
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,190
Sit down.

898
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,550
Yi.

899
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
Don't blame your father.

900
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,260
Your aunt destroyed this family.

901
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,590
Your father had no choice but to do so.

902
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,710
He did it for our family,

903
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,470
and for you.

904
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,910
Do you understand?

905
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,800
Lin Siyun, come here.

906
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,030
I don't understand.

907
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,950
You called off your perfect marriage
with Mr. Qiao

908
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,630
and ruined Yi's marriage.

909
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,490
What exactly are you trying to do?

910
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,320
Who's really in charge of this family?

911
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,800
How have we wronged you

912
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,510
that you treat us this way?

913
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,240
You are a woman.

914
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,360
You should do what you're supposed to do.

915
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,640
Mom,

916
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,030
please tell Lin Jinghan

917
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,630
that the Zhu family's bride price

918
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,160
should be returned in full.

919
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,340
From today on, Yi

920
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,600
will live with me

921
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,230
and I'll pay for her living expenses

922
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,360
and tuition fees.

923
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,320
How can you be so selfish?

924
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,700
Why do I have such a selfish daughter?

925
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,110
Yi,

926
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,590
come upstairs with me.

927
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,030
Yi, sit down.

928
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,250
Mom.

929
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,310
Listen to your grandmother.

930
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,080
I want to listen to Auntie.
