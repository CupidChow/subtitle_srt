1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,010
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,810
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,570
Shield!

4
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,300
This is...

5
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,140
[Episode 11: A dream or the end?]

6
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,770
My Lady, are you waking up?

7
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,360
Yeah.

8
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,030
My Lady, hold me.

9
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,200
Are you okay?

10
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,490
Prince Gyeongseong is not even here.

11
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,470
I am worried you faint so often.

12
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,590
Do I need to get you some herbal medicine?

13
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,660
It's the same figurine I bought near school.

14
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,660
How is it here?

15
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,400
Is it a coincidence?

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
By the way, Bang Wool,

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,840
where did this figurine come from?

18
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Did you forget already?

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,520
This is that stuff.

20
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,590
Life is stuffy and boring?

21
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,650
It is like someone designed
my daily life. It feels stuffy.

22
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,710
Maybe something new could change things up.

23
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,530
This sounds like a rich girl is whining, right?

24
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
Of course not.

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,140
I, Seol Gi, have many solutions
to address your concern.

26
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,450
Pick one you are drawn to out of these.

27
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,060
That will be the solution to your concern.

28
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,250
By chance,

29
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,930
did this figurine lead me here?

30
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,540
I think I need to go there.

31
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,110
Would you be okay?

32
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,250
Where did she go?

33
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,340
Let me check if she is nearby.

34
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,830
My Lady, are you okay?

35
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,360
Oh, my.

36
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,610
Well, yes.

37
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,590
I have not seen that figurine in a while.

38
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,530
Did it work at all?

39
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,450
What effect does this have, exactly?

40
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,220
Since you visited me to escape
mundane everyday life,

41
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,140
your solution would be...

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,940
the beginning of a new life.

43
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,590
The beginning of a new life?

44
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,470
But your lover is a bigger issue.

45
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,350
I heard he was sent to a battle.
You must be worried.

46
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,140
Yes, I'm so worried.

47
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,280
Let us see. Let us see.

48
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,940
Will her lover return safely?

49
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,380
I cannot get an answer to the question.

50
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,300
I am getting a strange reading instead.

51
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,720
Strange reading? Like what...

52
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,590
The ending.

53
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,250
Everything concludes when you reach the ending.

54
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,030
What does that mean?

55
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,540
I am not so sure, either.

56
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,330
I have never gotten a reading like this.

57
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,520
Everything concludes when you reach the ending.

58
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,970
By "concludes,"

59
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,300
does it mean this world will disappear?

60
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,110
Wake up.

61
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,160
Only focus on Prince Gyeongseong's
safe return for now.

62
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,130
The ending has not been determined yet.

63
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,980
I need to be stronger at times like this.

64
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,080
So,

65
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,910
did Prince Gyeongseong leave for the border?

66
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,560
You made a very wise decision.

68
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,800
I am sure he could defeat the barbarians

69
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,890
and return with the Emperor's edict.

70
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,660
This is all thanks to your resourcefulness.

71
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,520
You are too generous.

72
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,930
You made this decision on your own.

73
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,800
By the way,

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,870
what would happen if Prince Gyeongseong
cannot make it back alive?

75
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,110
Do you not have faith in him?

76
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,320
If he is absent around here for too long,

77
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,230
who...

78
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,880
who would protect me?

79
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,370
Heuksa Clan.

80
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,370
The Heuksa Clan will come for my head.

81
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,640
Heuksa Clan... H-Heuksa Clan...

82
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,810
H-Heuksa Clan... Heuksa...

83
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,940
My head...

84
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,510
Heuksa Clan... Heuksa Clan...

85
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,460
Your Majesty.

86
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,790
Your Majesty...

87
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,970
Why are you worried about that?

88
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,700
You now have me by your side, Your Majesty.

89
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,270
That is right.

90
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,690
I have you, Prince Seonghyeon.

91
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,220
I had Prince Seonghyeon.

92
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,960
The incense you brought from China

93
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,700
is relaxing me.

94
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,730
I finally had a good sleep.

95
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,560
That is a relief, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,920
Continue to keep this incense by his bed.

97
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,670
Yes, sir.

98
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,240
Gosh, I am cold and hungry.

99
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,020
What do I do?

100
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,360
How will I enter the house?

101
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,830
I cannot hide you anymore.

102
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,720
If you get caught, both of us will die.

103
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,080
What if we get caught by Lady Eun Ae?

104
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,520
That is why you should not do something so risky.

105
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,970
I wanted to escape the slave life.

106
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,440
Gosh, My Lady.

107
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,580
What are you doing here right now?

108
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,900
Prince Gyeongseong,

109
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,440
although we are apart,

110
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,780
I can sense you in this place.

111
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,340
Cha Sun Chaek.

112
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,010
Here.

113
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,930
So pretty.

114
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,430
You care for small things like this.

115
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,220
You really are a madam now.

116
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,690
I want to care for every little thing

117
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,270
in Hoseondang without missing anything.

118
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,000
Let us go that way, Maiden.

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,220
Shall we, Young Master?

120
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,680
So pretty.

121
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,050
You're...

122
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,720
There you were, my boy.

123
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,240
Aigoo...

124
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,520
He seems happier to see you
than to see me, Sun Chaek.

125
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,940
You seem to have changed a lot
since I last saw you.

126
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,760
I hope you stop calling me
by my name from now on.

127
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,970
I am now Hoseondang's madam.

128
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,010
I see.

129
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,840
But I thought you were the kind
of person who'd never get

130
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,540
involved with Prince Gyeongseong

131
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,210
let alone marry him.

132
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,810
Why did you think that?

133
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,960
Someone endlessly sweet,

134
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,910
kind...

135
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,880
and knows how you feel without being told.

136
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,190
That was the husband material you wanted.

137
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,150
If so, that's the reason why.

138
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,760
I've never met anyone like
Prince Gyeongseong, who's so sweet, kind,

139
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,990
and understands my feelings
even when I'm not aware of them.

140
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,420
What brings you here?

141
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,830
My Lady is out at the moment.

142
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,900
Give me a break.

143
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,270
I knew it.

144
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,720
So, you were here.

145
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,620
Is lying your and your servant's
specialty around here?

146
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,380
You laugh?

147
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,600
Should I cry, then?

148
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,840
No, save it.

149
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,540
Crying now would not be fun.

150
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,920
What a scaredy-cat.

151
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,780
You are no match for me.

152
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,370
Just cut to the chase.

153
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,020
I will, then.

154
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,910
You are dead now.

155
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,030
I reported you to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

156
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,340
I even secured witnesses.

157
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,080
Wow.

158
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,890
I am so...

159
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,160
scared.

160
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you have some kind of insurance?

161
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,210
I am sick of being surprised, flustered,

162
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,480
and crying.

163
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,290
Let us see if you would be so confident
at the Royal Investigation Bureau, too.

164
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,490
But I am not sure if you
would be able to see that.

165
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
What do you mean?

166
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,220
You drank this tea in one gulp
without knowing what was in it.

167
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,410
A-Are you saying there is
poison in it or something?

168
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,980
I was kidding.

169
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,090
Do not be such a scaredy-cat, My Lady.

170
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,140
I think it is time to witness the perfect ending.

171
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,520
My Lord.

172
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,410
Aigoo...

173
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,640
My Lord.

174
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,220
You're here...

175
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,710
Madam...

176
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,720
W-What is going on?

177
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,690
Well...

178
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,650
Prince Gyeongseong got ambushed by the enemy

179
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,750
and died at the scene.

180
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,850
You're lying.

181
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,230
If he's actually dead,

182
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,270
where's his body?

183
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,440
They could not find the body.

184
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,620
See?

185
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,250
He's not dead, then.

186
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,430
The barbarians take the body
of the enemy commander

187
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,190
and display his head in public.

188
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,640
My Lord...

189
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,770
You didn't check yourself.

190
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,240
Prince Gyeongseong wouldn't
die so easily like this.

191
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,220
So, everyone,

192
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,850
don't be sad.

193
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,940
My Lord...

194
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,890
We will hear that he's alive
when the sun comes up.

195
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm sure of it.

196
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
No.

197
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,750
No.

198
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,930
Prince Gyeongseong isn't just anyone.

199
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,690
The male lead doesn't die.

200
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,780
He doesn't die.

201
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,870
I need to see it for myself.

202
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,560
Dear my lover, Cha Sun Chaek.

203
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,340
This is the first time in my life
that I am writing a letter to someone.

204
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,980
This is another first experience you gifted me.

205
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,550
So, let me confess for the first time.

206
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,930
To be honest, whenever I picked up a sword

207
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,800
or entered a battle,

208
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,190
I always felt afraid.

209
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,530
But at the moment,

210
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,470
rather than being afraid that I might die,

211
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,780
I am more afraid that I am leaving my lover

212
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,390
behind alone.

213
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,920
All the victories in the battles
thus far were due to luck.

214
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,940
Prince Gyeongseong.

215
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,560
You are done for now.

216
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,770
You are the bastard Yi Gyu had mentioned.

217
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,720
You said you would bring me good luck,

218
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,380
but the fact that I survived countless battles

219
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,830
and slaughter alone is already a miracle.

220
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,720
I dedicate this miracle to my lover,

221
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,800
Cha Sun Chaek...

222
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
who is reading this letter.

223
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,390
Let me ask you a favor.

224
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Just in case something happens to me...

225
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,390
What are you talking about?

226
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,930
I said, just in case.

227
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,910
If something were to happen to me,

228
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,860
please protect my lover.

229
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,830
This is...

230
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,550
my first and last favor I ask you as a friend.

231
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,970
Beon...

232
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,160
Please step outside for a moment.

233
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,640
Is this Prince Gyeongseong?

234
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,200
Prince Gyeongseong... died on the battlefield, Your Majesty.

235
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,770
Prince Gyeongseong died?

236
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,150
How could the mighty Prince Gyeongseong...

237
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:07,430
Dying for you on the battlefield must be his fate.

238
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,560
Prince Gyeongseong...

239
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,260
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

240
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,480
I am not as healthy as I once was.

241
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,850
Perhaps you should put your duties aside and focus on getting your health back.

242
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,910
I do not even have a crown prince.

243
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,000
Who would I put in charge of my duties?

244
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,400
You could also abdicate the throne.

245
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,030
Abdicate?

246
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,330
You never know what will happen.

247
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,270
You worked so hard to build this country.

248
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,180
Do you want it to falter?

249
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,010
What if the remnants of the Heuksa Clan take advantage of your poor health

250
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,710
and choose the new king and flip this world upside down?

251
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,970
No, no!

252
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,870
That cannot happen.

253
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,010
So, who should I abdicate the throne to?

254
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,930
Sun Chaek.

255
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,370
What brings you here at this hour?

256
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,540
I heard about Prince Gyeongseong.

257
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,670
Are you very shocked?

258
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,000
I find it to be a pity, too.

259
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,560
Who would have thought he
would die in a foreign land?

260
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,600
Prince Gyeongseong is not dead.

261
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,320
Do you really think so?

262
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,210
I will convince His Majesty
to send reinforcements.

263
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:03,030
His Majesty already knows no generals
came back alive from there

264
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,410
better than anyone.

265
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,130
Unless I advise him to do so,

266
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,290
it would be difficult to...

267
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,100
send reinforcements.

268
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,030
You cannot go.
I need to go.

269
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,340
I need to save Prince Gyeongseong.

270
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,680
They said he is dead.

271
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,700
If so, I will bring his body so he does not feel lonely.

272
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,790
Will you really betray your family?

273
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,820
From now on,

274
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,300
do not consider me as your child.

275
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,060
Have you not come to your senses yet?

276
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,390
No. I will not come to my senses.

277
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,870
I am never good enough for you,
no matter what I do, anyway.

278
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,800
If you go out that door,

279
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,530
I could slay you.

280
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,150
I have no idea what kind of new world

281
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,790
you desire,

282
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,870
but if my mother were alive,

283
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,040
she would have trusted my decision.

284
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,950
I do not want to live with guilt for the rest of my life because of your mysterious cause.

285
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,690
I would have to live in shame.

286
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,760
You bastard!

287
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,620
Do you even know what you are saying right now?

288
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,900
I do not. But...

289
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,320
I will manage my life...

290
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,140
from now on.

291
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,570
Can you make a request
to His Majesty on my behalf?

292
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,970
I beg you.

293
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,540
If you do me a favor,

294
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,060
I might be able to.

295
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,480
What kind of favor is it?

296
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,580
Please marry me.

297
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,060
What kind of nonsense is that?

298
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,270
You said you would do anything
to save Prince Gyeongseong.

299
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,950
I already belong to Prince Gyeongseong.

300
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,640
I know.
Why are you doing this to me, then?

301
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,550
Because you always belonged to me.

302
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:55,850
To be exact, Prince Gyeongseong stole you from me.

303
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,590
I never belonged to you.

304
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,100
You will from now on, then.

305
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,760
Prince Gyeongseong will not make it back alive.

306
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,410
Because I made sure of that.

307
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,570
You're crazy.

308
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,540
Why are you doing this to him?

309
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,390
You already know.

310
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,800
He stole what's precious to me.

311
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
He had no choice, either.

312
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,900
He was forced to make that
decision to survive as a child.

313
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,750
He was tormented to see you again.

314
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,150
What about my anger and pain?

315
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,760
Do you not see them, Sun Chaek?

316
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,990
Let go.

317
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,090
I will soon achieve my goal.

318
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,240
I can make you happy. You just...

319
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,950
You just need to accept me.

320
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,170
You were...

321
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,230
You were in the Heuksa Clan.

322
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,440
You caught on.

323
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,170
You noticed so quickly.

324
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,760
Were you the one who's been
torturing Prince Gyeongseong?

325
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,780
Bringing him up again!
Listen even if you don't want to.

326
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,070
Prince Gyeongseong is my husband

327
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,480
and I will never marry you even if it kills me.

328
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,170
Sun Chaek, how could you do this to me?

329
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,010
Don't call my name with that filthy mouth.

330
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't want to learn about your pain...

331
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,180
ever.

332
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,230
I assembled you here today because

333
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,070
His Majesty wishes to abdicate the throne.

334
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,890
Abdicate? Why all of a sudden?

335
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,950
Because his health has deteriorated, he will not be able to discuss state affairs.

336
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,300
But His Majesty does not have a successor yet.

337
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,150
This is too sudden...

338
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,530
I will...

339
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,450
hand over the throne to Prince Seonghyeon.

340
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,710
Your Majesty, abdication is out of the question.

341
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,860
The foundation of this country will falter.

342
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,550
For your weakening health,

343
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,030
you can rehabilitate briefly and regain strength.

344
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:54,580
Please listen to our plea.

345
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,550
It is what His Majesty wants to do.

346
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,050
Do not go against His Majesty's decision!

347
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,250
No one is more qualified than
Prince Seonghyeon to take over the throne.

348
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,400
His Majesty is adamant about it.

349
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,960
The royalty and the country's
future depend on this.

350
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,540
Even if you abdicate,

351
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,100
there are other royal relatives,
such as Prince Gyeongseong.

352
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,520
Prince Gyeongseong is dead.

353
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,030
Most importantly, he went
against the King's order.

354
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,200
How dare you mention him in front of His Majesty?

355
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,630
It is clear you are on Prince Gyeongseong's side.

356
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,230
Why are you doing this?

357
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,920
There is a tavern just a little further.

358
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,950
Let us catch a break there.

359
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,900
Yes.

360
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,020
Stop right there!

361
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,360
What is this about?

362
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,650
His Majesty ordered to arrest and transfer the traitor's daughter, Cha Sun Chaek.

363
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,920
Pardon?

364
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,170
Let go!

365
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,070
Father! Father!

366
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,430
Mother!

367

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,950
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

370
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,190
Heuksa Clan's leader,
Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol

371
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,140
and his family will be arrested
according to the King's order.

372
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,890
Heuksa Clan?

373
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,460
That makes no sense at all.

374
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,060
I found it!

375
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,660
[General Gyeongseong is on
his way to kill the tyrannical King]

376
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,880
[The Heuksa Clan will start a new world afterward]

377
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,570
How could this be?
Father...

378
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,690
I have no idea what's going on...

379
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,520
What should I do with these evil and greedy people?

380
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,500
Do as you wish.

381
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,590
Your will...

382
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,260
is my will.

383
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,290
I will follow your order.

385

386
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,360
Please.

387
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,160
I need to go to Prince Gyeongseong.

388
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,210
My time, that was passing by meaninglessly,

389
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,780
you are the only one who gave it meaning.

390
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,040
The first and...

391
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,890
the last woman of Yi Beon's life is...

392
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,780
Cha Sun Chaek.

393
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,570
Only you.

394
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,250
Sun Chaek!
Sun Chaek.

395
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,060

396

397
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,050
Sun Chaek, what on earth is going on?

398
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,550
I am afraid.

399
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,270
Is this really how we die?

400
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,690
No, this is not happening.

401
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,260
You call me a traitor?

402
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,260
I have been framed!

403
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,680
This is clearly a false accusation and a stretch!

404
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,760
Please let us meet His Majesty!

405
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,190

Let us live!

406
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,700
Let us live...

407
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,530
I have been framed.

408
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,360
Prince Seonghyeon?

409
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,600
This must be hard for you, Sun Chaek.

410
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,630
But this is the path you chose.

411
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,510
You need to accept it, then.

412
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,690
Were you the one who framed my family?

413
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,710
You are suffering because
of your youngest daughter.

414
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:05,130
I will send you off all at once for your sake.

415
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,850
No, stop! Stop!

416
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,020
Stop, I said!

417
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,060

prayed to the same figurine.

Yes.

Anyway, I can't believe Cha Sun Chaek
became the female lead.

461

00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,330
Yes, sir.

551
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,500
Ouch! My eyes... My eyes!

552
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,640
"Gumaengjusan."

553
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,410
Do you mind if I speak more?

554
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,420
You remembered that saying.

555
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,810
You taught it to me yourself.

556
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,350
"Gumaengjusan."

557
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,420
It's a phrase that started the Heuksa Clan,
founded by Prince Seonghyeon.

558
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,030
If a tavern's guard dog is vicious,

559
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,940
their wine turns sour.

560
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,750
As such, if the king's guard dog is vicious,

561
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,920
the country cannot have virtuous subjects.

562
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,020
That was your justification
for founding the Heuksa Clan.

563
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,620
You know more than I thought.

564
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,120
However, after killing the
hunting dog, Prince Seonghyeon

565
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,830
became a hunting dog himself...

566
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,280
I mean,

567
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,470
he became a crazy dog himself.

568
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,140
Because dogs never bite their owners.

569
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,760
In actuality, you probably
wanted to be on the throne.

570
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,630
Prince Gyeongseong, who's been an eyesore, is gone

571
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,010
and the Chief State Minister
was imprisoned for treason, too.

572
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:42,060
It must be a perfect time to trick
His Majesty and take the throne.

573
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,070
But be careful.

574
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,470
The Heuksa Clan...

575
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,800
Do you think they're all on your side?

576
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,640
Truly, are you saying that for my sake?

577
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,330
You're trying so hard...

578
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,720
to save yourself.

579
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,820
They say it is abdication,
but it is basically treason.

580
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,630
We need to correct what is wrong.

581
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,430
We need to be more loyal at times like this.

582
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,340
Are you all right, Your Highness?

583
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,170
Now that Prince Gyeongseong is gone,

584
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:10,300
Prince Seonghyeon is the problem now.

585
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,120
As soon as the King fell ill,

586
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:18,310
he is showing his claws as if he has been waiting.

587
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:22,600
I am afraid there would be...

588
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,680
another bloodbath.

589
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,230
Your Highness.

590
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:33,930
Can we really trust Prince Seonghyeon?

591
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,930
Are you playing the king right now?

592
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,600
Play?

593
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,870
I am about to become one soon.

594
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:13,960
I will also give you another chance.

595
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,690
Will you marry me?

596
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,720
I said I would never, even if it killed me.

597
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,320
If you marry me,

598
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,970
you will become the queen of this country.

599
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,400
I can make you...

600
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,860
the most powerful woman in this country.

601
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:45,020
You are giving me no choice.

602
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,190
If you really do not want to,

603
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,810
I will have to take you forcibly.

604
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,210
Easy is boring to me, too.

605
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,270
Hear ye!

606
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,680
Bring this woman to my bedchamber!

607
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,430
Catch her!

608
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,200
What is it?

609
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,480
Will you jump in or something?

610
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,480
Are you afraid now that it is about to happen?

611
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,870
Please wake up.

612
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,070
You will get the last chance, then.

613
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,850
A chance is not given.

614
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,530
It is something you create.

615
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,480
There is no need to go to the execution site.

616
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,390
If you wish to die so badly,

617
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,350
I will make it happen.

618
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,880
My poor Sun Chaek.

619
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,630
I do not want to do this, either-

620
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,850
What are you doing?

621
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,720
I decide when I'll die.

622
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,220
I have been tolerating you
for the sake of our old ties.

623
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,150
But your foolish decision is...

624
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,870
hastening your death in the end.

625
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,960
It is finally time to go, Sun Chaek.

Yes.

640

This world is so freeing.

644

01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,260
I thought our great cause was
to create a different world.

652
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,290
We were ordered to kill anyone
who goes against the King.

Please save the country that is
