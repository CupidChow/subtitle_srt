00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,020
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,820
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,120
[Episode 4: We need Cha Sun Chaek.*]
(Means "Plan B")

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
[Two hours before the fire]

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,020
Bottoms up!
Drink!

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,760
Here's the penalty drink. The penalty drink.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,440
Please pass this on.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,890
Drink it.
I drank too much.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,270
♪ Here comes the alcohol ♪

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,830
♪ Drink up, drink up, drink up ♪

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,830
♪ How long will you make me dance? ♪

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,680
♪ Look at my shoulders ♪

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,290
I'm drunk, but I can feel it.

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,430
Prince Gyeongseong is so embarrassed of me.

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,480
No men would like it when his fiancée acts like this.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,710
Well done.

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,110
What is that?

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,900
What is that?
What is that?

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,710
This is a new game that I created just for the Seonmun Club.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,660
Removing a wooden block...

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,660
without making the tower fall is the first rule.

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,670
And ask the question that's written on the back

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,710
of the block to the person who's on your right.

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,410
The one who was asked the question
will have to give an answer.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,570
My Lady, I am about to lose my arm.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,980
What will you do with all these?

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,240
It's too many for the Yoot game.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,130
This is a game device that's as groundbreaking

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,060
as my cocktail-making skills.

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,200
Looks like you are all
about entertainment these days.

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,940
Gosh, how vulgar.

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,010
What is with all these questions?

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,880
Considering they are Confucians,
I'm going easy on them.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,530
What happens if one cannot answer the question?

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,930
There is a penalty drink.

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,430
The penalty drink is made with

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,880
the notoriously strong hongsoju.

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,210
It's more than just a penalty drink.

39
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,080
It's basically a poison.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,050
You will have to answer, then.

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,440
That makes this game...

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,460
This... merriment... so entertaining.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,810
Okay, let's decide on the order, then.

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,950
Gosh.

45
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,640
Lady Eun Ae, please start.

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,380
It's not hard. Don't be nervous.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,870
Okay.

48
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,160
What is the question?

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,090
"Your lover... turned into a bug.

50
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,810
Would you save it or kill it?"

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,220
Prince Gyeongseong ended up with that question.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,010
Prince Gyeongseong, please answer.

53
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,360
My lover turned into a bug.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,410
That would never happen.

55
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,140
It is just imagination.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,460
How pathetic.

57
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,170
I am only reading the question.

58
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,240
I have no reason to answer such a useless question.

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,540
I think the questions in this merriment

60
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,510
start with, "What if"-
There is no what if.

61
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,240
Because my lover will never turn into a bug.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,630
You have to drink the penalty drink, then.

63
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,990
Are you giving me an order now?

64
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,800
Gosh, I shouldn't have prepared this.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,440
I will drink this penalty drink.

66
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,670
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

67
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,430
Come on now.

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,350
It's just a merriment.

69
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,240
I think we should stop now.

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,910
I did not say I will not participate.

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,770
[What is the color
of the underwear you are wearing?]

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
So cold.

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,700
Something as sharp as ice in a highball flew and pierced me.

74
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,460
When was your last kiss?

75
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,860
Was there a question like that?

76
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,590
Did Bang Wool write that?

77
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,870
Are you not ready to answer?

78
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,160
Are you refusing to answer or can you not?

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,180
What do you mean I cannot answer?

80
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
I will answer.

81
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,980
I...

82
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,830
have never kissed anyone
since the moment I was born.

83
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,910
How could a daughter of a nobleman dare to make my lips available?

84
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,010
What was that, then?
Pardon?

85
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,710
The thing we did together the other night-

86
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,620
What nonsense are you spewing right now?

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,950
Nonsense? What are you imagining?

88
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,080
I just... wanted to talk about the promise we made the other night.

89
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,420
There will be a wedding soon?

90
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,650
Mother!

91
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,140
Why are you making a fuss at this late hour?

92
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,580
Something terrible happened.

93
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,050
Something terrible?
We received a wedding proposal at our house.

94
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,730
What are you saying out of the blue?

95
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,110
To avoid misunderstanding, I will make something clear now.

96
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,660
I, Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon... am planning to...

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,660
marry Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

98
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,060
Maiden, what is he talking about?

99
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,160
T-That's not it...

100
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,930
Lady Eun Ae.

101
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,550
Give me water...

102
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,210
Water. Water.
Water, please.

103
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,280
Water. Water.

104
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,250
Maiden Eun Ae.

105
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,510
I brought that to make a peach cocktail.

106
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,680
Is she allergic to peach, by chance?

107
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,660
What a splendid hazing ceremony.

108
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,670
You surely are qualified to be my bride.

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,770
You... must be crazy.

110
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,040
I am crazy... for Cha Sun Chaek.

111
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,250
This can never happen.

112
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,240
I want to hear a good reason.

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,890
My daughter is not ready to get married yet.

114
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,120
What a twist. I didn't expect a response like this.

115
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,700
I said she already took my virginity away.

116
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,340
She can live with me for the rest of her life, then.

117
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,910
It sounds like you do not care if she remains unwed for the rest of her life.

118
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,610
He's so blindly obsessed.

119
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,820
Not just one but three of Sun Chaek's
older brothers have not married.

120
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,530
They need to get married first.

121
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,120
I do not think it would be too late for her to get married afterward.

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,740
I didn't think my brothers could be my shield.

123
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,980
But do you not think... her opinion matters the most?

124
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,430
Yes, Sun Chaek. You tell me.

125
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,790
Do you really want to marry him, too?

126
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,660
I...

127
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,150
Say you don't want to.

128
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,690
Why are you hesitating?

129
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,200
Are you wavering, by chance?

130
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,710
Even so, I can't get married now.

131
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,570
Sun Chaek.

132
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,930
I will just... do what you want me to do, Father.

133
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,470
I do not know how My Lord has come to hold something over my daughter's head-

134
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,870
Hold something over her head?

135
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,450
I think you are very mistaken.

136
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,640
She is the one who holds something over my head.

137
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
What do you mean by that?

138
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,160
The one who kissed me first that night was your daughter.

139
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,290
Sun Chaek...

140
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,770
Hyungnim, you need to stay alert.

141
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,130
Do you want to hear more?

142
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,760
Stop!

143
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,210
Please stop.

144
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,020
What are you saying in front of my parents?

145
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,420
I want to ask if you still oppose it.

146
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,920
Actually, the biggest reason for me...

147
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,050
is something else.

148
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,440
I do not...

149
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,800
want my daughter to join the royal family.

150
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,160
I want my Sun Chaek...

151
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,380
to marry into a very ordinary family.

152
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,350
Since I made myself clear to you,

153
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,540
I will go back inside.

154
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,180
You should go inside, too.

155
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,630
Yes.

156
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,810
My Lady, let's go.

157
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,700
Talk to me for a moment.

158
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,430
Spare us.

159
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,580
It is not that we did not want to get married.

160
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,010
T-That is right. It is rather we could not...

161
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,040
You must be so proud.

162
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,200
H-Hyungnim.
Calm down. It is okay.

163
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,570
I do not think...

164
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,000
it is right for you to get involved in our family business.

165
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,190
You are the biggest problem.

166
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,290
This is what is wrong with the scholars.

167
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,080
They get absorbed in their studies
and avoid reality.

168
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,500
Do not get in the way of your sister's future and be gone now.

169
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,980
Spare me!

170
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,830
Spare me.

171
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,690
I will generously give you two months.

172
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,340
Find your marriage prospects within that time and get married.

173
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,110
We could not do it our whole lives.
How could we suddenly-

174
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,650
I am being as patient as I can be.

175
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,050
After that, even I do not know how I would get rid of you.

176
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,710
I noticed you have been strange lately.

177
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,840
What do I do with you?

178
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,880
Bring me a knife.

180
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,190
Madam.
Hurry.

181
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,650
Yes. I can't get married with a shaved head.

182
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,530
Nice.

183
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,590
I will do what you want me to do, Mother.

184
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,580
Mother.

185
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,550
I will let you cut it if you want.

186
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,150
It is okay.

187
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,530
To be honest, I am on board.

188
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,960
Pardon?

189
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,030
I want Prince Gyeongseong as my son-in-law.

190
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,510
There are scary rumors about him

191
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,960
and as Father said, my brothers
should take time to get married

192
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,470
and I should marry into an ordinary family.

193
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,220
Wouldn't that make me happy?

194
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,820
According to my life experience, men are all about their looks.

195
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,130
It is possible to lose power and wealth.

196
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,040
But one's appearance does not change.

197
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,620
They say if you live with a handsome man, your anger naturally goes away.

198
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,120
I could not have one myself, but I hope you do.

199
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,330
M-Mother.

200
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,610
And I think this is a great chance to get your brothers married at once, too.

201
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,190
Has she always been like this?

202
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,000
She's nothing like what I expected.

203
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,190
Prince Bokyang's son is a child of a concubine.

204
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,800
That makes Beon the perfect candidate.

205
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,420
To make that happen, you must step forward.

206
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,560
Be ambitious.

207
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,000
For our Beon's sake.

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,320
I married you in order to do this.

209
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,480
But I...

210
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,260
You must strike first.

211
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,480
If you cannot do it, I will do it.

212
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,770
They say a man and wife are one in body and soul.

213
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,470
Are you on the same page as her, Hyungnim?

214
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,940
You are mistaken.

215
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,310
You know.

216
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,250
I am not interested in the throne at all.

217
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,120
Spare me.

218
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,060
I will go somewhere far away with my son

219
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,410
and become reclusive so no one sees us. Please.

220
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,560
I am not sure.

221
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,310
I cannot believe what humans say.

222
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,230
No!

223
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,790
S-Spare him.

224
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,860
Please let my father live.

225
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,450
I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.

226
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,680
Please. Please spare him this once.

227
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
Really?

228
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,950
No matter what that might be?

229
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,790
Can you swing that sword for me?

230
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,670
I ended up getting blood on my hands.

231
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,800
To survive.

232
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,140
I am sorry.

233
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
Because I am so weak...

234
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,600
I could not protect you.

235
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,690
I hope...

236
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,980
you will...

237
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,050
no longer...

238
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,310
be in pain.

239
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,120
A life where family point
their swords at each other.

240
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,170
I wanted to put an end to it.

241
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,000
But...

242
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,560
To be honest, I know everything.

243
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,820
The secrets you keep.

244
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,840
It's not your fault.

245
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,760
You did nothing wrong.

246
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,730
If she got to meet her,

247
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,980
she would have liked her a lot.

248
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,340
Your Highness, it is my wish. Please.

249
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,800
Prince Gyeongseong already
has a woman he wants to marry.

250
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
But he has not married her yet.

251
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,070
Do you not have any self-respect?

252
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,540
I do not care.

253
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,280
I need to have Prince Gyeongseong, no matter what.

254
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,180
So, help me. Please?

255
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,240
You are capable of doing so.

256
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,860
You have always told me that I resemble you

257
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,620
the most in the family.

258
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,440
I rely on you more than my mother.

259
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,270
What is family?

260
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,690
What is bloodline?

261
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,260
Are you granting my request?

262
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,590
You are the best, Queen Mother.

263
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,350
Let me see.

264
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,130
If so...

265
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,980
This just won't come off.

266
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,100
We got into a fight over drinks and even a fire.

267
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,490
Even the lead character can't handle a ridiculous plot like this.

268
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,110
I am worried about Sun Chaek. Should we go in?

269
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,790
We cannot. She is not feeling so well.

270
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,010
It is not a good time.

271
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,320
But still, I am worried. Let us go in.

272
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,720
Come on in.

273
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,460
We were just worried about you, Sun Chaek.

274
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,820
This is all Prince Gyeongseong's fault.

275
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,330
You cannot marry against your will.

276
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,080
We will be sure to help you. Do not worry.

277
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,770
Even if P-Prince Gyeongseong barged in, w-we will protect you.

278
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,930
T-The three of us... can surely fight Prince Gyeongseong!

279
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,160
You are incredibly reassuring.

280
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,500
With all that ruckus yesterday, take care of yourself first.

281
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,960
Yes. I heard everyone who was there is not well.

282
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,880
Right. Eun Ae.

283
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,990
I somehow feel bad.

284
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,400
I wonder if she's okay.

285
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,880
Brothers, I think I need to rest a bit.

286
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,740
Are you ready to start the day, Father?

287
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,710
Are you leaving now?

288
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,360
I went to bed late while reading last night.

289
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,080
I heard there was a big fire last night.

290
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,660
They say the fire started where you
had your club meeting.

291
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Am I misinformed?

292
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,190
I did not tell you in case you'd worry.

293
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,580
My apologies.
You should behave differently in your position.

294
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,240
How much longer will you play around?

295
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,880
If I hear something shameful like this again,

296
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,570
I will no longer ignore it.

297
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,480
Do you understand?

298
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,860
I will be careful...

299
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,120
as much as I can, so as not to worry you, Father.

300
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,040
[Prince Gyeongseong is getting married? / What? ]

301
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,520
[With whom? / Is it true someone
holds something over him?]

302
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,690
[That is just ridiculous!]

303
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,880
[Will his wedding be a royal event? / It's a lie]

304
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,590
[How vulgar / I heard there's a reason]

305
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,710
That is her. That is her.

306
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,310
Is that not the Chief State Minister's daughter?

307
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,040
They are getting married.

308
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm jealous.

309
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,050
I'm sorry!

310
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,390
My gosh.

311
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,610
Are you okay?

312
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,860
Did I hit him hard?

313
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,660
A foreigner?

314
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,180
Help...

315
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,270
W-What did you say?

316
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,900
Help me...

317
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,500
Help!

318
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,670
Help!

319
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,390
Someone fell! Please help!

320
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,970
I'll use the CPR techniques
I learned in high school.

321
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,650
Like this...

322
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,230
I'm hungry.

323
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,750
My stomach hurts.

324
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,360
Y-You're hungry?

325
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm hungry.

326
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,980
Oh, you're hungry?

327
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,310
Delicious?

328
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,880
Korean soup.

329
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,050
So good.

330
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,890
I'm glad.

331
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,800
Ma'am!
Yes.

332
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,260
Another bowl, please.

333
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,040
Same order?
Yes.

334
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,470
So, you got stranded because of a storm and ended up here?

335
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes. I had to go to Japan... but the ship I sailed on and the wave...

336
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,290
I see.

337
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,880
I'm so sorry, man.

338
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,290
What is your name?

339
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,920
My name is Mark. Mark.

340
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,260
Mark. Mark?

341
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,710
I'm Sun Chaek.

342
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,920
Sun Chaek.

343
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,290
Sun Chaek.
Yes.

344
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Sorry, you're having trouble ending up here.

345
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,230
I was like that at first, too.

346
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,600
"Where am I? Who am I?"

347
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,200
Mark, this must be meant to be.

348
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,630
I will buy you clothes.

349
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,290
Really?
Yes.

350
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,210
Lady Sun Chaek.

351
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,430
Long time no see.
Yes.

352
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,740
Are you looking for silk garments for your wedding with Prince Gyeongseong?

353
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,260
Pardon? Wedding?

354
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:40,510
Everyone in the capital is saying you are Prince Gyeongseong's
fiancée right now.

355
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,590
For your wedding, please let me make your garments.

356
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,200
I will make you the best one.

357
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm not shopping for myself today.

358
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,620
M-Mark! Over here. Here, here.

359
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,520
He's the one who needs clothes.

360
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,080
What's wrong?

361
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,670
I am a bit afraid of Westerners.

362
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,880
They say you can get an unknown disease, too.

363
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,420
My gosh!

364
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,810
They just look a bit different than us.

365
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,660
Have pity on him.

366
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,810
I'll be responsible if anything happens.

367
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,200
So, don't worry and make him one outfit.

368
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,970
Since it is your request, I will make an outfit, I suppose.

369
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,980
And could you find him a place to stay?

370
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,200
Yes, I will.

371
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,780
Thank you.

372
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,740
Well, follow me. Follow me.

373
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,220
Thank you, Sun Chaek.

374
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,140
You're welcome.

375
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,700
Yes, come on in.

376
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,340
Now, I should get to it.

377
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,820
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

378
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,720
Is Lady Eun Ae inside?

379
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,890
I am sorry.

380
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,260
My Lady is not home right now.

381
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh, I see.

382
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,180
How's she feeling, by the way?

383
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,990
She is better since she took medicine.

384
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,390
That's a relief.

385
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,670
I will let her know you stopped by.

386
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,710
Okay.

387
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,210
Are you His Excellency Cha's daughter, by chance?

388
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,770
Do you know me?

389
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,960
It is you.

390
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,440
Eun Ae told me a lot about you.

391
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,700
I am her father, Cho Byeong Mu.

392
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,350
Yes, hello.

393
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,370
Nice to meet you.

394
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,290
You look way younger than I thought-

395
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,640
I-It's nothing.

396
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,560
I was curious if Lady Eun Ae was feeling better.

397
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,250
That is why I stopped by briefly.

398
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,270
I was there when the fire started last night.

399
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,650
Oh, I see.

400
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,260
You are a noblewoman,
but you care about my daughter.

401
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,040
Thank you.

402
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,000
Of course, I should. She's my friend.

403
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,880
You are pure, as if you grew up without any worries

404
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,280
your whole life.

405
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,490
Thank you.

406
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,310
I hope Eun Ae turns out like you, Lady Sun Chaek.

407
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,840
She is in...

408
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,020
your care from now on, My Lady.

409
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,030
Of course.

410
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,170
I'll get going now.

411
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,190
My Lady, drink your medicine.

412
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,440
What medicine is this?

413
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,020
It is a medicine made with chamberbitter

414
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,070
Prince Gyeongseong brought himself.

415
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,600
Oh, right.

416
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,800
I feel bad that he's been doing stuff for me.

417
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,310
I wonder if he's feeling okay.

418
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,390
Why am I thinking of him?

419
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,780
Why do I worry about him?

420
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,280
Whatever. Don't get sucked in.

421
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,640
Don't read into things.

422
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,570
How dare you worry about him?

423
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,890
Worry about yourself.

424
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,950
If I didn't do it, Eun Ae would've done it.

425
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,710
My Lady?

426
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,140
What are you doing?

427
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,920
Huh? It's nothing.

428
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,470
Go ahead and drink the medicine.

429
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,760
The precious stuff is getting cold.

430
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,150
I can't stand anything bitter.

431
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,120
What was that? Am I hearing things?

432
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,000
I heard it, too.

433
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It sounded like a stone hitting the window.

434
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,710
Gosh, hurry.

435
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,790
My gosh.

436
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,030
Sir Su Gyeom.

437
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,050
I wanted to see you,

438
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,810
but it was late, and I felt impatient...

439
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,370
This was the only way to see you.

440
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,840
It is okay.

441
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,100
I must've scared you at the last meeting.

442
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,810
I am so relieved that... you did not get hurt.

443
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,340
Did you come here because
you were worried about me?

444
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,780
There is something I need to tell you.

445
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,800
I-If you heard about me
marrying Prince Gyeongseong-

446
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,510
Well...

447
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,670
The thing is...

448
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,310
This atmosphere. This reaction.

449
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,210
This situation is...

450
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,570
Is he confessing his love by chance?

451
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,620
I think he's here to confirm if it's true

452
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,970
I'm with Prince Gyeongseong.

453
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,550
What's the deal?
Did Jung Su Gyeom fall for me, too?

454
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,810
You might find this to be a burden, but...

455
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,490
His voice says he's suppressing jealousy.

456
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,650
Because our bodies touched in front of the wall,

457
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,800
he's getting fired up.

458
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,490
Gosh, is this my fate?

459
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,110
I try to deny it, but I can't.

460
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,610
You seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.

461
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,000
This is treason.

462
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,670
You might have noticed it already,

463
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,800
but Maiden Sun Chaek, I-

464
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,680
No! You can't!

465
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,840
I love...
You can't love me-

466
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,550
You cannot!
I love Lady Eun Ae.

467
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,020
Not me...

468
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,520
but Lady Eun Ae?

469
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,840
Of course, you are an exceptional woman who is not lacking in any way.

470
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,230
But I fell for Lady Eun Ae when she bravely

471
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,700
took the penalty drink for me as a weak vessel.

472
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,980
Was that really enough... for you to fall in love with Lady Eun Ae?

473
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,970
I have been looking for someone

474
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,770
who is gentle and strong like her.

475
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,690
But...

476
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:35,970
why are you telling me this?

477
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,600
I could not tell her how I feel yet.

478
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,940
Even I am flustered by how I feel.

479
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,170
I have no idea what she would think of it.

480
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,510
Right.

481
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,910
In the book, Eun Ae briefly met Su Gyeom,

482
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,050
but she ended up with Yi Beon.

483
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,110
So...

484
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:06,610
are you asking me to help you end up together?

485
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,320
That is right, Maiden Sun Chaek.

486
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,470
I knew you would understand how I feel.

487
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,930
I know I am asking a lot,

488
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:22,630
but I would find your advice very helpful.

489
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,220
Hold on.

490
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,830
Eun Ae needs to end up with Yi Beon.

491
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,350
If I help him now...

492
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,610
I knew it was too much to ask.

493
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,680
You must be busy with the goings on at home.

494
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,220
Wait...

495
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,390
Could you give me some time to think?

496
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:55,080
I want to try talking to Lady Eun Ae, too.

497
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,260
Do you mean it, Maiden Sun Chaek?

498
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,940
I feel as if I've gained
a thousand soldiers and horses.

499
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,460
I am planning to get married.

500
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,220
I will soon introduce her to you...

501
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,830
Heuksa Clan is... back to being active?

502
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,110
Not only that but the clan and its movement

503
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,270
is stronger and more aggressive than before.

504
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,500
Toughen security at Gangnyeongjeon

505
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,890
and try not to leave the Palace for a while.

506
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,710
You have a lot to worry about, Prince Gyeongseong.

507
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,780
Come. Come closer.

508
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,610
Is it because you have someone to protect?

509
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,720
Your eyes never wavered from any threats,

510
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,510
but I can see fear in them.

511
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,010
Sun Chaek, give me a city tour, please?

512
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,990
City tour?

513
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,370
Oh, sightseeing?

514
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,050
I have something to do.

515
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,020
I'm sorry. Next time, okay?

516
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,620
I need you. Sun Chaek is my only friend.

517
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,890
Okay, let's go.

518
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,770
Mask.
Mask?

519
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,790
Tal. Tal.

520
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,610
This is gat.

521
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,060
Gat?

522
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,520
Hat.

523
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,330
Say, ah.

524
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,660
Fantastic.

525
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,810
We're here.

526
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,810
Mark, I really need to go now.

527
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,260
Okay, but...

528
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,230
thanks for today.

529
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,100
Bye.

530
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,900
Rest well.
Love you. Bye.

531
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,610
See you soon.

532
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,860
Bye.
Bye.

533
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,790
Come, open the door.

534
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,150
I didn't even get to see Eun Ae.

535
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,670
What's wrong with me?

536
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm cold and dizzy.

537
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,610
Why am I...

538
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,190
What's wrong?

539
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,950
Are you okay? Should I call a physician?

540
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,100
Are you okay, maiden?

541
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,050
Blood!
Are you okay?

542
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,160
Heuksa Clan is so tenacious and sneaky.

543
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,860
You must know that better than anyone.

544
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,010
Be careful so you do not lose...

545
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,170

546
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,960
My Lord...

547
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,920
Yes, where is Lady Sun Chaek?

548
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,320
The soldiers took My Lady.

549
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,190
They took her? What do you mean?

550
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,740
She...

551
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,020
She got the plague, they say.

552
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,080
She cannot even stand straight...

553
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,540
I will go in.

554
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,300
We were told not to let anyone in.

555
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,100
Do you not know who I am?

556
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
It is the King's order.

557
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,190
I will cut your throat if you do not move.

558
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,110
Forgive me.

559
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,970
I will give you this Howon Sword.

560
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,800
Cut it up or melt it.

561
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,580
Do whatever you wish.

562
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,270
You must know what kind of sword this is.

563
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,220
We have no choice but to follow the King's order.

564
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,980
If you end up catching it, too...

565
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,350
I do not care.

566
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,370
Let me in.

567
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,650
This is not an order.

568
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,910
It is a request.

569
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,210
So cold...

570
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,630
Where did things go wrong?

571
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,640
It must be because I changed the story

572
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,460
without knowing my place.

573
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,350
That's why I must be dying alone...

574
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:59,110
without anyone finding out.

575
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,520
Cha Sun Chaek!

576
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,810

577
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,810
Is that you?

578
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,820
Yes.

579
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:36,070
Am I really dying?

580
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,490
Die if you can.

581
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,150
I will chase you to the end.

582
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,330
I want to live.

583
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,770
Let me live.

584
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,330

587
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,090

588

589

590
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,950

Forgive me, Queen Mother.

594

Do not worry, Your Majesty.

595
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,670
Whoever has more energy can visit the other.

596
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,380
This must be something very urgent.

597
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,240
Since you, who is more youthful than I,

598
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,330
paid a visit to see me at my chamber.

599
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,180
I want Prince Gyeongseong's wedding

600
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,720
to go through a selection process.

601
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,630
A selection process for a mere prince's wedding?

602
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,530
He is not just a mere prince.

603
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,870
It is Prince Gyeongseong, your favorite prince.

604
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,940
We cannot let him marry just anyone.

605
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,510

628
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,120
There is one thing I overlooked.

629
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,590
