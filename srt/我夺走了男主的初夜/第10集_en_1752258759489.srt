1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,000
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,700
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,220
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,060
What does that mean?

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,190
It means I don't want you to kill people.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,680
By chance,

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,040
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,400
Correct me if I'm wrong.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,280
Do you not trust me?

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,280
If I killed him,

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,540
will you call me a murderer and run away again?

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,620
You know that's not what I meant.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,210
I said to avoid him because
he is dangerous. Is that so hard?

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,080
Stay away from Prince Seonghyeon.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,450
This is an order.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,330
I wish you didn't hide things from me.

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,390
Do you still think I killed that man?

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,740
It's not that.
Fine. This is great.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,080
I might as well kill everyone in the market.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
How much longer will you have blood on your hands?

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,540
He must be possessed by a murderous spirit.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,080
He's way too young.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,640
How could he do that as a human?

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,020
He is not a human.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,770
He is a dog. A hunting dog.

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,090
Whoever is near Prince Gyeongseong

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,910
will die.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,730
This might be your opportunity
to stop being called

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,470
a hunting dog or a murderous spirit.

30
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,240
I do not need such an opportunity.

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,420
This is not what I saw when I read your mind.

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,300
I know you're lonelier and tormented than anyone.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,740
But why do you let people misunderstand you?

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,410
You said you know everything about me,

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,560
but you do not understand me at all.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,970
I had better leave for the night.

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,630
[Episode 10: Destiny strikes again]

38
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,350
I took care of it as you ordered.

39
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,810
You are back to being the
old Prince Gyeongseong again.

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,020
My Lord!

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,240
It is cold. Why are you outside?

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,950
Because I do not feel at ease.

43
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,980
You must have argued with Lady Cha.

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,650
I know just by looking at your face, My Lord.

45
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,930
Do not worry.

46
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,820
A lovers' quarrel does not last.

47
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,730
Even a fight like that is a luxury to me.

48
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,550
Why would you say that?

49
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,830
Just like the rumors say,

50
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,290
I wonder if everyone near me...

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,790
ends up miserable.

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,520
Gosh, that is not true.

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,160
I am here to prove that wrong.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,370
You do not know how happy
I am to serve you, My Lord.

55
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,440
Make sure the body is...discovered at the downstream.

56
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,970
Don't look at me so scary.

57
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,420
What do you want from me?

58
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,190
I do not want anything from you.

59
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,900
Just stay the same as before.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,880
Stay as Cha Sun Chaek's
trusty friend as you are now.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,640
So, she listens to you and relies on you.

62
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,130
I will decide what you will tell her.

63
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,880
By the way,

64
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,170
what would you gain by doing this?

65
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,870
You will find out soon.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,470
It will not be fun...

67
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,710
to spoil it in advance.

68
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,420
Was I too harsh?

69
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,570
Prince Gyeongseong seemed very hurt.

70
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,630
I don't know.

71
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,590
Where did things go wrong?

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,740
You said you know everything about me,

73
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,740
but you do not understand me at all.

74
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,860
I already know

75
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,340
how difficult of a past you had.

76
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,620
So, I just wanted to help you move on from it.

77
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,800
My Lady!

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,510
Lady Eun Ae is here.

79
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,290
Yes, let her in.

80
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,270
My Lady, you were up.

81
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,520
What brings you here so early?

82
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,670
I wanted to help you prepare for the wedding.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,240
Is something going on, My Lady?

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,910
The bride should be at her peak now.

85
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,590
But you do not look so well.

86
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,080
It is nothing.

87
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,590
I hope it is not because of the rumor.

88
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,920
Rumor?

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,870
The thing is...

90
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,550
Prince Gyeongseong apparently killed a prime minister who is in exile.
Pardon?

91
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,490
He was respected since
the former king was in power.

92
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,760
That must be why there is a lot of talk.

93
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,980
They say the bloodshed started again

94
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,250
and the hunting dog cannot help himself.

95
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,380
Although Prince Gyeongseong
must have followed the King's order.

96
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,480
It is just a rumor.

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,300
It hasn't been confirmed, either.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,980
R-Right.

99
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,980
I should not have told you.

100
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,940
Do not worry.

101
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,440
How long am I supposed to do this?

102
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,200
Start the silence training all over again.

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,290
A-Again? Says who?

104
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,970
Do you think you could...

105
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,510
scare me staring like that?

106
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,250
You still have a long way to go.

107
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,650
Reflect on your sins through silence.

108
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,750
Why would he hit me? Seriously.

109
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,830
Monk, please come out for a moment.

110
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,510
I did not commit a sin.

111
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,500
Not this time.

112
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,900
Right.

113
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,490
To prove my innocence,

114
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,880
I will have to find the culprit
instead of meditating.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Yes, I am the embodiment of revenge.

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
No, revenge equals Do Hwa Seon.

117
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,200
Away! Go away!

118
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,320
Stop blocking the path and move.

119
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,100
Hold on.

120
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,250
I said move.

121
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,080
Seriously. Hold on a moment, I said-

122
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,350
I thought you were a beggar.

123
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,770
But it was you.

124
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,050
What? A beggar?

125
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,280
There is the Right State Minister.

126
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,570
Should I call him for you?

127
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,670
You be quiet.

128
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,290
Do not touch me with your dirty hand.

129
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,090
What? Dirty?

130
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,760
You are finally showing your true color.

131
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,470
Take a good look at yourself instead.

132
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,730
What? Seriously.

133
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,080
My gosh.

134
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,540
Look who is here.

135
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,340
What a miserable sight.

136
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,590
What were you talking about here?

137
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,410
Lady Hwa Seon must still find me to be an eyesore.

138
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,690
What did you just say?

139
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,050
Try running that big mouth again.

140
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,440
Gosh, she is so crude.

141
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,420
I cannot deal with you.

142
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,900
Are you crazy?

143
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,390
Do not fight because of me.

144
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,600
The Dahong Club meeting
preparation is almost ready.

145
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,980
I will let you know soon.

146
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,890
D-Dahong Club? Without me?

147
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,200
At your teahouse?

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Lady Eun Ae will lead the club from now on.

149
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,690
Excuse us, then.

150
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,600
Excuse us.
Let us go, My Lady.

151
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,530
You are radiant today, Lady Eun Ae.

152
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,620
You are too kind.

153
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Seriously!

154
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,560
So, you are treating me like a culprit, too?

155
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,960
Just wait and see.

156
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,740
I will catch the culprit.

157
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,380
Gosh, My Lord.

158
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,900
Were you waiting for me?

159
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,890
I need to talk to you urgently.

160
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,100
People can see us. You cannot do this.

161
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,300
What if people get the wrong idea?

162
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,880
I am the one...

163
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,780
who wants to resolve a misunderstanding.

164
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,910
What is this?

165
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,640
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

166
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,950
Please explain properly

167
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,230
so I can understand.

168
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,410
You are not mistaken.

169
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,720
What you are thinking is correct.

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,920
My Lady, what do you mean-

171
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,330
I lured Lady Cha with a fake letter and had her kidnapped at Cheonggyecheon.

172
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,730
Are you satisfied to hear what you wanted to hear?

173
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,360
How...How could you do something so evil?

174
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,260
Your innocent face makes me feel like such a terrible person.

175
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,030
Why did you do that?

176
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,850
Tell me the reason, at least.

177
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,640
You would never understand.

178
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,540
The ones who were born with
everything could never understand why.

179
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,130
No reason in the world can justify hurting people.

180
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,770
Please...confess now.

181
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,820
I have no interest in doing so.

182
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,730
If you keep acting like this,

183
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,430
I have no choice but to tell Prince Gyeongseong.

184
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,770
What a touching friendship.

185
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,620
Yes, do that.

186
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,840
But I am not sure if you know this, by the way.

187
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,840
Your father is a member of the Heuksa Clan that

188
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,180
Prince Gyeongseong has been fighting for decades.

189
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,890
How ludicrous!

190
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,930
It is not ludicrous. It is the truth.

191
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,990
If you are curious,

192
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,880
ask the Chief Secretary yourself and confirm.

193
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,990
Culprits always return to the crime scene.

194
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,370
Are you the culprit, then?

195
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,120
Now that I think about it,
the culprit is already dead.

196
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,810
Why are you telling me that now?

197
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,440
Because we just met.

198
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,530
Our fates brought us here. It was nice to meet you.

199
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,470
If I put myself in the culprit's shoes,

200
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,940
I thought I might think of a clue.

201
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,840
Crazy bastard. Seriously.

202
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,110
She asked for help with this?

203
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,040
Cha Sun Chaek sure is lucky.

204
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,940
Are you following me around by chance?

205
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,550
I think it is the opposite.

206
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,640
Stop following me.

207
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,850
The first one was a miss

208
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,510
and the second one was accurate.

209
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,570
A silver dagger* and a medium sword inflicted two wounds.

210
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,150
*(Used by women for self-defense)

211
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,970
The silver dagger missed...

212
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,410
and the sword stabbed the vital spot exactly.

213
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,120
Did the woman...

214
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,870
have an accomplice?

215
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,220
My Lord.

216
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,360
What is going on?

217
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,350
His Majesty is looking for you urgently.

218
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,110
His Majesty?

219
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,200
Did you wait long?

220
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,950
No, Your Majesty.

221
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,640
I was waiting...

222
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,650
for you to confess your sin...and repent.

223
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,320
What do you mean-
Prince Gyeongseong, you promised to be loyal to me.

224
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,170
Do you remember?

225
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,540
Are you truthful with me?

226
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,430
Are you sure you are not hiding anything from me?

227
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:23,010
Were you going to fake his death and hide him away?

228
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,220
That is not the case at all.

229
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,620
I just wanted to delay it.

230
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,650
Why did you want to delay it?

231
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,190
I asked him to wait until...my daughter's wedding.

232
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,760
Shut your mouth.

233
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,740
How dare a sinner talk to His Majesty?

234
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,640
Did he affect you enough to go against my order?

235
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,180
Today, I killed you with my sword.

236
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,060
Have you softened up or...did you have a change of heart?

237
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,190
Your Majesty, what Prince Gyeongseong attempted is tantamount to treason.

238
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,000
I agree.

239
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,740
Unless he sided with the minister,

240
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,880
how could he go against your order and make a false report?

241
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,900
For going against your order, please punish him harshly.

242
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,270
Punish him harshly.

243
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:07,110
Your Majesty, he has been in exile as punishment for a long time.

244
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,170
Revisiting the past and blaming
him for his old crime

245
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,000
would not be approved by the people.

246
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,390
Even the Book of Law says one should
not be punished for sins from the past.

247
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,380
Displaying your generosity

248
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,720
would be a good way to set an example and be a good lesson.

249
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,270
Please listen to my plea.

250
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,420
Sins from the past?

251
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,740
Yes.

252
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,100
The Chief State Minister makes a good point.

253
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,240
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

254
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,060
I will be generous and...give Prince Gyeongseong one more chance.

255
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,990
Kill this man in front of me now.

256
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,760
Then, I will let go of your past error.

257
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
Your Majesty.

258
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,630
Are you refusing or incapable?

259
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,630
Thank you.

260
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,160
I heard the wedding went well, thanks to you.

261
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,190
I am all right.

262
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,910
Kill me.

263
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,380
What are you doing? Kill him now!

264
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,230
Don't kill.

265
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,460
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

266
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,020
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

267
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,480
Prince Seonghyeon.

268
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,000
I crossed the line, Your Majesty.

269
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,660
But I could not just sit and watch.

270
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,410
It is okay. It is okay.

271
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,850
I feel relieved, as if an enormous
burden has been lifted.

272
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,980
Prince Gyeongseong will be
stripped from his position now.

273
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,410
Wait for my disciplinary action for the dismissal.

274
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,290
Why did you do that?

275
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,960
That was so out of character for you.

276
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,340
It was your doing.

277
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,230
Why are you doing this?

278
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,680
Not only you disobeyed the King's order,

279
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,680
you dared to make a false report to him!

280
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,730
Is this how you show your claws?

281
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,990
What is it that you want?

282
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,460
That's why...

283
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,780
you should have done your job properly.

284
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,700
This would not have happened, then.

285
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,120
[The Obsessive Tyrant]

286
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,320
Pardon?

287
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,140
Prince Gyeongseong was stripped of his position?

288
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,340
He did not kill the man
His Majesty ordered him to kill

289
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,630
and made a false report.

290
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,150
Because the man had pleaded
with him for his daughter

291
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,400
who was about to wed.

292
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,850
You said you know everything about me,

293
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,920
but you do not understand me at all.

294
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,240
Do you not trust me?

295
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,620
What brings you to my room at this hour?

296
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,420
Cut your ties with Prince Gyeongseong.

297
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,140
What...

298
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,770
do you mean by that?

299
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,320
You will die if you stay by his side.

300
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,480
Father.

301
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,680
Have you sided with Prince Seonghyeon?

302
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,260
Is Prince Seonghyeon...

303
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,110
behind the Heuksa Clan?

304
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,880
How did you know?
Answer my question.

305
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,900
I thought you were completely oblivious.

306
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,850
I am impressed.

307
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,010
The owner of the Palace will change and the new world will begin soon.

308
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,210
Does Prince Gyeongseong need
to be gone to achieve that?

309
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,180
The puppet king has been able to stay in power

310
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,590
all because of Prince Gyeongseong.

311
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,370
He needs to be eliminated first.

312
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,620
You have a duty.

313
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,360
Submit a petition and request
the execution of Prince Gyeongseong.

314
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,250
You must know well how important my mission is.

315
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,270
So, risk your life for it, too.

316
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,020
Prince Gyeongseong seems to be a dying flame.

317
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,230
I no longer know which rope to hold onto.

318
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,700
What do you think?

319
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,590
Father,

320
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,500
I gained a new card.

321
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,160
Are you all right?

322
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,740
I heard about what happened.

323
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,340
As you were concerned, I ended up falling out of His Majesty's favor.

324
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,100
You had better not come here for a while.

325
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,360
Being friendly with me...

326
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,610
will not help you at all.

327
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,310
There is something I need to tell you.

328
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,540
You are not even shocked...

329
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,510
as if you were expecting me.

330
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,730
I see Sir Su Gyeom already tattled on me.

331
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,700
You killed, but you have no remorse.

332
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,290
Who is your accomplice?

333
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,060
I did it alone.

334
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,180
I found a trace of an accomplice
in the kidnapper's body.

335
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,730
Tell me the truth.

336
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,010
How long did you think you could deceive?

337
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,970
You would not feel wronged
even if you died like this.

338
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,520
Sure. Go ahead and kill me.

339
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,820
If you want to commit another
murder despite Lady Cha's wish.

340
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,230
I guess you actually love Lady Cha.

341
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,230
But a person's true color never changes.

342
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,240
You must know that better than anyone, My Lord.

343
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,160
If you do not reveal your accomplice,

344
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,470
I will send you to the Royal
Investigation Bureau. Decide wisely.

345
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,770
The store you built with
your father might be in danger.

346
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,630
She is Lady Cha's close friend.

347
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:56,400
What will you tell Lady Cha?

348
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,300
Watch her carefully.

349
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,930
Cho Eun Ae...

350
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,390
got caught by Prince Gyeongseong?

351
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,800
Murderous spirit.

352
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,900
Evil murderer!

353
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,940
You killed my husband, didn't you?

354
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,660
How many people have you killed?

355
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,510
No!

356
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,200
Stop throwing it!

357
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,240
Move!

358
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,280
Bring my husband back!

359
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,280
Bring my husband back!

360
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,640
Bring him back to life!

361
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,830
What you did today could have put you in danger.

362
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,320
You always live in danger.

363
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm sorry for misjudging you.

364
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,650
I was all talk.

365
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,100
I guess I didn't understand you with my heart.

366
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,260
You are the first person who stepped in for me, Cha Sun Chaek.

367
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,430
I can continue to do anything for you.

368
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,590
I'm so sorry for hurting you.

369
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,710
I am...

370
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,820
also sorry.

371
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:19,170
All of this is because of my shameful past

372
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,800
I want to put behind.

373
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,170
I have a terrible past that could make you want to leave if you found out.

374
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,550
When His Majesty rose to the throne, Prince Seonghyeon's parents,

375
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,970
Prince Seonghyeon's parents, my uncle and aunt were killed.

376
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,060
I was there then.

377
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,700
But...

378
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,750
to protect my family,

379
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,960
I sided with His Majesty.

380
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,700
I would've done the same.

381
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,490
I understand why Prince Seonghyeon hates me.

382
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,460
Because I do, I can sense
how dangerous his hatred is.

383
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,260
I have been afraid of his pent-up
anger from the past dozen years

384
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,340
and I lost my mind when I saw you with him.

385
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,440
I did not want his resentment
toward me to hurt you.

386
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,360
Don't say things like that.

387
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:30,040
Just because... I asked you not to kill anyone,

388
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,560
you tried to change.

389
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,830
You want to leave your dark past
behind more than anyone.

390
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,560
I know that.

391
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,060
For you to be able to do that

392
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,910
and have nothing but happiness ahead,

393
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,990
I will help you.

394
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,320
I will make sure of it.

395
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,410
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

396
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,480
Please execute him immediately.

397
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,260
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

398
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,230
Please execute him immediately.

399
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:58,870
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

400
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,230
Please execute him immediately.

401
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,160
I am not happy about it,

402
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,310
but the only person His Majesty listens to now

403
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,990
seems to be Prince Seonghyeon.

404
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,700
It is you, Sun Chaek.

405
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,140
It is cold. Come inside.

406
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,860
No.

407
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,440
I'll talk to you here.

408
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,530
All right.

409
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,490
What is it?

410
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,750
Please help Prince Gyeongseong.

411
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,160
Help Prince Gyeongseong?

412
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,270
How could I when he went against the King's order?

413
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:46,380
I know that you hold a grudge against

414
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,820
Prince Gyeongseong from the past.

415
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,930
But you are still asking me that?

416
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,270
Please let Prince Gyeongseong live.

417
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,530
I beg you.

418
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,760
I see you truly love him.

419
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,200
I am sorry, but I do not have the power.

420
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,230
If you let him live, I will do anything.

421
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,440
What are you planning to do
with Prince Gyeongseong?

422
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,090
Please execute him immediately!

423
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,560
Your Majesty!
What do you think?

424
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,490
I actually have a brilliant idea.
Please execute him immediately!

425
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,700
Brilliant idea?

426
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,210
China is having trouble
with barbarians at the border.

427
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,600
Send Prince Gyeongseong there
to suppress the barbarians

428
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,460
and let him bring the Emperor's edict.

429
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,630
Are you saying send
Prince Gyeongseong to the border?

430
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,040
That is correct.

431
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,150
If we solve China's headache,

432
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,790
I am sure we can get the Emperor's attention.

433
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,390
We struggled for a long time
to eradicate those barbarians,

434
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,780
but I heard none of the generals
made it back alive.

435
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,280
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong
will easily defeat the barbarians

436
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,170
and bring back the edict as well.

437
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,770
Not only would it allow
Prince Gyeongseong to repent,

438
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,250
it is a great chance to...

439
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,650
bring honor to the country.

440
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,120
Summon Prince Gyeongseong.

441
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:08,320
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

443
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,940
Please execute him immediately.

444
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:20,580
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

445
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,090
Please execute him immediately.

446
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,890
What is it regarding?

447
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,080
I learned that...

448
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,080
my father is a member of the Heuksa Clan.

449
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,820
I might...

450
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,930
feel too ashamed to face you again.

451
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,540
Beon...

452
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,800
please forgive me.

453
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,080
This is no one's fault.

454
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,130
No matter what happens,

455
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,530
I will not blame you.

456
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,090
When I consider what happened yesterday,

457
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,420
punishing you by death will not be enough.

458
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,280
But considering our bond,

459
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,980
I want to give you a last chance
to redeem yourself.

460
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,370
Go to the border.

461
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,680
Kill the barbarian general
who is giving China trouble

462
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,160
and achieve great success.

463
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,100
Leave before sunrise tomorrow.

464
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,290
I will follow your order.

465
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,660
Your Majesty,

466
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,780
lastly, there is something I need to tell you.

467
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,270
Please...

468
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,480
beware of Prince Seonghyeon.

469
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,230
I trusted you, but you betrayed me.

470
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,740
Prince Seonghyeon demonstrated
his loyalty toward me in action.

471
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,880
I hope you do the same.

472
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,260
Be healthy and well, Your Majesty.

473
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,950
Prince Gyeongseong.

474
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:32,680
They immediately started appealing
as if they had prepared already.

475
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,220
I am sorry I cannot help you much.

476
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,180
Do not worry.

477
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,770
Brother-in-law!

478
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,070
Brother-in-law,

479
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,800
I thought I would never see you again.

480
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,690
How about you rest at our house for a few days to rejuvenate?

481
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,490
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

482
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,180
Don't be alone.

483
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,720
I am afraid I cannot.

484
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,940
Pardon?

485
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,340
I am being sent to the border
for a battle tomorrow.

486
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,440
A battle?

487
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,770
I need to prepare for the battle now.

488
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,910
No!

489
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,500
Brother-in-law.
No...

490
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,940
No, Brother-in-law.

491
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,700
No...

492
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,110
Why did you make such a suggestion?

493
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,110
It was a great chance to eliminate him immediately.

494
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,890
Do you think the hit list incident...

495
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,350
could have eliminated Prince Gyeongseong?

496
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,910
This is definitely the right way to handle him.

497
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,670
Do not worry.

498
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,880
The path Prince Gyeongseong is on

499
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,270
will not bring him back alive.

500
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,180
Prince Gyeongseong!

501
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,480
If you leave me behind, you won't go 10 ri without getting sore feet.

502
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,060
It is so hard to marry you.

503
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,430
We should've done this from the get-go, right?

504
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,500
I might not be able to return.

505
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,800
Don't say stuff like that.

506
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,630
What happened to the obsessive tyrant I know?

507
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,610
Like how you pursued me relentlessly,

508
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,150
come back to me.

509
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,190
I ended up...becoming a source of trouble for you.

510
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,810
What do you mean, trouble?

511
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,400
We are one from now on.

512
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,740
Just like this ring.

513
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,110
Put it on me, too.

514
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,990
We need to become a married
couple before the sun rises.

515
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,190
How pretty.

516
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,040
This makes us a married couple.

517
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,900
Bang, bang, bang.

518
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,680
I cannot believe it.

519
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,480
It feels like a dream.

520
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,020
Should I make it feel real for you?

521
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,000
I, Cha Sun Chaek,

522
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,030
promise undying love
to Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon.

523
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,640
Let me hear from the groom, too.

524
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,200
My time, that was passing by meaninglessly,

525
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,760
you are the only one who gave it meaning.

526
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:47,690
The first and...the last woman of Yi Beon's life is...

527
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,590
Cha Sun Chaek.

528
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,400
Only you.

530
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,810

My Lord.

538
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,140
Yes...

539
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,710
Return safely.

540
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,470
Have a safe trip. Come back soon.

541
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,860
I'll be right here!

542
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,350
Bye!

543
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,310
Do not worry so much.

544
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,690
He will return safely.

545
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,140
My Lady. Prince Gyeongseong is...

546
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,190
[I will never leave you.
Be careful, Prince Gyeongseong.]

547
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,570
I knew you would be like this.

548
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,330
Do not cry because I am gone.

549
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,560
Right.

550
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,380
I will always be with you.

551
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,870
Come back soon.

552
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,610
I will be back.

553
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,450
Don't cry, My Lady.

554
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,140
My Lady.

555
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,080
Don't cry...

556
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,790
I shouldn't be sitting here like this.

557
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,460
Bang Wool.

558
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,280
Yes, My Lady.

559
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,900
Could you help me pack?

560
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,770
Pack? What for?

561
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,910
I will move into Hoseondang.

562
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,570
You are suddenly moving into Hoseondang?

563
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:31,440
Actually...Prince Gyeongseong and I had a wedding last night.

564
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,880
Pardon?

565
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,310
Pardon? Why all of a sudden...

566
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,930
It just happened so.

567
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,100
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you, Bang Wool.

568
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,510
My Lady.

569
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,580
It is all right.

570
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,950
It is too late, but congratulations, My Lady.

571
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,140
I should call you Madam, not Lady now.

572
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,060
Madam? What are you talking about?

573
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,040
Mother and Father.

574
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,090
Without your approval,

575
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,910
we had a wedding, just the two of us.

576
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm sorry.

577
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,560
I'm now Prince Gyeongseong's wife.

578
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,480
Yes, I'm glad you did.

579
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,080
Goodness. You are so delicate.

580
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,110
How could you live alone in that huge house without a husband?

581
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:43,650
That's why I should keep the house company.

582
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,060
Don't worry, Father.

583
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,480
No, Sun Chaek. I will come with you.

584
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,990
Do not be like that, Your Excellency.

585
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,230
I will go with her.

586
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,520
You cannot. You cannot go alone.

587
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,020
Come on.
Let go.

588
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,170
What are you doing?

589
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,140
If you have decided,

590
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,450
get ready to move to Hoseondang.

591
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,990
I will bring my belongings. Wait here.

592
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,810
What are you doing, Your Excellency?

593
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,180
I will go with her.

594
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,280
Aigoo, Your Excellency.

595
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,890
There.

596
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,920
Your moving cart must be here already.

597
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,850
Let me check. Just one moment.

598
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,860
This is...

599
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,800
It's the enemy!

I can sense you where I am.

Everything ends when you reach the conclusion.
