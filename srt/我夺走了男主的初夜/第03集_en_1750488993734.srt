Ah Yeong, I need to tell you something.

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,000

152
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,440
I am sorry. Even if we did, I would not sell it.

154
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,960

What is it that you want?

156
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,730
A few days ago, I got scared by tigers

157
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,450

159
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,350

Beon has never treated me coldly.

163
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,220

171
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,660

ended up in the pharmacy,

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,630
As you said, I am not just a normal kid.

184
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,500
Are you on your way to play another trick?

185
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,510
I'm going to the village to find a way
to play tricks without getting caught.

186
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,600
Let us say hello happily
if we meet again, Ahjussi.

187
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,670
It was a spectacular night.

188
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,480
I cannot believe I fainted.

189
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,060
But how could I have not?

190
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,910
To live or to get married.

191
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,760
That is the question.

192
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,620
Can you not just get married?

193
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,090
What?

194
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,450
To be honest, I do not know why you try so hard.

195
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,490
You ran away, had a spending spree,
and even joined a temple.

196
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,950
You tried everything,

197
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,050
but Prince Gyeongseong does not mind.

198
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,900
He says it still has to be you.

199
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,870
It's... because that place doesn't belong to me.

200
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,130
It belongs to whoever takes it first.

201
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,710
There is no one entitled to it.

202
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,870
You can't go after someone else's man.

203
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,780
No matter how much you want him,

204
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,100
you can't go after someone else's man.

205
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,960
Are you feeling ill, My Lady?

206
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,370
I just remembered a bad memory.

207
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,040
P-Prince Gyeongseong?

208
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,100
I am glad you woke up.

209
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,620
Here.

210
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,490
What is this?

211
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,190
It is a medicinal herb.

212
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,630
But what is it for...

213
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,470
It apparently cures any illnesses.

214
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,950
Make sure to prepare it for her without skipping a day.

215
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,410
Yes, My Lord.

216
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,680
By chance, did you get hurt?

217
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,170
Are you worried about me?

218
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,940
No, it's not that.

219
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,510
You'd worry when even
a neighbor's dog got injured.

220
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,880
Everyone feels pain when they're hurt.

221
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,060
It might hurt more
if you don't get treated quickly.

222
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,150
You do not have to worry about that.

223
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,300
I am okay.

224
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,650
Oh...

225
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,360
the club Jung Su Gyeom started.

226
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,430
I will let you attend their meeting.

227
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,340
I thought you could use a little breather.

228
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,350
Did I hear him correctly?

229
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,080
He said you can attend the Seonmun Club meeting.

230
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,580
Did he not?

231
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,920
Did the sun rise from the west today?

232
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,020
What's gotten into that obsessive psycho?

233
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,390
How did he get this rare herb?

234
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,250
I understand this is rarer than wild ginseng.

235
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,130
Prince Gyeongseong must have gotten this after going through an ordeal.

236
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,060
gotten this after going through an ordeal.

237
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,080
You must take it and get rejuvenated, My Lady.

238
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,370
He got this medicinal herb for me?

239
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:36,580
I think this is truly... the love of the century.

240
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,690
Love?

241
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,210
I don't think I should get involved with him more.

242
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,930
Here.

243
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,400
To begin with, this doesn't belong to me.

244
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,360
Is it okay to take it?

245
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Beon, where have you been...

246
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,050
What happened to your face?

247
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,270
My Lady.
Oh, my gosh!

248
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,170
What are you thinking about so intently?

249
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,200
It's nothing. What is it?

250
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,180
It is a letter from Lady Eun Ae.

251
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,160
Lady Eun Ae?

252
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,890
Lady Sun Chaek, my sudden letter might have surprised you.

253
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,030
But since I wanted to get to know you,

254
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,420
I worked up my courage.

255
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,380
If you are free tomorrow,

256
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,560
I would love for you to come by

257
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,690
and try our shop's new dessert.

258
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,640
She wants me to come to her merchandise store?

259
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,200
No, no, no.

260
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,110
I'll do nothing from now on.

261
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,210
I will not worry about the male or female lead.

262
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,230
Of course, you can say no.

263
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,290
That will not bother me at all.

264
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,050
I was born an orphan

265
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,730
and I am nothing but
a merchant's adoptive daughter.

266
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,570
I have been doing fine on my own.

267
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,720
You haven't been doing fine alone.

268
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,570
What is her deal?

269
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,080
Bang Wool.
Yes?

270
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,840
I think I came up with a brilliant idea.

271
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,790
Will you really not tell me what happened?

272
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,240
Will anyone believe me if I did?

273
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,410
Just tell me first.

274
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,090
I will decide to believe it or not then.

275
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,510
If you will not believe me anyway,
I have no reason to tell you.

276
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,370
I wish I knew what this was about.

277
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,270
You really are so frustrating sometimes.

278
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,160
Frustrating?

279
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,910
You suddenly banned club meetings in Hanyang.

280
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,660
The youth have nowhere

281
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,350
to go or nothing to do in this desolate world.

282
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,010
I will make an exception... and allow that club meeting.

283
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,880
Was it the Jeongmun Club?

284
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,520
Do you mean it?

285
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,900
You certainly are my friend, Beon.

286
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,960
You still need to know the name
before you allow it.

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,440
It is the Seonmun Club.

288
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,160
The young men and women of Hanyang

289
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,070
gather to study the moon and stars

290
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,200
and talk about poetry and paintings.

291
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,750
But I have a request.

292
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,240
I need to join that club, too.

293
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,340
You, Beon?

294
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,570
With the prolonged drought, the people are impoverished.

295
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,180
I think we should open the grain storage and share with the ones in need.

296
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,910
Yes, Madam. I will participate.

297
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,050
We will also participate.

298
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,180
My family will give away 100 seok of white rice to set an example.

299
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,890
The rest of you can give what you can-

300
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,280
We will give away 150 seok this time.

301
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,110
150 seok?

302
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,910
You do not have to overdo it.

303
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,550
The thing is, our youngest son is getting married.

304
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,490
Another wedding?
Oh, my!

305
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,380
I want to share more to celebrate.

306
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,070
Your youngest was studying for the state exam.

307
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,340
He is already getting married?

308
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,790
Your eldest got married just a few months ago.

309
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,440
It just happened so.

310
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,150
I guess he wanted to get married
more than to pass the exam.

311
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,470
He wins first place in rushing into marriage.

312
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,070
Yes.

313
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,420
Madam Jeong.

314
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,100
Yes.
Congratulations on the wedding.

315
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,400
If you need help for the wedding, I will send you our servants.

316
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,940
Feel free to ask me anytime.

317
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,140
I appreciate the gesture alone.

318
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,720
Mother, did you have a nice gathering?

319
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,410
Yes.

320
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,710
We were debating the connection between cotton seeds and the Moon family in the room-

321
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,880
I will dismiss you now.

322
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,790
Take care, then.

323
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,360
You must want a daughter-in-law.

324
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,020
Of course I do.

325
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,530
They are old enough to marry.

326
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,370
But none of them seem interested.

327
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,930
Seeing them up close, they are all handsome and perfectly fine.

328
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,550
Why should you worry?

329
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,720
You became better at flattery.

330
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
They are not fine.

331
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,510
They cannot get married because they are not.

332
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,180
I worry the family bloodline
will end at this rate.

333
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,790
Well, I know someone who specializes in this.

334
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,600
Would you like to visit them?

335
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,660
Is Beon drunk?

336
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,400
Or did he really mean it?

337
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,670
Who are you?

338
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,140
Sir Su Gyeom, it is me.

339
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,170
Maiden, did you wait for me, by chance?

340
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,520
You must not be feeling well, though.

341
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,540
I am okay now.

342
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:17,140
Well, is your invitation to Seonmun Club still valid?

343
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,460
Seonmun Club is suddenly so popular.

344
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,800
Of course. You are welcome anytime.

345
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,610
I have a small request, by the way.

346
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,300
There's a friend I want to invite.

347
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,200
Can we join together?

348
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,760
It's Lady Cho Eun Ae.

349
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,450
The name sounds familiar.

350
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,710
That is your request?

351
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,590
Feel free to bring her.

352
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,630
Making requests must be a trend in Hanyang.

353
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,320
Pardon?

354
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,190
It is nothing. Seonmun Club was just approved.

355
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,320
I am planning to have a meeting tonight.

356
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,090
Did Prince Gyeongseong give that approval?

357
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,620
Yes.

358
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,830
Since we are on the topic-
Since we are on the topic-

359
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,560
How about we invite Prince Gyeongseong?
Can I invite Prince Gyeongseong?

360
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Prince Gyeongseong is coming?

361
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,430
Is it okay if he comes?

362
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,570
I knew it.

363
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,170
That's why he allowed it so willingly.

364
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,060
We're on the same page for once.

365
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,680
If you feel uncomfortable around him-

366
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,990
No, no.

367
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,590
Not uncomfortable at all.

368
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,260
He's coming, then. Right?

369
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,490
I suppose he is.

370
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,280
Any young people should be allowed.

371
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,450
We can't discriminate against those
with a bad temper.

372
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:42,100
Your kindhearted gesture is
so beautiful, Maiden Sun Chaek.

373
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,890
I understand.

374
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,020
I am tired today.

375
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,540
You can leave now.

376
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,310
Your Majesty,

377
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,800
In Pyeongan-do, snow and hail fell and frost fell until two months ago.

378
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,530
The seeds they sowed died and the fields dried out due to the recent drought.

379
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,940
They cannot even harvest wheat
and barley right now.

380
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,330
I am aware.

381
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,550
The people have been living off crops

382
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,740
and they are in danger now.

383
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,220
Ever since I took the throne,

384
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,590
natural disasters and crises have
been emerging every month

385
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,780
and we have had droughts and floods every year.

386
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,040
This is because of my lack of virtue.

387
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,900
Well...

388
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,120
do you agree with me, Chief State Minister?

389
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,880
It is not that, Your Majesty.

390
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Please establish the Ministry of Aid quickly and help the people-

391
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,620
Right State Minister, you have been looking upset.

392
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,040
What are you so unhappy about?

393
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,760
How could I be, Your Majesty?

394
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,940
You speak up, too.

395
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,910
Do you think my lack of virtue is to blame?

396
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:26,180
How can your humble subject judge Your Majesty?

397
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,020
Is not showing emotion your family's characteristic?

398
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,880
As expected of the Queen Mother's relative,

399
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,510
you are very skilled at avoiding trouble discreetly.

400
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,510
Your Majesty...
I heard enough.

401
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,850
You can leave now.

402
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,370
I am worried something might happen to you by upsetting His Majesty.

403
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,980
You said he has been sensitive due to his worsening of insomnia.

404
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,460
I still need to say what I need to say.

405
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,940
We cannot delay establishing the Relief Agency.

406
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,440
Prince Gyeongseong is the only one
His Majesty keeps close.

407
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,410
I am worried about the nation's security.

408
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,820
How could a single royal family member falter His Majesty's judgment?

409
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,030
Lower your voice.

410
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,590
If Prince Gyeongseong hears you, you do not know what he might do to you.

411
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,300
Yes, for the past 12 years, countless people were dragged out by Prince Gyeongseong.

412
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,380
Perhaps from now on, the hunting dog might go hunting himself.

413
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,170
If the dog goes crazy, it bites its owner.

414
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,470
Come on.

415
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,410
What are you saying?

416
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:56,200
All right, we need to stay alive in order to convince His Majesty again in the future.

417
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,290
Let us leave.

418
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,780
My Lady,

419
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,850
you clearly said you will not do
anything yesterday.

420
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,220
You saw it, too.

421
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,970
After reading Eun Ae's letter yesterday, ignoring it would be not right.

422
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,010
Bang Wool, you are colder than you seem, aren't you?

423
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,000
Yes, my hands and feet are cold by nature.

424
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,710
I am cold deep inside my bones, too.

425
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,530
My Lady.

426
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,570
You really came.

427
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,860
I feel like I am dreaming.

428
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,410
I have a friend now.

429
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,100
Please come inside now.

430
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,890
Hold on, Lady Eun Ae.

431
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,580
I want to do something with you to celebrate our becoming friends.

432
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,230
Do something together?

433
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,130
With me, do you mean?

434
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,540
Yes.

435
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,840
I do not know. I have no idea.

436
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,200
I thought he was out.

437
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,600
What do I do?

438
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,690
My Lord,

439
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,940
what is going on?

440
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,320
I have no idea.

441
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,990
What are you talking about?

442
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,500
Goodness...

443
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,870
I am not sure what to do.

444
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,160
My Lord, if you do not mind,

445
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,290
can I step in today?

446
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,550
Lady Eun Ae.

447
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,230
I am late, am I not?

448
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,780
I am sorry, My Lady.

449
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,730
You look so pretty today.

450
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,840
You asked me to look presentable.

451
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,070
You also... look pretty.

452
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,030
Gosh...

453
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,100
Eun Ae needs to shine today.

454
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,210
So, this is Seolhwajae.

455
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,930
The annex His Majesty built before the Princess got married.

456
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,020
The Princess also met her current husband and married him here, too.

457
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,650
The Seonmun Club meeting
is happening here tonight.

458
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,710
I hear there is a pond for boats over there.

459
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,090
I cannot believe I got to come here.

460
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,780
It is all thanks to you.

461
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,310
Thank you so much.

462
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,670
Don't thank me.

463
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm thankful that you joined me.

464
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,870
Why did I realize this now?

465
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,060
Instead of running away,

466
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,950
I just need to let Eun Ae and Yi Beon connect.

467
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,060
I'll ignite new sparks.

468
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,910
I'll do that myself.

469
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,360
Are you okay, My Lady?

470
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,310
Yes, of course. I'm fine.

471
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,610
He should be here by now.

472
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,670
Over here, My Lord.
Maiden Sun Chaek.

473
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,740
This is Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

474
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,130
Lady Cho Eun Ae.

475
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,660
And this is Sir Jung Su Gyeom,

476
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,130
an official of Hongmungwan.

477
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,000
I have often heard about you, Maiden Eun Ae.

478
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,410
I hear you do a lot of good things.

479
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,670
Nice to meet you.

480
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,980
People know me because of my father.

481
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,800
Thank you for allowing me to join Seonmun Club.

482
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,570
Allow?

483
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,070
Any romantic young men and women of Hanyang

484
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,240
are always welcome.

485
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,280
Please come inside.

486
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,740
Let's go.

487
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,960
You look beautiful.

488
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,140
Have you been well?

489
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,080
All right.

490
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,090
The night of Seonmun Club you have been waiting

491
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,640
is finally here!

492
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,250
Let me introduce the new members.

493
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,960
The daughter of the Chief State Minister,

494
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,400
Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

495
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,700
And Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's adopted daughter,

496
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,080
Maiden Cho Eun Ae.

497
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,450
A big round of applause, please.

498
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,700
Welcome!
Welcome!

499
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,350
Thank you for welcoming us.

500
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,970
I am in your care going forward.

501
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,010
Applause!

502
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,940
Is Prince Gyeongseong not here yet?

503
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,070
My heart.

504
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,470
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

505
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,780
Yes.

506
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,540
You two...

507
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,150
seem very close.

508
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,600
Beon, I was waiting for you.

509
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,300
It is the last newcomer of the Seonmun Club, Prince Gyeongseong.

510
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,620
I am sure he needs no introduction...

511
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,920
He is also a young man of Joseon.

512
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,110
How long will you keep holding hands?

513
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,400
I was worried Maiden Sun Chaek would faint again.

514
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,760
That is why I was holding her.

515
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,630
Is this an obvious plot where
he misunderstands and gets jealous?

516
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,700
It can't be.

517
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,800
Hello.

518
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,020
I am the third son of the Choi family of Hwasun-

519
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,970
Nothing is more useless than an introduction.

520
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,170
But I still need to know his name.

521
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,460
What is the point of learning his name?

522
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,430
By chance,

523
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,410
will you call each other's names sweetly and become close?

524
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,380
Not at all.

525
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,520
Why are you doing this here?

526
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,370
All right, all right.

527
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,190
Let us introduce each other later.

528
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,550
Since all three new members are here,

529
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,780
let us start the meeting now.

530
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,560
Shall we?

531
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,530
Shall we?

532
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,240
Yes!

533
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,490
Here are the sweets...

534
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,640
the new member, Maiden Cho Eun Ae, brought.

535
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,010
Let us taste them.

536
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,470
She prepared so much for the Seonmun Club.

537
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,670
Isn't Lady Eun Ae as beautiful
inside as she is outside?

538
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,690
I heard Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's
sweets are very famous.

539
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,430
This is my first time trying them.

540
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,130
You are too kind.

541
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,690
It is not much, but please enjoy.

542
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,970
When the moon reaches the top of the gazebo, I will start pouring drinks.

543
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,370
It is nice to drink,

544
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,060
but the warm tea and sweets will help you digest.

545
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,670
Did you know this?

546
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,270
I heard Lady Eun Ae brews
the best of the best tea.

547
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,910
Even the envoys from China line up.

548
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,830
This is why she is thought of
as the finest young lady of our time.

549
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,180
Step 1.

550
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,570
First impression is everything in high society.

551
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,720
Compliments don't just move whales. They move the high society.

552
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,100
Compliment attack.

553
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,920
You are too kind.

554
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,340
This tea's scent spreads over 100 ri... so it is called Baekrimun-

555
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,250
It also makes one confess.

556
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,020
How did you know?

557
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,620
I have never met anyone who knows that.

558
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,540
My gosh.

559
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,430
You already have so much in common.

560
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,170
I can't believe you two have never met before.

561
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,210
Is this what they mean by
"Finishing each other's sentences"?

562
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,900
I have heard a lot about you, Prince Gyeongseong.

563
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,270
You've heard of her, too.
Haven't you, Prince Gyeongseong?

564
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,280
This is my first time.

565
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,450
Of course.

566
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,340
Why would you have heard of my name?

567
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,920
Moving on to Step 2.

568
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,800
Sweetness heightens one's interest in another.

569
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,210
Sweetness attack.

570
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,930
Everyone,

571
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:50,670
Lady Eun Ae made these juak* from scratch.
(Sweet rice cake)

572
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,000
They smell so sweet.

573
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,700
Let's all try a bite.

574
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,390
Thank you.

575
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,120
So tasty.

576
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,400
Why aren't you eating, Prince Gyeongseong?

577
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,250
I am not craving them.

578
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,420
They're really delicious, I'm telling you.

579
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,170
If you don't eat one, you'll definitely regret it.

580
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,980
You do not have to force him...

581
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,390
It's tasty, right?

582
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,980
Isn't it the best?

583
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,500
Its taste dulls one's mind.

584
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,210
Dulls one's mind?

585
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,790
He means...

586
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,730
that's how tasty it is.

587
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,850
No, what I meant is-

588
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,310
Wow. Even a man like me finds them tasty.

589
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,950
I am sure they will sell well.

590
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,490
Gosh, that's exactly what I thought.

591
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,000
I thought so, too.

592
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,710
I will give you plenty more to take home, then.

593
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,550
Yes, thank you.

594
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,310
I do not need any.

595
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,220
Sweetness doesn't work with him.

596
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,290
He's as bitter as poison.

597
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,690
Let's move on to the next step.

598
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,220
Didn't you say there's a special event

599
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,450
for the new members tonight?

600
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,120
Yes, that is correct.

601
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,490
To celebrate three new members
joining the Seonmu Club,

602
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,660
I hid notes with poems written on them

603
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,970
all over Seolhwajae.

604
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,370
The one who finds one first
and finishes the poem...

605
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,210
will be awarded.

606
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,300
One of these notes...

607
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,720
have a gold ring inside it.

608
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,540
The one who finds it will keep it.

609
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,940
It is a real gold ring, right?

610
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,270
He said there is one. I will find it first.

611
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,660
Let us go, too. Let us.

612
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,650
You have until nine o'clock.

613
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,290
Find the hidden treasures, and we will regroup.

614
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,710
Gosh, I should go find the treasure.

615
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,490
Come with me, My Lady.

616
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,040
Okay.

617
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,670
Beon,

618
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,650
are you not going?

619
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,080
I do not need treasure.

620
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,910
Because recently,

621
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,830
I acquired the biggest treasure.

622
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,460
If you do not follow the rules,

623
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,920
I will F.R. you from the club as a leader.

624
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,220
F.R.?

625
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,440
Forcibly remove.

626
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,820
You will do that to me?
Why do you not go ahead and try me?

627
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,610
Where are the notes hidden, anyway?

628
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,760
It is too dark.

629
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,770
I think I heard it's in the garden toward

630
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,040
the end of the pond over there.

631
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,180
Let us go there together, then.

632
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,400
My stomach...

633
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,880
My lower stomach is churning.

634
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,850
Are you okay, My Lady?

635
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,760
I think I need to go to the outhouse.

636
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,740
I'll join you after I'm done.

637
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,040
Hurry before other people find it.

638
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,350
Hurry, hurry. Get going.

639
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,740
Go.

640
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,060
Go.

641
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,640
Where could it be?

642
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,330
Have you been to the garden over there?

643
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,250
Not yet.
Shall we go?

644
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,020
I already went there.

645
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,660
I didn't see anything there.

646
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,730
Is that so?

647
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,350
I only got dirt on my hands.

648
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,570
It was such a waste of time.

649
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,680
As I heard,

650
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,670
the book storage over there has a ton of notes.

651
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,540
I'm sharing this only with you.

652
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,820
Thank you, My Lady.

653
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,570
Let us go.

654
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,420
I barely managed to distract them.

655
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,890
You cannot cheat like that.

656
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,890
Gosh, Sir Su Gyeom.

657
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,950
You were there.

658
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,130
It's not that. I-
I was kidding.

659
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,090
It was a little awkward when

660
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,600
Prince Gyeongseong showed up earlier.

661
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,400
But thanks to you, things became lively.

662
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,370
I feel so relieved.

663
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,270
You accepted my suggestion to do a treasure hunt.

664
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:04,200
Just as the novel said,
you're sweet and sensitive-

665
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,070
Aigoo. N-Never mind.

666
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,380
The moment I met you,

667
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,390
I noticed how unique and fun you are.

668
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,530
Thanks to you, the members are
having fun like children.

669
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,860
It makes me feel happy.

670
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,480
On a night where young men
and women have gathered,

671
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,540
anything could happen, right?

672
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,230
Of course.

673
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,800
Looks like you are awaiting something more fun.

674
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,920
I will rest in the garden

675
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,950
until they find the treasures.

676
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,130
You can't.

677
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,150
Pardon?

678
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,350
You need to stay with me.

679
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,160
Is it not here, either?

680
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,210
Prince Gyeongseong.

681
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,730
Where are these petals coming from?

682
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,780
When Eun Ae enters the garden
and runs into Prince Gyeongseong,

683
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,180
scatter petals on them.

684
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,640
Why should I be doing this here?

685
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,130
Recreating the serendipitous first
encounter from the novel.

686
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,660
You two fell in love right at this moment.

687
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,200
All right. It's time to focus.

688
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,370
Ready, go.

689
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
How beautiful is this?

690
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,830
Petals make my nose itchy.

691
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:28,950
I hate it.

692
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,950
Oh, I see.

693
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,730
Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.

694
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,150
Pardon?

695
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,170
My name is not Do Hwa Seon.

696
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,970
My name is Cho Eun Ae.

697
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,530
Was it?

698
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,360
I was mistaken.

699
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,660
Why that name out of all names?

700
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,800
If my plan happens to go awry,

701
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,690
release that thing.

702
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,550
It's too shaky, Sir.

703
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,540
Could you stand straight?

704
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,440
I am fine, Maiden Sun Chaek.

705
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,510
Please relax as you look.

706
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,690
Things did go the way I wanted.

707
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,710
Why do I feel so melancholy?

708
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,930
I was avoiding a rat.

709
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,890
My apologies.

710
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,740
Of course, you should apologize.

711
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,640
You do not know how precious this sword is.

712
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,870
It is because I was caught off guard.

713
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,090
How much does it cost?

714
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,160
I will compensate you if it is damaged.

715
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,180
Compensate?

716
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,390
No money in this world can buy this sword.

717
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,010
I-I did not know.

718
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,030
My apologies.

719
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,910
You had better not.

720
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,850
If you knew,

721
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,190
you would not be alive now.

722
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,600
Sword?

723
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,780
I knew a noblewoman would come today.

724
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,250
What are you here to ask about?

725
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,460
Well...

726
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,350
these are my sons' fortune readings.

727
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,380
Would any of them get married this year?

728
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,690
It will not be easy!

729
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:45,240
Can even one of them get married?

730
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,260
You are not showing enough effort.

731
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,810
This is about finding the love of one's life.

732
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,310
You cannot expect it for free.

733
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,580
She is young, but all she wants is money.

734
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,810
Gosh, he is finally here.

735
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,810
Everything is okay now.

736
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,760
Okay.

737
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,480
Do not worry.

738
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,140
Your family will have a celebration soon.

739
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,700
Celebration?
There will be a wedding.

740
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,270
Is that true?

741
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,720
Would that be possible?

742
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,650
I am telling you.

743
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,510
Finally.

744
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,490
Finally, my Jang Ho...

745
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,520
My eldest son Jang Ho is finally...

746
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,960
I do not know who it will be yet.

747
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,070
But it is definitely just one of them.

748
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,980
Do not ask for more.

749
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,020
You will get hurt, then.

750
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,710
The flowers that look like azaleas

751
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:25,060
blossomed and turned red overnight.

752
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,520
Raise the glasses...

753
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,260
and face the bright moon.

754
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,130
Things seemed to be going well.

755
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,680
What happened in that nick of time?

756
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,970
Eun Ae dressed prettily today.

757
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,670
She's like a wet mouse now.

758
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,850
Hug the wine jar...

759
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,300
and face the fresh wind.

760
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,560
None of us here...

761
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,410
can get drunk on alcohol or poetry.

762
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,080
I think we should call it a night-

763
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,710
We can't!

764
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,070
No one can leave.

765
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,660
I did not come to this meeting

766
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,970
to let it end so unceremoniously.

767
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,530
I was going to save this one, but...

768
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,680
To be honest, I'm not a good poet.

769
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,630
But for our first meeting,

770
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,750
I'm thinking of showing off
another talent of mine.

771
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,850
Some of you might've heard about it.

772
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,400
I'm thinking of making cocktails.

773
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,140
She must have been a fish in her previous life.

774
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,110
Take the penalty drink.

775
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,350
Maiden Sun Chaek!

776
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,820
Forgive me just once.

777
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,900
If you were going to say no like this,

778
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,820
why did you ask me how to make cocktails?

779
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,140
I am so disappointed.

780
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,360
My goodness.

781
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,250
Okay, then.

782
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,660
Goodness.

783
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,210
Do you mind...

784
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,020
if I drink the penalty drink for you?

785
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,450
Lady Eun Ae?

786
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,180
I cannot let a woman drink something so strong...

787
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,610
Geez. Come on.

788
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,750
Can I not?

789
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,330
In the world of drinking games,

790
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,700
a substitute...

791
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,090
I mean, having a stand-in is allowed.

792
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,310
But Sir Su Gyeom later

793
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:29,720
has to grant Lady Eun Ae's wish.

794
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,810
I will tell you my wish later.

795
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,570
Okay.

796
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,210
Thank you, Maiden Eun Ae.

797
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,840
Lady Eun Ae, were you always a good drinker?

798
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:02,070
I am feeling thirsty and... craving alcohol tonight.

799
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,140
Did something bad happen?

800
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,540
I was wondering, too.

801
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,630
You look a bit upset.

802
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,010
It is nothing. I just...

803
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,510
feel kind of sad.

804
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,770
The female lead can't feel down.

805
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:25,170
Come to think of it, some couples start off by hating each other.

806
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,020
Let's lighten up the mood somehow.

807
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,970
Tonight, to your love and romance.

808
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,030
Cheers to your beautiful eyes.

809
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,780
Nuts to that.

810
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:58,620
I wondered why I was suddenly feeling hot.

811
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,280
Fire, fire, fire!

812
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,830

Hurry, hurry!

815

Hurry!

816
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:26,070
My bomb shots... became actual bombs.

817
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,040
Run away!

818
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,400
Fire! Fire!

819
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,130
Run! Get some water!

820
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,080

but I only ended up in a situation
