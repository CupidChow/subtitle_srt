1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,090
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,790
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,840
She received my letter and went out?

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,700
I looked everywhere,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,380
but she is not at Cheonggyecheon.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,380
I was away running an errand for Madam.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,930
Where am I?

8
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,540
[Episode 9: The ones who were hurt]

9
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,440
Your Excellency!
Aigoo, Aigoo.

10
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,640
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Is there no news yet?

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,430
No, not yet.

13
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,350
If something happens to Sun Chaek,

14
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,470
I will also leave this world immediately.

15
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,610
Please do not say that.

16
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,480
There is no time for this.

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,530
Release all the servants in the house

18
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,000
and you should also look where she might be.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,090
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Madam.

20
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,100
Let us go, Du Ho and Se Ho.

21
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,120
Aigoo, Sun Chaek...

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,540
I am sure she will return soon.

23
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,900
Gosh, Sun Chaek.

24
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,310
Let us go.

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,110
We are looking for the
Chief State Minister's daughter.

26
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,530
This way.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,070
Sun Chaek, where are you?

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,900
Have you... Have you seen Sun Chaek?

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,670
She is this tall and has a slender face.

30
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,090
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

31
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,950
Make sure to tell us if you see her.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,060
Sun Chaek!
Sun Chaek!

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,690
Sun Chaek!

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,830
Sun Chaek!
Sun Chaek!

35
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,480
My Lady! Lady Sun Chaek!

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,320
My Lady!

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,180
Lady Sun Chaek!

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,930
My Lady...

39
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,710
My Lady!

40
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,980
Look everywhere around here!

41
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,520
Yes, sir!

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,660
What on earth is going on?

43
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,350
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

44
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,560
Everyone is looking for her.

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,930
Did you hear, My Lady?

46
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,890
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

47
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,930
All hell broke loose.

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,150
Spare me.

49
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,810
Spare me! Spare me!

50
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,110
There is no use.

51
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,730
No one will hear you and come.

52
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,040
What do you want from me?

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Die very painfully.

54
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,300
That is what that person wants.

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,710
Damn it.

56
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,030
You crafty thing.

57
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,570
You'd better stop now.

58
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,600
For whose benefit?

59
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,030
You are hastening your death.

60
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,450
My life is already in someone else's hands.

61
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,420
Who ordered you to do this?

62
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,720
Someone very important desperately wants you gone.

63
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,050
No matter who they are,

64
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,340
Prince Gyeongseong will not forgive them.

65
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,420
I'm certain he will find me.

66
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,180
I suppose Prince Gyeongseong could.

67
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,270
But even if he got lucky and found you,

68
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,610
it will be after you're dead.

69
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Anything yet?
My apologies.

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,330
As you ordered, I released
all the soldiers to look for her.

71
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,010
Did you find the servant
who delivered the fake letter?

72
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,890
I ambushed their residence,

73
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,130
but they had already fled.

74
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,530
If there is no evidence,
we need to find witnesses.

75
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,520
Yes, My Lord.

76
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,540
Hold on!

77
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay, I'll die.

78
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
I'll die as you wish.

79
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,750
I'm too exhausted to go on as well.

80
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,900
What are you plotting?

81
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,650
I'm not plotting.

82
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,730
I want to end my life beautifully.

83
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,760
I don't want to be killed
gruesomely by a huge hammer.

84
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,060
I'm still the Chief State Minister's only daughter.

85
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,210
I want to have a beautiful death.

86
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,520
If I'll die anyway,

87
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,620
you can do that for me, at least.

88
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,190
So, how do you want to die?

89
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,560
Well,

90
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,750
so...

91
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,450
The way I want to die is...

92
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,060
You thought you could fool me, didn't you?

93
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,310
What is going on?

94
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,240
Maiden Sun Chaek disappeared?

95
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,700
Where did she disappear to?

96
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,460
Prince Gyeongseong sure is powerful.

97
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,820
Wow.

98
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,650
Because your fiancée went missing,

99
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,880
you brought chaos to the capital.

100
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,640
How touching your affection is for her.

101
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,480
Looks like you are about to hit me.

102
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,020
I could do something worse.

103
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,500
You kill other people easily like flies.

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,940
But I guess you cherish your fiancée's life.

105
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,340
You should not be doing this now.

106
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,750
I found a witness who reportedly
saw her at Cheonggyecheon.

107
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,850
Where is the witness now?

108
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,030
This way.

109
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,500
Let us go.

110
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,170
I am a ginseng digger.

111
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,820
While I was descending the mountains this way,

112
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,730
I think I saw an unfamiliar palanquin.

113
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,070
An unfamiliar palanquin?

114
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,520
When was that?

115
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,900
It was about an hour ago.

116
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,120
If so, they must be still around there.

117
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,450
You can forget about dying beautifully.

118
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,010
Don't kill him!

119
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,390
My Lady!

120
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,010
Maiden!

121
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,320
My Lady.
Maiden.

122
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,460
Are you okay, Maiden?

123
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,120
Are you okay, My Lady?

124
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,150
Oh, no. My Lady...

125
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,310
Please pull yourself together, My Lady.

126
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,760
Bring him to me.

127
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,330
Yes, sir.
My Lady.

128
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,390
Cha Sun Chaek.

129
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,500
This is not good.

130
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,940
My Lady.

131
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,040
Could it be...

132
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,590
It cannot be.

133
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,930
Sun Chaek!

134
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,300
This way. This way.

135
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,150
Gosh, what's happened?
Sun Chaek!

136
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,930
Oh, my gosh!

137
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,730
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

138
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,790
Should I bring a physician?

139
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,480
What on earth is going on here?

140
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,630
Her pulses are irregular due to shock,

141
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,970
but she seems to be deeply asleep.

142
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,220
All right.
My Sun Chaek.

143
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,430
Looks like she needs rest.

144
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,630
Let us leave now.

145
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
Let us leave.

146
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,830
Are you leaving now?

147
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,660
It is getting late. I will-
Please rest here tonight.

148
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,030
But first,

149
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,660
how about a drink with me?

150
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,040
You seem very uncomfortable.

151
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,770
I am not.

152
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,230
I do not think I could sleep tonight
because of all the trauma.

153
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,970
I need to drink first.

154
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,980
This is our family's inherited...

155
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,000
authentic mountain ginseng wine.

156
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:25,050
Thank you for letting Sun Chaek
return to me, My Lord.

157
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,210
Once you have a child, you will learn

158
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,860
how it feels to cherish
someone more than yourself.

159
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,350
If you outdrink me tonight,

160
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,750
I will allow you to marry Sun Chaek.

161
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,780
Do you think you can beat me?

162
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,660
Of course,

163
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,790
I will lose.

164
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,110
I suggested we drink because I wanted to lose.

165
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,980
You are slow to read the air.

166
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:19,420
Forget the wounds from the past with this wine.

167
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,320
The hurtful words I said to you in the past

168
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,320
were said by the father, Cha Ho Yeol,
not the Minister, Cha Ho Yeol.

169
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,540
If you had a daughter like Sun Chaek,

170
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,040
you will soon understand how I feel.

171
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,470
She is in your care from now on.

172
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,410
You kept your promise to...

173
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,310
protect Sun Chaek for me.

174
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,220
Please always protect her like you did today.

175
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,590
I will...

176
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,430
keep that promise even when I am dead.

177
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,000
Then, let us drink...

178
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,440
the real mountain ginseng wine.

179
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,620
Who told you to do this?

180
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,410
Spilling it now would be better for your sake.

181
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,080
It must mean there are that many people
who want you to see your blood.

182
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,800
Did you receive the letter I sent?

183
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,580
I cannot believe that he's being exiled.

184
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,900
I know.

185
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,090
I feel so sorry for him.

186
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,270
He is left alone. All alone.

187
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,850
The remaining ones need to go on.

188
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,680
What can you do...

189
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,960
Cha Sun Chaek!

190
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,690
Prince Gyeongseong...

191
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Cha Sun Chaek!

192
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,100
You're breaking out in cold sweats.

193
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,540
Did you have a nightmare?

194
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,010
Why are you doing this first thing in the morning?

195
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,180
I thought I had lost you again.

196
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,190
Because I've been through so much,

197
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,540
I pretty much got used to it.

198
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,970
It is all my fault.

199
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,390
How is it your fault?

200
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,330
I worry my enemies would threaten you

201
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,230
and my misfortune would affect you.

202
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,910
For the first time, I wondered...

203
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,730
if my love for you might be too selfish.

204
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Prince Gyeongseong, why did you get so weak?

205
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,560
Once you love someone,

206
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,380
you share happiness and sadness together.

207
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,000
If I could alleviate your misfortune,

208
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,500
it would make me happy.

209
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,630
And if we end up sharing the misfortune,

210
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,740
my good fortune will reach you as well.

211
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,610
Chief State Minister... I mean...

212
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,140
Father-in-law gave us his approval.

213
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,100
Really?

214
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,720
You did it, Prince Gyeongseong.

215
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,610
See? What did I tell you?

216
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,250
Please have faith in your lucky charm,

217
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,740
Cha Sun Chaek, in the future, too.

218
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,370
I thought I lost this.

219
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,870
It reconnected us as the name suggested.

220
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,410
I will never lose it again.

221
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,940
Seeing what I read about in the novel

222
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,220
in person made me feel afraid.

223
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,840
Don't kill him!

224
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,140
But...

225
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,890
I don't want Prince Gyeongseong
to kill any more people.

226
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,920
Even if it is to protect me,

227
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,040
it can't happen.

228
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,400
It was chaotic last night.

229
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,390
The Do family did that?

230
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,220
Probably Lady Do Hwa Seon, to be exact.

231
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,270
Yes, who else in the capital would do that?

232
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,470
Lady Do loved Prince Gyeongseong.

233
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,340
Yes, she is more than capable.

234
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,830
I think people are talking about me.

235
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,440
I kidnapped Chae Sun Chaek?

236
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,520
They blame me whenever something happens to her.

237
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,000
Did you do it?

238
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
F-Father.

239
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,620
I asked if you did it.

240
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,960
No, Father.

241
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,300
Who was it, then?

242
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Why would you ask me that?

243
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,430
It was not me.

244
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,030
Are you deceiving me now?

245
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,180
I am innocent.

246
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,700
It sounded like...

247
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,510
something I could have done, but...

248
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,590
What?

249
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,860
I am just saying that. It really
was not me this time.

250
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,620
You are mistaken.

251
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,730
Stay at a temple for now.

252
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,590
Pardon?
Be away until things quiet down.

253
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,270
I am saying it was not me.

254
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,170
I can only tolerate you so much.
Do you understand?

255
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,260
He has not spoken a word yet.

256
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,190
They copied my handwriting.
[Come to Cheonggyecheon...]

257
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,410
They are really something.

258
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,700
Who was it?

259
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,380
If you confess, I will let you live.

260
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,240
I promise.

261
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
My Lord said he will let you live.

262
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,370
Confess and save your life, you bastard!

263
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,980
If you miss your chance to confess,

264
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,920
you will experience the worst pain possible.

265
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,090
Sir.

266
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,630
Maiden.

267
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,050
Did you come to see me today again?

268
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,900
The capital was in shambles last night.

269
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,410
You mean about Lady Sun Chaek?

270
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,150
Did you hear, too?

271
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,630
Of course.

272
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,340
What on earth is going on?

273
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,360
She is not seriously injured, is she?

274
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,820
I heard about her, and I could not
sleep because I was worried.

275
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,480
Who would do something so evil?

276
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,970
Did they catch the culprit?

277
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,200
The culprit...

278
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,210
was caught on scene.

279
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,630
Prince Gyeongseong captured the culprit

280
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,520
and is trying to find out who was behind it.

281
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,700
That is such a relief.

282
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,260
Did they happen to find out who was behind it?

283
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,060
They are suspecting someone,

284
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,200
however, they have not yet
caught the real culprit.

285
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,320
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong...

286
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,900
will find out.

287
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,090
Do you have something to say to me

288
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,400
No, I do not.

289
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,130
I hope I did not interrupt you
while you were busy.

290
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,480
Not at all.

291
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,950
I will put everything on hold at the store today

292
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,300
and visit Lady Sun Chaek with tea and snacks.

293
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,910
Maiden Sun Chaek?

294
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,730
Yes.

295
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,140
I would like to comfort her.

296
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,880
Would you like to come with me?

297
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,510
I will bring snacks for Lady Sun Chaek.

298
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,830
Please wait here for a moment.

299
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,320
I brewed this tea myself.

300
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,640
I will enjoy it.

301
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,040
Take your time preparing.

302
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,180
This is how Maiden Eun Ae is.

303
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,480
What am I imagining?

304
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,140
So, this is where Maiden Eun Ae works.

305
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,710
As expected of Maiden Eun Ae, it is subtle, clean,

306
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,900
and understated-

307
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,310
Sir, I am ready to go-

308
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,960
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

309
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,490
Someone copied my handwriting very well.

310
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,740
They must know me very well.

311
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,170
Who could it be?

312
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,520
This is a special paper...

313
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,110
that was created by dehydration
and mixed with other materials.

314
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,980
People who would do something like this

315
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,360
must be no other than the Heuksa Clan.

316
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,920
This is different than their usual behavior.

317
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,840
I need to find out where
this paper was first distributed.

318
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,610
What do we do, My Lady...
I hope she recovers quickly.

319
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,010
What happened?
She needs to eat something.

320
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,940
We do not know what would happen.

321
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,590
Her symptoms say she is weak
and has poor blood circulation.

322
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,630
She must rest for now.

323
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,550
She also must take the medicine without fail.

324
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,330
Yes.

325
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,300
Thank you.

326
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,140
Thank you.

327
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,200
I will see him off. You stay here.

328
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,500
My Lady, Lady Eun Ae is here.

329
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,040
My Lady.

330
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,160
Lady Eun Ae.

331
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,250
You are okay.

332
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,590
You are not injured, are you?

333
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,520
Can't believe you were kidnapped.

334
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,020
I was so shocked that I could not sleep.

335
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,270
Thank you for worrying.

336
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,340
I will do my best to protect you from now on.

337
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,810
I brought you tea that will help you relax.

338
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,030
Brew the tea.

339
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,420
Pardon?

340
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,880
Oh, yes.

341
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,740
My Lady, your wound...

342
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,100
Hold on.

343
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,380
I brought you an ointment for wounds.

344
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,630
Do not fall for me too much.

345
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:55,940
By the way, what happened to the culprit?

346
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,750
Prince Gyeongseong captured him,

347
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,920
but I don't know what happened afterward.

348
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,900
Maybe someone was behind it.

349
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,980
The rumor already spread in the market.

350
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,170
Someone who could plan such a thing

351
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,260
has to be only one person.

352
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,700
Do you mean Do Hwa Seon?

353
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,500
Yes. Make sure she cannot
get away with it this time.

354
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,450
How about you report to the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

355
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,950
I have Prince Gyeongseong, who is scarier
than the Royal Investigation Bureau.

356
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,070
By the way,

357
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,240
you look angrier than I am.

358
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,110
Because I consider your business as mine.

359
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,100
The special paper you mentioned
is manufactured in only one place.

360
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,420
Let me ask you something.

361
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,990
The special paper...

362
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,810
was sent to China as a tribute last year.

363
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:11,150
Since then, we no longer produce it.

364
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,770
Is that so?

365
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,640
It seems many people are
looking for it these days.

366
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,950
Did someone else look for it?

367
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,790
People from the biggest merchandise
store in Hanyang came recently.

368
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,340
Do you mean Cho Byeong Mu's Merchandise Store?

369
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,690
Someone who used to work at that store

370
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,990
worked here at the Paper Production Agency.

371
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,700
He had tons of special paper in his room.

372
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,020
Cho's Merchandise Store bought all of it.

373
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,470
Cho's Merchandise Store?

374
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,010
My Lord.

375
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,090
You have been summoned to the Palace immediately.

376
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,640
Thank you.

377
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,820
I have not yet been acknowledged by China.

378
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,670
What do you think the reason is?

379
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,330
I do not know how to say this, but...

380
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,090
It is okay.

381
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,640
Tell me.

382
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,620
Everything in the world is
about trade, Your Majesty.

383
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,510
Trade?

384
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,540
The Emperor is not interested
in this country at all.

385
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,620
You cannot get what you want from
someone who is not interested.

386
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,130
I think a bait that could interest him is needed.

387
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,390
If you are uncomfortable-
No.

388
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,810
It's okay.

389
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,050
No one has ever told me anything like this before.

390
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,480
Securing people's support comes first.

391
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
Our relationship with China is important,

392
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
but securing people's support comes first.

393
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,300
They only said something so obvious.

394
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,570
The people's support is not tangible.

395
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,480
It is easily swept away in the wind.

396
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,400
If a major path is determined,

397
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,070
everyone will end up following it.

398
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,430
It sounds like you have a good solution.

399
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,640
So, did you mention a bait earlier?

400
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,110
If you will allow me to do so,

401
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,970
I will help you set the foundation.

402
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,320
Did you rescue your fiancée successfully?

403
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,990
Why do you glare at me like that?

404
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,490
You are acting as if I hurt your fiancée.

405
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,360
Your Majesty,

406
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,100
Prince Gyeongseong is here.

407
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,940
Let him in.

408
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,430
I heard there was a huge ruckus last night.

409
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,740
You summoned all soldiers in the capital?

410
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,280
My apologies, Your Majesty.

411
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,180
Was it related to the Heuksa Clan?

412
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,520
Or...

413
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,570
did you summon the army to find your fiancée?

414
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,020
I do not have any excuses to make.

415
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,760
I did give you the right to use the military force,

416
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,090
but you used my soldiers for personal use.

417
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,150
Do you consider yourself the king by chance?

418
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,210
That is not the case at all.

419
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,850
The old sayings are never wrong.

420
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,630
They say you cannot see right under your nose.

421
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,720
I did not know a traitor would be right by my side.

422
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,740
My loyalty to Your Majesty remains unchanged.

423
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,450
Please listen to my plea.

424
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,620
I will gladly accept any punishment.

425
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,750
You will gladly accept any punishment?

426
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,020
No matter what it might be?

427
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,660
S-Spare him.

428
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,880
I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.

429
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,890
No matter what that might be?

430
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,880
Can you swing that sword for me?

431
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,710
This is my hit list.

432
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,870
Your unchanging loyalty.

433
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,550
Go ahead and prove it.

434
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,780
If you leave now, you will arrive
tomorrow morning.

435
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,910
Take care of it now.

436
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,550
I did not say anything.

437
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,470
Do not worry.

438
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,500
I will make sure...

439
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,070
to succeed next time.

440
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,450
You are in bad shape.

441
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,100
Take this.

442
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,050
I...

443
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,200
do not need more money.

444
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,600
You have been so generous to a servant like me.

445
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,940
I did it to return the favor.

446
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,180
But still, take it.

447
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,030
You need to run away in order
to plan for the next time.

448
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:40,090
I knew you cared about people like me.

449
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,050
People might show up here soon. Run now.

450
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,530
I would be able to see you again, right?

451
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,760
As long as we stay alive,

452
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,780
I am sure we will meet again.

453
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,000
I was able to come this far on my own.

454
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
Actually, she is supposedly his daughter,

455
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,210
but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.

456
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,260
Oh, my.

457
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,080
Of course, you dislike me, too.

458
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,120
I am sorry. I should have known better.

459
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,810
I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.

460
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,790
Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.

461
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,500
My name is not Do Hwa Seon.

462
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,470
My name is Cho Eun Ae.

463
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,480
Lady Eun Ae?

464
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,330
Wasn't she at the plague village?

465
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,840
M-My Lady.

466
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,970
Nothing is predetermined in this world.

467
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:07,090
Your Highness.
Keep massaging her.

468
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,490
Your Highness. Your Highness.

469
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,260
Everything went wrong because
of you, Cha Sun Chaek.

470
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,730
Buying a fake nobility note

471
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,460
cannot change one's fate, I suppose.

472
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,890
Fate changes.

473
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,520
An abandoned orphan on the streets

474
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,240
grew a successful store and
even became a noblewoman.

475
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,270
I cannot be satisfied now.

476
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,800
I will get rid of anyone who gets in my way.

477
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,830
You could not even do that properly.

478
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,700
Pathetic bastard.

479
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,930
My goodness.

480
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,630
Did I see something I was not supposed to?

481
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,490
You are...

482
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,300
It was a good try,

483
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,190
but you are still clumsy.

484
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,530
You missed the vital spot.

485
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,620
Should I finish him off for you?

486
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,160
Do not worry.

487
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,020
I will keep this a secret.

488
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,990
What do you want from me?

489
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:12,310
Similar people recognize each other.

490
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,140
Perhaps we share the same goal.

491
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,810
You want to change the world, too.

492
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,860
What are you talking about?

493
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,250
No need to try to act in front of me.

494
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,880
If you are quick,

495
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,750
you must have understood me immediately.

496
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,100
Let us not waste each other's time.

497
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,800
Would you like to work with me?

498
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,470
Mother.

499
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,490
How is this one?

500
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,970
Yes, that is nice.

501
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,420
Nice.

502
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,000
How pretty.

503
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,170
Mother, what is that?

504
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,810
We can let the servants do other things,

505
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,490
but I wanted to embroider
the newlyweds' bedding myself.

506
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,000
Why have you been hiding a talent like this?

507
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,770
I had no opportunity to use my talent.

508
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:39,640
Your grandmother used to
do embroidery herself as well.

509
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,020
I guess she wanted you to
live happily ever after.

510
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,160
You must have become happier
after getting married.

511
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,280
Getting married does not always bring happiness.

512
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,840
Pardon?
Marriage means...

513
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,310
going through things with
your spouse and your children

514
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,640
and creating the new future

515
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,560
while facing hardships from time to time.

516
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,150
Happiness follows in the process.

517
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,350
Nothing is predetermined.

518
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,270
Then, the process of

519
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,550
putting the efforts with Prince Gyeongseong
must be important.

520
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,550
I want to make Prince Gyeongseong happy.

521
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,550
What should I do?

522
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,910
You are so determined, Sun Chaek.

523
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:28,480
You could finish the bridal training quickly, too.

524
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,470
Bridal training?

525
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,260
So you could survive better
than anyone after getting married,

526
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,670
I'll share my tips with you thoroughly.

527
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,500
Brace yourself.

528
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,710
Mother...

529
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,650
There is something I would
like you to do beforehand.

530
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,790
What is it?

531
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,150
Is there a reason you are revisiting the past?

532
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,980
He was the former king's favorite prime minister.

533
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:20,670
He is apparently more respected
than the local governor there.

534
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,590
It is time to get rid of the
source of future troubles.

535
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,560
Who are you?

536
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,050
Is it His Majesty's order?

537
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,450
Will His Majesty's bloodbath start again?

538
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,590
I am just someone who follows the King's order.

539
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,520
I will die as he wishes.

540
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,650
Just give me some time, Prince Gyeongseong.

541
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,720
You know that I cannot do that.

542
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,790
Tomorrow is my youngest daughter's wedding day.

543
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,910
I cannot let her have her father's
funeral before a celebration.

544
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,810
I beg you.

545
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,070
So, this is the place.

546
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,960
Before weddings, my parents always

547
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,090
visited the temple to pray.

548
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:40,560
Offer a devout prayer for a good
marriage to Prince Gyeongseong.

549
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,480
My Lady,

550
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,580
while you are praying,

551
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,530
I will run an errand for Madam quickly.

552
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,710
Sure.

553
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,500
Yes.

554
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,210
Think of it as a Templestay.

555
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,450
Prince Seonghyeon?

556
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,210
Why is he standing there getting all wet?

557
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,740
What are you doing here?

558
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,980
You'll catch a cold. Come this way.

559
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,230
Hurry.

560
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,700
See? You already caught a cold.

561
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,440
Why were you foolishly standing in the rain?

562
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,610
Standing in the rain...

563
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,150
makes it feel like old wounds
are getting washed away.

564
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,120
Wounds?

565
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,370
When I left Hanyang, I had my parents'

566
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,850
memorial service at this temple.

567
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,080
I was greeting them after being away for 10 years.

568
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,270
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

569
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,540
It is okay.

570
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,150
You make me feel less lonely.

571
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,310
Are you sure you're okay?

572
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,530
Being here reminds me of that day.

573
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,790
That day?

574
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,660
You fell in the study
at our house, and I saved you.

575
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,030
We ended up falling together, and you got injured.

576
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,590
Where did you get hurt back then?

577
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,150
Was it m-my head?

578
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,740
No, was it my leg?

579
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,910
Are you really Sun Chaek?

580
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,120
It was too long ago.

581
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:34,270
Looking at your puzzled look, you are Sun Chaek.

582
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,610
I was joking. I was joking.

583
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,920
Goodness...

584
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,760
What are you doing?

585
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,640
I would like to take a short nap.

586
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,880
I have not been able to sleep for three days.

587
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,500
It will only take a moment.

588
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,850
Just until it stops raining.

589
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,740
Cha Sun Chaek and Yi Gyu must've
been closer than I thought.

590
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,130
What do I do?

591
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,340
Are you awake?

592
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,230
Look at this.

593
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,610
It's a puppy.

594
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,350
So cute.

595
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,710
Where did you come from?

596
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,780
He was lost and totally wet.

597
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,800
I found him nearby.

598
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,520
What do we do? I think he lost his mom.

599
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,730
I think I will have to keep you.

600
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,700
I cannot bring myself to leave you behind.

601
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,860
Could you give him a name?

602
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,080
Me?
Yes.

603
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,750
Is it a person? A person is dead?
A person is dead.

604
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,280
How did he end up dying?

605
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,660
What's going on?
I wonder.

606
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,980
What's that?
Let us check it out.

607
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,780
My goodness! Look.

608
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,260
You should not have seen that.

609
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,120
It is okay.

610
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,180
It is okay.

611
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,670
What are you doing right now?

612
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,020
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

613
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,790
There is...

614
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:15,820
There is the body of my kidnapper.

615
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,330
It is okay.

616
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,330
I am here now.

617
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,070
This country obviously has the Ministry of Justice.

618
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,950
If one condemns another personally,

619
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,380
what would be the use of the law?

620
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,750
Sun Chaek looks very shocked.

621
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,490
Provide comfort for her.

622
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,430
I am all right.

623
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,640
Thank you.

624
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,720
Prince Gyeongseong.

625
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,920
What Prince Seonghyeon said earlier...

626
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,050
Prince Seonghyeon, Yi Gyu...

627
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:16,200
You cannot be close to him, no matter what.

628
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,680
He holds a grudge against me.

629
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,510
What kind of grudge?

630
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,580
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

631
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,950
What does that mean?

632
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,020
It means I don't want you to kill people.

633
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,650
By chance,

634
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,520
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

635
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,890
Correct me if I'm wrong.

636
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,270
Do you not trust me?
