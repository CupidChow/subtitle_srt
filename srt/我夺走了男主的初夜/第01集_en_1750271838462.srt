00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,950
You told me we had to prepare for it.

183
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,520
Anyway, we need to start getting ready now.

184
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,980
My Sun Chaek.

185
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,470
You are representing the Cha family of Yeonan.

186
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,760
Make sure you look the best in Hanyang.

187
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,630
Do not skimp.

188
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,880
Make sure to spend all of it.

189
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,250
It is your father's order.

190
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,220
If that is your order,

191
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,800
I should follow it, Father.

192
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,120
Yes.

193
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,000
Someone gets me dolled up,

194
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,320
dresses me,

195
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,480
and makes me shine.

196
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,420
This is the life of a side character?

197
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,400
Daebak.

198
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,360
I can't believe I'm in a fictional world.

199
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,160
What happens if I can't get out of here?

200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,930
I'd be grateful, then.

201
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,730
Why would I leave this world?

202
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,880
The smell of money is always so fragrant.

203
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,970
And I'm in my favorite novel?

204
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,430
This is better than winning the lottery.

205
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,720
I'm in the novel. Hooray!

206
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,550
What father scolds you for not spending money?

207
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,420
It's nice to be the Chief State
Minister's daughter.

208
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,000
So, what if I'm in someone else's body?

209
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,420
This is a dream, but I won't wake up.

210
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,370
Dahong Club and the full moon are tonight.

211
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,630
I'm still at the beginning of the book.

212
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,110
It's when the characters start crossing paths.

213
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,770
My Lady.

214
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,520
This way.
Oh, okay.

215
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,530
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

216
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,260
Welcome, My Lady.

217
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,750
Yes.

218
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,360
My Lady.

219
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,730
Look at these colors.

220
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,490
They must be angel's clothes.

221
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,580
Is this better? Or is this better?

222
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,020
I like both.

223
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,460
The clothes I'm wearing are made of silk, too.

224
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,990
Since you like pure silk...

225
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,980
Pure silk?

226
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,920
Silk made of pure silk yarn.

227
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,740
Because you kept talking about it,

228
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,690
they got it all the way from China in three months.

229
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,650
Did I do that?

230
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,570
Should we go with this, then?

231
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,710
Since you only wear top-quality clothes,

232
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,300
you have exceptional taste.

233
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,380
My Lady, since His Excellency gave us plenty of money,

234
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,930
how about we get both?

235
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,390
Should we?

236
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,060
No one else can buy these but you.

237
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,960
Hold on a moment.

238
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,020
I think that dress will look better on me.

239
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,720
Let me have it this time.

240
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,790
You came, Lady Hwa Seon.

241
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,490
Hwa Seon?

242
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,530
Do Hwa Seon, by chance?

243
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,630
Do Hwa Seon, the Right State
Minister's third daughter.

244
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,110
As her name implies, she starts
all conflicts and incidents.

245
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,930
She's wicked.

246
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,950
I heard someone ordered a summer
garment made from this silk.

247
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,910
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong did.

248
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,880
I should wear this dress, then.

249
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,860
We would look like a beautiful couple.

250
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,170
But Sun Cheok ordered this first-

251
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,770
A-Are you okay?

252
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,920
How dare a lowly man jump into our conversation?

253
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,660
M-My apologies.

254
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,980
Lady, they act up if you treat them nicely.

255
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,010
Make them learn their place.

256
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,380
Seeing her in person like this is even more infuriating.

257
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,570
Do you want to tell me something, by chance?

258
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,910
My Lady.

259
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,700
Excuse me,

260
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,930
those clothes...

261
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,170
Hwa Seon, you-
Hwa Seon?

262
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,500
Lady Hwa Seon, you can...

263
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,950
just have it.

264
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,860
You are the Chief State Minister's daughter.

265
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,520
Assert dominance.

266
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,390
Main skills. Arson and kidnapping.

267
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,880
Mastered poisoning and murdering as a hobby.

268
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,070
Getting involved with a notorious villain

269
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,100
would make my life tiring.

270
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,910
Do you mean it?

271
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,630
Of course.
My Lady.

272
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,170
What has gotten into you?

273
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,350
You always get top-quality silk.

274
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,410
But you are letting me have this?

275
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,690
I wonder if you are plotting something. I am so scared.

276
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,880
I find you scarier.

277
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,220
Please take those clothes and leave.

278
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,020
If you matched with Prince Gyeongseong,

279
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,600
you would look so beautiful as a couple.

280
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,740
Of course, I should let you have it.

281
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,050
If you insist,

282
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,640
I will not say no.

283
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,770
I will leave now, then.

284
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,600
Hold on.

285
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,630
What is it now?

286
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,430
Since you let me have the clothes,

287
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,300
I would like to treat you to a tea.

288
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,010
You will not reject my kind offer, will you?

289
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,060
I am not rejecting it.

290
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,610
Okay.

291
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,640
Send the dress to our house.

292
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,290
Okay, got it.

293
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,950
Let us go.

294
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,350
My Lady,

295
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,860
thank you for letting us host
a Dahong Club meeting tonight.

296
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,460
I am a bit busy.

297
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,980
Acting all pitiful...

298
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,090
Let us drink tea next time since I am upset.

299
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,050
Who is she, by the way?

300
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,540
Do you dislike her?

301
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,920
Yes, I do. Very much.

302
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,840
She is a depressing orphan.

303
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,680
How dare she try to join the Dahong Club?

304
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,820
Even her name sounds fake.

305
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,130
It's Cho Eun Ae* or whatever.
(Means, "good kid")

306
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,230
Cho Eun Ae?

307
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,900
She was born as an orphan

308
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,810
and adopted by the wealthiest merchant
in Joseon by coincidence.

309
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,400
Serendipitously, she falls in love
with Prince Gyeongseong,

310
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,660
Yi Beon, regardless of the class difference.

311
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,070
I get to see my favorite, Eun Ae, in person.

312
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,590
Let us work together...

313
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,810
and make sure she cannot come near here.

314
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,050
Let us teach her a lesson...

315
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,300
tonight.

316
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,680
Tonight?

317
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,990
The teahouse owned by her father, Cho Byeong Mo,

318
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,970
will be in charge of the hosting
of the Dahong Club.

319
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,250
They are using money to mingle with the nobility.

320
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,520
I am planning to discipline her properly.

321
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,920
Do you agree with me, Lady Sun Chaek?

322
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,370
Gosh, look at this.

323
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,020
Are your brothers doing well?

324
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,060
Thank you.
I hope this is enough.

325
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,040
Thank you.

326
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
Now that I've met her, I get why

327
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,410
Eun Ae is the female lead.

328
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,180
She's been through endless hardship since birth,

329
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,510
but endless coincidences and destined timing

330
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,720
that turn crises into opportunities.

331
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,460
She even has a devastating quality that draws people in.

332
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,990
She's the perfect female lead.

333
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,950
On the other hand, Cha Sun Chaek

334
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,140
has a high status, endless money, and a happy family.

335
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,270
She's not lacking in any sense.

336
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,810
The observer with a privilege.

337
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,130
I just need to observe this fun story, right?

338
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,600
This is amazing.

339
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,000
What's this?

340
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,390
I feel something.

341
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,170
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

342
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,340
I knew it. It's Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong.

343
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,140
He's way more handsome than I thought.

344
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,180
Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong...

345
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,440
He volunteered to be the
hunting dog of the royal family.

346
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,360
He's a monster.

347
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,440
He shows no blood or tear.

348
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,820
He's the male lead of this world.

349
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,920
Why can I not raise my head?

350
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,620
If you make eye contact with Prince Gyeongseong,

351
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,050
something terrible might happen to you.

352
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,860
During the royal banquet,

353
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,200
a hair was found in his food.

354
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,100
We deserve to die!

355
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,930
He apparently cut all the hair off

356
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,610
the kitchen staff's heads.

357
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,270
A servant scratched his hand slightly
while dressing him up.

358
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,500
Your Highness!

359
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,850
Spare me. Spare me...

360
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,470
He pulled out her fingernails and toenails.

361
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,420
Someone who got caught chatting
during the rainmaking ceremony

362
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,670
got all of their teeth pulled out.

363
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,370
That is not all.

364
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,070
The women who spent a night with him

365
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,460
were forced to become Buddhist nuns the day after.

366
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,610
So, they had to join the temple by force.

367
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,060
There is no need to fear.

368
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,450
Here.

369
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,190
It is best to believe what you see
rather than listen to rumors.

370
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,500
Who are you?

371
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,080
The supporting male character,
the official of Hongmungwan.

372
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,750
Jung Su Gyeom.

373
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,450
He's sweet, proper,

374
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,050
and he's even intelligent.

375
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,640
He's the prime example
of a supporting character,

376
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,950
and the only friend of Yi Beon,
Prince Gyeongseong.

377
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,480
Look, Beon. Wait for me.

378
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,620
Beon,

379
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,320
did you find out who that man was?

380
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,710
Your face tells me you have not caught him.

381
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,320
I can tell by just looking at your eyes.

382
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,860
I told you not to call me that.

383
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,630
Come on, Beon. My Beon.

384
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,130
It is just between us.

385
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,090
I think I-

386
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,720
Prince Gyeongseong...

387
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,180
The love quadrangle is even
more intense in person.

388
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,630
If tonight is the full moon,

389
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,660
Eun Ae and Yi Beon's encounter has not happened yet.

390
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,570
Do I just need to wait
for the highlight of the night?

391
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,190
Where can I get popcorn?

392
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,470
Explosion!

393
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,640
This is the best spot to watch.

394
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,660
A masterpiece is still fun,
even when you know the ending.

395
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,680
Move!

396
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,540
Move!
Move!

397
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,390
Passing by. Move.

398
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,480
Move!
Move!

399
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,690
Gosh, I can't believe I'm going
to a Dahong Club meeting.

400
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,530
It's too exciting.

401
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,060
No.

402
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,540
It's exciting and nerve-wracking, but I can't show it.

403
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,040
In this type of genre, a side character

404
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,620
can get wrongly involved and twist the story.

405
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,980
Know your place for everyone's sake.

406
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,490
Know your place.

407
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,440
Cook it all the way.
Yes, My Lady.

408
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,460
Nothing can be lacking.

409
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,530
We need to prepare with
a lot more care than usual.

410
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,060
Yes, My Lady.

411
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,570
Gosh, no way.

412
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,240
It reminds me of your eyes.

413
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,740
So pretty.

414
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,690
Lady Hwa Seon,

415
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,840
I cannot look at you tonight.

416
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,260
You are too radiant tonight.

417
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,630
I know.

418
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:31,260
Lady Hwa Seon sure is the greatest beauty of Hanyang.

419
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,850
Do you not agree?

420
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,300
Oh, yes. You are right.

421
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,260
She is like a dragonfly...

422
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:49,540
I mean, she is like an angel from heaven.

423
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,240
Angel! Angel.

424
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,580
Blindly agreeing with others

425
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,180
is a side character's job.

426
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,420
Everyone,

427
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,150
the tea and snacks are ready.

428
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,950
This is a work of art.

429
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,060
Gosh, so beautiful.

430
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,680
So beautiful.

431
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,250
We can each take a plate.

432
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,020
My Lady,

433
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,150
have a cup of tea.

434
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,120
Would you pour it for me?

435
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,030
Of course, My Lady.

436
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,150
Was my hand slippery?

437
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,510
Are you okay, My Lady?

438
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,920
I feel so terrible.

439
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,530
The floor got so dirty.

440
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,920
I will clean it.

441
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,860
Could you clean quickly?

442
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,710
I am a bit sensitive.

443
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,840
Yes, My Lady.

444
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,040
I will come back in a bit.

445
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,360
My apologies.

446
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,350
Take this.

447
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,040
Thank you.

448
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,710
Eun Ae, cheer up.

449
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,340
You'll win everything eventually.

450
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,950
You'll meet the male lead and be happy, too.

451
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,990
Because you're the main character of this novel.

452
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,800
Fighting.

453
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,110
Why would you give a handkerchief to a servant?

454
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,430
Was I not aware that you are friends with her?

455
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,830
I just cannot stand blood.

456
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,830
My father raised me, making sure I do not see anything horrific.

457
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,940
You must all know, do you not?

458
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,280
My father, the Chief State Minister,

459
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,560
His Excellency Cha Ho Yeol.

460
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,230
She is making a fuss over a little cut.

461
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,200
She must have acted pitiful in front of Cho Byeong Mo and got herself adopted.

462
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,950
Actually, she is supposedly his daughter,

463
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,750
but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.

464
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,210
Gosh, really?
Yes.

465
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,330
She is so unexpectedly devious.

466
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,890
They say the tame cat reaches the roof first.

467
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,410
What awful gossip.

468
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,730
Should I step in?

469
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,420
No.

470
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,360
Don't step in. You'll only give
yourself a headache.

471
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,240
She looks innocent, but she is scary.

472
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,300
I did not think she would be so obnoxious.

473
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,590
I know. I know.

474
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,150
According to a report, they're hiding in this alley.

475
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,510
They apparently meet up at this place often.

476
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,800
They do not even hide. How proud.

477
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,820
As if they have multiple lives.

478
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,990
They seem incredibly gutsy.

479
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,980
I wonder if someone is helping them.

480
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:18,100
We can finally catch the Heuksa Clan, right?

481
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,850
What?

482
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,630
It is not that, My Lady.

483
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,440
I did not want to believe the rumor, but you really are devious.

484
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,210
If I scold you,

485
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,910
people would say I bully you for no reason.

486
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,330
That is not true. You are mistaken.

487
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,770
Mistaken? I am glad you said that.

488
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:08,440
Let us resolve the misunderstanding now.

489
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,330
Pardon?
I heard you and your father have an inappropriate relationship.

490
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, my gosh!

491
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,090
I heard you frequent his bedroom and serve him by his bed.

492
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,010
You cannot mess with her family.

493
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,820
She really is crazy.

494
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,170
I do not mind you disgracing me,

495
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,370
but please do not disgrace my father.

496
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,250
My father saved and raised me when I had nowhere to go.

497
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,140
I did not say anything.

498
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,880
I know.

499
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,840
I am just curious if Cho Byeong Mo
is your father or husband.

500
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,880
No, hold back.

501
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,350
Don't get involved.

502
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,590
Stay put.

503
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,180
Stay put, I said.

504
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,580
Are you in pain?

505
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,530
Stop!

506
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,420
I will not go easy on you because
you are Prince Gyeongseong.

507
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,600
Who are you working for?

508
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,500
Stop, stop... Stop, stop...

509
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,300
Stop! Spare me! Spare me...

510
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,000
If you spare me, I can make you the king.

511
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,480
You don't want to be the royal
family's hunting dog forever.

512
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,420
I am not interested in the throne.

513
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,660
Aigoo, here you go.

514
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,100
There is something I want to say.

515
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,520
What do you want to say?

516
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,720
So, what I want to say is...

517
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,780
The full moon is so beautiful tonight.

518
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,210
How about we all drink together?

519
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,610
Drink together?

520
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,810
Yes.

521
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,590
But I do not mean tea.

522
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,350
I mean alcohol.

523
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,450
All of a sudden?

524
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,660
Let us be honest. Why drink tea at night?

525
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,420
It will keep us up at night.

526
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,550
Sir Cho Byeong Mo's daughter is a bit unhip...

527
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,530
I mean, she is a bit clueless.

528
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,110
Alcohol is appropriate at night.

529
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,620
You need to drink when the full moon is up.

530
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,670
Would that not be romantic?

531
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,080
Instead of meeting at a teahouse,

532
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,700
should we not meet at
a tavern on a night like this?

533
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,810
I noticed it at the garment shop, but you are...

534
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,190
very much in sync with me.

535
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,350
Right?

536
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,940
Let us drink.

537
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,930
Let us.

538
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,250
I hear Cho Byeong Mo is hiding a liquor even the King cannot get.

539
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,690
Bring us the best kind.

540
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,180
Yes.

541
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,160
Let us drink!

542
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,180
What is all this?

543
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,460
Here they are, My Lady.

544
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,590
If so,

545

What are you doing?

547
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,250
I wanted you to try something new.

548

Cocktail?

555
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,440
This is Bokgeolju.

556
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,160
I mixed bokbunja and makgeolli.

557
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,410
I've never made a cocktail using bokbunja wine.

558
