But if you still want to,

187
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,220
- I will willingly-
- No, no, no!

188
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,470
Never, never, never! I don't want to!

189
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,780
I am willing to-

190
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,510
No!

191
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,880
Let me go!

192
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,830
Gosh!

193
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,440
Are you walking like that for me to see?

194
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,770
I will lend you my back.

195
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,880
What are you saying?

196
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,580
I never asked you to carry me.

197
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,270
I got scared.

198
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:27,410
<i>♫ Just like the moment I first met you ♫</i>

199
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,280
<i>♫ Stay by my side always ♫</i>

200
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,830
<i>♫ I'm only you ♫</i>

201
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,710
<i>♫ Show me your heart ♫</i>

202
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,930
<i>♫ I love you forever ♫</i>

203
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,770
<i>♫ I think of you ♫</i>

204
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,300
<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

205
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,490
<i>♫ The fortune came to me like a dream ♫</i>

206
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,110
<i>♫ I can give you my everything ♫</i>

207
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,900
<i>♫ That's how beautiful you are ♫</i>

208
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,490
<i>♫ I'm happy ♫</i>

209
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,070
<i>♫ My heart is calling for you ♫</i>

210
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,260
Why do you keep getting more clingy?

211
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,160
Clingy?

212
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,250
When you put your hand on my back,

213
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,860
it seemed very intentional.

214
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,190
There are intentions behind our actions.

215
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,120
You're subtly sneaky, too.

216
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,920
Being subtle isn't my style.

217
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,510
I prefer to be blatant.

218
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
Have you no shame?

219
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,330
That would require me to feel
embarrassed about myself.

220
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,140
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

221
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,740
<i>♫ Shall we begin? ♫</i>

222
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,590
What a weak-kneed physician.

223
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,170
How would you make yourself useful?

224
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,980
I do not think she has a plague.

225
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,020
Are you sure?

226
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,790
The symptoms are similar,

227
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,590
but she is recovering differently.

228
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,530
I was so sick I could die.

229
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,590
She also coughed up blood.

230
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,350
But she does not have necrosis or sores.

231
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,960
Most importantly, her pulse is stable.

232
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,530
I think it is another illness, not a plague.

233
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,280
Another illness?

234
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,670
Did you intake or touch anything in particular?

235
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,310
Try to think carefully.

236
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,600
I was trapped in a room.

237
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,770
<i>I met Lord Su Gyeom.</i>

238
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,460
<i>I went to Lady Eun Ae's house and...</i>

239
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,340
I did meet a Westerner on the streets.

240
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,140
He was in trouble because he was
stranded on his journey.

241
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,000
I showed him around places.

242
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,620
Westerner?

243
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,150
We pray. We pray.

244
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,950
We pray for Sun Chaek's safe return.

245
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,790
Please let My Lady come back safely.

246
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,590
Sun Chaek...

247
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,040
If you would just watch us standing like that,

248
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,680
just go inside instead.

249
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,040
A scholar does not believe in superstition.

250
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,450
Superstition?

251
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,340
Sun Chaek is in danger of dying right now.

252
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,600
I do not care if it is superstition or not.

253
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,780
She is right.

254
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,500
It is about your child's life.
Why should it matter

255
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,450
whether you are a scholar or a slave?

256
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,810
If Sun Chaek returns,

257
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,900
I will grant any of her wishes.

258
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
I pray...

259
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,360
I will call Sun Chaek "Noonim."

260
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,280
I do not mind if she gets married before me.

261
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,000
I already miss her face and voice.

262
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,630
<i>I said I can walk by myself.</i>

263
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,110
<i>Put me down.</i>

264
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,180
Am I hearing things?

265
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,500
I feel like I could hear her voice.

266
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,440
<i>Gosh, I'm okay.</i>

267
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,690
Put me down, I said.

268
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,130
People could see us.

269
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,590
Noonim!

270
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,120
- Seriously, put me down.
- Noonim!

271
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,980
Sun Chaek.

272
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,650
Is that you, my Sun Chaek?

273
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,660
You came back alive, did you not?

274
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,890
- Father.
- Yes, yes, yes.

275
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,560
Aigoo.

276
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,620
Aigoo, my Sun Chaek.

277
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,840
Your face got so slender.

278
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,990
You look so worn out.

279
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,400
The moon heard our prayer.

280
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,890
Sun Chaek came back alive.

281
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,540
I am proud of you, my sister.

282
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm okay.

283
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm really okay.

284
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,590
Gosh.

285
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,830
By the way, what brings you here...

286
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,990
I was able to return in good health

287
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,090
thanks to Prince Gyeongseong.

288
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,730
He saved my life.

289
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,100
I see.

290
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,380
Thank you.

291
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,930
The night air is cold.

292
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,630
Come inside with us.

293
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,010
I will get going now.

294
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,200
It is getting late. You should go inside.

295
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,700
Yes. Well, then.

296
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,790
- Let us go inside.
- But we should-

297
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,950
Let us go.

298
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,820
But he saved Sun Chaek...

299
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,460
Are you really leaving like this?

300
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,840
If we stay together tonight,

301
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,630
something dangerous might really happen.

302
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,550
Something dangerous? L-Like what, exactly?

303
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,880
Will there be assassins or swordsmen?

304
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,890
There is something dangerous

305
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,920
you do not know about.

306
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,330
I am giving you a pass tonight.

307
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,260
You wanted to see me first thing in the morning.

308
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,130
What is the reason?

309
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,000
I heard my marriage was being
arranged behind my back.

310
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,690
How could I delay a moment?

311
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,580
Royal marriages are under the
Internal Court's jurisdiction.

312
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,560
You must be aware of that.

313
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,850
Technically speaking, I am not a prince.

314
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,040
Please stop the selection.

315
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,650
Through a selection,

316
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,820
I want to find someone
who is a good match for you.

317
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,580
Do you not know how this old lady feels?

318
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,230
I have already found someone
who is a good match for me.

319
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,090
I am aware.

320
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,990
But royal marriages are not just
about personal feelings.

321
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,330
Prince Gyeongseong,

322
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,560
you are more naive than I thought.

323
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,450
If you want, that woman can become a concubine.

324
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,050
There will be only one woman for me.

325
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,400
Do not argue with me.

326
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,720
I will consider it an insult, then.

327
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Leave right now.

328
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,200
Please remember.

329
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,400
I politely gave you the last chance
to change your mind.

330
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,800
- What did you say?
- Do as you wish.

331
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,320
Things will end up the way I want, anyway.

332
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,890
What do you mean by that?

333
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,590
The woman I chose will be selected in the end.

334
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,250
P-Prince Gyeongseong.

335
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,650
Prince Gyeongseong!

336
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,530
A magpie cried this morning.

337
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,520
I was wondering who I would run into.

338
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,190
I get to see you here.

339
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,560
I suppose you just saw the Queen Mother.

340
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,600
I did.

341
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,760
I was also on my way to see her.

342
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,270
You are visiting the Queen Mother's
chamber so early.

343
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,880
You must be quite close to her.

344
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,770
Well, I am her favorite among her relatives.

345
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,580
So, you were her relative.

346
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,120
My Lord,

347
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,880
to be honest, I sent an application
for the selection-

348
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,280
Prince Gyeongseong,
could we have a tea together...

349
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,940
<i>A Westerner?</i>

350
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,730
Why all of a sudden?

351
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,560
I think she got involved in something unpleasant.

352
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,200
All right.

353
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,990
I will move as quickly as possible.

354
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,770
And one more thing.

355
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,620
There is someone I want you to watch.

356
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,540
Selection process?

357
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,730
I cannot believe you made such a huge decision
without discussing it with us.

358
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,110
Did Prince Gyeongseong threaten you?

359
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,230
He did not. I did it because I wanted to.

360
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,380
So, please let me.

361
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,450
I cannot.

362
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,080
Let her, My Lord.

363
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,550
Wife, why are you doing this now?

364
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,980
You said you would grant any
of her wishes if she returned.

365
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,670
A man cannot go back on his word
from just yesterday.

366
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,350
Wife,

367
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,760
we should be stopping this reckless girl-

368
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,970
Why stop her? We should support her.

369
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,350
- Wife?
- I gave birth to her and raised her,

370
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,930
but I have never been happier with her decision.

371
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,790
She wants to get married ahead of her brothers

372
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,800
and participate in the
notoriously difficult selection.

373
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,570
I am proud of her courage.

374
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,010
Sun Chaek, participating in the selection

375
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,280
is not as simple as you think.

376
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,970
Do you still feel the same way?

377
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,360
Father, I understand you are worried,

378
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,590
but if I cannot participate in the selection,

379
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,880
I am sure I will regret it later.

380
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,350
Have faith in our daughter.

381
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,120
The fact that the Queen Mother is taking
charge of a royal family's marriage.

382
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,720
It does not seem like an ordinary selection.

383
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,970
It makes me worry.

384
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,210
Please do not worry.

385
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm confident I'll exceed your expectations.

386
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,420
[Cha Sun Chaek]

387
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,800
Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

388
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Yes, she is the youngest daughter
of the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol.

389
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,670
She sent her application, too?

390
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,320
Yes.

391
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
That cannot be.

392
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,570
I was told she was at the plague village.

393
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,080
Pardon?

394
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,580
It is nothing.

395
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,600
Carry on using the registry for now.

396
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,620
I will start the first round per your order then.

397
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,500
<i>The woman I chose will be selected in the end.</i>

398
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,400
Is that why he said that?

399
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,620
Secretary Do.

400
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,310
Yes, Queen Mother. Yes.

401
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,470
I want this selection to be different
than the usual ones

402
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,990
planned by the Royal Wedding Office.

403
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,270
Would you like to hear about it?

404
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,650
Yes.

405
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,660
I'll bring honor to the Cha family.

406
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,160
Yes.

407
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,490
Watch your head, My Lady.

408
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,640
[The first round is about basic manners]

409
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,680
[The second round is about how cultivated one is]

410
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,750
[The third round is about
one's character and wisdom]

411
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,090
<i>I'm a romantic period novel fanatic.</i>

412
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,770
<i>Of course, I know about the selection.</i>

413
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,480
<i>I've read about it so much that</i>

414
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,730
<i>I can explain it off the top of my head.</i>

415
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,240
You sure have great handwriting.

416
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,950
Is the material for the
Prince Training Hall contest ready?

417
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,410
Yes.

418
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,600
It is also nice to look at.

419
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,370
Thank you.

420
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,850
Let us go get lunch now.

421
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,690
How about hot gukbap and makgeolli?

422
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,960
That is a good idea.

423
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,830
Why are you not getting up? Do you not want lunch?

424
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,080
Gukbap is not my favorite.

425
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,940
Why not? It is delicious.

426
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,350
For me, gukbap is...

427
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,330
The smell and the look of it feel barbaric.

428
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,810
Do not act superior.

429
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,970
I am not. It is a matter of taste.

430
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,220
Please respect it.

431
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,130
Of course, Mr. Calligrapher.

432
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,830
By the way, did you hear?

433
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,470
There will be a royal spouse selection
at the Palace soon.

434
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,240
You mean for Prince Gyeongseong?

435
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,280
Hold on.

436
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,820
Selection for Prince Gyeongseong?

437
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,990
What do you mean by that?

438
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,450
Lady Eun Ae?

439
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,970
Gosh, My Lady.

440
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,870
What are you doing here...

441
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,200
Because my father insisted,

442
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,950
I will also be participating in the selection.

443
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,500
Your father?

444
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,620
Yes.

445
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,190
He even purchased a fake nobility note.

446
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,270
<i>If Eun Ae participates in the selection,</i>

447
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,840
<i>does it make her my competition?</i>

448
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,440
<i>By chance,</i>

449
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,050
<i>will Eun Ae and Yi Beon be able to connect again?</i>

450
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,730
<i>This world is too unpredictable.</i>

451
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,680
I hope you are not mistaken.

452
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,070
I am still scared of Prince Gyeongseong.
I do not like him.

453
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,090
I do not even want to be married to him

454
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,430
even in my dreams.

455
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,480
Would you be okay being here, then?

456
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,050
My father said it was his dream.

457
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,530
You're doing this just to be filial.

458
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,950
I admire your filial heart, Lady Eun Ae.

459
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,570
It is my duty.

460
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,920
I hope I do not get in
between you and Prince Gyeongseong.

461
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,150
- Not at all.
- Do not worry.

462
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,250
I will get disqualified quickly
since I lack in many ways.

463
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,990
I hope you have a good result.

464
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,260
Gosh, I hear vulgar and unpleasant noises.

465
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,960
My Lady.

466
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,960
<i>What is Cha Sun Chaek doing here?</i>

467
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,080
<i>Why is she not sick?</i>

468
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,350
You look like you saw a ghost.

469
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,310
You are not happy to see me, either. Am I wrong?

470
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,040
Here is your fan, My Lady.

471
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,830
The world must be coming to an end.

472
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,870
Even dogs and cows are
participating in the selection.

473
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,380
Dogs and cows?

474
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,630
You are going too far.

475
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,020
A lowlife like you are
participating in the selection?

476
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,210
I can hear the sound of the royal family's

477
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,860
authority falling all the way from here.

478
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,640
I will show the difference between
a noblewoman and a lowlife like you.

479
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,190
I know I will get disqualified in the first round.

480
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,580
You don't know that.

481
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,010
You never know until you compete.

482
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,980
Gosh. What a touching friendship.

483
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,950
They say, "Heukimjamuk."

484
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,520
If you stay close to something dirty,

485
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,420
you end up getting dirty, too.

486
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,580
You mean, "Geunmukjaheuk."

487
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,480
What kind of food is "Heukimjamuk?"

488
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,080
You will regret ignoring my warning.

489
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,990
Cho Eun Ae or whatever her name is...

490
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,930
You never know what sly nature she is
hiding behind her innocent face.

491
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,730
It takes one to know one, they say.

492
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,530
What did you say?

493
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,320
All right. Line up and go inside in order.

494
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,010
Let's go.

495
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,290
<i>It is a ritual for the Kitchen God.</i>

496
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,040
<i>It signals the beginning of the selection.</i>

497
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,610
The cauldron knob never bent before.

498
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,510
Does this signal something?

499
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,820
I dodged a bad omen.

500
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,060
I dodged it.

501
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,570
The first round of the selection will commence.

502
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,330
The Queen Mother gave you this task herself.

503
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,470
It is called,

504
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,610
"Triathlon Fitness Battle."

505
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,010
<i>Health is one of the three criteria
for women, along with intelligence and heart.</i>

506
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:11,060
Especially the royal women
need to be stronger than anyone.

507
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:18,230
Women of this country carried
cannonballs themselves during wars

508
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,000
and overcame crises alongside men
throughout our history.

509
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,430
Therefore,

510
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,540
you lift up this cannonball...

511
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,800
Lift it up and

512
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,350
toss it past that line.

513
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,220
The ones who succeed will pass this round.

514
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,010
Who wants to toss it first?

515
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,580
What do I do?

516
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,270
Is there anyone who wants to go first?

517
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,680
I will give it a try.

518
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,640
How admirable.

519
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,870
Bring her the cannonball.

520
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,360
Toss it!

521
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,650
She passed!

522
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,910
Good job.

523
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,890
You did a great job.

524
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,460
All right. Start tossing it in order.

525
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,900
She passed!

526
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,140
She failed!

527
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,650
She passed!

528
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,240
She failed!

529
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,440
She passed!

530
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,700
She failed!

531
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,560
She passed!

532
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,590
All she got is brute force.

533
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,670
She failed!

534
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,230
She passed!

535
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,560
<i>Is it really this heavy?</i>

536
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,480
<i>No, don't get scared.</i>

537
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,620
<i>Sports are about science, not force.</i>

538
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,430
<i>Apply pressure to the core.</i>

539
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,120
<i>Using the centrifugal force...</i>

540
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,240
<i>toss it the moment you feel certain.</i>

541
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,580
She passed!

542
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,850
What brings you here?

543
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,500
How could you not tell me about your selection?

544
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,590
I am very disappointed.

545
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,590
The selection was planned behind your back.

546
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,840
You are finally facing a hardship, too.

547
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,860
This is not much of a hardship.

548
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,770
Do not be so confident.

549
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,760
If another woman gets selected,

550
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,170
what would you do then?

551
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,940
I can easily cancel the selection result.

552
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,580
If you can,

553
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,540
why are you letting the selection happen?

554
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,850
Just like in hunting,

555
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,840
everything has its moment.

556
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,020
Hunting?

557
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,230
I am suspicious that this selection started at all.

558
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,920
I am thinking of finding out the reason.

559
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,480
And...

560
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,780
hardships aren't necessarily bad.

561
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,290
What are you so entertained by?

562
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,440
This is so you.

563
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,510
You were watching this...

564
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,580
Only the maidens who hit the bullseye

565
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,420
can move on to the next stage.

566
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,880
She passed.

567
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,630
Something is strange over there.

568
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,100
She passed!

569
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,880
I-It worked.

570
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,470
It was obviously suspicious.

571
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,400
This is not fair.

572
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,200
If you do not shoot at a count of 10,

573
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,420
I will disqualify you.

574
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,190
Even the best archer could not
hit the bullseye in this weather.

575
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,760
This is also a part of her fate.

576
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,800
You cheated.

577
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,110
How dare you speak of fate?

578
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,300
I will have to show her...

579
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,400
that fate can change.

580
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,830
Ten!

581
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,510
I'm Jumong's descendant.

582
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,250
Korea is a nation of archery.

583
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,230
Seven!

584
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,040
Sun Chaek better not delay too much.

585
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,160
Five!

586
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,600
Four!

587
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,110
<i>You don't calculate the wind.</i>

588
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,600
Three!

589
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,930
<i>- You overcome it.</i>
- Two!

590
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,310
One!

591
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,670
Wow!

592
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,990
Even with this strong wind!

593
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,460
Do not look him in the eye.

594
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,460
Oh, no, hurry.

595
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,330
Hurry.

596
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,970
<i>I found the Westerner who approached Lady Cha.</i>

597
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,640
<i>I think he came off of a ship
that arrived about six days ago.</i>

598
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,090
Six days ago?

599
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,400
<i>He and Lady Cha went to a tavern, a fabric shop,</i>

600
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,090
<i>and other places together.</i>

601
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:13,310
<i>He is currently staying at an inn that
the fabric shop owner recommended.</i>

602
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,540
<i>He did not display plague symptoms.</i>

603
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,290
I am here to pick up my clothes.

604
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,240
You came with Lady Sun Chaek last time.

605
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,260
I will bring them out now.

606
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,430
He speaks our language well, by the way.

607
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,300
This is the last stage of the first round.

608
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,440
Deliver refreshments for the internal court ladies

609
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,920
who are working hard.

610
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,360
Get started.

611
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,290
My Lady, the porridge
on the left is about to spill.

612
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,660
Thank you.

613
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,160
It's slippery here. Be careful.

614
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,570
Okay.

615
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,190
You wasted food that our countrymen

616
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,930
grew with blood, sweat, and tears.

617
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,450
You failed.

618
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:55,610
<i>Don't underestimate a resident
of a hilltop neighborhood.</i>

619
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,030
You failed.

620
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,550
The bowls you broke are...

621
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,670
precious white porcelain, the Princess' favorite.

622
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,310
You failed.

623
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,420
I guess no experience is useless.

624
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,300
Are you okay?

625
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,940
I might die before the selection ends.

626
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,920
Anyway, thanks for your help today.

627
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,420
Do not mention it.

628
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,910
You helped me a lot, too.

629
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,780
<i>Don't smile like that.</i>

630
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,970
<i>I'm your competitor.</i>

631
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,290
<i>You need to defeat me.</i>

632
00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:00,140
I feel secure that you are with me.

633
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,530
<i>But I feel uncomfortable.</i>

634
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:07,190
<i>I'm sorry, sweet Lady Eun Ae.</i>

635
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,460
Why do you look so down?

636
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,940
You said we should work hard
without being discouraged.

637
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,500
Let us do well until the end.

638
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,160
But what would be the point?

639
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,600
I think someone was already chosen internally.

640
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:26,100
You saw Do Hwa Seon cheating, right?

641
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,310
Is there anyone who does not know that?

642
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,120
I hope we aren't playing sidekicks to Do Hwa Seon

643
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,980
when the decision was already made.

644
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,360
Geez.

645
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,090
Thinking that makes me so angry.

646
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,270
My Lady, if nothing had changed,

647
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:56,170
I would not have been able
to participate in this selection.

648
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,750
I was born an orphan.

649
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,420
No matter how wealthy my stepfather is,

650
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,380
he is nothing but a merchant.

651
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,700
But while he was growing his business,

652
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,200
he was able to change his status.

653
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,580
And I got to participate in the selection, too.

654
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,210
Lady Eun Ae.

655
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,130
Now, I think...

656
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,750
nothing in this world was predetermined.

657
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,920
All we have is this moment.

658
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,960
Was that out of line?

659
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,610
No.

660
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,260
You're so admirable.

661
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,690
"Nothing is predetermined in this world."

662
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,860
It's such a cool idea.

663
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,690
I wonder if the test went well.

664
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,320
I wonder if she caused trouble.

665
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,470
The person I saw was indeed Maiden Eun Ae.

666
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,370
Why did she participate
in Prince Gyeongseong's selection?

667
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,960
No.

668
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,200
No...

669
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,560
This cannot be true.

670
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,180
Right.

671
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,650
I was worried most about Eun Ae,

672
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:31,220
but she said the present moment matters the most.

673
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,060
Let's stop feeling guilty.

674
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,520
Just focus on what's ahead.

675
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,730
Is talking to yourself a trend these days?

676
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,780
I don't even have the energy to be surprised.

677
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,600
Do not say you already failed the first round.

678
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,460
What do you mean, fail?

679
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,220
I hung in there with all my might and passed.

680
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,370
The whole thing was already set up for Do Hwa Seon.

681
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,600
Do you know how hard I worked?

682
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,060
Look. My legs are shaking.

683
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,080
Lady Eun Ae and I were so flustered.

684
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,850
You know Lady Eun Ae, right?

685
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,330
- At the Seonmun Club meeting-
- I am not interested.

686
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,290
All I am interested in is you, Cha Sun Chaek.

687
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,320
So, no matter what the test is,

688
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,420
make sure to pass.

689
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,250
Getting married is important,

690
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,750
but I'll make sure to win
for the sake of my dignity.

691
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:52,430
Prove yourself as the female lead who suits me.

692
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,010
If it is for winning,

693
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,420
I will let you do anything.

694
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,010
But...

695
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,960
I cannot forgive you if you hurt yourself.

696
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,360
Let's go.

697
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,120
For the second round of the selection today,

698
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,980
out of intelligence, heart, and health,

699
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,240
we will assess the intelligence.

700
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:42,150
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

701
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:48,260
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

702
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:54,510
That is the task I am giving you.

That's an admirable idea.

706
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:23,380
I'm so impressed with you, Lady Eun Ae.

707
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,780
<i>After being moved by Eun Ae's words,</i>

708
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,980
<i>Sun Chaek felt at ease.</i>

709
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,420
<i>It's probably because
of the guilt she's been having.</i>

710
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,600
<i>But what Eun Ae said to Sun Chaek wasn't for her.</i>

711
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,640
<i>It was more of a promise to herself.</i>
