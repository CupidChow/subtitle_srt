1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,978
[The child actors were filmed safely

2
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,728
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,418
Did I drink too much?

4
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,398
Is this a dream?

5
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:44,128
Or am I still in the novel?

6
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:48,458
Why is it so complicated?

7
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,058
Gosh, whatever.

8
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,008
Right?

9
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:12,148
Eun Ae comes out for a night walk

10
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,638
and she meets Yi Beon.

11
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:18,138
I think that long-awaited moment happens now.

12
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:25,958
I can't miss a highlight like that.

13
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,568
Where's Eun Ae? Is she not here yet?

14
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:51,658
His features look like delicately sculpted ice.

15
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:55,268
A perfect-looking man.

16
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:59,398
What? Why does this feel familiar?

17
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,358
By chance, are you...

18
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:06,298
the male lead, Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong?

19
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:09,128
Gosh, it's you. It's you. I finally did it.

20
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,128
Shake my hand.

21
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,618
This is so crazy.

22
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:24,018
Did you lose your mind?

23
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,338
If you try to do anything funny,

24
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,898
you might lose your fingers.

25
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,958
Go ahead and try.

26
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,718
The worst thing that could happen is me dying

27
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:37,568
in this novel.

28
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,128
You are staring at me directly

29
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,928
when you know who I am?

30
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,018
Because the rumor says something horrific

31
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:52,438
happens to you if you make eye contact with you?

32
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:56,438
Why don't I check if that rumor

33
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,908
is true or not?

34
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:13,488
Try cutting these lips in half, too.

35
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,968
You can't do it.

36
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:31,838
To be honest, I know everything.

37
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:35,468
The secrets you keep.

38
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:38,398
Because you don't want to kill anyone,

39
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,168
you created such rumors yourself.

40
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:45,418
Even though you'd be left alone,

41
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:47,968
you chose to be lonely

42
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,368
than to be in agony.

43
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,748
It's not your fault.

44
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:01,728
You did nothing wrong.

45
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,598
Why...

46
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,648
are you so sure that you know...

47
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:14,338
so well about me?
It's because...

48
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:20,508
I read your mind completely.

49
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:25,548
You felt hurt because you were lonely.

50
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:28,018
But once you fall in love,

51
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,268
you're good to your woman.

52
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:38,108
No woman ever told me

53
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:40,148
something like that.

54
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,448
[Episode 2: The first night in this life]

55
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:51,248
[Episode 2: The first night in Yi Beon's life]

56
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:55,648
Gosh, my head.

57
00:04:58,238 --> 00:05:00,808
What are you doing?

58
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,238
My Lord.

59
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,828
What do I do? What do I do?

60
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:47,868
Were you into this kind of thing?

61
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:50,448
My Lord.

62
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,278
No, no, no.

63
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:07,228
This is not reality. This is not the novel. No...

64
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,728
This is... What do you call it?

65
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,558
Trying to evade what happened last night,

66
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:39,578
if you're pretending not to remember...

67
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:47,638
Or if you're playing ignorant
because you think so lightly

68
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:50,448
of this between a man and a woman,

69
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,688
so that you do not think such a thing again,

70
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:55,508
I will make sure to...

71
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:59,468
crush this small head of yours.

72
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:02,708
So, you had better...

73
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,688
wait here until I come back.

74
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:27,258
I had a one-night stand with someone else's man?

75
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:36,118
Be calm. Let's think this through.

76
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,918
Feeling upset from the Dahong Club meeting,

77
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,408
Eun Ae was walking alone and

78
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:48,028
ran into Yi Beon by the water.

79
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:52,478
By chance, because of me,

80
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,208
did they miss their first encounter?

81
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,848
Gosh, that can't be...

82
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:01,618
But that could actually be the case...

83
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,988
This is unsettling.

84
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:07,458
Why did I black out at that moment?

85
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,868
I need to check on my own.

86
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,048
By chance,

87
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,968
is my wish coming true, My Lord?

88
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,488
Or will she become a Buddhist nun, too?

89
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,648
Was it your wish for me to marry?

90
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,328
You know well.

91
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,908
But you said you will never marry.

92
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:44,758
So, I thought that was the case.

93
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,088
The women who crossed paths with you once

94
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:51,388
are forced to become Buddhist nuns,
according to a rumor.

95
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:55,558
Rumors can be useful sometimes.

96
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:59,498
It was a rumor you started, of course.

97
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:04,318
By the way, how...

98
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:14,618
To be honest, I know everything.

99
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,848
The secrets you keep.

100
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,108
It's not your fault.

101
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:23,048
You did nothing wrong.

102
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:29,498
Make sure she doesn't leave
Hoseondang until I return.

103
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,788
Yes, sir.

104
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:36,088
She is different than most noble women.

105
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,068
So, take extra care.

106
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:41,928
It might be good to prepare a wedding proposal.

107
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,808
Already?

108
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,638
Did the sun rise from the west today?

109
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,208
Are you in there?

110
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,278
Are you in there?

111
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:17,038
Is she still sleeping?

112
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,858
Why is it so complicated?

113
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,058
What is this, an escape room?

114
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,838
Gosh, is this right?

115
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:53,578
You've got to be kidding.

116
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:59,838
Hello.
Hello.

117
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:03,328
Which way should I go to exit?

118
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,378
Well, t-that way.

119
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,958
Thank you.
Sure.

120
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,208
Who is she, by the way?

121
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,348
I wonder. Looks like she came from the guest room.

122
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:21,848
No way. At Hoseondang, there is no woman except for the cook lady.

123
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,418
Is she a thief, by chance?

124
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:28,598
We should catch her, then.
Hold on. We cannot catch her.

125
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:33,848
She could be a thief who stole the Lord's heart.

126
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:47,288
What happened yesterday, anyway?

127
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:54,328
So, what happened to Eun Ae, then?

128
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,308
This must be the place.

129
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,088
Lady Sun Chaek.

130
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,848
What happened yesterday?

131
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:23,158
I was scared because you suddenly disappeared.

132
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:27,218
I must've drank too much last night.

133
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:30,048
I don't remember so well.

134
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:34,448
I prepared a tea that is good for a hangover.

135
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,118
Shall we?
Yes.

136
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:44,408
Thank you so much for
helping me in a bind last night.

137
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:47,138
I will forever be grateful.

138
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:52,828
Well... I think I was...

139
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,168
slightly drunk last night.

140
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:58,438
Did I make a mistake in front of people

141
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,688
or cause trouble by chance?

142
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,768
Mistake? Oh, no.

143
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:06,938
What are they called... your cocktails?

144
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:09,078
Right?
Yes...

145
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,488
Everyone was talking about them last night.

146
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:18,448
The teahouse was packed with people who came to see your cocktails.

147
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,568
Is that so?

148
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:26,468
Yes. We will serve cocktails
for the full moon, too.

149
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:30,748
Could you teach me your know-how later, My Lady?

150
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:33,698
H-How to make cocktails?

151
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:37,628
Well, if that's what you want.

152
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,018
By chance,

153
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:45,358
d-did something else happen last night?

154
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,478
Something else?

155
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:51,078
Did Yi Beon and Eun Ae even meet last night?

156
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,458
Nothing else happened.

157
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,008
Everyone went home happy, thanks to you.

158
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:59,228
Everything went well.

159
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:02,208
I see.

160
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,148
They couldn't meet because of me.

161
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:09,818
Did you not run into someone named Yi Beon

162
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:13,468
or the Prince Gyeongseong briefly, by chance?

163
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,658
I have heard of him many times,

164
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,358
but I have never met him in person.

165
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:30,338
I heard that Prince Gyeongseong
frequents this area these days.

166
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,998
Aren't you curious?

167
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,328
Really?
Yes.

168
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,888
That is a bit scary.

169
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,538
I heard you cannot upset him or make eye contact with him.

170
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:41,968
I do not have a lot of connections,

171
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:46,058
but the teahouse people told me about him.

172
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,238
But he might not be as scary as you think.

173
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,818
Rumors are just rumors.

174
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,248
Have you heard?

175
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:58,438
According to what I heard recently...

176
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,248
since he has no interest in women,

177
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,128
there's a rumor that there might
be something wrong with him.

178
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:09,848
Gosh, that's not true.

179
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:13,188
To be exact, he's full of vitality...

180
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,538
I thought I didn't remember.

181
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,448
I remember now.

182
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,238
Crazy.

183
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:40,938
I still have not broken away

184
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:44,168
from my brother's influence yet.

185
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:46,748
Is it because I lack virtue?

186
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:49,778
It took long because it was
an undercover operation.

187
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:54,348
You do not have to worry
about Heuksa Clan for a while.

188
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,028
I need to get China's approval.

189
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,418
I need to be appointed officially

190
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:04,628
so the former King's remaining factions
can't run wild any longer.

191
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,598
Prince Gyeongseong, what do you think?

192
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,628
Our relationship with China is important,

193
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,998
but securing people's support comes first.

194
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:16,108
Since you've been focusing
on destroying the rebels,

195
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,938
you're not thinking clearly.

196
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,828
Getting acknowledged by China

197
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:24,648
will naturally win the people's support.

198
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:27,298
I have not...

199
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:30,418
won your support yet, Prince Gyeongseong.

200
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,538
That is not true-
If not,

201
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:38,468
I would like you to lead the envoys that I am sending to China.

202
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,598
Take grains, visit the Emperor, and bring me my official appointment.

203
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,198
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

204
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,718
but I do not think I would be able to join the envoys.

205
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,948
Is there a particular reason?

206
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,748
There is something I need to take care of.

207
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,508
I will not be able to for a while.

208
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,248
Something to take care of?

209
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:03,848
I...

210
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,798
have someone I would like to marry, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:22,738
You hold no prejudices and you speak up regardless of hierarchy.

212
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:26,908
You even corrected the rumor
regarding Prince Gyeongseong.

213
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:29,998
You are such a great person.

214
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:33,738
You are meant to end up with the male lead

215
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:39,748
and that would make this story
and my life easier, too.

216
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:45,078
I think I developed a crush.

217
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,658
Pardon?
On you, My Lady.

218
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:50,568
Can I dare ask you to be my friend?

219
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:53,378
I would like to see you often.

220
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:58,738
U-Us being friends is...

221
00:17:58,738 --> 00:18:01,758
It might be kind of difficult.

222
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:04,988
Of course, you dislike me, too.

223
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,918
I am sorry. I should have known better.

224
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,458
I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.

225
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,848
No, it's not like that.

226
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,738
I am an orphan with an unknown origin

227
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:17,658
and they say I seduced my father
and got adopted as a mistress...

228
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,778
Who says that?

229
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:24,418
I'm very aware of how great of a person you are.

230
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,268
Even when you struggle or are sad,

231
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:28,598
you help others who struggle more than you.

232
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,418
You're such a blessing.

233
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:33,308
How dare they say bullshit like that...

234
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:40,968
Let's be friends, okay?

235
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:45,348
You aren't allowed to say
something so pitiful, okay?

236
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:49,188
Lady Sun Chaek.

237
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:57,818
How about you join the envoys in three months?

238
00:18:57,818 --> 00:19:00,208
Get married during that time.

239
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:05,548
Your wedding will be treated with utmost respect in the royal court.

240
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,188
You will not refuse this, will you?

241
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,298
All right, then.

242
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:13,418
I will follow your order.

243
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:21,608
You should also experience the family affection

244
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,578
you didn't know about for a while.

245
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:31,998
I will take my leave.

246
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,618
All right.

247
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,738
He suddenly wants to get married.

248
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,448
What is he thinking?

249
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:52,368
Watch him closely from now on.

250
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,818
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:04,258
Is that not the Prince Gyeongseong?

252
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:07,578
Looks like he just visited His Majesty.

253
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,398
Prince Gyeongseong.

254
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,528
Queen Mother.

255
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:23,238
What happened to you?

256
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:27,758
Your handsome face looks so tired.

257
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:31,338
Did you have a serious
conversation at the Main Hall?

258
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,388
It is nothing.

259
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:39,938
If so, I think you need a wife to care for you.

260
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:44,598
That would liven up your face a little.

261
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:50,268
I am planning to invite all the daughters of noble families at the banquet early this month.

262
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:54,828
How about you find a wife there?

263
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,338
I appreciate your concern,

264
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:02,298
but I will choose who I will marry.

265
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,188
I will take my leave now.

266
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,908
Fine.

267
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:17,278
He insidiously hides his feelings.

268
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,818
It is impossible to know what he is thinking.

269
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:24,788
Is it still about what happened then?

270
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,828
How could he be so sharp as a razor?

271
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,288
The thing is...

272
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:37,118
Is that true?

273
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:40,948
He took in a woman last night?

274
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:48,528
Not only did I have a one-night
stand with the male lead,

275
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,618
I befriended the female lead, too.

276
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,728
This isn't right.

277
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:59,178
Yes. This happened because of me.

278
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:02,128
I need to correct things somehow.

279
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:04,718
Gosh, what do I do?

280
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:06,798
My Lady!

281
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,188
Lady Sun Chaek!

282
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,518
My Lady... My Lady...

283
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:18,278
My Lady, where did you spend the night last night?

284
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,438
Something serious happened.
Things can't get any worse than it is.

285
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:25,538
You should have warned me sooner.

286
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:28,098
I had no idea you had a lover.

287
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,408
What do you mean a lover?

288
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:33,718
Gosh, you are so clueless.

289
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:36,538
You are about to get married.

290
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,508
Get married?

291
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:43,968
A wedding proposal for you just arrived.

292
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:50,148
So, did my family see it?

293
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:52,408
They are not home right now.

294
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:55,688
I wanted to warn you
before His Excellency gets home.

295
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,928
But he should be coming home soon.

296
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,198
I'm getting married at this point?

297
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:05,858
No, I need to stop it.

298
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,538
My Lady, move!

299
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:19,428
Maybe this is how...

300
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,588
Cha Sun Chaek leaves the story.

301
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:32,098
Gosh, she survived.

302
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,248
She survived. She survived.

303
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:49,378
I told you to stay put and wait.

304
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,418
Did you want to get killed by a horse
before the wedding?

305
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:55,238
I never asked you to send a wedding
proposal or whatever.

306
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:59,318
Wedding proposals have nothing
to do with how the couple feels.

307
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,328
It's just formality between the families.

308
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:05,938
Do you think it makes sense for us to get married?

309
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,838
If a man and woman spent a night together,

310
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:10,308
they have to get married, of course.

311
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:13,248
But I have no memory of it.

312
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:15,468
If you say you have no memory of it,

313
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:17,818
will it cancel out what happened?

314
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,288
And I remember last night very clearly.

315
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,838
Who took my clothes off so aggressively?

316
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,488
Someone might hear you. Lower your voice.

317
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:28,658
You have shame. You had none yesterday.

318
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,888
Even if I did,

319
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,168
I don't think we should
get married only because of that.

320
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,928
You seduced me and spent a night with me.

321
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:39,258
But you are denying it now?

322
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:43,538
Are you blaming me for everything, by chance?

323
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,758
It wasn't your first time, was it?

324
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:50,708
Come on. It wasn't right?

325
00:24:55,238 --> 00:25:00,288
Do you think I am a horny animal who sleeps with any woman I can find?

326
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:03,498
No, it's not that...

327
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:07,248
With your face, body, and wealth,

328
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,998
you had to have been with a woman before.

329
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,808
The first night with a woman
is important to a nobleman.

330
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,578
That is why I have been saving myself.

331
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,218
Since we spent the first night together,

332
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:20,008
of course, we should be responsible for the other.

333
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:24,088
Why is he so obsessed with the first night?

334
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:29,278
But still, I think this is too unfair.

335
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,248
I cannot marry you.

336
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,628
If so,

337
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,658
you seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.

338
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,788
Not only that, you stopped me trying to go

339
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:48,788
against the King's word and tried to hurt me.

340
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:50,438
That is an attempt at assuming royal authority.

341
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:54,458
It is safe to call it treason.

342
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,318
Yes, that is exactly it.

343
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:00,038
This is...

344
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:03,728
treason.

345
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,008
Thank you, sir.

346
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:06,208
Yes, yes.

347
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,348
Wait for me! Wait.

348
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:10,228
Hurry up.

349
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,708
How do you like the yeot, Father?

350
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,748
It is very sweet.

351
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:23,538
Not only you,

352
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,538
but the family can lose their rank
and positions immediately.

353
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:29,928
Three generations can be executed,
so the family ceases to exist.

354
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:33,668
Who would be responsible
for the end of the Cha family?

355
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,588
Sun Chaek,

356
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:38,438
why couldn't you just marry him?

357
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,918
Why did you do that?

358
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:45,008
How dare you turn down the Prince Gyeongseong?

359
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:47,028
I never even got to marry.

360
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:49,328
You think I did?

361
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:53,028
This is where our family's bloodline ends.

362
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,658
My dear ancestors,

363
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:57,438
I am terribly sorry.

364
00:26:57,438 --> 00:26:59,948
I hope we do not...

365
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:03,428
meet again in the next life.

366
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,928
What if this family actually ceases

367
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:09,038
to exist because of me?

368
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,318
I'm sorry!

369
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,268
I'll get married.

370
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:21,358
So, please spare me.

371
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:22,758
What can I say?

372
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:25,598
You only had one chance.

373
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,768
This woman deceived me.

374
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,758
Kill her very cruelly and painfully.

375
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,648
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

376
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:39,428
She tarnished a royal's virginity.

377
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:41,828
Cha Sun Chaek, a traitor...

378
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,798
will be torn apart to death!

379
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:49,828
Spare me!

380
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,608
He was acting crazy earlier.

381
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,268
Why does he have such a sweet smile?

382
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:27,178
You must care about your family.

383
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:32,998
I care about all lives.

384
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:36,118
That's why I'd like to share the news about

385
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:40,018
my marriage personally with my dear family.

386
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,038
I'm their precious only daughter.

387
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,518
If I suddenly tell them I'll get married,
they'll feel disappointed.

388
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:48,608
Until I bring it up with them myself,

389
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:51,708
could you wait just a moment?

390
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,988
Sure, fine.

391
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:56,908
I will give you three days.

392
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,358
After three days,

393
00:28:58,358 --> 00:29:01,368
I will resend the wedding proposal.

394
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:05,578
How about you join the envoys in three months?

395
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,958
Get married during that time.

396
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,348
Your wedding will be

397
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:13,078
treated with utmost respect in the royal court.

398
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:15,838
You will not refuse this, will you?

399
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:20,548
Three days is... That's way too short.

400
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:23,568
No, it is more than enough.

401
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:26,038
As long as you do not try to run away.

402
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,038
If you are thinking that, you had better give up now.

403
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:32,908
Of course not.

404
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:37,878
The geography and security
of this city is in the palm of my hands.

405
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:40,188
If you want to confirm that,

406
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,328
feel free to try.

407
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:50,108
So, you did not come home last night

408
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:52,838
because you slept with the Prince...
the Prince Gyeongseong?

409
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:55,438
We didn't just sleep together.
It was his first time, apparently.

410
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:58,028
And he said to be responsible by marrying him.

411
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,818
How does that make sense?

412
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:02,708
So, what will he do about the wedding proposal?

413
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,678
He said he will resend it in three days.

414
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:08,218
So, I'll run far away as quickly as possible.

415
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:11,008
Pack everything that's small,
light, and worth money.

416
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,778
Oh, yes...

417
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:19,048
Why do you have to run away, by the way?

418
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:22,838
The Prince may not be the nicest person,

419
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:26,608
but he is a royal, handsome,
and all women desire him.

420
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,168
That makes him the best marriage material.

421
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:30,648
That is not all.

422
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:33,448
You will become the King's
relative by marrying him.

423
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:35,708
You will get paid regularly for that.

424
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,638
It would be an honor
to the family, too. Isn't that nice?

425
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:41,638
That has always been your dream.

426
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:43,248
My dream?
Yes.

427
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:46,098
Your dream has always been

428
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:48,938
marrying a son of a family that is suitable,

429
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:52,488
having as many children
as possible, living a happy life,

430
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,348
and ending your life in peace

431
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:57,988
while being cared for by your grandchildren.

432
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:01,488
I'd enjoy a lot of things as a royal,

433
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:04,798
but that would put me in danger, too.

434
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,138
No!

435
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:13,498
Spare us.

436
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,188
The female lead always...

437
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:18,588
face all sorts of hardship and danger.

438
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:21,398
Gosh, I don't want to be the female lead.

439
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,008
And most importantly...

440
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:26,848
The Prince is supposed to marry someone else.

441
00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:30,638
But you said he wants to marry you.

442
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,478
That's why I need to run away quickly.

443
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:35,748
That will not be easy.

444
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:39,388
If he sets his mind to it,
there is no one he cannot find

445
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,828
or get rid of in this world.

446
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:46,418
See?

447
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:48,308
He must've noticed you were running away.

448
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,378
What do I do?

449
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:02,628
Do you not even invite your guests to come in?

450
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:06,048
You cannot just barge in like this.

451
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,468
Are you okay, Bang Wool?

452
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,558
How dare you touch me?

453
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,788
Go outside and stay away.

454
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:23,848
What brings you here?

455
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:29,428
I stopped by to ask you something.

456
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:36,088
Last night, you suddenly left the club meeting.

457
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:40,098
You went to Prince Gyeongseong's Hoseondang and left this morning.

458
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:43,628
Someone I know saw it. Is that true?

459
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,568
That's...

460
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:49,248
T-The thing is-
It is true.

461
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:52,728
Well, I don't really remember it...

462
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:58,628
Don't try to lie, and say you do not remember because you were drunk.

463
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:04,328
By chance, did you spend the night with the Prince?

464
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:10,578
My hunch was correct.

465
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,938
You let me have the silk dress and sided with me

466
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:15,438
but you stabbed me in the back? How shameless-

467
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:16,998
Is this when...

468
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:20,618
Do Hwa Seon uses her signature
move by splashing water?

469
00:33:33,988 --> 00:33:35,808
What are you doing...

470
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,428
Were you prepared to disgrace me?

471
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:41,358
No, I didn't do that.

472
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:44,318
You splashed water at me first.

473
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:47,798
All I did was block it like this.

474
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:53,018
The fan the Queen Mother gave me was ruined.

475
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:02,068
I will repay you for this humiliation.

476
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:06,248
I will do so much more than
just splashing water next time.

477
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:08,328
Just wait and see.

478
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:17,378
What's going on?

479
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:20,438
Why do things keep going haywire?

480
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,598
I'm not supposed to do anything.

481
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:26,978
Why does my body keep moving against my will?

482
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,818
My Lady,

483
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:37,438
you do not have to do this for someone like me.

484
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,738
You are the only one who took revenge for me.

485
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:50,038
I will do anything for you from now on-

486
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,398
My Lady.

487
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,708
My Lady! My Lady!

488
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,908
Beon, what brings you here?

489
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:12,898
I am here because you said this place has the best view of Hanyang.

490
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:15,928
You never seemed to listen to me.

491
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:18,878
I have never seen you doing this.

492
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:23,198
So... have you really not been to this gazebo before?

493
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:26,698
Everyone knows about this one.

494
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:28,958
This is my first time here.

495
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:33,818
What has gotten into our Beon?

496
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:38,698
What made you visit a place for the first time?

497
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,808
You said your binoculars were broken.

498
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,348
Yes.

499
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:50,268
It broke... because I dropped it from a rooftop.

500
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:52,768
It was not easy to acquire these.

501
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:56,198
Let me get you a new pair.

502
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:58,358
Do you mean it?

503
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:00,248
But why?

504
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:02,488
I would love that,

505
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:05,078
but you are acting very suspiciously.

506
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:09,498
Let us say it is to celebrate my first visit here.

507
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,938
And most importantly,

508
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:16,628
it is because you are my first and only friend.

509
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:22,778
It looks like you find all things first meaningful.

510
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:28,458
I am still your only friend because you did not let anyone in afterward.

511
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:33,598
I thought everyone was like that.

512
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:38,348
It is... special because not everyone

513
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:41,378
cherishes the beginning.

514
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:44,408
I hope you have many beginnings.

515
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:49,288
That way, I would... strike more gold like this.

516
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:05,468
My Lady...

517
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,578
Plan A.

518
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:18,408
Escape.

519
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:23,618
We were told not to let any unwed noblewomen through the four gates.

520
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,798
This is something very urgent.

521
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:29,288
I cannot disobey the order from above, either.

522
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:33,818
My Lady is so ill.

523
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,698
She needs to rehabilitate in the countryside.

524
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:43,878
If that is why,

525
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:46,448
there is a good place
to rehabilitate in Hanyang, too.

526
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,488
It is called Hoseondang Spa.
Hoseondang?

527
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,058
It is a spa owned by the Prince Gyeongseong.

528
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:54,138
How about you go there instead?

529
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,718
My Lady! Gosh...

530
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,488
Let me do a search.

531
00:38:16,488 --> 00:38:20,638
As you can tell, I am not a noblewoman.

532
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:25,138
It is a search for finding a culprit.

533
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,368
Culprit?

534
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:28,958
As soon as we find the woman
who stole one and only thing

535
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,948
very precious to the Prince Gyeongseong,

536
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:37,158
we are supposed to arrest and detain her.

537
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:48,468
You had better just leave quietly.

538
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:51,338
If you walk past this gate,

539
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:54,708
he will send bounty hunters.

540
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,888
No way...

541
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,308
No!

542
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,118
Let me go!

543
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:07,018
We will bring her body if we have to!

544
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:17,778
No! No!

545
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,238
Lift her.

546
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:25,748
Okay, let us go.
Save me...

547
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:41,658
You appear to be in a good mood.

548
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,408
That cannot be.

549
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:51,358
You are mistaken.

550
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:56,168
Can I dare to tell you something?

551
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:02,578
Fear tactics do not work in this field.

552
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:07,018
The engagement policy works well in this case.

553
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,008
I can't seem to breathe.

554
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,058
If you really do not want to,

555
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:28,028
just make the Prince fall out of love with you.

556
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:32,018
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

557
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:34,858
Gosh, Bang Wool.

558
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,348
You're smarter than I thought, Bang Wool.

559
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:43,108
What would be a good way,
do you think, for example?

560
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:46,448
I am not sure.

561
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:49,098
I have thought about how to make someone like me,

562
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:52,848
but I have never tried to do the opposite.

563
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:55,068
The kind of woman men hate...

564
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:58,888
The kind of woman men hate?

565
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,328
Yes.

566
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:08,718
Perhaps I'm an expert in this field.

567
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,278
My Lord!

568
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:13,068
My Lord! My Lord!

569
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,238
My Lord. My Lord.

570
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,488
Send the wedding proposal in two days.

571
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:20,008
Is the rest of the preparation going well?

572
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:21,918
This is more urgent.

573
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:24,398
You need to see this.

574
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:41,628
What am I seeing right now?

575
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:44,248
I am not so sure, either.

576
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:48,128
Gosh, My Lord.

577
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:51,648
You must have missed me this morning.

578
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,628
What are you doing here?

579
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,078
Plan B.

580
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:06,348
Provoke the obsessive male lead.

581
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,408
As I know, Yi Beon from the novel

582
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:11,928
hates anything dirty and impure.

583
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:14,178
He won't be able to stand this.

584
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,388
Why do you look like this?

585
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:19,868
You smell, too.

586
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:22,258
Gosh, the fertilizer smell.

587
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:25,628
I dug up and ate some because I got hungry.

588
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:30,548
Unlike how I look, I love emergency crops like this.

589
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,198
And you aren't smelling fertilizer.

590
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:35,048
It's actual poop.

591
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:37,228
My stomach hurts because I ate too much.

592
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:40,668
So, I pooped and buried it there.

593
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:44,778
For cleaning, this foxtail grass is perfect.

594
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:51,918
As time goes by, it will fertilize Hoseondang's soil, too.

595
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,628
Disgusting and insufferable, right?

596
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:58,488
With your clean and perfectionist personality.

597
00:42:58,488 --> 00:42:59,818
Ditch me already.

598
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:02,248
I'm ready for it.

599
00:43:15,908 --> 00:43:21,368
A nobleman's daughter's hands... show signs of labor.

600
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:23,808
It's very refreshing and inspiring.

601
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:25,888
Pardon?
Not only do you have a common appetite,

602
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:27,928
you are harvesting emergency crops during

603
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:31,008
downtime to encourage and inspire others.

604
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,868
You will set an example...

605
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:34,808
as a royal.

606
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:45,828
Let us go.

607
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:47,638
Well, yes.

608
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:49,308
Yes...

609
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:52,808
Plan C.

610
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:56,508
A toxic woman's... vanity and extravagance.

611
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,908
Gosh, My Lady.

612
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:04,448
If you buy this much, even the Minister's family would run out of money soon.

613
00:44:04,448 --> 00:44:05,668
Shut up.

614
00:44:05,668 --> 00:44:06,758
I want to buy things.

615
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:08,918
How dare a servant lecture me?

616
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:12,328
Should I cut off your wrists immediately?

617
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:17,548
Gosh, for my delicate wrists... even this jewelry is so heavy.

618
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:19,858
You carry this, too.

619
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:26,578
Did I toss it that hard?

620
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:28,898
My Lady.

621
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:32,618
Gosh, the Prince Gyeongseong.

622
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:36,038
We run into each other often.

623
00:44:36,038 --> 00:44:37,058
What are you doing here?

624
00:44:37,058 --> 00:44:39,978
Our upcoming wedding has made me feel restless.

625
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:42,918
I wanted to adorn myself from head to toe.

626
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:45,638
I bought the best goods in Joseon...

627
00:44:45,638 --> 00:44:48,128
No, I only bought imported goods.

628
00:44:48,128 --> 00:44:49,318
Why?

629
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:53,218
Because I worship foreign countries.

630
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:59,408
I want to continue to buy all the limited edition goods from Japan and China from now on.

631
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:03,778
Can you buy them for me the rest of my life, Prince Gyeongseong?

632
00:45:03,778 --> 00:45:06,898
A clueless beauty who spends taxpayers' money.

633
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:11,238
A royal like Yi Beon won't tolerate this, right?

634
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,378
Aigoo, so heavy...

635
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:23,538
You need to dress like this to be on my level.

636
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:26,748
Envoys are visiting us in a few months.

637
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:28,948
Please assist me with that.

638
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,898
You have a global taste, too.

639
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:40,798
What? What's going on?

640
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:42,968
It's not working at all.

641
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:46,708
Why is he so impenetrable?

642
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:51,378
Plan D.

643
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:53,558
Fatalism.

644
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:10,698
What brings you here at this late hour?

645
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:14,178
You could not have missed me already.

646
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:19,588
We're not supposed to miss each other.

647
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:20,748
What do you mean by that?

648
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:25,788
Using your fortune... and mine, I checked our compatibility.

649
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:31,748
How is our compatibility?

650
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:39,908
It says if we get married, you're destined to die young, apparently.

651
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:45,648
It does not matter.

652
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:46,788
Pardon?

653
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:49,988
I-It doesn't matter?

654
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:53,418
They say you will die if you marry me.

655
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:58,888
I think of this life... as a bonus, anyway.

656
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:03,278
If I could meet someone I love and live happily, even briefly,

657
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:08,328
I will think of it as a gift from my parents and accept it willingly.

658
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:13,018
No, I'll become a widow.

659
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:16,348
All of my assets will become yours, then.

660
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:17,968
However,

661
00:47:20,108 --> 00:47:21,818
you cannot remarry.

662
00:47:21,818 --> 00:47:25,558
I will not allow you another man even if I am dead.

663
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,328
Plan E.

664
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:43,068
Become religious.

665
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,988
A noble lady is joining the temple?

666
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:49,158
Yes, that is correct.

667
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,298
Being free from material desires and pain...

668
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:52,628
Especially Yi Beon.

669
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:54,398
is my wish.

670
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:56,158
Please accept me-

671
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:59,608
I am sorry, but you cannot join the temple.

672
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:02,638
How did you know I was here?

673
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:10,348
Do you know each other?

674
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:14,208
Of course. We know each other very well.

675
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,528
Why do you say she cannot join us?

676
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,378
You only need faith in Buddha's world-

677
00:48:19,378 --> 00:48:23,168
This maiden lacks in faith.

678
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,808
First of all,

679
00:48:24,808 --> 00:48:27,218
she loves drinking. Very much so.

680
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:29,048
I can quit.

681
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:30,878
Of course, I should.

682
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:32,778
And she loves eating meat.

683
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:34,778
For breakfasts, her family

684
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,178
eats meat from land, sea, and sky.

685
00:48:37,178 --> 00:48:40,168
I ate it because they were there.

686
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,618
They were there.

687
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,088
I can go vegetarian, ma'am.

688
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,758
And I won't eat much, either.

689
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,738
So, please accept me.

690
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:51,928
Please spare me.

691
00:48:52,908 --> 00:48:55,008
It is up to her to join the temple.

692
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:57,588
No one can stop someone from doing that.

693
00:48:57,588 --> 00:49:00,738
Ma'am, I just thought about something

694
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,568
I forgot to mention.

695
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:06,708
It is a reason she cannot become a monk.

696
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,368
What is it...

697
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:18,238
Can a woman who is not celibate become a monk?

698
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:19,598
P-Pardon?

699
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:21,338
It's not true, ma'am!

700
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:22,918
You lie now?

701
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,078
Lying is not permitted in Buddha's world.

702
00:49:26,078 --> 00:49:27,928
Don't listen to this man, ma'am.

703
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:30,848
I-
Gosh, stop!

704
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:33,368
I am the one she spent the night-

705
00:49:33,368 --> 00:49:35,478
Namu Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...

706
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:38,908
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...
He's out of his mind, ma'am.

707
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:40,248
I swear it's not true.

708
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:42,618
You will not become a monk.

709
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:45,688
Forget about the plans.

710
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:47,768
Is running away at night the only option?

711
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:49,368
Just run away.

712
00:49:49,368 --> 00:49:51,018
Nothing works.

713
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:53,538
How could this be?

714
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:57,508
I just need to disappear.

715
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:04,518
Wow, we smelled makeup powder
in the middle of the night.

716
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:05,758
We had to come check.

717
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:08,278
It is not just the makeup powder.

718
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:11,428
I smell gold, too.

719
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:13,648
I'll give you this.

720
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:15,808
I swear I didn't see anything.

721
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:17,268
It's so dark.

722
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:20,578
It looks like you are a nobleman's daughter.

723
00:50:20,578 --> 00:50:23,428
Should we sell the jewelry and silk?

724
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:26,278
I knew I had a lucky dream.

725
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:29,038
We will finally make good money.

726
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:31,528
Help me!

727
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:35,968
Screaming will not help.

728
00:50:35,968 --> 00:50:38,928
There are not even ants here at night.

729
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:42,428
So, go ahead-

730
00:50:45,568 --> 00:50:47,148
What?

731
00:50:47,148 --> 00:50:48,508
Geez.

732
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,688
This is...

733
00:50:52,268 --> 00:50:53,448
yeot.

734
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:56,688
Yeot fell from the sky?

735
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:22,848
Gosh, my apologies.

736
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:26,588
I was eating yeot while stargazing.

737
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:29,198
But I dropped it by accident.

738
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,918
Supporting character, Jung Su Gyeom?

739
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:33,808
Are you okay?

740
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:35,518
Help me.
Geez.

741
00:51:35,518 --> 00:51:38,748
You look like a pretty boy.
Come on.

742
00:51:38,748 --> 00:51:40,788
Do not do anything dangerous now.

743
00:51:40,788 --> 00:51:42,538
Since we are in this situation,

744
00:51:42,538 --> 00:51:44,558
we will have to kill you both.

745
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:46,208
I will take the lady.

746
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,388
No, I will take the lady.

747
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:51,408
Do you have a sword? Can you fight?

748
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:54,898
We're dead.

749
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,018
Are you a good runner?

750
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:57,558
Pardon?

751
00:51:57,558 --> 00:51:59,728
It is okay if you aren't.

752
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:07,558
They are running away.

753
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:10,348
I said I will take the lady.

754
00:52:32,638 --> 00:52:35,348
Eat this yeot, you thieves.

755
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:41,438
Yes, my type has always been

756
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:44,198
the supporting characters.

757
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:50,778
Why was a nobleman's daughter

758
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:54,058
roaming in the mountains at night?

759
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,748
You are the Chief State Minister's
daughter, correct?

760
00:52:56,748 --> 00:52:58,418
How did you know...

761
00:52:58,418 --> 00:52:59,788
To be honest,

762
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:04,428
I stopped by the teahouse
on the night of the full moon.

763
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:07,018
Y-You saw me at the teahouse?

764
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,468
Yes.

765
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:12,488
You made drinks in such a fun and satisfying way.

766
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:15,718
It was so impressive that I could not forget.

767
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:17,918
What's this?

768
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:21,018
Jung Su Gyeom was there that night, too?

769
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,758
My film cut off that night...

770
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:30,498
I mean, I cannot remember that night.

771
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:34,218
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

772
00:53:34,218 --> 00:53:36,188
I do not know how to return the favor.

773
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:38,618
You do not have to do anything special.

774
00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:40,768
But I have a request.

775
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:43,728
Would you say yes?

776
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:46,358
Of course. Tell me.

777
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:49,598
Could you join the Seonmun Club

778
00:53:49,598 --> 00:53:51,578
that I created?

779
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:53,298
Seonmun Club?

780
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:55,888
Seonmun Club is a drinking club

781
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:59,858
disguised as an astrology club started by him.

782
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:03,688
I have always been interested
in the sun, moon, and stars.

783
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:06,548
I started the club to study the celestial bodies'

784
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:10,168
movements and discuss life and fate.

785
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:13,848
I know that's just an excuse to drink.

786
00:54:13,848 --> 00:54:15,648
Don't try to make it sound impressive.

787
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:17,588
Jung Su Gyeom is smoother than I thought.

788
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,158
I heard the next full moon will be big.

789
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:23,588
How about we enjoy your fascinating

790
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:25,998
and unusual drinks together, then?

791
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:30,048
The cocktails made a great impact.

792
00:54:30,048 --> 00:54:33,488
But I'm running away now.

793
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:36,418
I appreciate the suggestion, sir.

794
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:40,148
But a nobleman's daughter can't leave home at night

795
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:42,648
and drink on top of that.

796
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:45,998
But if you want the recipes for the cocktails,

797
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:49,028
I'll write them down for you.

798
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:50,328
You cannot.

799
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,968
I want you to teach me everything

800
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:55,018
directly in person. And...

801
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:58,718
it is not about alcohol.

802
00:54:59,518 --> 00:55:01,328
Studying the sky is...

803
00:55:01,328 --> 00:55:05,268
the most romantic thing
the current youth can enjoy.

804
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:11,078
I want you to enjoy the romantic experience, too.

805
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:23,718
You will not say no to me, will you,
Maiden Sun Chaek?

806
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:30,598
J-Just once, then.

807
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:32,218
I do not allow it.

808
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:50,648
Beon.

809
00:55:55,598 --> 00:55:57,918
What brings you here?

810
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:00,338
And what do you mean you will not allow?

811
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:02,658
I am planning to ban all the gatherings between

812
00:56:02,658 --> 00:56:06,908
unwed men and women of the capital for now.

813
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:09,708
Why all of a sudden?

814
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:15,938
There is something I need to protect and manage.

815
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:26,328
The yellow leaves are so nice.

816
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:32,028
Fellas, isn't that Sun Chaek?

817
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:37,858
What are you all doing here?

818
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:41,578
What are you doing here, then?

819
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:47,648
You were here, too, Prince Gyeongseong.

820
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:49,758
Let us greet you.

821
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:52,328
Yes.

822
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:55,968
Are you my future brothers-in-law?

823
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:02,878
Brothers-in-law, did you say?

824
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,598
I think you heard him wrong, Hyungnim.

825
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:07,758
No, he heard me correctly.

826
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,848
It sounds like your sister...

827
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:12,798
did not tell you anything.

828
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:17,008
What strange things
were you talking about, anyway?

829
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:21,538
I, Prince Gyeongseong,
will declare directly and openly.

830
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,338
Right now?

831
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:28,628
Your sister and I will soon-

832
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:33,128
She will soon-

833
00:57:33,878 --> 00:57:36,358
Cover your ears. Cover your ears.

834
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:39,108
W-What...
No, no!

835
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:42,468
She will soon-
No!

836
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:05,638
This handsome psycho's
obsession for his first night

837
00:58:05,638 --> 00:58:10,278
will end when I die, it seems.

838
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:16,428
Sun Chaek!

839
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,498
[Epilogue]
Gosh, gosh...

840
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:29,518
You should have watched where you were going.

841
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:32,738
Shit. What about you, then?

842
00:58:32,738 --> 00:58:34,568
Geez, should I hit you or not?

843
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:36,358
This is your fault.
My fault?

844
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:37,748
You little...

845
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:48,198
Why are you doing this to us?

846
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:49,978
We were just passing by-

847
00:58:49,978 --> 00:58:51,738
Do you know...

848
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:54,938
who you dared to threaten?

849
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:58,508
She will become my wife soon.
Me, Prince Gyeongseong.

850
00:58:58,508 --> 00:59:00,358
Prince Gyeongseong...

851
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:02,028
F-Forgive us.

852
00:59:02,028 --> 00:59:04,378
We were just trying to feed ourselves to survive.

853
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:09,558
By the way, she ran away
holding another man's hand.

854
00:59:09,558 --> 00:59:11,388
No, don't...

855
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:14,048
If you did this to feed yourselves and survive,

856
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:16,408
I should get rid of your mouths first.

857
00:59:16,408 --> 00:59:18,288
Pardon?
Pardon?

858
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:21,408
S-Spare us!

859
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,078
Beg him right now.

860
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:26,138
Forgive us. Please spare us.

861
00:59:26,138 --> 00:59:27,928
We do not know what we did, but...

862
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:30,408
Y-You saw me at the teahouse?

863
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:32,208
It was so impressive that I could not forget.

864
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,448
Consider yourselves lucky today.

865
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:37,328
