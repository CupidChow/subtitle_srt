1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,070
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,710
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,390
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,960
Just marry Maiden Sun Chaek already.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,530
Why did you have to do this?

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,610
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,050
Maiden Eun Ae...

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,710
She participated in the selection to marry you.

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,890
So?

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,010
Do you...

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,360
Do you really not know how I feel?

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,270
How am I supposed to know how you feel?

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,410
I love Maiden Eun Ae.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,000
If she ends up getting selected,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,780
what am I supposed to do?

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,060
You scared me for that reason?

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,660
Do not belittle this matter.

18
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,310
My life depends on it.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,830
My Lord.

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,070
I caught him as he was running away.

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,050
Where is he?

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,870
This way.

23
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,570
I am not done yet-

24
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,160
Beon!

25
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,900
Just kill me.

26
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,490
You must know about this

27
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,690
filthy object better than anyone.

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,730
Did the Do family hire you?

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,020
Why did you approach Cha Sun Chaek?

30
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,170
You did such a thing without being

31
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,520
prepared to go through this?

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,170
Compared to the pain my woman had to endure,

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,660
it is not even close.

34
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,300
Just make sure he does not die.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,730
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,860
Did you say he got off the ship
that belongs to the Do family?

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,780
Yes, as soon as he got off,

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,590
I confirmed that he went to
the Right State Minister's house.

39
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,810
Do Hwa Seon will be the key to this.

40
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,810
What are you planning to do?

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,590
I need to find evidence from her directly.

42
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,470
Directly?

43
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,140
You will not seduce her, will you?

44
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,090
It might look suspicious.

45
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,970
Do not tell anyone.

46
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,900
Not even Lady Sun Chaek?

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,800
She might end up in danger.

48
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,470
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,600
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,800
That is the task I am giving you.

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,030
[Episode 6: Fishing ground and disguise]

52
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,320
It's such a difficult task.

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,680
It's a task suited for the Queen.

54
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
You have an advantage
since you've run a merchant store.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
I really can't think of anything.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,410
I think it is about wisdom
rather than business skills.

57
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,080
That's even harder.

58
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,350
My Lady!

59
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,520
Bang Wool, do you have any good ideas?

60
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,560
How would I know anything?

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,900
I should've learned
about investing if I had known.

62
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,820
My Lady.
Yes?

63
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,300
I am certain someone is following you.

64
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,920
Again?

65
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,070
Why don't you stop and come out now?

66
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,540
Otherwise, I'll tell Prince Gyengseong that

67
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,820
you followed me so obviously.

68
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,920
How did you know?

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,260
I knew you were Ma Yun
from the way you were acting.

70
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,360
How do you know my name?

71
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,800
I know a lot more

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,650
about this place than you think I do.

73
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,750
Still, why did you follow me so obviously?

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,190
I feel so uncomfortable.

75
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,620
My Lord ordered me to

76
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,270
protect you during the selection.

77
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,270
Tell him to protect me himself if he's so worried.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,300
He is not able to come himself.

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,330
Why not?

80
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,590
I cannot tell you just yet.

81
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,400
Don't follow me around, then.

82
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,560
I cannot go against his order.

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,800
Both you and your lord won't listen.

84
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,590
From now on,

85
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,780
I will protect you discreetly.

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,690
Gosh, seriously!

87
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,570
What the hell are you doing?

88
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,490
I-I am sorry.

89
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,270
How will you compensate for all this?

90
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,890
Gosh, seriously.

91
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,270
Geez.

92
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,140
I will compensate you.

93
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,420
How much will it be?

94
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,050
Because of the bad crops this year,

95
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,040
rice is impossible to get right now.

96
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,050
Rice is more precious than any treasure nowadays.

97
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,230
Even a nobleman's daughter

98
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,010
will not be able to compensate me for this.

99
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,020
Geez.

100
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,540
Do not do it, My Lady.
It's okay. Do it together.

101
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,930
Your hands will get dirty.

102
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,040
Seriously.

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,590
How upsetting.

104
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,190
Geez.

105
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,970
Is that all you can do with 10 nyang?

106
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,010
Your heads are good for nothing, are they not?

107
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,160
If your head is good for nothing,

108
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,340
why is it so big?

109
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,950
I suppose.

110
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,760
What do I expect from you people?

111
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,310
You are so useless.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,810
I cannot stand you. Be gone!

113
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,400
Queen Mother acted like she would help me.

114
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,590
But she did not give me any hint.

115
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,520
B-By chance, is she trying to test me, too?

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,730
I do not know what she is thinking.

117
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,720
If only he did not mess up,

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,230
Prince Gyeongseong would have been mine.

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,480
Now, he is nowhere to be seen.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,730
What a bastard.

121
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,400
Whatever.

122
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,030
Eating tasty food will give me an idea, right?

123
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,720
Right.

124
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,260
Prince Gyeongseong!

125
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,910
Prince Gyeongseong...

126
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,240
Prince Gyeongseong! Prince Gyeongseong...

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,260
Huh? What's going on? Was I mistaken?

128
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,060
I don't think so.

129
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,050
Watch where you are going!

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,200
Prince Gyeongseong.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,950
I ran into you again.

132
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,010
Is this fate, too?

133
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,950
I wanted to say hello to the maidens
participating in the selection.

134
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,170
I am glad I ran into you.

135
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,730
It is my mistake,

136
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,840
but I am not sure if I can let a man inside.

137
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,260
I could become your husband in the future.

138
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,970
My gosh.

139
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,010
I would like to get changed.

140
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,940
Oh, come this way.

141
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,640
And...

142
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,470
I am a bit thirsty, too.

143
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,730
I will get you something.

144
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,760
Please wait inside.

145
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,010
You had better not go anywhere.

146
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,390
Would you like cold or warm water...

147
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,630
Oh, gosh!

148
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,440
I felt stuffy, so...

149
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,710
You can take off more.

150
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,910
I got you water.

151
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,000
I prefer tea over water.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
Tea is nice.

153
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,340
I will brew you a strong one.

154
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,960
I would like you to brew it as long as you can.

155
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,390
Yes. I will get it for you.

156
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,030
What is the point of working so hard?

157
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,230
It is indeed a bad year of harvest.

158
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,820
The nobles do not know.

159
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,410
It has been like this for a while.

160
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,070
We are screwed.

161
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,940
The ground looks good, though.

162
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,450
Excuse me.

163
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,200
Are you the owner of this field?

164
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,190
Why do you ask?
Can I borrow this place briefly?

165
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,340
Will you plant rice in this bad crop year?

166
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,130
I'm thinking of growing something else.

167
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,730
I will borrow it just for two days.

168
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,110
Here.

169
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,340
Will this be enough?

170
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,260
I wonder if there's one.

171
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,820
What? What's this noise?

172
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,580
My Lady, look that way.

173
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,970
What a shock out of the blue.

174
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,550
I am about to lose both a friend and a woman.

175
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,100
I understand how that feels, too.

176
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
I should step aside now, should I not?

177
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,510
Can you give up on the woman
you love for a friend?

178
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,100
How close is he to Prince Gyeongseong?

179
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,230
It was not in the book.

180
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,670
But I've always been curious.

181
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,470
You cannot even kill it.

182
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,100
Should I cut you first?
Go ahead and try.

183
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,710
"Life and death share the same body.

184
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,200
Just as hardship and growth come hand in hand."

185
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,610
That is what my late mother said.

186
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,810
"Neung" as in despise. "So" as in the sky.

187
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,360
No matter how poor the weather is,

188
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,970
it blossoms without care.
That is why it is called that.

189
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,590
You and I...

190
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,800
seem to be going through hardship.

191
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,950
Let us hang in there like this flower and blossom.

192
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,300
All right?

193
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,210
I am Beon's only friend.

194
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,770
But how could I...

195
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,190
possibly betray him?

196
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,900
But don't be so sad.

197
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,120
Lady Eun Ae didn't want to participate, either.

198
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,630
I-Is that true?

199
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,890
According to her, she had no choice

200
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,590
but to participate because of her father.

201
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,420
If so, I still have a chance. Do I not?

202
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,300
I should tell her how I feel right now, then.

203
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,650
Gosh, hold on.

204
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,550
There is no time. I need to run to her house and-

205
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,350
I mean,

206
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,330
if you suddenly visit her,

207
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,000
Lady Eun Ae would be so flustered.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,070
If then,

209
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,850
how can I win her heart?

210
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,040
Sir Su Gyeom,

211
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,590
don't say you've never courted a woman before...

212
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,390
I didn't know Jung Su Gyeom
was such a dating rookie.

213
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,550
The ones who look normal on the outside

214
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,510
usually have hidden flaws.

215
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,700
My Lady.

216
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,300
Please buy one.

217
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
What's all this?

218
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,470
They are jewelry I made.

219
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,320
They bring good luck.

220
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,630
Come on.

221
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,970
It is true.

222
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,770
I am taking a very important test right now.

223
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,740
Is there one that would let me pass?

224
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,220
This one.

225
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,460
You will definitely pass with this.

226
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,810
Really?

227
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,800
This looks prettier to me.

228
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,690
That is called Hoshinok.

229
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,970
It protects you and prolongs your lifespan.

230
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,480
Oh, I see.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,300
How about this one, then?

232
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,320
That is called Inyeonok.

233
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,000
It connects you with the one you love

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,360
and it lets you two overcome hardship together.

235
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,790
Oh, wow...

236
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,700
You have a lot of impressive stuff.

237
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,650
Inyeonok needs to be purchased as a pair.

238
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,960
It costs twice as much.

239
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,560
Which one would you like?

240
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,250
How do you like the tea?

241
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,780
It is unique.

242
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,210
You cannot get it in this country.

243
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,040
It is a very rare tea from the Middle East.

244
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,800
Even Merchant Cho probably cannot get this.

245
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Does the Do family get a lot
of things from overseas?

246
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,930
Since we have been diplomats for generations,

247
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,610
we have a lot of connections overseas.

248
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,270
Once you start looking outside this country,

249
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,450
you find so many fun things all over.

250
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,780
Fun things, huh?

251
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,020
I would like to know what those things are.

252
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,470
Should I show you something fun?

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
I am only showing this to you.

254
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,980
Of course, if we become a family,

255
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,140
all of this will become yours.

256
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,060
What a unique symbol.

257
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,400
Those are rare objects from England.

258
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,230
I am sure only we own objects with that symbol.

259
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,380
That is perfect for you.

260
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,790
Do you pull the trigger like this?

261
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,020
Pull it.

262
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,980
Pull the trigger of your heart.

263
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,360
I am willing to take your bullet.

264
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,770
I had fun browsing.

265
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,020
I will leave, then.

266
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,870
My Lord.

267
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,190
There is something I want to tell you.

268
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,400
I want to give this to him quickly.

269
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,270
Burn these clothes immediately.

270
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,730
Burn these valuable clothes?

271
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,310
They are just pieces of fabric

272
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,520
touched by an awful person.

273
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,760
Oh, yes.

274
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
I will follow your order.

275
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,800
I do not know how that vixen
Cha Sun Chaek stole your heart,

276
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,900
but I thought you should know her true side.

277
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,250
True side?

278
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,060
The thing is...

279
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,360
To be honest, you are not the only man

280
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,600
who were intimate with her.

281
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,520
I heard a Westerner who came to the capital

282
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,080
recently was intimate with her.

283
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,910
I heard she even promised
to run away overseas with him.

284
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,050
She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.

285
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,290
She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.

286
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,940
And I can't believe she
participated in the selection.

287
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,110
Is she not so devious?

288
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,560
The Cha family has kept her inside for a reason.

289
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,640
By the way,

290
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,620
how do you know about that?

291
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,010
Pardon?
You speak as if

292
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,410
you saw and heard it yourself.

293
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,160
Actually, that Westerner is from England.

294
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,980
He told me himself.

295
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,200
That is how I know for certain.

296
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,730
[Westerner]

297
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,230
[Cha Sun Chaek]

298
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,340
[Cha Sun Chaek]

299
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,450
She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.

300
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,510
She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.

301
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,270
Beautiful day, right?

302
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,940
Yes.

303
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,130
How dare she try to frame

304
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,220
my woman with such nonsense?

305
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,510
I feel much better.

306
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,940
Is there something on my face?

307
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,260
Yes.

308
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,740
I see emotions in it.

309
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,730
I have not seen them

310
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,620
on your face for a long time.

311
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,970
It is not a bad thing.

312
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,660
Thanks to Lady Sun Chaek, you have
found different emotions of life again.

313
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,840
I feel so relieved.

314
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,190
Don't be silly.

315
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,280
I will finish things up here. Go in and rest.

316
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,820
Have a good night.

317
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,050
Have a good night.

318
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,210
Good night?

319
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,760
No such a thing for me...

320
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,360

why...

342
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,950
did you want to meet me?

343
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,870
Because I like you.

344
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,000
I've always wanted to fall in love

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,990

Up until recently,

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,880
she was just one of the women
I crossed paths with.

352
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,060
But I cannot let her go.

353
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,590
I must have you.

354
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,180
No.

355
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,280
I will have you.

356
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,600
I will spend my first night with you.

357
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,100
Even if she got sober

358
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,060
and does not remember tonight,

359
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I just need to make her keep falling for me.

360
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,740
I will devote my last moment to you as well.

361
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,840
Since that night,

362
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,210
my nights have been different
than the ones before.

363
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,250
Prince Gyeongseong!

364
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,980
Prince Gyeongseong!

365
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,740
Prince Gyeongseong...

366
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,600
Huh? Was I mistaken?

367
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,340
I don't think so.

368
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,790
I miss her.

369
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,220
Did you find the answer
to the Queen Mother's question?

370
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,530
Yes.

371
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,890
Starting with Suk Gyeong of the Jeong family,
the daughter of the royal secretary,

372
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,580
give the answer you prepared.

373
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,280
I bought rice seedlings with 10 nyang.

374
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,170
What would you do...

375
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,010
if it does not rain after you
planted the seedlings?

376
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,450
I offered 10 nyang to a temple

377
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,460
and prayed for the country's well-being.

378
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,590
Since I prayed and offered with a sincere heart,

379
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,470
it is worth more than 10 nyang-
Next.

380
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,720
I bravely went to a gambling house with 10 nyang,

381
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,680
but I lost all of it.

382
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,490
So, I learned that I should never gamble

383
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,140
with 10 nyang from now on.

384
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,260
She's so proud.

385
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,440
Next.

386
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,630
I decided to melt the 10 nyang

387
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,930
you gave to me.

388
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,670
With the copper from the melted coins,

389
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,720
I created a one-of-a-kind ring.

390
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,400
The ring will be handed down over generations.

391
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,520
I will cherish Queen Mother's

392
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,250
virtuousness without forgetting
the value of 10 nyang.

393
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,800
What a sweet gesture.

394
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,660
Next.

395
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:56,670
With 10 nyang, I gave orphans
food and a brush each.

396
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,850
I think nurturing the talents
of the future is a guaranteed way

397
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,950
to enrich the country and secure its well-being.

398
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,590
However,

399
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,270
can you guarantee the children
would turn out the way you want?

400
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,770
Next.

401
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,320
Using the 10 nyang you gave me,

402
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,210
I borrowed an unused paddy field

403
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,340
and put catfish and loaches there.

404
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,990
What kind of nonsense is that?

405
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,270
Catfish and loaches are natural enemies.

406
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,080
If you put enemies together,

407
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,320
their survival instinct strengthens

408
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,160
and they naturally reproduce
more and get stronger.

409
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,080
Using that fact, I turned 10 nyang

410
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,870
into this much.

411
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,830
By selling catfish and loaches to
paddy fields with poor harvests,

412
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,200
I was able to make a lot in a short period of time.

413
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Some people lament the drought,

414
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,880
but I wanted to find a new solution
in the midst of that.

415
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,130
Even empty fields with poor harvests

416
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,160
can be lucrative if you change your thinking.

417
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,990
Crises can always be turned into
opportunities. Do you not think so?

418
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,170
I will announce the final three maidens

419
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,400
who will advance to the final round.

420
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,310
The first maiden.

421
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,160
Right State Minister Do Bae Myeong's daughter,

422
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,340
Hwa Seon of the Do family.

423
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,470
Congratulations.

424
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,870
The next is...

425
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,850
Scholar Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

426
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,870
Eun Ae of the Cho family.

427
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,500
Good work.

428
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,560
And the last one is...

429
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,730
the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's daughter,

430
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,280
Sun Chaek of the Cha family.

431
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,330
You received the highest score
in the second round.

432
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,560
Thank you.

433
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,810
Nonsense.

434
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,500
How could she win first place?

435
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,540
The final round, Samgantaek,

436
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,830
will be held at the Queen Mother's
Palace in two days.

437
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,760
What's the deal?

438
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,530
It's my first time winning first place.

439
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,560
Goodness, I can't believe I used that this way.

440
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,290
Natural enemies. In Korean, it's "cheonjeok."

441
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,790
What happens if you put them together?

442
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,230
You can take catfish and loaches as examples.

443
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,340
In a paddy field, if you put loaches on one side

444
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,640
and catfish on the other side
and grow them together,

445
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,170
the loaches on the catfish side
grow much stronger.

446
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,650
Why is that?

447
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,150
To avoid the natural enemy...

448
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,470
Wow! I cannot believe how fun the selection is.

449
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,970
The second round was fierce, too.

450
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,920
D-Did the second round result come out?

451
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,110
Yes.

452
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,910
By giving the best answers to the Queen Mother,

453
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,360
the three maidens were selected.

454
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,100
I liked Lady Cho Eun Ae's answer the most.

455
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,710
Yes, her answer was nice.

456
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,820
Which means...

457
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,760
Lady Eun Ae passed the second round?

458
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,400
Prince Gyeongseong!

459
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,900
Hello, Lady Sun Chaek.

460
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,860
Hello. I'm here to see Prince Gyeongseong.

461
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,460
He went to bed early.

462
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,970
The sun hasn't even set yet.

463
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,180
I just need a moment. Can't you let me?

464
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,200
He'd be thrilled to hear this news.

465
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,860
I think you should go back home today.

466
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,800
You did such an amazing job today.

467
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,020
But you look so upset.

468
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm not. I just need to think about something.

469
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,190
By chance, is it about Prince Gyeongseong?

470
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,340
What are you talking about?
Never. It's not like that, okay?

471
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,980
What's gotten into you, then?

472
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,540
After running Madam's errand yesterday,

473
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,520
I saw Prince Gyeongseong.

474
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,700
Really? Did he seem busy?

475
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,730
He looked so tired and mopey, right?

476
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,960
It's not that.

477
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,890
Lady Do Hwa Seon and Prince Gyeongseong
were stuck together

478
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,490
and went inside Lady Do's house.

479
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,340
Locking arms, even.

480
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,070
He locked arms with Do Hwa Seon?

481
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,980
Come on. You must've been mistaken.

482
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,110
I can recognize people from even 10 ri away.

483
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,960
I know what I saw.

484
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,230
But I could not chase them inside her house.

485
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,170
So, I am just telling you what I saw.

486
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,960
By chance, was he on his way to see her, too?

487
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,240
No. I'll just ask him.

488
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,270
Bang Wool, go to the Hoseondang now

489
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,550
and tell the servant there that
I will come by early in the morning.

490
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,180
So, Prince Gyeongseong must
see me before he leaves.

491
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,360
A-All right...

492
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,070
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

493
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,620
Father.

494
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,860
Father, please talk to the Queen Mother.

495
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,060
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong has feelings for me.

496
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,660
My hard work finally paid off and

497
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,640
Prince Gyeongseong opened up to me.

498
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,980
Is that not a relief, then?

499
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,440
Father, things are going so well.

500
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,190
It would be so humiliating
if I failed to be selected.

501
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,120
The final round is still ahead.

502
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,410
Trust the Queen Mother.

503
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,860
No. We need to take action while he is interested.

504
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,520
We cannot delay this. Please?

505
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,730
Do something, Father.

506
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,170
All right, I will.

507
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,470
You mean it, right?

508
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,610
I said I will, did I not?

509
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,550
Maiden Eun Ae.

510
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,710
What brings you here?

511
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,340
I was waiting for you.

512
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,550
Maiden Eun Ae,

513
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,930
It will not be good...

514
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,590
to do this here.

515
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,700
Sir,

516
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,690
you put me in a tricky position
if you come by without notice.

517
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,640
You know I am participating in the selection.

518
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,720
I do, but...

519
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,470
At the Seonmun Club meeting,

520
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,720
you said you would grant me a wish
if I drank your penalty drink for you.

521
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,590
I did.

522
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,390
I will tell you my wish now.

523
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,280
Stay away from me for a while.

524
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
What do you mean-

525
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,720
I need to do well in the selection
to obey my father.

526
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,050
Can you not quit the selection?

527
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,990
I cannot go against my father's wish.

528
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,450
If I get caught seeing you privately
during the selection,

529
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,150
things would get very difficult for me.

530
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,400
I do know how you feel, Sir.

531
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,130
If you do not mind,

532
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,850
could you wait for me for just a little while?

533
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,290
Gosh, it must be her.

534
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,460
She filled a rice paddy with fish?

535
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,800
Why did I just hear about her?

536
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,000
What a pretty lady.

537
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,970
Oh, yes. It's me.

538
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,550
She has not come in a while.

539
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,860
Did she forget me already?

540
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,980
Anyway, I wonder if her wish came true.

541
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,170
Prince Gyeongseong!

542
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,830
You came, My Lady.

543
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,870
Is Prince Gyeongseong up and about?

544
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,000
What is it? Is he not up yet?

545
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,800
No, the thing is...

546
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,430
I relayed your message to him,

547
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,200
but when I went inside a moment ago,

548
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,080
he was already gone.

549
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,870
Where did he go off to?

550
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,250
I do not know, either.

551
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,490
My apologies, My Lady.

552
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,990
What's going on?

553
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,200
Is he treating me like a fish he already caught?

554
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,450
My Lady!

555
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,310
Lady Sun Chaek!

556
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:43,050
My Lady, there is no time for this now.
What is it?

557
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,600
I was told the final round is happening today.

558
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,290
You need to prepare to enter the Palace now.

559
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,830
What?

560
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,410
Bang Wool, make me look the best in Hanyang

561
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,780
so no one looks better than me.

562
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,010
I thought you were all about being frugal lately.

563
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,500
No. I no longer need to be frugal.

564
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,200
I'll shine brighter than anyone.

565
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,780
Like the female lead.

566
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,260
The final round starts!

567
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,860
The theme of the final round...

568
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,930
is virtue.

569
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,590
Do not be so nervous.

570
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,360
You have worked so hard.

571
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,610
I will treat you to some tea.

572
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,010
Do you have a flower you want to resemble?

573
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,970
I like peonies.

574
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,510
I-I...

575
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,120
like lotus flowers.

576
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,950
They grow in the mud,

577
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,610
but they blossom without

578
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,710
getting dirty at all.

579
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,290
I want to be like gossypiums.

580
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,280
No matter how beautiful other flowers are,

581
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,320
they only blossom for a season.

582
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,330
But gossypiums become the
people's clothes and blankets.

583
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,450
They are the most beautiful flowers in the world.

584
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,430
To be honest, I was never
so interested in flowers.

585
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,440
But I recently learned about trumpet vine flowers.

586
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,690
I was touched the moment I learned its meaning.

587
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,120
Just like the trumpet vine flowers,
I want to overcome

588
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,720
hardships such as heat and torrential rain

589
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,970
and blossom for everyone to see.

590
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,090
Yes.

591
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,000
Hardships?

592
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,360
If your husband faces hardships,

593
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,530
what would be your priority as a wife?

594
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,330
I think my priority is to be disciplined

595
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,240
based on the elders' judgment and wisdom

596
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,250
when times are tough.

597
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,530
I will believe that I would learn
from the hardship

598
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,240
and quietly endure until it passes.

599
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,460
I think not going through hardships is the best.

600
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,040
But if you have no choice but to face it,

601
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,450
I think physical and financial
strengths are most needed.

602
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,950
Women should step up to overcome, too.

603
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,110
To do that, not only physical strength

604
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,680
but an emergency fund would be needed, too.

605
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,320
I think women should be

606
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,580
interested in finances, not just housework.

607
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,710
You say financial strength is important?

608
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,010
Was it Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

609
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,440
Yes, Your Highness.

610
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,950
Is that why you dressed so lavishly
while the country is

611
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,570
suffering due to poor harvests?

612
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,470
As if you are showing off your family's wealth?

613
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,370
I just wanted to impress you today.

614
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,170
She gets so many silk garments made that

615
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,340
the fabric shop's threshold is wearing out.

616
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,140
You're much worse than me-

617
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:11,760
At least, I do not make clothes for some man.

618
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,970
A man?

619
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,730
Your Highness, for the dignity
of the royal family,

620
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,930
I need to tell you exactly what I saw and heard.

621
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,340
They say the Chief State Minister's
daughter displayed-

622
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,350
I mean, displayed affection
with a Westerner in the streets.

623
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,050
A Westerner?

624
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,350
I hesitate to even speak of it.

625
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,640
I can't believe such an immoral woman
participated in the selection.

626
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,440
Even I feel ashamed of it.

627
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,310
Is that true?

628
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,630
She is slandering me.

629
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,750
I just helped someone in need.

630
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,610
There is a witness.

631
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,110
Witness?

632
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,900
Tell her what you saw and heard.

633
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,710
She brought a Westerner and

634
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,380
asked me to make clothes for him.

635
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,040
I wanted to get him new clothes
because his clothes were too worn out.

636
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,460
Tell her more.

637
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,050
She held hands with him, hugged him,

638
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,930
a-and I think I saw them k-kissing, too.

639
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,350
No way.

640
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,130
Why would you tell such a lie?

641
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,240
She did that in public.

642
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,410
Imagine how devious she must be in private.

643
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,740
Is that not obvious?

644
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,860
Do not speak so rudely.

645
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,870
Your Highness, this is not true.

646
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,780
Can you prove that it is a lie?

647
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,920
You don't think I can?

648
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,510
You are disgracing the Queen
Mother's Palace. How shameless.

649
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,250
Stop!

650
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,850
A royal woman has to be faithful and pure.

651
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,590
Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's
daughter, Cha Sun Chaek

652
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,010
will be eliminated from the selection-

653
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,120
No, My Lord! You cannot!

654
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,910
Is this the Westerner you mentioned?

655
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,350
Y-Yes, yes.

656
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,960
Prince Gyeongseong.

657
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,270
What are you doing right now?

658
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,790
At this man's residence,

659
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,350
I discovered this.

660
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,390
This substance he brought from overseas

661
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,080
makes you show the plague symptoms.

662
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,110
And...

663
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:10,030
Lady Cha right here experienced those symptoms.

664
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,070
I'm sorry!

665
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,290
Ma'am!
Yes.

666
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,810
Another bowl, please.

667
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,040
Same order?

668
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,950
Yes. Add a lot of meat, please.

669
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,070
Okay, got it.

670
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,980
If so,

671
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,840
I almost died...

672
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,020
because of this Westerner...

673
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,890
I-If so, you should go to the Ministry of Justice.

674
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,380
How dare you cause a scene in front of me?

675
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,610
That Westerner knows the Do family very well.

676
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,490
And the fact that...

677
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,990
your favorite Do Hwa Seon hired the Westerner.

678
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,420
Do you want that to be revealed?

679
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,010
If you stop the selection process,

680
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,290
I will not reveal who was behind this.

681
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,450
Otherwise, we will have to hear his confession.

682
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:33,440
Speak and tell the truth yourself.

683
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,260
If so, you might be able to live.

684
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,760
Does this symbol not look familiar?

685
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,660
Your Highness. Your Highness!

686
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,260
My gosh! My gosh...

687
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,980
Oh, no...

688
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,190
Massage her arms.

689
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:31,060
Your Highness.

690
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,750
Your Highness.
Keep massaging her.

691
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,240
Her feet. Her feet.

692
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,760
Your Highness. Your Highness.

693
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,800
Gosh, what is going on?

694
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,760
Since the Queen Mother lost consciousness,

695
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,990
His Majesty became furious.

696
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:55,750
Therefore, he ordered the
selection process to stop.

697
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,750
The Westerner was such a dangerous person.

698
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,810
I can't believe it.

699
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,230
That is why you should not open up to anyone.

700
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,380
I will not allow you to eat, walk,
or go sightseeing

701
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,200
at all without me.

702
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,400
Have you been gone because
you've been chasing the Westerner?

703
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,480
I heard you locked arms with Do Hwa Seon, too.

704
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,240
You completely forgot about me, didn't you?

705
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,330
I have never let you go, even for a moment.

706
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,270
I realized something.

707
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,720
To be honest, I...

708
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,520
Prince Gyeongsong!

709
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,920

00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,980
Do you have to leave again?

711
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,360
Yes.

712
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,740
I really hate waiting.

713
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,540
But there's no choice.

714
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,690

716
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,650

Please hurry.

719
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,090

No.
