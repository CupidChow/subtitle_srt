1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,000
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,100
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,120
Wow, look who is here.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,740
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,230
Do they know each other?

6
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,810
Did you forget how to greet, by chance?

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,130
Of course not.

8
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,710
Greet even your sworn enemy politely.

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,950
That is what my parents taught me to do.

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,990
Have you been well?

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,420
You cannot suddenly appear
and behave so rudely toward her.

12
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,460
She is my fiancée.

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,780
My goodness.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,860
I made a mistake.

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,000
Anyway, thank you for helping me today, Sun Chaek.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,010
How dare you call my fiancée's name like that?

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,270
You still know to cross the line.

18
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,230
Sun Chaek and I share childhood

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,030
memories you are not aware of.

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,150
She helped me when I was in trouble.

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,010
Do not tell me I need your approval

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,070
for every little thing like this.

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,440
Enjoy your time together, then.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,630
See you again, Sun Chaek.

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,610
This concludes our outing today.

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,960
Let us go home.

27
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,190
Are you upset about earlier, by chance?

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,840
Not at all.

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,440
What happened earlier-
I do not want to know.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,830
By the way, how do you know Prince Seonghyeon?

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,950
Our time together is precious enough.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,110
I do not want to waste time talking about him.

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,950
Here.

35
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,890
You're right.

36
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,860
Let's only focus on our future from now on.

37
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,240
We're already here.

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,480
Oh, right.

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,120
Ta-da.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,810
What are they?
In any situation,

41
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,260
these bracelets will connect us together.

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,170
Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.

43
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,780
A man cannot wear such a thing.

44
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,110
It suits you well.

45
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,020
You need to remember something as my lover, then.

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,110
You cannot dare to be in another man's arms.

47
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,180
Got it. I'll keep that in mind, Prince Gyeongseong.

48
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,990
Cha Seon Chaek!

49
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,010
F-Father.

50
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,510
[Episode 8: Return of the shadow]

51
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,710
Sun Chaek is Prince Gyeongseong's fiancée?

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,390
Are you okay?

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,130
I am not okay.

54
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,920
What if I cannot get married because of it?

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,930
I will take responsibility, then.

56
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,660
Are you not using this as an excuse

57
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,230
because you want to marry me?

58
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,100
I am not, okay?

59
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,440
Unless you become handsome when you grow up.

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,300
Do not obsess over me because I got too handsome.

61
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,010
That will never happen.

62
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,590
I am a self-respecting woman.

63
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,970
Remember.

64
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,150
You had your first kiss with me.

65
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,510
My Lady! Young Master! Where are you?

66
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,750
Marry me if you are upset about it.

67
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,540
She is my fiancée.

68
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,000
Prince Gyeongseong.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,070
You have someone you do not deserve.

70
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,690
What's going on?

71
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,060
Did I really get locked up?

72
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,810
Father! Bang Wool!

73
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,170
Please open the door!

74
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,140
Fire!

75
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,940
I coddled you too much.

76
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,450
Father.
That is how we ended up here.

77
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,280
I can no longer maintain civility.

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,470
Your Excellency, do you have to do this?

79
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,220
You also look down on me
because I did not do anything.

80
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,350
I am planning to be a strict father from now on.

81
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,290
No one is allowed to...

82
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,120
open this door until I tell you to.

83
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,990
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,440
Do not do this. Please go now.

85
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,160
His Excellency is furious.

86
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,640
Is My Lady okay?

87
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,470
She ended up getting locked up.

88
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,500
She should have behaved better.

89
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,310
I need to see the Chief State Minister.

90
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,530
Notify him now.

91
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,210
He is not in the mood for that now.

92
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,590
If I upset him now,

93
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,900
you may never be able to see her again.

94
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,040
I will close the door.

95
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,610
Not a chance this time!

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,810
I am sorry, My Lady.

97
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,610
Bang Wool!

98
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,480
What's this?
[Sealed]

99
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,010
[Sealed]

100
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,360
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

101
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,200
You wish the killer of your parents well?

102
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,010
Are you being sincere?

103
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,760
Please do not say that.

104
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,150
It cannot be easy for you to face me.

105
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,150
I moved on from my past
while traveling to other countries.

106
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,240
I do not even remember anymore.

107
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,260
I do not believe what people say.

108
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,070
I heard you were traveling.

109
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,100
What made you suddenly return?

110
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,750
Not for a particular reason.

111
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,220
I grew tired of wandering for a long time,

112
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,610
and I just missed my homeland.

113
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,730
Are you sure that is all?

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,830
It is impossible to fool you.

115
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,620
Actually, my friends got me to
gamble, and I lost my fortune.

116
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,820
I am left with nothing.

117
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,590
But I guess that was not the end of me.

118
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,770
In the last round,

119
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,070
I acquired something more valuable than money.

120
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,590
What is this?

121
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,190
It is a rare medicine even the
Chinese Emperor covets.

122
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,430
It will restore your energy effectively.

123
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,440
I appreciate the gesture.

124
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,280
You must know the Chinese
envoys well, as they say.

125
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,620
So, how are things in China these days?

126
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,410
As you know,

127
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,460
I am a good-for-nothing
who is not interested in politics.

128
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,770
But I will share what I overheard

129
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,260
with you from time to time, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,350
Yes. That is not a bad idea.

131
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,290
There will be a royal family gyeokgu* event soon.
(A sport similar to polo)

132
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,450
Feel free to participate if you wish.

133
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,250
It will be my honor, Your Majesty.

134
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,670
Prince Seonghyeon suddenly returned.

135
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,370
What is he thinking?

136
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,020
Since he returned to Hanyang,

137
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,970
he has not done anything in particular yet.

138
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,220
If Prince Gyeongseong is a hunting dog,

139
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,670
is Prince Seonghyeon more like a wild dog?

140
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,960
I shall make those two dogs have
a match this time around.

141
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,440
He looks very familiar.

142
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,050
Is that a new robe?

143
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,740
How pretty.

144
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,460
Is that... P-Prince Seonghyeon?

145
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,650
My Lady, time to eat.

146
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,810
How's Prince Gyeongseong? He must be shocked.

147
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,740
He came here first thing in the morning,

148
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,530
and he is camping outside the gate.

149
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,960
He must be freezing.

150
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,290
Could there be a solution?

151
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,660
There is none until you change
His Excellency's mind.

152
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,190
Because I'm trapped here,

153
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,400
I can't meet him or talk to him.

154
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,650
What do I do?

155
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,040
Bang Wool, get me paper and thread right now.

156
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,110
I need a whole bunch of threads.

157
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,220
A bunch? All right. I will bring them.

158
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,670
I forgot.

159
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,290
I will be right back.

160
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,680
A little more. A little more.

161
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,130
Good.

162
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,610
Communication device installed.

163
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,880
Bang Wool, take this to Prince Gyeongseong.

164
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,000
My Lord!

165
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,980
Prince Gyeongseong, can you hear me?

166
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,550
I miss you, Prince Gyeongseong.

167
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,150
I need to settle this matter.

168
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,520
Trust me, and wait a bit.

169
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,850
Settle this matter?

170
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,750
I have a few ideas, too.

171
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,000
What do you think?

172
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,970
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

173
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,950
Prince Gyeongseong.

174
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,920
H-Hello?

175
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,410
H-Hello?

176
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,480
Prince Gyeongseong!

177
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,330
I need to talk to you fellows.

178
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Why are you pouring us drinks?

179
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,370
I would like your advice.

180
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,090
Advice? From us?

181
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,340
Do you have an idea for me
to win your father's heart?

182
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,930
I mean, do you think we are so easy?

183
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,710
I could never tell you.

184
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,210
Coax the supporters.

185
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,900
My brothers can't resist gifts.

186
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,540
Hyungnim. Hyungnim.

187
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,800
Wine. Our father loves wine.

188
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,420
Come on, Se Ho.

189
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,650
He has been drinking more these days.

190
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,050
Mountain ginseng!

191
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,500
Father likes mountain ginseng, too.

192
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,190
W-Watch yourselves.

193
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,480
Do you not have any self-respect at all?

194
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,950
No.
No.

195
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,940
I am not drunk yet.

196
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,450
I will not fall for something like this.

197
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,030
Have a glass,

198
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,750
Big Brother.

199
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,980
Big Brother?

200
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,840
Brother-in-law!

201
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,580
Brother-in-law...

202
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,930
Brother-in-law!

203
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,840
Prince Gyeongseong is my brother-in-law!

204
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,860
Brother-in-law!

205
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,650
Can't believe he'll be our brother-in-law...

206
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,680
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

207
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
Prince Gyeongseong,

208
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
this is not mountain ginseng.

209
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,200
It is farmed ginseng.

210
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,990
I hope you are not mocking me.

211
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,380
I am disappointed, Prince Gyeongseong.

212
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,300
Until you approve us,

213
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,820
I will not take even a step away from here.

214
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,770
My Lady, time to eat.

215
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,960
Lady Sun Chaek.

216
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,440
My Lady.

217
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,570
My Lady.

218
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,170
Bang Wool.

219
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,910
What happened to Prince Gyeongseong?

220
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,160
Will Father let us get married?

221
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,900
It is not that.

222
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,150
Prince Gyeongseong is still
kneeling in the front yard

223
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,550
and His Excellency continues to ignore him.

224
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,180
I need to go. I need to go.
No!

225
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,650
You will only make it worse by going there now!

226
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,670
I'm so frustrated.

227
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,710
My Lady.
What should I do?

228
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,000
There is nothing I can do.

229
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,170
My Lady.

230
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,880
This is not good.

231
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,870
My Lady, I have no choice.

232
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,640
Whether you are grounded or not,

233
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,140
I need to save you first.

234
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,800
Let us go.

235
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,570
Really?

236
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,290
Please get up now.

237
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,620
I cannot get up until you give your approval.

238
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,140
If kneeling would have resolved this,

239
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,310
what would be impossible in this world?

240
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,850
Please come inside for now.

241
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,210
Hand me that.

242
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,670
Goodness.

243
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,710
You got covered in snow.

244
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,350
You must have been so cold.

245
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,790
I understand how determined you are now, but-

246
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,670
Do you mean you still cannot approve us?

247
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,820
Any father would want their
daughters to get married

248
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,040
and live happily and healthy for a long time.

249
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,170
I will make her happier than anyone.

250
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,900
You have had blood on your hands for His Majesty

251
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,610
for over a decade now.

252
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,530
It must mean there are that many people

253
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,450
who want you to see your blood.

254
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,490
If you get married and have children,

255
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,510
they will be the targets
for those who are after you

256
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,400
and they will become your weakness.

257
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,210
However...

258
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,520
a grown man and woman love each other.

259
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,830
I cannot follow you around and stop you forever.

260
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,870
I wonder if you really have the character
and the spirit to protect my daughter.

261
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,870
I would like to test your potential.

262
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,580
Please promise me one thing.

263
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,270
For our family and Sun Chaek's reputation,

264
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,720
I will let you see each other, but

265
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,880
I hope you refrain from her staying out overnight.

266
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,130
Please protect Sun Chaek.

267
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,390
I will make sure to keep that promise.

268
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,520
If so, I will count on you.

269
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,270
Wife.

270
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,000
I will allow Sun Chaek to come out now.

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,510
Yes.

272
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,140
Sun Chaek, your father finally-

273
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,860
My Lady.

274
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,050
Long time no see.

275
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,340
I thought you forgot about me.

276
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,190
I've been so out of it.

277
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,850
Was the solution you got from here last time

278
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,820
effective at all?

279
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,900
The solution?

280
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,270
The thing you purchased from here, My Lady.

281
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,710
Y-Yes, yes. I suppose so...

282
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,250
What concern brought you here today, then?

283
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,670
Well, the thing is...

284
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,060
There is an obstacle to your love.

285
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,920
How perilous. You might never be able to marry.

286
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,530
Your feet were tied, and the thread was cut off.

287
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,020
You are so frustrated right now.

288
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,510
How did you know that?

289
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,310
Love, reunion, and popularity talismans.

290
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,710
They are my special talismans,
approved by reviews.

291
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,750
Talismans?

292
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,140
Aigoo. It knows who it belongs to.

293
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,810
Hide this in the man's bedding.

294
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,500
It will get rid of everyone
who interferes with your marriage.

295
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,380
Since you are a regular, I will
give you a special discount.

296
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,090
Should I buy this?

297
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,160
I think I should buy it.

298
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,110
There you are again.

299
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,750
Let me run my business.

300
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,660
I am trying to make a living. How could you-

301
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,870
Where is the real one?

302
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,310
The wrong girl is sitting here instead.

303
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,300
Looking at you,

304
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,240
I can tell things are not going your way.

305
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,090
I could even say stuff like that.

306
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,600
I don't like this...

307
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,710
You are at a crossroads.

308
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,480
You had better choose wisely.

309
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,600
Crossroads?

310
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,730
The only thing you can do freely
in life is to make choices.

311
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,640
Just wait and see.

312
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,720
You will be at the crossroads
where you have to decide soon.

313
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,710
Of course, no one knows
the results of the decisions.

314
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,870
That includes me, a deity.

315
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:30,540
That makes life and stories
more interesting, right?

316
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,430
You ended up buying that.

317
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,820
You are so gullible, My Lady.

318
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,650
Does she really know something about me?

319
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,910
It feels strange.

320
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,980
Did she really say that knowingly?

321
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,390
I do not believe in that stuff,

322
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,200
but she sounded kind of believable today.

323
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,630
Did you think so, too?

324
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,340
Might as well test it now.

325
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,350
You paid money for it. Try something with it.

326
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,570
What brings you here so late?

327
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,020
Are you celebrating your freedom?

328
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,880
Am I no longer grounded?

329
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,960
Did you and Father come to an agreement?

330
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,860
So, you were not freed.

331
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,100
You ran away.

332
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,790
Come on. That's not important.

333
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,640
The fact that we're together now is important.

334
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,010
I missed you, Prince Gyeongseong.

335
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,690
It's cold tonight.

336
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,380
Can I come in for a moment?

337
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,710
You cannot come in.

338
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,410
Until your father approves our marriage,

339
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,720
I promised not to lay a finger
on his precious daughter.

340
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,200
If he hears I brought you into
the men's quarters right away,

341
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,170
I would be in trouble.

342
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,770
But there seems to be no one around.

343
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,100
I think I could just sneak in.

344
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,750
If I were to break the promise so easily,

345
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,110
I would not have made the
promise in the first place.

346
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,120
Do you think lightly of a man's promise?

347
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,770
Do you care more about that promise than me?

348
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,750
I suppose you didn't miss me.

349
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,070
If you tempt me with a face like that...

350
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,100
it would be difficult for me.

351
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,910
Could you please leave now, Maiden Cha Sun Chaek?

352
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,880
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong?

353
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,260
[How dare you expect to be happy]

354
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,070
[sitting on top of someone's blood?]

355
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,630
[How despicable. Not only you but your people]

356
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,590
[and everyone around you will not be safe]

357
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,010
How could he do this to me?

358
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,640
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong!

359
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,570
Sun Chaek.

360
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,910
Jang Ho.

361
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,500
Where did you go as soon as you were freed?

362
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,540
You must have been frustrated. I am sorry.

363
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,980
But Father still hasn't approved
the marriage yet. I'm worried.

364
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,910
He said he would keep an eye on things,

365
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,400
but this is a huge improvement.

366
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,370
Please, all of you, convince
Father and help me out.

367
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,940
A-All right.

368
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,550
I could see Prince Gyeongseong's
good qualities up close.

369
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,990
I know, right?
Yes.

370
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,750
Well, by the way...

371
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,570
Do you have something else to say?

372
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,140
By chance, did you know?

373
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,220
Know what?

374
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,730
I think Prince Seonghyeon is back.

375
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,750
After he returned from his exile,

376
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,520
he disappeared and...

377
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,470
grew apart from our family.

378
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,860
Exile? Isn't that for criminals?

379
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,580
I am talking about the killings among royals that

380
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,330
took place when the current King began ruling.

381
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,730
Prince Seonghyeon lost his parents then.

382
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,540
In that process, he grew apart from
Prince Gyeongseong, who sided with the King.

383
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,520
They had that kind of a history?

384
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,200
[Invitation]

385
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,870
Gyeokgu competition, huh?

386
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,280
Since the game is set up,

387
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,880
I will go ahead and play.

388
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,620
It has been a while.
I know. This would be a lot of fun.

389
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,580
Prince Gyeongseong...
What a great weather.

390
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,970
Here comes His Majesty!

391
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,230
Players, come in!

392
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,500
You have not seen each other in a while.

393
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,060
Gyeokgu is a perfect way to catch up.

394
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,520
Do you not think so?

395
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,590
Thanks to your thoughtfulness,

396
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,800
I seem to have regained my energy.

397
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,210
Yes.

398
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,600
That is great.

399
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,040
All right. Do your best to make me happy.

400
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,180
Beon!

402
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,810
Let us go!

403
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,430
Take this!

404
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,340
Beon, Beon! Over here!

405
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,130
That is right!

406
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,500
Beon! Beon!

407
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,210
[2:0]

408
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,450
I just cannot do it.

409
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,930
Go, go, go!

410
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,160
Beon! Beon! Over here! Over here!

411
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,270
It went in! Did you see it? Beon!

412
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,390
Did you see it?

413
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Beon.

414
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,170
[3:0]

415
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,250
Beon!

416
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,060
Score!

417
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,730
Beon!

418
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,900
Beon!

419
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,470
What are you, kids?

420
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,210
Do it right!

421
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,470
Get it together!

422
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,280
Foul! Foul!

423
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,960
Can you not hear me?

424
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,080
Foul, I said!

425
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,870
[4:1]

426
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,860
[1]

427
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,600
The wild dog bit the hunting dog.

428
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,930
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

429
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,540
Your Majesty!
Yes.

430
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,560
I am completely fine.

431
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,070
My apologies, Your Majesty!

432
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,400
I committed a grave sin.

433
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,240
Well...

434
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,440
it happened during the game.

435
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,850
I deserve to die!

436
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,520
It is okay, I said.

437
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,240
Things are heating up too much.

438
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,510
Let us end the game now.

439
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,000
I am heading to the King's Palace.

440
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,130
Beon,

441
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,080
it is my fault.

442
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,390
I am sorry.

443
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,890
It is okay.

444
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,360
Wow, the rumors were right.

445
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,380
You are just as good as ever.

446
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,070
But even seemingly perfect things have flaws.

447
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,350
Gosh, do not get too worked up.

448
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,520
It means I learned something from you again today.

449
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,000
Let us go.

450
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,710
By the way,

451
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,520
did you receive the letter I sent?

452
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,440
What happened? They were fine.

453
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,190
While leaving a brothel the other day,

454
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,390
they got attacked by an assailant.

455
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,760
Who did they upset?

456
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,050
They look pretty bad.

457
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,470
Gosh, they look terrible.

458
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,080
Aigoo, I am sorry.

459
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,180
It is because I cannot see well.*
(It also means 'fearless')

460
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,680
Anyway, it would be tough
to function properly in the future.

461
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,450
What was that chilling, murderous energy?

462
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,410
So cold.

463
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,820
How many days has it been now?

464
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,000
I just need to avoid staying out all night.

465
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,510
This is so unfair.

466
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,350
What a master of self-control.

467
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,090
Is it because I didn't get to give this to him?

468
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,810
But if I go to him to give it to him,

469
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,770
he'll obviously make me leave.

470
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,440
You are at a crossroads.

471
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,660
You had better choose wisely.

472
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,630
Crossroads.

473
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,000
Why does that word bother me so much?

474
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,830
Watch Prince Seonghyeon closely from now on.

475
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,450
Report to me if you notice anything suspicious.

476
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,370
Is Prince Seonghyeon someone dangerous?

477
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,880
Something has been bothering me.

478
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,820
Watch him for now.

479
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,400
Yes, My Lord.

480
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,440
What is it?

481
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,450
The object you ordered is ready.

482
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,930
As you requested,

483
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,450
I split the ring Madam Seol left you

484
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,970
into two rings.

485
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,220
You are planning to give
these to Lady Cha, correct?

486
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,110
Lady Cha will love them.

487
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,860
Sir.

488
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,460
Maiden.

489
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,410
You must have been taken aback
that I suddenly disappeared that day.

490
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,950
Could you accept these flowers

491
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,690
and forgive me for my rude behavior?

492
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,960
Just the fact that you came to see me today

493
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,950
made me feel completely fine.

494
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,480
The flowers are very pretty.

495
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,190
I think it is my first time being given flowers.

496
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,900
I should visit you with flowers often.

497
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,180
Maiden Eun Ae,

498
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,560
to be honest, that day, I...

499
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,440
You do not have to tell me.

500
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,100
Everyone has a situation they cannot explain.

501
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,310
Of course, I have a good eye for people.

502
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,050
If so, Maiden Eun Ae,

503
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,240
could you give me another chance to eat

504
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,160
the gukbap I missed out on that day?

505
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,150
I would be happy to.

506
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,990
Has the world always been this beautiful?

507
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,540
"Everyone has a situation."

508
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,620
Goodness, Maiden Eun Ae.

509
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,910
Right, the handkerchief.

510
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,670
I could use this as an excuse to see her again.

511
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,960
Beon.
Watch where you are going.

512
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,820
Since you are always watching
straight ahead, I will...

513
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,350
watch a bit crookedly.

514
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,920
What is with your neck? It is crooked.

515
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,570
It is because I am jealous of the groom-to-be.

516
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,740
By the way, where are you headed to?

517
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,230
I have a private life, too.

518
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,200
To be honest, I am not at all interested.

519
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,760
You are joking. You must be in a good mood.

520
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,190
Are you on your way to see your fiancée?

521
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,630
Yes.

522
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,690
By the way, the mountain ginseng wine...

523
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:28,010
turned out to be fake.
Let us go on our way.

524
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,780
I'll let it slide because I'm
in a good mood today, Jung Su Gyeom.

525
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,110
Prince Gyeongseong sent me a letter?

526
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,800
"Come to Cheonggyecheon,

527
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,550
where we first met.

528
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,610
I will be waiting."

529
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,030
If Mother and Bang Wool look for me,

530
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,610
tell them I left urgently
to meet Prince Gyeongseong.

531
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,390
Yes, My Lady.

532
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,860
This is where we first met.

533
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,970
Why is he not coming?

534
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,490
What did you say just now?

535
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,870
She received my letter and went out?

536
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,500
I looked everywhere,

537
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,150
but she is not at Cheonggyecheon.

538
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,310
I was away running an errand for Madam.

539
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,420
The leader is here.

540
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,250
Should you not receive treatment soon?

541
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,630
I will not be treated.

542
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,940
But why...

543
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,840
Whenever I am starting to forget
the past, I see my blood

544
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,630
and am reminded of my family's
blood and screams clearly.

545
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,070
Compared to their pain,

546
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,480
this is nothing.

547
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:17,910
Now is the time for everything
to get back into place.

548
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,310
Where am I?

550

your grave.

551
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,690
Make sure to take care of it tonight.

552
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,520
Spare me.

553
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,820
Spare me! Spare me!

554
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,160
There is no use.

555
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,730
No one will hear you and come.

556
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,710
What do you want from me?

557
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,570
Why are you doing this?

558
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,850
Die very painfully.

559
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,400
That is what that person wants.

[Be suspicious when everyone's too happy]

568
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,080
What's the plan, exactly?

569
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,880
This will get resolved again somehow.

570
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Because she's the main character.

571
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,610
Worrying makes me look ugly.

572
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,350
No, no.

573
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,420
Disappear, wrinkles, and worries.

574
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,500
It's already looking soft and shiny.

575
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,000
This world is amazing.

576
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,180
I'll use it again tomorrow.

A letter of promises.

Prince Gyeongseong promises the following.

579
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,500
One.

580
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,590
In my relationship with Your Excellency's daughter,

581
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,970
I will maintain dignity and civility.

582
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,990
I will never let her stay out overnight.

583
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:57,740
Two. I will not behave in a way
to hurt the Cha family's reputation.

584
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,140
I will follow your words rather
than my personal emotions.

585
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,450
Three. I will make sure to protect your daughter

586
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,530
and keep her safe.
