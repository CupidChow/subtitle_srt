1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,980
[The child actors were filmed safely

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,730
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,420
Did I drink too much?

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,400
Is this a dream?

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,130
Or am I still in the novel?

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,460
Why is it so complicated?

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,060
Gosh, whatever.

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,010
Right?

9
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,150
Eun Ae comes out for a night walk

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,640
and she meets Yi Beon.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,140
I think that long-awaited moment happens now.

12
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,960
I can't miss a highlight like that.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,570
Where's Eun Ae? Is she not here yet?

14
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,660
His features look like delicately sculpted ice.

15
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,270
A perfect-looking man.

16
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,400
What? Why does this feel familiar?

17
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,360
By chance, are you...

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,300
the male lead, Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong?

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,130
Gosh, it's you. It's you. I finally did it.

20
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,130
Shake my hand.

21
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,620
This is so crazy.

22
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,020
Did you lose your mind?

23
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,340
If you try to do anything funny,

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,900
you might lose your fingers.

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,960
Go ahead and try.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,720
The worst thing that could happen is me dying

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,570
in this novel.

28
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,130
You are staring at me directly

29
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,930
when you know who I am?

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,020
Because the rumor says something horrific

31
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,440
happens to you if you make eye contact with you?

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Why don't I check if that rumor

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,910
is true or not?

34
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,490
Try cutting these lips in half, too.

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,970
You can't do it.

36
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,840
To be honest, I know everything.

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,470
The secrets you keep.

38
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,400
Because you don't want to kill anyone,

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,170
you created such rumors yourself.

40
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,420
Even though you'd be left alone,

41
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,970
you chose to be lonely

42
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,370
than to be in agony.

43
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,750
It's not your fault.

44
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,730
You did nothing wrong.

45
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,600
Why...

46
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,650
are you so sure that you know...

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,340
so well about me?
It's because...

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,510
I read your mind completely.

49
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,550
You felt hurt because you were lonely.

50
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,020
But once you fall in love,

51
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,270
you're good to your woman.

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,110
No woman ever told me

53
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,150
something like that.

54
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,450
[Episode 2: The first night in this life]

55
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,250
[Episode 2: The first night in Yi Beon's life]

56
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,650
Gosh, my head.

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,810
What are you doing?

58
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,240
My Lord.

59
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,830
What do I do? What do I do?

60
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,870
Were you into this kind of thing?

61
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,450
My Lord.

62
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,280
No, no, no.

63
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,230
This is not reality. This is not the novel. No...

64
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,730
This is... What do you call it?

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,560
Trying to evade what happened last night,

66
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,580
if you're pretending not to remember...

67
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,640
Or if you're playing ignorant
because you think so lightly

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,450
of this between a man and a woman,

69
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,690
so that you do not think such a thing again,

70
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,510
I will make sure to...

71
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,470
crush this small head of yours.

72
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,710
So, you had better...

73
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,690
wait here until I come back.

74
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,260
I had a one-night stand with someone else's man?

75
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,120
Be calm. Let's think this through.

76
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,920
Feeling upset from the Dahong Club meeting,

77
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,410
Eun Ae was walking alone and

78
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,030
ran into Yi Beon by the water.

79
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
By chance, because of me,

80
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,210
did they miss their first encounter?

81
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,850
Gosh, that can't be...

82
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,620
But that could actually be the case...

83
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,990
This is unsettling.

84
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,460
Why did I black out at that moment?

85
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,870
I need to check on my own.

86
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,050
By chance,

87
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,970
is my wish coming true, My Lord?

88
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,490
Or will she become a Buddhist nun, too?

89
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,650
Was it your wish for me to marry?

90
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,330
You know well.

91
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,910
But you said you will never marry.

92
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,760
So, I thought that was the case.

93
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,090
The women who crossed paths with you once

94
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,390
are forced to become Buddhist nuns,
according to a rumor.

95
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,560
Rumors can be useful sometimes.

96
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,500
It was a rumor you started, of course.

97
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,320
By the way, how...

98
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,620
To be honest, I know everything.

99
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,850
The secrets you keep.

100
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,110
It's not your fault.

101
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,050
You did nothing wrong.

102
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,500
Make sure she doesn't leave
Hoseondang until I return.

103
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,790
Yes, sir.

104
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,090
She is different than most noble women.

105
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,070
So, take extra care.

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,930
It might be good to prepare a wedding proposal.

107
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,810
Already?

108
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,640
Did the sun rise from the west today?

109
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,210
Are you in there?

110
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,280
Are you in there?

111
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,040
Is she still sleeping?

112
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,860
Why is it so complicated?

113
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,060
What is this, an escape room?

114
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,840
Gosh, is this right?

115
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,580
You've got to be kidding.

116
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Hello.
Hello.

117
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,330
Which way should I go to exit?

118
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,380
Well, t-that way.

119
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,960
Thank you.
Sure.

120
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,210
Who is she, by the way?

121
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,350
I wonder. Looks like she came from the guest room.

122
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,850
No way. At Hoseondang, there is no woman except for the cook lady.

123
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,420
Is she a thief, by chance?

124
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,600
We should catch her, then.
Hold on. We cannot catch her.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,850
She could be a thief who stole the Lord's heart.

126
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,290
What happened yesterday, anyway?

127
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,330
So, what happened to Eun Ae, then?

128
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,310
This must be the place.

129
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,090
Lady Sun Chaek.

130
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,850
What happened yesterday?

131
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,160
I was scared because you suddenly disappeared.

132
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,220
I must've drank too much last night.

133
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,050
I don't remember so well.

134
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,450
I prepared a tea that is good for a hangover.

135
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,120
Shall we?
Yes.

136
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,410
Thank you so much for
helping me in a bind last night.

137
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,140
I will forever be grateful.

138
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,830
Well... I think I was...

139
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,170
slightly drunk last night.

140
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,440
Did I make a mistake in front of people

141
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,690
or cause trouble by chance?

142
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,770
Mistake? Oh, no.

143
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,940
What are they called... your cocktails?

144
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,080
Right?
Yes...

145
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,490
Everyone was talking about them last night.

146
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,450
The teahouse was packed with people who came to see your cocktails.

147
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,570
Is that so?

148
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,470
Yes. We will serve cocktails
for the full moon, too.

149
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,750
Could you teach me your know-how later, My Lady?

150
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,700
H-How to make cocktails?

151
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,630
Well, if that's what you want.

152
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,020
By chance,

153
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,360
d-did something else happen last night?

154
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Something else?

155
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Did Yi Beon and Eun Ae even meet last night?

156
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,460
Nothing else happened.

157
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,010
Everyone went home happy, thanks to you.

158
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,230
Everything went well.

159
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,210
I see.

160
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,150
They couldn't meet because of me.

161
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,820
Did you not run into someone named Yi Beon

162
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,470
or the Prince Gyeongseong briefly, by chance?

163
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,660
I have heard of him many times,

164
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,360
but I have never met him in person.

165
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,340
I heard that Prince Gyeongseong
frequents this area these days.

166
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,000
Aren't you curious?

167
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,330
Really?
Yes.

168
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,890
That is a bit scary.

169
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,540
I heard you cannot upset him or make eye contact with him.

170
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,970
I do not have a lot of connections,

171
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,060
but the teahouse people told me about him.

172
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,240
But he might not be as scary as you think.

173
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,820
Rumors are just rumors.

174
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,250
Have you heard?

175
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,440
According to what I heard recently...

176
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,250
since he has no interest in women,

177
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,130
there's a rumor that there might
be something wrong with him.

178
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,850
Gosh, that's not true.

179
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,190
To be exact, he's full of vitality...

180
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,540
I thought I didn't remember.

181
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,450
I remember now.

182
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,240
Crazy.

183
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,940
I still have not broken away

184
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,170
from my brother's influence yet.

185
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,750
Is it because I lack virtue?

186
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,780
It took long because it was
an undercover operation.

187
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,350
You do not have to worry
about Heuksa Clan for a while.

188
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,030
I need to get China's approval.

189
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,420
I need to be appointed officially

190
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,630
so the former King's remaining factions
can't run wild any longer.

191
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Prince Gyeongseong, what do you think?

192
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,630
Our relationship with China is important,

193
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,000
but securing people's support comes first.

194
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,110
Since you've been focusing
on destroying the rebels,

195
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,940
you're not thinking clearly.

196
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,830
Getting acknowledged by China

197
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,650
will naturally win the people's support.

198
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,300
I have not...

199
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,420
won your support yet, Prince Gyeongseong.

200
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,540
That is not true-
If not,

201
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,470
I would like you to lead the envoys that I am sending to China.

202
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,600
Take grains, visit the Emperor, and bring me my official appointment.

203
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

204
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,720
but I do not think I would be able to join the envoys.

205
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,950
Is there a particular reason?

206
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,750
There is something I need to take care of.

207
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,510
I will not be able to for a while.

208
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,250
Something to take care of?

209
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,850
I...

210
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,800
have someone I would like to marry, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,740
You hold no prejudices and you speak up regardless of hierarchy.

212
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,910
You even corrected the rumor
regarding Prince Gyeongseong.

213
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,000
You are such a great person.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,740
You are meant to end up with the male lead

215
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,750
and that would make this story
and my life easier, too.

216
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,080
I think I developed a crush.

217
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,660
Pardon?
On you, My Lady.

218
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,570
Can I dare ask you to be my friend?

219
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,380
I would like to see you often.

220
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,740
U-Us being friends is...

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,760
It might be kind of difficult.

222
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,990
Of course, you dislike me, too.

223
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,920
I am sorry. I should have known better.

224
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,460
I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.

225
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,850
No, it's not like that.

226
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,740
I am an orphan with an unknown origin

227
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,660
and they say I seduced my father
and got adopted as a mistress...

228
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,780
Who says that?

229
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,420
I'm very aware of how great of a person you are.

230
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,270
Even when you struggle or are sad,

231
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,600
you help others who struggle more than you.

232
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,420
You're such a blessing.

233
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,310
How dare they say bullshit like that...

234
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,970
Let's be friends, okay?

235
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,350
You aren't allowed to say
something so pitiful, okay?

236
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,190
Lady Sun Chaek.

237
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,820
How about you join the envoys in three months?

238
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,210
Get married during that time.

239
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,550
Your wedding will be treated with utmost respect in the royal court.

240
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,190
You will not refuse this, will you?

241
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,300
All right, then.

242
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,420
I will follow your order.

243
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,610
You should also experience the family affection

244
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,580
you didn't know about for a while.

245
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,000
I will take my leave.

246
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,620
All right.

247
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,740
He suddenly wants to get married.

248
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,450
What is he thinking?

249
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,370
Watch him closely from now on.

250
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,260
Is that not the Prince Gyeongseong?

252
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,580
Looks like he just visited His Majesty.

253
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,400
Prince Gyeongseong.

254
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,530
Queen Mother.

255
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,240
What happened to you?

256
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,760
Your handsome face looks so tired.

257
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,340
Did you have a serious
conversation at the Main Hall?

258
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,390
It is nothing.

259
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,940
If so, I think you need a wife to care for you.

260
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,600
That would liven up your face a little.

261
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,270
I am planning to invite all the daughters of noble families at the banquet early this month.

262
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,830
How about you find a wife there?

263
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,340
I appreciate your concern,

264
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,300
but I will choose who I will marry.

265
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,190
I will take my leave now.

266
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,910
Fine.

267
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,280
He insidiously hides his feelings.

268
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,820
It is impossible to know what he is thinking.

269
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,790
Is it still about what happened then?

270
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,830
How could he be so sharp as a razor?

271
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,290
The thing is...

272
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,120
Is that true?

273
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,950
He took in a woman last night?

274
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,530
Not only did I have a one-night
stand with the male lead,

275
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,620
I befriended the female lead, too.

276
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,730
This isn't right.

277
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,180
Yes. This happened because of me.

278
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,130
I need to correct things somehow.

279
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,720
Gosh, what do I do?

280
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,800
My Lady!

281
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,190
Lady Sun Chaek!

282
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
My Lady... My Lady...

283
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,280
My Lady, where did you spend the night last night?

284
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,440
Something serious happened.
Things can't get any worse than it is.

285
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,540
You should have warned me sooner.

286
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,100
I had no idea you had a lover.

287
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,410
What do you mean a lover?

288
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,720
Gosh, you are so clueless.

289
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,540
You are about to get married.

290
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,510
Get married?

291
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,970
A wedding proposal for you just arrived.

292
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,150
So, did my family see it?

293
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,410
They are not home right now.

294
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,690
I wanted to warn you
before His Excellency gets home.

295
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,930
But he should be coming home soon.

296
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm getting married at this point?

297
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,860
No, I need to stop it.

298
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,540
My Lady, move!

299
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,430
Maybe this is how...

300
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,590
Cha Sun Chaek leaves the story.

301
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,100
Gosh, she survived.

302
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,250
She survived. She survived.

303
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,380
I told you to stay put and wait.

304
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,420
Did you want to get killed by a horse
before the wedding?

305
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,240
I never asked you to send a wedding
proposal or whatever.

306
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,320
Wedding proposals have nothing
to do with how the couple feels.

307
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,330
It's just formality between the families.

308
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,940
Do you think it makes sense for us to get married?

309
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,840
If a man and woman spent a night together,

310
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,310
they have to get married, of course.

311
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,250
But I have no memory of it.

312
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,470
If you say you have no memory of it,

313
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,820
will it cancel out what happened?

314
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,290
And I remember last night very clearly.

315
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,840
Who took my clothes off so aggressively?

316
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,490
Someone might hear you. Lower your voice.

317
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,660
You have shame. You had none yesterday.

318
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,890
Even if I did,

319
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,170
I don't think we should
get married only because of that.

320
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,930
You seduced me and spent a night with me.

321
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,260
But you are denying it now?

322
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,540
Are you blaming me for everything, by chance?

323
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,760
It wasn't your first time, was it?

324
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,710
Come on. It wasn't right?

325
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,290
Do you think I am a horny animal who sleeps with any woman I can find?

326
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,500
No, it's not that...

327
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,250
With your face, body, and wealth,

328
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,000
you had to have been with a woman before.

329
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,810
The first night with a woman
is important to a nobleman.

330
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,580
That is why I have been saving myself.

331
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,220
Since we spent the first night together,

332
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,010
of course, we should be responsible for the other.

333
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,090
Why is he so obsessed with the first night?

334
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,280
But still, I think this is too unfair.

335
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,250
I cannot marry you.

336
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,630
If so,

337
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,660
you seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.

338
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,790
Not only that, you stopped me trying to go

339
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,790
against the King's word and tried to hurt me.

340
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,440
That is an attempt at assuming royal authority.

341
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,460
It is safe to call it treason.

342
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,320
Yes, that is exactly it.

343
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,040
This is...

344
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,730
treason.

345
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,010
Thank you, sir.

346
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,210
Yes, yes.

347
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,350
Wait for me! Wait.

348
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,230
Hurry up.

349
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,710
How do you like the yeot, Father?

350
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,750
It is very sweet.

351
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,540
Not only you,

352
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,540
but the family can lose their rank
and positions immediately.

353
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,930
Three generations can be executed,
so the family ceases to exist.

354
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,670
Who would be responsible
for the end of the Cha family?

355
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,590
Sun Chaek,

356
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,440
why couldn't you just marry him?

357
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
Why did you do that?

358
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,010
How dare you turn down the Prince Gyeongseong?

359
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,030
I never even got to marry.

360
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,330
You think I did?

361
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,030
This is where our family's bloodline ends.

362
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,660
My dear ancestors,

363
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,440
I am terribly sorry.

364
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,950
I hope we do not...

365
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,430
meet again in the next life.

366
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,930
What if this family actually ceases

367
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,040
to exist because of me?

368
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm sorry!

369
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,270
I'll get married.

370
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,360
So, please spare me.

371
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
What can I say?

372
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,600
You only had one chance.

373
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,770
This woman deceived me.

374
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,760
Kill her very cruelly and painfully.

375
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,650
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

376
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,430
She tarnished a royal's virginity.

377
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,830
Cha Sun Chaek, a traitor...

378
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,800
will be torn apart to death!

379
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,830
Spare me!

380
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,610
He was acting crazy earlier.

381
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,270
Why does he have such a sweet smile?

382
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,180
You must care about your family.

383
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,000
I care about all lives.

384
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
That's why I'd like to share the news about

385
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,020
my marriage personally with my dear family.

386
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm their precious only daughter.

387
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,520
If I suddenly tell them I'll get married,
they'll feel disappointed.

388
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,610
Until I bring it up with them myself,

389
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,710
could you wait just a moment?

390
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,990
Sure, fine.

391
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,910
I will give you three days.

392
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,360
After three days,

393
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,370
I will resend the wedding proposal.

394
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,580
How about you join the envoys in three months?

395
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,960
Get married during that time.

396
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,350
Your wedding will be

397
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,080
treated with utmost respect in the royal court.

398
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,840
You will not refuse this, will you?

399
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,550
Three days is... That's way too short.

400
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,570
No, it is more than enough.

401
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,040
As long as you do not try to run away.

402
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,040
If you are thinking that, you had better give up now.

403
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,910
Of course not.

404
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,880
The geography and security
of this city is in the palm of my hands.

405
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,190
If you want to confirm that,

406
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,330
feel free to try.

407
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,110
So, you did not come home last night

408
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,840
because you slept with the Prince...
the Prince Gyeongseong?

409
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,440
We didn't just sleep together.
It was his first time, apparently.

410
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,030
And he said to be responsible by marrying him.

411
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,820
How does that make sense?

412
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,710
So, what will he do about the wedding proposal?

413
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,680
He said he will resend it in three days.

414
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,220
So, I'll run far away as quickly as possible.

415
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,010
Pack everything that's small,
light, and worth money.

416
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,780
Oh, yes...

417
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,050
Why do you have to run away, by the way?

418
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,840
The Prince may not be the nicest person,

419
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,610
but he is a royal, handsome,
and all women desire him.

420
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,170
That makes him the best marriage material.

421
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,650
That is not all.

422
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,450
You will become the King's
relative by marrying him.

423
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,710
You will get paid regularly for that.

424
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,640
It would be an honor
to the family, too. Isn't that nice?

425
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
That has always been your dream.

426
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,250
My dream?
Yes.

427
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,100
Your dream has always been

428
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,940
marrying a son of a family that is suitable,

429
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,490
having as many children
as possible, living a happy life,

430
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,350
and ending your life in peace

431
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,990
while being cared for by your grandchildren.

432
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,490
I'd enjoy a lot of things as a royal,

433
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,800
but that would put me in danger, too.

434
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,140
No!

435
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,500
Spare us.

436
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,190
The female lead always...

437
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,590
face all sorts of hardship and danger.

438
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,400
Gosh, I don't want to be the female lead.

439
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,010
And most importantly...

440
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,850
The Prince is supposed to marry someone else.

441
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,640
But you said he wants to marry you.

442
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,480
That's why I need to run away quickly.

443
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,750
That will not be easy.

444
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,390
If he sets his mind to it,
there is no one he cannot find

445
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,830
or get rid of in this world.

446
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,420
See?

447
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,310
He must've noticed you were running away.

448
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,380
What do I do?

449
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,630
Do you not even invite your guests to come in?

450
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,050
You cannot just barge in like this.

451
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,470
Are you okay, Bang Wool?

452
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,560
How dare you touch me?

453
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,790
Go outside and stay away.

454
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,850
What brings you here?

455
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,430
I stopped by to ask you something.

456
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,090
Last night, you suddenly left the club meeting.

457
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,100
You went to Prince Gyeongseong's Hoseondang and left this morning.

458
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,630
Someone I know saw it. Is that true?

459
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,570
That's...

460
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,250
T-The thing is-
It is true.

461
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,730
Well, I don't really remember it...

462
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,630
Don't try to lie, and say you do not remember because you were drunk.

463
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,330
By chance, did you spend the night with the Prince?

464
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,580
My hunch was correct.

465
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,940
You let me have the silk dress and sided with me

466
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,440
but you stabbed me in the back? How shameless-

467
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Is this when...

468
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,620
Do Hwa Seon uses her signature
move by splashing water?

469
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,810
What are you doing...

470
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,430
Were you prepared to disgrace me?

471
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,360
No, I didn't do that.

472
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,320
You splashed water at me first.

473
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,800
All I did was block it like this.

474
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,020
The fan the Queen Mother gave me was ruined.

475
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,070
I will repay you for this humiliation.

476
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,250
I will do so much more than
just splashing water next time.

477
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,330
Just wait and see.

478
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,380
What's going on?

479
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,440
Why do things keep going haywire?

480
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,600
I'm not supposed to do anything.

481
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,980
Why does my body keep moving against my will?

482
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,820
My Lady,

483
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,440
you do not have to do this for someone like me.

484
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:40,740
You are the only one who took revenge for me.

485
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,040
I will do anything for you from now on-

486
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,400
My Lady.

487
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,710
My Lady! My Lady!

488
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,910
Beon, what brings you here?

489
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,900
I am here because you said this place has the best view of Hanyang.

490
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,930
You never seemed to listen to me.

491
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,880
I have never seen you doing this.

492
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,200
So... have you really not been to this gazebo before?

493
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,700
Everyone knows about this one.

494
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,960
This is my first time here.

495
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,820
What has gotten into our Beon?

496
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,700
What made you visit a place for the first time?

497
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,810
You said your binoculars were broken.

498
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,350
Yes.

499
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,270
It broke... because I dropped it from a rooftop.

500
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,770
It was not easy to acquire these.

501
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,200
Let me get you a new pair.

502
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,360
Do you mean it?

503
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,250
But why?

504
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,490
I would love that,

505
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,080
but you are acting very suspiciously.

506
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,500
Let us say it is to celebrate my first visit here.

507
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,940
And most importantly,

508
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,630
it is because you are my first and only friend.

509
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,780
It looks like you find all things first meaningful.

510
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,460
I am still your only friend because you did not let anyone in afterward.

511
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,600
I thought everyone was like that.

512
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,350
It is... special because not everyone

513
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,380
cherishes the beginning.

514
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,410
I hope you have many beginnings.

515
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,290
That way, I would... strike more gold like this.

516
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,470
My Lady...

517
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,580
Plan A.

518
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,410
Escape.

519
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,620
We were told not to let any unwed noblewomen through the four gates.

520
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,800
This is something very urgent.

521
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,290
I cannot disobey the order from above, either.

522
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,820
My Lady is so ill.

523
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,700
She needs to rehabilitate in the countryside.

524
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,880
If that is why,

525
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,450
there is a good place
to rehabilitate in Hanyang, too.

526
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,490
It is called Hoseondang Spa.
Hoseondang?

527
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,060
It is a spa owned by the Prince Gyeongseong.

528
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,140
How about you go there instead?

529
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,720
My Lady! Gosh...

530
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,490
Let me do a search.

531
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,640
As you can tell, I am not a noblewoman.

532
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,140
It is a search for finding a culprit.

533
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,370
Culprit?

534
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,960
As soon as we find the woman
who stole one and only thing

535
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,950
very precious to the Prince Gyeongseong,

536
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,160
we are supposed to arrest and detain her.

537
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,470
You had better just leave quietly.

538
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,340
If you walk past this gate,

539
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,710
he will send bounty hunters.

540
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,890
No way...

541
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,310
No!

542
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,120
Let me go!

543
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,020
We will bring her body if we have to!

544
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,780
No! No!

545
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,240
Lift her.

546
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,750
Okay, let us go.
Save me...

547
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,660
You appear to be in a good mood.

548
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,410
That cannot be.

549
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,360
You are mistaken.

550
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,170
Can I dare to tell you something?

551
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,580
Fear tactics do not work in this field.

552
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,020
The engagement policy works well in this case.

553
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,010
I can't seem to breathe.

554
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,060
If you really do not want to,

555
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,030
just make the Prince fall out of love with you.

556
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,020
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

557
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,860
Gosh, Bang Wool.

558
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,350
You're smarter than I thought, Bang Wool.

559
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,110
What would be a good way,
do you think, for example?

560
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,450
I am not sure.

561
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,100
I have thought about how to make someone like me,

562
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,850
but I have never tried to do the opposite.

563
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,070
The kind of woman men hate...

564
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,890
The kind of woman men hate?

565
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,330
Yes.

566
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,720
Perhaps I'm an expert in this field.

567
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,280
My Lord!

568
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,070
My Lord! My Lord!

569
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,240
My Lord. My Lord.

570
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,490
Send the wedding proposal in two days.

571
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,010
Is the rest of the preparation going well?

572
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,920
This is more urgent.

573
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,400
You need to see this.

574
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,630
What am I seeing right now?

575
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,250
I am not so sure, either.

576
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,130
Gosh, My Lord.

577
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,650
You must have missed me this morning.

578
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,630
What are you doing here?

579
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,080
Plan B.

580
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,350
Provoke the obsessive male lead.

581
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,410
As I know, Yi Beon from the novel

582
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,930
hates anything dirty and impure.

583
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,180
He won't be able to stand this.

584
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,390
Why do you look like this?

585
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,870
You smell, too.

586
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,260
Gosh, the fertilizer smell.

587
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,630
I dug up and ate some because I got hungry.

588
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,550
Unlike how I look, I love emergency crops like this.

589
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,200
And you aren't smelling fertilizer.

590
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,050
It's actual poop.

591
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,230
My stomach hurts because I ate too much.

592
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,670
So, I pooped and buried it there.

593
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,780
For cleaning, this foxtail grass is perfect.

594
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,920
As time goes by, it will fertilize Hoseondang's soil, too.

595
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,630
Disgusting and insufferable, right?

596
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,490
With your clean and perfectionist personality.

597
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,820
Ditch me already.

598
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,250
I'm ready for it.

599
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:16,370
A nobleman's daughter's hands... show signs of labor.

600
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,810
It's very refreshing and inspiring.

601
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,890
Pardon?
Not only do you have a common appetite,

602
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,930
you are harvesting emergency crops during

603
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,010
downtime to encourage and inspire others.

604
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,870
You will set an example...

605
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,810
as a royal.

606
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,830
Let us go.

607
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,640
Well, yes.

608
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,310
Yes...

609
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,810
Plan C.

610
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,510
A toxic woman's... vanity and extravagance.

611
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,910
Gosh, My Lady.

612
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,450
If you buy this much, even the Minister's family would run out of money soon.

613
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,670
Shut up.

614
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,760
I want to buy things.

615
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,920
How dare a servant lecture me?

616
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,330
Should I cut off your wrists immediately?

617
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:12,550
Gosh, for my delicate wrists... even this jewelry is so heavy.

618
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,860
You carry this, too.

619
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,580
Did I toss it that hard?

620
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,900
My Lady.

621
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,620
Gosh, the Prince Gyeongseong.

622
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,040
We run into each other often.

623
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,060
What are you doing here?

624
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,980
Our upcoming wedding has made me feel restless.

625
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,920
I wanted to adorn myself from head to toe.

626
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,640
I bought the best goods in Joseon...

627
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,130
No, I only bought imported goods.

628
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,320
Why?

629
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,220
Because I worship foreign countries.

630
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:54,410
I want to continue to buy all the limited edition goods from Japan and China from now on.

631
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,780
Can you buy them for me the rest of my life, Prince Gyeongseong?

632
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,900
A clueless beauty who spends taxpayers' money.

633
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,240
A royal like Yi Beon won't tolerate this, right?

634
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,380
Aigoo, so heavy...

635
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,540
You need to dress like this to be on my level.

636
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,750
Envoys are visiting us in a few months.

637
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,950
Please assist me with that.

638
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,900
You have a global taste, too.

639
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,800
What? What's going on?

640
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,970
It's not working at all.

641
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,710
Why is he so impenetrable?

642
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,380
Plan D.

643
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,560
Fatalism.

644
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,700
What brings you here at this late hour?

645
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,180
You could not have missed me already.

646
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,590
We're not supposed to miss each other.

647
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:15,750
What do you mean by that?

648
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,790
Using your fortune... and mine, I checked our compatibility.

649
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,750
How is our compatibility?

650
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,910
It says if we get married, you're destined to die young, apparently.

651
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,650
It does not matter.

652
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,790
Pardon?

653
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,990
I-It doesn't matter?

654
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,420
They say you will die if you marry me.

655
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,890
I think of this life... as a bonus, anyway.

656
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,280
If I could meet someone I love and live happily, even briefly,

657
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,330
I will think of it as a gift from my parents and accept it willingly.

658
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,020
No, I'll become a widow.

659
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,350
All of my assets will become yours, then.

660
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,970
However,

661
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,820
you cannot remarry.

662
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,560
I will not allow you another man even if I am dead.

663
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,330
Plan E.

664
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,070
Become religious.

665
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,990
A noble lady is joining the temple?

666
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,160
Yes, that is correct.

667
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,300
Being free from material desires and pain...

668
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,630
Especially Yi Beon.

669
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,400
is my wish.

670
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,160
Please accept me-

671
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,610
I am sorry, but you cannot join the temple.

672
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,640
How did you know I was here?

673
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,350
Do you know each other?

674
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,210
Of course. We know each other very well.

675
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,530
Why do you say she cannot join us?

676
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,380
You only need faith in Buddha's world-

677
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,170
This maiden lacks in faith.

678
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,810
First of all,

679
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,220
she loves drinking. Very much so.

680
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,050
I can quit.

681
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,880
Of course, I should.

682
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,780
And she loves eating meat.

683
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,780
For breakfasts, her family

684
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,180
eats meat from land, sea, and sky.

685
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,170
I ate it because they were there.

686
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,620
They were there.

687
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,090
I can go vegetarian, ma'am.

688
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,760
And I won't eat much, either.

689
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,740
So, please accept me.

690
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,930
Please spare me.

691
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,010
It is up to her to join the temple.

692
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,590
No one can stop someone from doing that.

693
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,740
Ma'am, I just thought about something

694
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,570
I forgot to mention.

695
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,710
It is a reason she cannot become a monk.

696
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,370
What is it...

697
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,240
Can a woman who is not celibate become a monk?

698
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,600
P-Pardon?

699
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,340
It's not true, ma'am!

700
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,920
You lie now?

701
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,080
Lying is not permitted in Buddha's world.

702
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,930
Don't listen to this man, ma'am.

703
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,850
I-
Gosh, stop!

704
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,370
I am the one she spent the night-

705
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,480
Namu Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...

706
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,910
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...
He's out of his mind, ma'am.

707
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,250
I swear it's not true.

708
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,620
You will not become a monk.

709
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,690
Forget about the plans.

710
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,770
Is running away at night the only option?

711
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,370
Just run away.

712
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,020
Nothing works.

713
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,540
How could this be?

714
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,510
I just need to disappear.

715
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,520
Wow, we smelled makeup powder
in the middle of the night.

716
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,760
We had to come check.

717
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,280
It is not just the makeup powder.

718
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,430
I smell gold, too.

719
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,650
I'll give you this.

720
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,810
I swear I didn't see anything.

721
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,270
It's so dark.

722
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,580
It looks like you are a nobleman's daughter.

723
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,430
Should we sell the jewelry and silk?

724
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,280
I knew I had a lucky dream.

725
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,040
We will finally make good money.

726
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,530
Help me!

727
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,970
Screaming will not help.

728
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,930
There are not even ants here at night.

729
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,430
So, go ahead-

730
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,150
What?

731
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,510
Geez.

732
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,690
This is...

733
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,450
yeot.

734
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,690
Yeot fell from the sky?

735
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,850
Gosh, my apologies.

736
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,590
I was eating yeot while stargazing.

737
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,200
But I dropped it by accident.

738
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,920
Supporting character, Jung Su Gyeom?

739
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,810
Are you okay?

740
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,520
Help me.
Geez.

741
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,750
You look like a pretty boy.
Come on.

742
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,790
Do not do anything dangerous now.

743
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,540
Since we are in this situation,

744
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,560
we will have to kill you both.

745
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,210
I will take the lady.

746
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,390
No, I will take the lady.

747
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,410
Do you have a sword? Can you fight?

748
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,900
We're dead.

749
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,020
Are you a good runner?

750
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,560
Pardon?

751
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,730
It is okay if you aren't.

752
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,560
They are running away.

753
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,350
I said I will take the lady.

754
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,350
Eat this yeot, you thieves.

755
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,440
Yes, my type has always been

756
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,200
the supporting characters.

757
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,780
Why was a nobleman's daughter

758
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,060
roaming in the mountains at night?

759
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,750
You are the Chief State Minister's
daughter, correct?

760
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,420
How did you know...

761
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,790
To be honest,

762
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,430
I stopped by the teahouse
on the night of the full moon.

763
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,020
Y-You saw me at the teahouse?

764
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,470
Yes.

765
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:07,490
You made drinks in such a fun and satisfying way.

766
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,720
It was so impressive that I could not forget.

767
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,920
What's this?

768
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,020
Jung Su Gyeom was there that night, too?

769
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,760
My film cut off that night...

770
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,500
I mean, I cannot remember that night.

771
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,220
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

772
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,190
I do not know how to return the favor.

773
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,620
You do not have to do anything special.

774
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,770
But I have a request.

775
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,730
Would you say yes?

776
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,360
Of course. Tell me.

777
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,600
Could you join the Seonmun Club

778
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,580
that I created?

779
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,300
Seonmun Club?

780
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,890
Seonmun Club is a drinking club

781
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,860
disguised as an astrology club started by him.

782
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,690
I have always been interested
in the sun, moon, and stars.

783
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,550
I started the club to study the celestial bodies'

784
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:05,170
movements and discuss life and fate.

785
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,850
I know that's just an excuse to drink.

786
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,650
Don't try to make it sound impressive.

787
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,590
Jung Su Gyeom is smoother than I thought.

788
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,160
I heard the next full moon will be big.

789
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,590
How about we enjoy your fascinating

790
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,000
and unusual drinks together, then?

791
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,050
The cocktails made a great impact.

792
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,490
But I'm running away now.

793
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,420
I appreciate the suggestion, sir.

794
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,150
But a nobleman's daughter can't leave home at night

795
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,650
and drink on top of that.

796
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,000
But if you want the recipes for the cocktails,

797
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,030
I'll write them down for you.

798
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,330
You cannot.

799
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,970
I want you to teach me everything

800
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:50,020
directly in person. And...

801
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,720
it is not about alcohol.

802
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,330
Studying the sky is...

803
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:00,270
the most romantic thing
the current youth can enjoy.

804
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,080
I want you to enjoy the romantic experience, too.

805
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,720
You will not say no to me, will you,
Maiden Sun Chaek?

806
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,600
J-Just once, then.

807
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,220
I do not allow it.

808
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,650
Beon.

809
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,920
What brings you here?

810
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,340
And what do you mean you will not allow?

811
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,660
I am planning to ban all the gatherings between

812
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,910
unwed men and women of the capital for now.

813
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,710
Why all of a sudden?

814
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,940
There is something I need to protect and manage.

815
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,330
The yellow leaves are so nice.

816
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,030
Fellas, isn't that Sun Chaek?

817
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,860
What are you all doing here?

818
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,580
What are you doing here, then?

819
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,650
You were here, too, Prince Gyeongseong.

820
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:44,760
Let us greet you.

821
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,330
Yes.

822
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,970
Are you my future brothers-in-law?

823
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,880
Brothers-in-law, did you say?

824
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,600
I think you heard him wrong, Hyungnim.

825
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,760
No, he heard me correctly.

826
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,850
It sounds like your sister...

827
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,800
did not tell you anything.

828
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,010
What strange things
were you talking about, anyway?

829
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,540
I, Prince Gyeongseong,
will declare directly and openly.

830
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,340
Right now?

831
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,630
Your sister and I will soon-

832
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,130
She will soon-

833
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,360
Cover your ears. Cover your ears.

834
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,110
W-What...
No, no!

835
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,470
She will soon-
No!

836
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,640
This handsome psycho's
obsession for his first night

837
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,280
will end when I die, it seems.

838
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,430
Sun Chaek!

839
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,500
[Epilogue]
Gosh, gosh...

840
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,520
You should have watched where you were going.

841
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,740
Shit. What about you, then?

842
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,570
Geez, should I hit you or not?

843
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,360
This is your fault.
My fault?

844
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,750
You little...

845
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,200
Why are you doing this to us?

846
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,980
We were just passing by-

847
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,740
Do you know...

848
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,940
who you dared to threaten?

849
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,510
She will become my wife soon.
Me, Prince Gyeongseong.

850
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,360
Prince Gyeongseong...

851
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,030
F-Forgive us.

852
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,380
We were just trying to feed ourselves to survive.

853
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:04,560
By the way, she ran away
holding another man's hand.

854
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,390
No, don't...

855
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,050
If you did this to feed yourselves and survive,

856
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,410
I should get rid of your mouths first.

857
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,290
Pardon?
Pardon?

858
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,410
S-Spare us!

859
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,080
Beg him right now.

860
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,140
Forgive us. Please spare us.

861
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,930
We do not know what we did, but...

862
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,410
Y-You saw me at the teahouse?

863
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,210
It was so impressive that I could not forget.

864
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,450
Consider yourselves lucky today.

865
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,330
