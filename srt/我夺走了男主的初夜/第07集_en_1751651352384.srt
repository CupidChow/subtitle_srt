1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,910
The result of the selection
that the Queen Mother pushed for

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,080
was her passing out?

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,390
I... I should have seen that.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,870
I should have seen that.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,580
So, how is the Queen Mother feeling now?

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,530
That Westerner knows the Do family very well.

9
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,020
If you stop the selection process,

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,760
I will not reveal who was behind this.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,810
How did Prince Gyeongseong find out?

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,050
He sure is something else.

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,010
Since the selection was canceled as he wanted,

14
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,120
he probably will not threaten me anymore.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,370
The Queen Mother and a Westerner?

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,380
What does she need to hide by

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,460
risking humiliation like that?

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,470
Bring in Prince Gyeongseong now.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,590
Prince Gyeongsong!

20
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,680
His Majesty wishes to see you.

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,720
Do you have to leave again?

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,050
Yes.

23
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,470
I really hate waiting.

24
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,240
But there's no choice.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,390
I'll be waiting patiently.

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,980
I will be back soon.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,400
Wait here without going anywhere.

28
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,100
Yes, Obsessive Tyrant.

29
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,280
I hear there was a commotion
at the Queen Mother's Palace today.

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,740
She planned this selection...

31
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,000
since she treasures you so much.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,270
But you behaved rudely there.

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,440
You went too far this time.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,980
My apologies, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,850
Why did you drag the Westerner
to the Queen Mother's Palace?

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,590
She never leaves the Palace.

37
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,750
There is no way she met a Westerner.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,690
If so,

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,770
was the Do family who does business often

40
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,420
with foreign countries involved in this?

41
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,590
Is Do Bae Myeong's family
plotting something secretly?

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,820
Tell me.

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,360
Right now.

44
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,430
It was just a trivial commotion.

45
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,280
It is nothing
you should worry about, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,140
Trivial...

47
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,460
T-Trivial... trivial...

48
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,420
Because it is trivial,

49
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,760
you will not report it to me?

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,980
Because I know how loyal you have been,

51
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,110
I ordered your wedding to be
considered a royal wedding,

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,350
but I do not think...

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,230
you are ready to start a family.

54
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,470
Therefore, delay the wedding.

55
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,000
And behave cautiously and be reflective for now.

56
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,020
I cannot do that.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,930
What did you just say?

58
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,560
Let me take care of my own wedding.

59
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,070
Let you...

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,670
take care of your wedding?

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,210
Yes, yes.

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,730
You voiced your opinion for the first time.

63
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,660
There must be a reason for it.

64
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,110
Do not get me wrong.

65
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,600
I am just worried you would be criticized.

66
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,830
I will not cause you any harm.

67
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,220
[Episode 7: Inflection point in the story]

68
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,040
Cha Sun Chaek.

69
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,550
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

70
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,400
Are you really okay?

71
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,440
I'm okay.

72
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,030
I was so afraid that

73
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,630
I might never see you again.

74
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,290
I should not have left you alone.

75
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,040
I am sorry.

76
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,120
It is not your fault.

77
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,160
You saved me.

78
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,420
When I was drowning,

79
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,370
I thought I would actually die.

80
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,750
But in that moment,

81
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,890
I thought of you, Prince Gyeongseong.

82
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,500
I thought I'd never see you again.

83
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,470
I was so afraid.

84
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,060
I...

85
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,030
love you.

86
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,490
Cha Sun Chaek,

87
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,760
I want you to...

88
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,260
swear on your confession earlier.

89
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,360
Swear?

90
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,150
Swear on the moon and the stars

91
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,280
and kiss me.

92
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,510
If that's what you want, I can do it all night.

93
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,120
Would you be able to handle it?

94
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,420
At first, I thought he couldn't be mine.

95
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,840
Your smile, eyes,

96
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,430
and even your voice.

97
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,270
If they belonged to someone else but me...

98
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,490

Smile a bit, Prince Gyeongseong.

109
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,880
Smile a bit.

110
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,130
What did you think of me when you first met me?

111
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,980
You seemed very unstable.

112
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,640
Is that all?

113
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,640
And you were very beautiful.

114
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,970
They must be planning to stay up all night.

115
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,210
Will she have babies
as a wedding gift at this rate?

116
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,570
Give me a break. Seriously.

117
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,990
Why is the night so endless?

118
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,240
I feel lonely.

119
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,290
My Lady, calm down!

120
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,290
How dare you tell me to calm down?

121
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,280
Do you think I am a joke, too?

122
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,980
Get out. Get lost!

123
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,130
Does this symbol not look familiar?

124
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,780
No...

125
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,410
No.

126
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,010
I did not do it.

127
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,960
No one can find out.

128
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,220
N-No one.

129
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,290
F-Father.

130
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,000
I heard about what happened.

131
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,370
I-I...

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,770
Buying a fake nobility note

133
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,760
cannot change one's fate, I suppose.

134
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,530
My Lady, I purchased everything you ordered

135
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,690
to get for the children.

136
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,770
I have not visited them in a while.

137
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,910
I will visit them soon.
Please pack them up well for me.

138
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,310
Wake up, Your Highness.

139
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,270
Prince Gyeongseong, we need to get up.

140
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,520
Just a couple more hours.

141
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
Come on. Let go, I said.

142
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,180
Have you already changed your mind?

143
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,440
It's not that.

144
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,150
I also have a solution, then.

145
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,290

146
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,360
Come on
No, no!

Hoseondang breakfast?

182
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,740
It's simple, and it has
all the essential nutrients.

183
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,290
And it's pretty to look at.

184

It's the perfect breakfast.

185
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,590
You could have made the servants cook.

186
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,380
To be honest, one of the things I've wanted to do

187
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,710
was having a hotel breakfast during a staycation.

188
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,860
Think of this as a hanok hotel suite.

189
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,080
Only I know what the breakfast is like.

190
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,490
Come on and try it.

191
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,950
Here.

192
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,900
Say, ah.

193
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,870
How is it?

194
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,940
I'm sure it tastes amazing

195
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,430
because I made it with love.

196
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,220
Look how touched you are.

197
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,310
Okay, then, try this, too.

198
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,570
I will eat the rest of it.

199
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,200
Okay.

200
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm so happy to see you enjoying my cooking.

201
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,860
Should I make you breakfast every day from now on?

202
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,820
Dear husband...

203
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,330
Have breakfast.

204
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,520
It's yukjeon, your favorite.

205
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,190
Dear, say, ah.

206
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,560
If you don't finish this,

207
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,710
I'll be angry.

208
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,180
This, too.

209
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,930
It looks tasty.

210
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,780
Aigoo, seriously.

211
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,130
What a waste. Look at all this.

212
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,260
What's wrong with it...

213
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,330
This is not edible.

214
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,810
With my skill level,

215
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,950
I could have a hit breakfast
spot in Hanyang, right?

216
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,600
Should I make you lunch, too?

217
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,220
Our country is all about eating three meals a day.

218
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,990
I hate to interrupt your happy moment,

219
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,180
but His Excellency is about to punish you.

220
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,380
If you do not go home now,
he might really lock you up this time.

221
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,020
Right. I don't think he'd forgive me this time.

222
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm sorry, but I need to go now.

223
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,530
Eat lunch without me.

224
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,720
A grown woman...

226
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,070
slept outside again?

227
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,140
Forgive me, Father.

228
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,330
Calm down, Your Excellency.

229
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,180
She was staying at Hoseondang safely, at least.

230
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,440
How is that place safe?

231
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,550
It is the most dangerous place.

232
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,120
T-There was a special circumstance yesterday.

233
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,020
Why do you have special circumstances so often?

234
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,770
Since we're on the topic, Father...

235
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,380
I think...

236
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,800
I should get married as soon as possible.

237
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,790
If I get married and move out,

238
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,520
I'd no longer be staying out the night.

239
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,790
I want to get married as soon as possible

240
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,810
and leave this family.

241
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,260
Your Excellency.

242
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,110
Gosh.

243
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,350
Your Excellency.

244
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,220
Your Excellency! Madam! Please come out!

245
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,850
Prince Gyeongseong,

246
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,800
what brings you here?

247
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,290
I brought the wedding proposal myself

248
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,850
because I want to marry your daughter.

249
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,920
I already said that I am against this marriage.

250
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,820
Please leave now.

251
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,480
Father.

252
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,430
Your Excellency, he is such
an important son-in-law-to-be.

253
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,640
You cannot kick him out like this.

254
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,830
Please come inside and have some tea.

255
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,350
Wife, how is he a son-in-law-to-be?

256
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,570
Sun Chaek slept outside twice because of you.

257
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,810
He is not an important guest.

258
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,670
We should call him a daughter thief.

259
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,750
I am willing to live with you
as your son-in-law as well.

260
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,130
Who would refuse to live
with such a dependable son-in-law?

261
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,880
He means...

262
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,190
he wants to move in with us?

263
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,550
Only walk on petals from now on.

264
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,710
I am against it!

265
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,330
M-Move in?

266
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,460
Get married and leave this family quickly!
Go on!

267
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,130
Aigoo...

268
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,330
Father!
Your Excellency.

269
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,230
Is he feeling ill?

270
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,690
He is ill due to anger.

271
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,070
His chest seems to be filled with anger.

272
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,610
It is about to explode.

273
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,680
I want all of you gone!

274
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,780
Father, calm down.

275
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,570
Go ahead and go inside.

276
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,920
My Lady, let us avoid this.
You are making Father angry.

277
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,900
I meant you, too!

278
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,860
Aigoo... aigoo...

279
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,820
You are unbelievable.

280
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,790
You are the unbelievable one.

281
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,800
Do you like handsome men that much?

282
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,100
Is that why you called him a son-in-law-to-be?

283
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,730
Beauty lasts not just three months but forever.
I still believe that.

284
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,940
But that is not why I want him as a son-in-law.

285
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,480
Regardless of your opposition,

286
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,970
he willfully brought the wedding proposal.

287
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,890
He only shows warmth toward Sun Chaek.

288
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:24,550
I wanted to support him for that reason.

289
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,550
Even so, I will not change my mind.

290
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,320
Do you not remember?

291
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,640
When I said I would marry you,

292
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,490
my parents were so against it.

293
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,750
Ultimately, no parent can bend their child's will.

294
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,310
I threatened to shave my head and become a monk.

295
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,060
I broke my parents' hearts and...

296
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,300
ended up marrying you.

297
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,610
You should stop now and approve them.

298
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,580
You just do not know what kind
of person Prince Gyeongseong is.

299
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,950
Geez.

300
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,380
Prince Gyeongseong must've been very flustered.

301
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,200
Gosh, why did Father have to be like that?

302
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,030
My Lady, I think you caught a cold.

303
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,760
What happened to you last night?

304
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
Who was the person...

305
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,870
who pushed me?

306
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,830
They definitely are resentful of me.

307
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,560
Does this symbol not look familiar?

308
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,080
Was it Do Hwa Seon after all?

309
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,820
I won't tolerate her anymore.

310
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,630
I'd better settle things this time.

311
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,370
What brings you here?

312
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,030
You must know better than I do.

313
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,680
If this is about the other day,
I've heard about it.

314
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,490
I heard the Westerner we were
caring for caused trouble.

315
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,190
It's not just any trouble.

316
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,710
It's serious trouble.

317
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,880
You are also responsible for opening up to

318
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,050
a stranger without any doubts.

319
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,010
How could a nobleman's daughter mingle with

320
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,910
a stranger without any fear?

321
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,980
You want to turn it around and blame me?

322
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,430
That Westerner tried to kill me.

323
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,260
That is none of my business.

324
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,330
Just tell me what you want.

325
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,050
I am happy to compensate you.

326
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,380
Compensate?

327
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,680
Can you put a price on a person's life?

328
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,370
That's not what I want.

329
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,440
What I really want is your apology.

330
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,770
A sincere apology.

331
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,530
The original story changed a long time ago.

332
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,830
The male lead fell in love with me,
a side character,

333
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,250
and promised to spend his life with me.

334
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,760
Lady Sun Chaek.

335
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,710
And the female lead became my best friend.

336
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,750
The supporting male character might be

337
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,390
able to win the female lead's heart as he wanted.

338
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,410
If so, maybe the villain could change, too.

339
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,250
Stop acting fake, Cha Sun Chaek.

340
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,080
You are on your high horse because

341
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,220
you think you will marry Prince Gyeongseong soon.

342
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,410
But wait and see if you could be
happy after insulting me like this.

343
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,690
I didn't tell anyone that you
pushed me into the water.

344
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,270
Not even Prince Gyeongseong.

345
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,020
Because I wanted to give you a chance.

346
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,380
What do you keep rambling on about?

347
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,660
Wake up, Do Hwa Seon.

348
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,820
Stop torturing others and live your life.

349
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,560
If you keep acting like this,

350
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,990
you might actually die.

351
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,850
You think I will die alone?

352
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,590
Wait and see!

353
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,510
All right.

354
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,470
This is a 30-year old

355
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,770
mountain ginseng wine my father has been hiding.

356
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,170
You are day drinking?

357
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,530
Are you that happy the selection was canceled?

358
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,660
It is not like that.

359
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,950
To congratulate you for overcoming hardship,

360
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,980
I wanted to share this precious wine with you.

361
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,440
Do not drink it with me. Drink it with...

362
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,750
that maiden instead.

363
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,790
I wish I could-

364
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,980
Do you like her that much?

365
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,750
You must know how I feel.

366
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,260
She came serendipitously and stole my heart.

367
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,070
My hunch says she is the one.

368
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,210
I am desperate not to lose her.

369
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,260
I have never felt this way before.

370
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,460
You are experiencing something
for the first time, too.

371
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,620
You are right.

372
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,360
We are friends for a reason.

373
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,320
Friends?

374
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,760
If so, it is your turn now.

375
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,330
I know something about this matter.

376
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,870
Move straight ahead.

377
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,580
Men are supposed to move straight ahead.

378
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,410
Straight ahead?

379
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,880
Yes. It is my turn to take action.

380
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,580
You are the best, Beon Beon.

381
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,850
I will do so right away. Straight ahead.

382
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,560
Straight ahead.

383
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,460
Anyway, I heard His Majesty scolded you for

384
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,530
creating a scene at the Queen Mother's Palace.

385
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,910
There are so many invisible eyes
and ears in the Palace.

386
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,390
I heard he told you to delay the wedding, too.

387
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,280
Do you still not know me?

388
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,630
Once I set my mind to something,

389
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,110
I make sure to do it.

390
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,790
That is why I am worried.

391
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,820
I am worried your relationship
with His Majesty would be ruined.

392
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,000
From what I hear,

393
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,800
Yi Gyu, Prince Seonghyeon, is returning soon.

394
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,690
You never know if Prince Seonghyeon

395
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,950
still resents you.

396
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,190
You are siding with someone who
killed my father and your mother.

397
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,570
Do you want to live like an animal?

398
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,210
I will never forget this day.

399
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,840
Both you and this disgusting world.

400
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,200
All right. All right.

401
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,390
Yes, yes. Got it, then.

402
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,730
I came to escort you, Prince Seonghyeon.

403
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,270
Get lost.

404
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,620
Hold on. Hold on.

405
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,990
Hoseondang. It has been a while.

406
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,520
Lower the sedan chair.

407
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,870
Yes.

408
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,350
I want to walk alone from here.

409
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,870
The more you get, the cheaper.

410
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes.

411
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,840
Do Hwa Seon's life would be
determined by her choices.

412
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,090
Cha Sun Chaek?
Yes?

413
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,730
Sun Chaek, right?

414
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,900
Who...

415
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,270
Do you not recognize me by chance?

416
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,150
Look carefully.

417
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,710
It is me, Yi Gyu.

418
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,740
Yi Gyu? I don't remember that name from the book.

419
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,900
Are you very surprised?

420
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,420
Maybe I do remember.

421
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,360
It's been a very long time, right?

422
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,680
Yes. It's been over 10 years.

423
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,130
Ten years is long enough to not recognize you.

424
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,520
We promised to marry each other as kids.

425
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,890
I am disappointed.

426
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,160
I recognized you instantly.

427
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,090
Huh? Promised to marry?

428
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,520
You sound different than before, too.

429
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,240
Are you really the Sun Chaek I know?

430
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,080
Well, t-the thing is...

431
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,720
My Lady!

432
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,080
My Lady!
Bang Wool, there you were.

433
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm in a hurry. Well, then.

434
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,790
Sun Chaek. Sun Chaek...

435
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,290
My Lady, who were you talking to?

436
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,080
Who were you with?

437
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,470
I don't know. I've never seen him before.

438
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,610
But he said something about us being engaged.

439
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,900
Pardon?

440
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,440
You did not cause trouble behind my back, did you?

441
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,260
Probably not?

442
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,250
Gosh, My Lord.

443
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,220
I have never seen you so down before.

444
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,430
It is because the Chief State
Minister is against it, right?

445
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,440
Some things do not go the way I want them to.

446
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,540
You have only been looking
straight ahead all this time.

447
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,470
Same with the matters of the royal family...

448
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,170
and marrying Lady Sun Chaek, too.

449
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,390
They say to take a detour if the path is blocked.

450
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,460
I think of this as an opportunity.

451
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,190
An opportunity for you to enjoy
everyday happiness like everyone.

452
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,430
Everyday happiness?

453
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,640
Think about the scenery you missed

454
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,030
while only running straight ahead.

455
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:57,430
Those might be the most
precious moments in the end.

456
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,720
Think as if you are taking a brief detour

457
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,470
and try doing the things you
have wanted to do with Lady Cha.

458
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,690
Bang Wool, isn't something strange?

459
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,060
There are no pedestrians on the streets.

460
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,560
It is not that there are none.

461
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,180
They cannot come here.

462
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,870
Why not?
Some impressive person...

463
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:32,210
rented this entire area.

464
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,010
They rented this area?
Yes.

465
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,650
Prince Gyeongseong?

466
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,840
Did you really rent this whole place?

467
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,000
The entire market?

468
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,870
Is that even possible?

469
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,740
Of course. I am Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong.

470
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,630
But you shouldn't have...

471
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,730
I did not want our precious time to be interrupted.

472
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,310
Thinking now,

473
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,950
this is our first time walking
together holding hands.

474
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,890
Let us discover...

475
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,840
numerous small and big first moments together.

476
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,270
Come on.

477
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,250
You can sound so romantic, too.

478
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,170
I want to go on a trip with you

479
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,590
and go watch cherry blossoms together.

480
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,030
The sky lanterns. I want us
to fly sky lanterns, too.

481
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,730
I want us to see the ocean together, too.

482
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,580
How about you?

483
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,090
I do not care what it is.

484
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,230
As long as I can be with you.

485
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,850
Let us go.

486
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,140
Can you still tell me something specific?

487
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,200
Think of just one.

488
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,930
Now, now. Stop!

489
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,800
My turn.

490
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,400
Wow, pretty good.

491
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,680
You are bad, too.

492
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,750
Everyone!

493
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,950
My Lady is here!

494
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,400
My Lady!

495
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,710
Slow down. Slow down. Come here.

496
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,290
Come here. Guess what I brought.

497
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,840
Ta-da.
Snacks!

498
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,230
Slow down. One by one. Eat slowly.

499
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,610
Play with us like last time.

500
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,450
Did we play hide and seek last time?

501
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,440
Read us a book, too.
All right, all right.

502
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,990
Play with us! Play with us!

503
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,090
Slow down.
Play with us! Play with us!

504
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,600
All right. Eat slowly.

505
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,800
Eat slowly.
Everyone!

506
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,790
You cannot harass the pretty lady.

507
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,720
Here. This is for you.

508
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,370
Pass!
It is mine!

509
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:24,010
So, what brings you here, Sir?

510
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,320
Give me!
It is mine!

511
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,920
Let me try.

512
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,710
Seeing those kids...

513
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,250
reminds me of when I used to wander
after losing my parents.

514
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,150
Children suffer the most in difficult times.

515
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,920
I did not expect to see you here, by the way.

516
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,070
I was surprised, too.

517
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,860
I will help a lot from now on.

518
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,520
Let us do good together.

519
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,210
I will teach them how to read whenever I can.

520
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,870
Really?

521
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,440
That would be greatly helpful.

522
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,200
I like children.

523
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:22,770
I think you will be a great husband.

524
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,830
D-Do you mean it?

525
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,200
Gosh, so pretty.

526
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,260
They're all pretty.

527
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,940
Should I buy you one?

528
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,220
Looks so delicious.

529
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,430
Prince Gyeongseong, say, ah.

530
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,650
Say, ah.
Ah...

531
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,150
So tasty.

532
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,540
If you miss the opportunity right ahead,

533
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,280
you will regret it forever.

534
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,070
I cannot do it.

535
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,000
It is not that you cannot. You are not doing it.

536
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,510
Watch carefully and see how I win.

537
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,720
The kids are having fun.

538
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,930
Once you get into something,
you need to see it through, right?

539
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,000
Why did you have to be so childish with the kids?

540
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,650
I taught them to work hard for small things, too.

541
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,470
Yes, yes. Of course you did.

542
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:18,930
Still, I've never seen you
enjoying yourself so much.

543
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,890
Of course, I am planning to teach
this to our children, too.

544
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,530
Our children?

545
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:28,770
I realized I like how lively it is when

546
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,880
there are many children around.

547
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,950
So...

548
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,820
is having 10 children enough for us?

549
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,470
Why would you suddenly plan that now?

550
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,200
The children's hanbok.

551
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,740
I will take all of these here.

552
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,100
Gosh, I don't know!

553
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,300
Is 10 not enough?

554
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,500
How about 12?

555
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,010
I do not care if they are boys or girls.

556
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,140
I did not think your favorite would be gukbap.

557
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,360
It is so unexpected.

558
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,210
It is the dish my father bought
me when we first met.

559
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:38,820
Eating it reminds me of that time.

560
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,310
Whenever I eat delicious food,

561
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,990
I am reminded of my mother,
who passed when I was a kid.

562
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,480
Since you look so aristocratic,

563
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,360
I thought you had been pampered by your mother.

564
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,420
Just like you,

565
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,280
she felt rewarded for helping those in need.

566
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,220
I am thinking of my mother...

567
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,260
more than usual today.

568
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,930
I showed you an embarrassing side of me.

569
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,630
Not at all.

570
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:34,150
I am grateful that you shared
what is in your heart.

571
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,410
How is Merchant Cho these days?

572
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,140
He is disappointed about the selection,

573
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,210
but there is nothing that can be done.

574
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:57,340
I think the Heavens decide who we end up with.

575
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,150
I completely agree with you.

576
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,070
What is wrong?

577
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,940
I will go to the outhouse briefly.

578
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,630
Father.

579
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,710
Follow me.

580
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,010
If you give me a moment...

581
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,620
I told you to follow me.

582
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,970
The person you are with reflects who you are.

583
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,260
I was just eating gukbap-

584
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,830
Do you think I do not have eyes or ears?

585
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,970
Why would you mingle with a lowly born

586
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,780
who does not know who her parents are.

587
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,440
Are you in the right mind?

588
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,060
His food is cold.

589
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,340
Where did he go?

590
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,030
So pretty.

591
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,050
Pretty, right?

592
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:04,210
Gosh, watch out for the bee, My Lady.
Pardon?

593
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,940
Hold still.

594
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,120
This bee has a discerning taste.

595
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,810
In this capital, no...

596
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,460
it recognized the most beautiful
flower in this country.

597
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,820
I guess I will spare its life.

598
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,310
Is it okay if I did?

599
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,360
Gladly.

600
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,350
Do they not smell good?

601
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,710
They smell amazing.

602
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,650
Cha Sun Chaek,

603
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,300
something urgent came up for me.

604
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,060
Could you...

605
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,210
wait for me at Bangmuljeon?

606
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,280
What's it about?

607
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,220
Something urgent came up.

608
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,740
It must be very urgent.

609
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,620
It is very urgent.

610
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,460
It is right there.

611
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,710
Go ahead.
All right.

612
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,300
So, would you like some flowers?

613
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:19,540
Prince Gyeongseong is cute.

614
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,800
Which flowers will he give me?

615
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,270
Are you not the cocktail maiden
from the Cha family?

616
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,310
Cocktail maiden...

617
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,110
Oh, yes. It is me.

618
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,070
It is an honor to meet you.

619
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,770
We are aware of your reputation.

620
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,740
I heard you made rare drinks

621
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,760
called cocktails at this teahouse.

622
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,150
Could you give us a chance to try them today?

623
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,970
I'm sorry, but I don't make that stuff anymore.

624
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,700
Do not be like that. Share the good stuff with us.

625
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,720
We will bring the top quality wines.

626
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,260
No, no. I can't.
Let us go.

627
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,240
No, no.
She said no.

628
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,060
Are you okay, Sun Chaek?

629
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,190
Who...

630
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:22,030
Gosh, look who is here.

631
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,450
It is Prince Seonghyeon.

632
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,880
I thought you were dead since
I heard no news about you.

633
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,520
But I returned instead of dying.

634
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,010
I know you are the royal relatives,
but do not act like thugs.

635
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,070
Why would you harass this delicate woman?

636
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,050
Let us go, Sun Chaek.
Come now.

637
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,820
Why would you get involved in her business?

638
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,870
Have you no fear since you have
wandered for too long?

639
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,010
You need to know when to step in or not

640
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,750
to stay alive, at least.

641
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,700
Keep pressuring someone who said no

642
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,290
is an impolite thing to do.

643
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,740
He suddenly cares about being polite?

644
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,640
Please do not fight.

645
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,850
I will teach you next time-

646
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,810
Do not teach these rude men anything.

647
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,010
Do you have a special relationship
with this maiden?

648
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,450
If I did,

649
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,790
would you step aside?

650
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,820
Looks like you are trying to pick a fight with us.

651
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,120
I know.

652
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,300
You should be begging us to be nice to you.

653
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,860
Are you okay?

654
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,000
I am so ashamed of this, Sun Chaek.

655
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,060
Three men are attacking one?

656
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,580
Aren't you being too cowardly?

657
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
Look...

658
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,560
Did you get hurt? Let me see.

659
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,840
I am okay, Sun Chaek.
