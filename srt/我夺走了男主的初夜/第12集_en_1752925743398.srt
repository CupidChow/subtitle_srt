1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,980
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,780
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,860
What I fear is...

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,250
the sadness my lover will feel

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,740
after hearing about my death.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,510
In any situation,

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,110
these bracelets will connect us together.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,250
Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.

9
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,740
W-Why are you not killing me?

10
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,370
This is humiliating.

11
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,940
Just kill me!

12
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,460
Because...

13
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,720
I promised not to take anyone's life

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,140
with this sword.

15
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,970
Because we weren't destined to be apart yet,

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
the moment the sun and the moon become one,

17
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,020
Inyeonok's miracle happened.

18
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,120
[Episode 12: The reencounter with the world]

19
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,700
We took care of the Chief State Minister,

20
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,750
but until the abdication process is completed,

21
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,770
we cannot ignore the opposition's movement.

22
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,200
Are you suggesting using the military force?

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,140
It was Prince Seonghyeon's idea, not mine.

24
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,510
Shedding more blood when we achieved our goal

25
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,190
is no different than what
His Majesty did a decade ago.

26
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,470
I thought our great cause was
to create a different world.

27
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,160
What a dangerous comment.

28
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,220
We do not have time to get sentimental.

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,420
We must eliminate potential resistance,
as Prince Seonghyeon ordered.

30
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,080
With the Hongmungwan official
Jung Su Gyeom's lead,

31
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,940
the officials of three ministries and

32
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,740
Confucian scholars are heading
to the King's Palace.

33
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,720
Jung Su Gyeom, you said?

34
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,150
Your Majesty!

35
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,890
Please withdraw your abdication!

36
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,420
Your Majesty, the abdication was
planned by an evil force

37
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,510
that is trying to shake the country's foundation.

38
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,100
Why do you play ignorant
of Prince Seonghyeon's impure ambition?

39
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,970
Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,910
Catch her!

41
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,010
But your foolish decision is...

42
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,580
hastening your death in the end.

43
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,550
It is finally time to go, Sun Chaek.

44
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,250
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

45
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,690
Catch that bastard.

46
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,210
Catch him, I said!

47
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,530
If you want to live,

48
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,630
drop the sword and step aside now!

49
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,770
Prince Gyeongseong,

50
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,220
how are you back here?

51
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,380
How dare you bandits...

52
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,900
come inside the Palace?

53
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,400
We were ordered to kill anyone

54
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
who goes against the King.

55
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,830
Is this...

56
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,470
truly what His Majesty wants?

57
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,330
Step back if you do not want to get hurt.

58
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,410
Stop!

59
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,710
Are you all right, Sir?

60
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,120
What are you doing here?

61
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,690
It was Prince Gyeongseong's order.

62
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,530
Prince Gyeongseong has returned.

63
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,560
Prince Gyeongseong...

64
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,570
What is taking him so long?

65
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,280
I will stop by somewhere briefly.

66
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,000
Prince Seonghyeon will be here soon.

67
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,360
Where are you going?

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,300
Because your son is facing trouble,

69
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,320
you are not going to him, are you?

70
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,700
The Chief Secretary cannot even handle his son.

71
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,120
If Prince Seonghyeon found out,
he will not be able to live

72
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,060
even if he is the Chief Secretary's son.

73
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,820
Say that again!

74
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,350
Your Excellency.

75
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,210
I think he is here.

76
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,090
Arrest everyone!

77
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Thanks to you, I took a nice trip to the border.

78
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,990
What the hell are you saying?

79
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,080
You said even sworn enemies

80
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,560
should greet each other properly.

81
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,260
Are you mocking me right now?

82
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,420
I no longer have any guilt or empathy

83
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,330
for you because of the past.

84
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,710
Soldiers!

85
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Take this traitor away!

86
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
Yes, sir.

87
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,310
Let go.

88
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,440
Let go. Let go of me.

89
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,240
How dare you!

90
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,780
Prince Gyeongseong, you bastard.

91
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,270
Let go! Let go of me!

92
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,860
Let go!

93
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,980
Let go, you bastards!

94
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,460
Let go. Let go!

95
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,560
Prince Gyeongseong...

96
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,560
It really is you, right?

97
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,730
This isn't a dream, right?

98
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,720
I came to believe in miracles.

99
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,170
I knew you'd come back.

100
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,800
Thank you for staying alive.

101
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,450
What took you so long?

102
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,630
It is not fun if the male lead
comes back too easily.

103
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:17,300
♪ Like the moonlight that is
absorbing into you right now ♪

104
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:28,330
♪ I will become someone
who illuminates your heart ♪

105
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,370

Sun Chaek!
Sun Chaek!

Sun Chaek!
Brothers!

108
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,320
Sun Chaek!
I thought I would never see you.

109
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,920
We are okay now.

110
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,750
You went through a lot because
of your foolish father.

111
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,110
Thank you.

112
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,050
I am sorry about what you went through.

113
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,860
Are you all right?

114
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,610
I am so happy to see that everyone is all right.

115
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,420
We are basically a family now.

116
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,480
That is right. Yes.

117
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,910
Let us have you return home.

118
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,690
Home... Home...

119
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,730
Let us go.

120
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,180
Go home and wait for me.

121
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,280
Where are you going now?

122
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,220
I need to stop by somewhere.

123
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
I need to see this through.

124
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,870
Your Majesty.

125
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,410
Bring a physician!

126
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,500
Will he recover?

127
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,950
He was exposed to highly toxic
incense for a long time.

128
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,500
It will take a long time for him
to detox completely.

129
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,060
Your Majesty.

130
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,570
Are you awake?

131
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,460
I am sure they said you were dead.

132
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,280
Are you back as a ghost?

133
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,040
I almost died, but I made it back alive.

134
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,700
I cannot believe it. I cannot.

135
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,330
You resented me in the past.

136
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,960
That is why you are visiting me
even after your death. You!

137
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,600
Your Majesty.

138
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,230
Your Majesty.

139
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,730
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,400
I am sorry.

141
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,870
I-I am sorry.

142
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,990
I... I...

143
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,440
I took your mother's life away

144
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,070
and I put...

145
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,300
blood on your hands. I did.

146
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
I am sorry.

147
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,330
Please... Please spare me this once.

148
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,000
P-Please spare me this once.

149
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,570
T-This once.

150
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,190
Prince Gyeongseong.

151
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,210
Spare him.

152
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,860
I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.

153
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,510
Please. Please spare him this once.

154
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,680
Spare me this once, Prince Gyeongseong.

155
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,200
This once. Spare me this once.

156
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,040
Where are you going in such a hurry?

157
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,470
Are you running away by chance?

158
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,000
What are you saying?

159
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,410
What else could I be saying?

160
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,100
Arrest her.
Yes, sir.

161
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,640
Let go of me! Let go of me!

162
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,120
Let go! Let go!

163
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,730
Do Hwa Seon! Do Hwa Seon!

164
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,270
Let go of me! I did nothing wrong!

165
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,320
Let go of me!

166
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,030
Do Hwa Seon, you...
She's still talking down to me.

167
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,640
Bye.

168
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,530
Let go!

169
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,030
I-I think there is a misunderstanding.

170
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,930
This is a misunderstanding!

171
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,130
Prince Seonghyeon. Please bring Prince Seonghyeon!

172
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,130
Because of old grudges from the past,

173
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,440
I also have not been able to look
upon the King favorably.

174
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,570
I have no choice, even if you call me
an old lady in the back room.

175
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,320
But seeing the bloodshed in the Palace again,

176
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,720
I need to make a decision.

177
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,290
For the sake of the country in crisis...

178
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,570
and the faltering King,

179
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,080
I want you to step up, Prince Gyeongseong.

180
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,660
I will also contribute the support
needed for that process.

181
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,200
Can I dare ask you to be my friend?

182
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,560
I would like to see you often.

183
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,850
It feels like a dream.

184
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,460
I have a friend now.

185
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,570
Make it quick if you have something to say.

186
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,060
For a very long time,

187
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,440
I've been fond of you.

188
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,840
Because...

189
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,060
you were my shining female lead.

190
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,380
I thought I had no one,

191
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,920
but I had made a true friend.

192
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,420
So, I was happy.

193
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,480
You are determined to turn me into a bad person.

194
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,020
That is your problem, My Lady.

195
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,960
You only care about your feelings,
and you cannot read the air.

196
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,230
Yes, because I can't read the air,

197
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,200
I really believed you wanted to be my friend.

198
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,880
I was happy and...

199
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,350
I had opened up to you about things
I couldn't with no one else.

200
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,690
And I was nosy for no reason.

201
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
And then...

202
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,980
I almost drowned to death.

203
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,600
I thought someone else was the culprit

204
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,720
and got kidnapped without anyone
knowing and almost died.

205
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,210
You kept surviving amazingly every time.

206
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,770
Since when...

207
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,780
did you change so much?

208
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,660
You haven't always been like this.

209
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,820
I never changed.

210
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,220
I have always been the same. But...

211
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,730
I changed things up since you barged into my life.

212
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,860
It was my fault in the end.

213
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,350
I'm sorry...

214
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,990
for barging into your story.

215
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,730
But hurting others is never acceptable
under any circumstances.

216
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,880
Please admit your wrongdoing and stop now.

217
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,270
Why should I stop?

218
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,710
As I watched you easily achieve
something that requires a lifetime effort

219
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,050
with a smile,

220
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,930
do you know how miserable I felt?

221
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,170
You're wrong. Not a single moment was easy for me.

222
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,090
Do you only pity yourself and
think others have it easy?

223
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,720
Do not try to lecture me.

224
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,320
Someone who tries to hurt others out of envy

225
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,150
doesn't deserve to be the lead character.

226
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:06,340
Because you'll no longer be
cheered on by the people you love.

227
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,540
Why do you...

228
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,630
Why do you keep...

229
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,490
saying such strange things?

230
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,750
Might as well strangle me or kill me.

231
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,570
Just make up your mind!

232
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,120
Confess what you tried to do

233
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,920
by forming the Heuksa Clan!

234
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,150
Heuksa Clan?

235
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,420
What are you talking about?

236
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,070
You are the one who mocked
and deceived His Majesty!

237
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,550
Ever so kindly, this man whom you sent

238
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,560
confessed to everything.

239
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,700
My Lord,

240
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
my apologies.

241
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,370
I do not know him.

242
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,130
My Lord.

243
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,230
Come on.

244
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,200
Why are you trying to frame me like this?

245
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,850
You dare cast out a man who
sacrificed himself for your cause?

246
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,590
What right do you have
to stand up there and ask?

247
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,150
I told him to do it.

248
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,880
This is why you tried to cover my eyes and ears.

249
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,560
The ones who had a deep and dark desire

250
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,230
to betray me by my side for a long time were...

251
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,030
You bastards were the ones.

252
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,070
However, if you confess to your crime now,

253
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,690
for the first and last time,

254
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,540
I will spare your life.

255
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:50,100
I will not punish your children, either.

256
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,770
Your Majesty,

257
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,010
I fell for Prince Seonghyeon's sweet talk

258
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,060
and committed an unforgivable sin.

259
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,860
Please kill me.

260
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,940
I also foolishly participated
in achieving the wrong cause.

261
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,940
Prince Seonghyeon also framed
the Chief State Minister for treason.

262
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,850
He is right.

263
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,100
He tried to cut out Your Majesty's

264
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,000
eyes, ears, hands, and feet.

265
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,820
Please kill me.

266
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,250
Please kill us.

267
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,070
I should behead all of you

268
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,490
and destroy three generations of your families,

269
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,090
but since the leader was revealed,

270
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,100
I will keep my promise.

271
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,080
However, other than your lives being spared,

272
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,070
do not expect to be forgiven in other ways.

273
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,320
How despicable.

274
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,270
Who is forgiving whom?

275
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,410
You took the throne by killing your family.

276
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,150
Did you expect to become a sage king?

277
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,280
You are not a king. You are an animal!

278
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,060
You bastard!

279
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,150
This bastard...

280
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,250
Cut his head off immediately.

281
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,950
Right now!

282
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,570
What are you doing?

283
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,950
I cannot follow that order, Your Majesty.

284
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,570
What?

285
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,630
Please do not repeat the same wrongdoing.

286
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,250
One's nature never changes.

287
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,430
You expect an animal to forgive?

288
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,850
A dog passing by would laugh.

289
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,240
You bastard. You bastard!

290
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,190
You cannot, Your Majesty! You cannot.

291
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,160
Get out of the way!

292
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,790
Move. I will kill that bastard-

293
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,140
After you took the throne that way,

294
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,120
have you felt at peace even for a day?

295
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,930
Once your life is stained in blood,

296
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,140
you cannot go back. I know it better than anyone.

297
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,670
Even if you struggle your whole life,

298
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,820
it's a shackle you cannot escape!

299
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,010
It will create another grudge that
will come back to haunt you.

300
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,490
Please end the cycle now

301
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,130
and only look ahead, Your Majesty.

302
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,460
Please sleep soundly, even for a day, Your Majesty!

303
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,880
Take care of the rest...

304
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,260
however you want, Prince Gyeongseong.

305
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,540
Where are you running off to?

306
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,480
I am not done talking!

307
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,050
You bastard!

308
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,000
I will rip him apart and kill him...

309
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,310
Let go. Let go of me.

310
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,760
Stop right there!

311
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,770
I need to tear that bastard apart.

312
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,400
Everything is over.

313
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,450
Do you want to live and die as his hunting dog?

314
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,870
That is what I chose to do.

315
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,640
You must pay for your choice as well.

316
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
It is unfair.

317
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,070
How could this world be like this?

318
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,010
I will rip all of you apart!

319
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,660
Let go! Let go! You bastards!

320
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,570
Let go! You bastards...

321
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,400
Go on and walk by.

322
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,080
Take me away now!

323
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,830
Someone told me...

324
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,140
that revenge is...

325
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,520
for the ones who cannot go back.

326
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,480
That means you have a chance.

327
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,870
A chance to turn your life around again.

328
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,460
I thought...

329
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,940
I should tell you this.

330
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,190
Hold on.

331
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,220
I came to tell you something.

332
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,250
Please tell Prince Seonghyeon this.

333
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,910
"I understand your resentment.

334
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,280
But do not become like the one you hate."

335
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,770
I want you to move on from the past

336
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,550
and find a new life.

337
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,180
I hope my sincerity reaches you.

338
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,390
At least, I can tell you do not mean it.

339
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,460
"Gumaengjusan."

340
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,350
I did not say that saying to you.

341
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,810
You said it to me.

342
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,730
Tell the actual person who told me that.

343
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,510
"This is not the end of me.

344
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,950
I will make sure to come back."

345
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,970
Tell her that.

346
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,090
What a nice day,

347
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,060
Lady Sun Chaek.

348
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,390
You proved yourself to be a true fan.

349
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,870
I admit it.

350
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,510
Thank you for giving me the chance.

351
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,720
Are you sure you won't regret staying here?

352
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,240
Even if you reach the ending

353
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,760
and this world ends?

354
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,630
What do you think?

355
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,430
Do you like it?

356
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,030
It seems like spring has arrived
in Hoseondang, Wife.

357
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,550
Why do you talk like that?

358
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,640
And "Wife"? Calling me that...

359
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,350
I love it so much,

360
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,400
Dear Husband.

361
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,270
We should have a wedding before spring comes.

362
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,650
Wedding?
Yes.

363
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,390
We need to announce that
we are officially married.

364
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,930
If we rush it, we can-
Hold on.

365
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:55,370
Don't you think the wedding could wait?

366
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,100
Is there an issue?

367
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,340
The ending.

368
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,580
Everything concludes...

369
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,950
when you reach the ending.

370
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,070
To be honest,

371
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,010
there's something I didn't get to tell you.

372
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,240
Do you have a secret lover?

373
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,670
Or a secret child?

374
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,440
I do not care about things like that.

375
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,690
N-No, it's not like that.

376
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,180
It's something even more unbelievable.

377
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,020
What is it, Father?

378
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:00,330
You will be repenting your
wrongdoings starting now.

379
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,960
Please straighten your back.

380
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,030
Gosh...
Father, do it properly.

381
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,850
You know I have a bad back.

382
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,970
You will start the silence training, too.

383
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,900
You are being too harsh to your father.

384
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,880
Who do you think I take after?

385
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,770
You lost your composure. We will start all over.

386
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,920
[Do not enter

387
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:51,030
I am back to being alone with nothing.

388
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,400
I hope we catch 10 sea bream.

389
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,720
Sea bream is not in season.

390
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,820
I-Is that so?

391
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,040
What would you like to catch, then?

392
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,290
I want to catch crayfish and cry.

393
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,530
Cray. Cry.

394
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,780
So, we are inside a novel,

395
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,780
you came from a different world,

396
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,400
and if this story ends,

397
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,870
this world will disappear?

398
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,470
Yes.

399
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,550
And romance novels like this...

400
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,140
usually end when the lead characters marry.

401
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,940
That is the reason you want to delay the wedding?

402
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,100
To prevent this world from disappearing?

403
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,470
Do you expect me to believe that?

404
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,210
I know it's hard to believe.

405
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,480
But it's true.

406
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,000
I want to be with you forever.

407
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,460
But I'm afraid that decision will result

408
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,540
in this world disappearing and tear us apart.

409
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,520
Whether you are the real Cha Sun Chaek or not,

410
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,760
I do not care.

411
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,880
Because you captured my heart

412
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,690
by being audacious like no one else,

413
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,170
my life completely changed.

414
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,300
Through you, I realized fate is

415
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,010
a miracle created by strong desires.

416
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,050
No!
Move!

417
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,690
I put my life that felt like
a punishment behind me

418
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,330
and started to dream of my future with you.

419
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:20,570
All of this was possible because you came to me.

420
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,940
You saved me...

421
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,110
and changed me.

422
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,840
So, from now on,

423
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,190
my trust and common sense

424
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,170
only dwell with you standing in front of me.

425
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,330
Prince Gyeongseong.

426
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,960
Even if this world disappears,

427
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,930
I choose to be with you.

428
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,050
If I can be with you,

429
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,770
I won't be afraid even if everything ends.

430
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,330
At this very moment,

431
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,940
I'll only look at you, my most precious one.

432
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:33,170
Wedding gift for sale!

433
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,520
Aigoo, no one here wants to buy a wedding gift.

434
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,160
Should we go to another house?

435
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,780
Wedding gift for sale!

436
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,920
You made it. Please come inside.

437
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,620
We have some hot meat and delicious wine.

438
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,410
I already had plenty of meat and wine.

439
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,000
What are you doing?

440
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,790
Lay out the straw mat.

441
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,400
Yes.

442
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,310
All right, all right. Since we want to digest,

443
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,490
let us lie down here

444
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,740
and rest a bit.

445
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,220
Aigoo, sit down, sit down.

446
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,630
Come on now.

447
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,740
It is better to lie down inside.

448
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,690
Gosh, brothers!

449
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,240
Please use your muscles.

450
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,600
I know.

451
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,140
Use your head if you do not have muscles.

452
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,350
What if I can't get married
because of my brothers?

453
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,620
That cannot be.

454
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,040
Father, Father.

455
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,480
The gift carrier needs to come in.

456
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,660
This will take all night at this rate.

457
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,120
Father.

458
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,060
We need our secret weapon.

459
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,250
Secret weapon?

460
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,020
No, no...

461
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,580
Father.

462
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,040
Please.

463
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,800
Come inside now.

464
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,240
The Cha family had this wine for generations.

465
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,200
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

466
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,610
M-Mountain ginseng...

467
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:33,690
W-We will not be tricked
by a mountain ginseng wine.

468
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,870
How about...

469
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:44,400
a cocktail made with mountain ginseng wine?

470
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,540
Cocktail?

471
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,830
If you come inside, you will be able to try

472
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,990
the famous cocktail immediately.

473
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,880
C-Cocktail? M-Me?

474
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,300
Yes, yes. I-I am coming. Cocktail...

475
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,710
Yes, let us go in. Let us go.

476
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,990
Come on in.

477
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,110
For Prince Gyeongseong and
Cha Sun Chaek to live happily ever after

478
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,110
and for everyone's longevity.

479
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,810
Cheers!

480
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,840
We will create a wave starting from the right.

481
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,220
If anyone refuses to do it,

482
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,710
we will start from the top.

483
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,570
All right. Start.

484
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,030
♪ I thought I was dreaming,
you shined like a shooting star ♪

485
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,560
♪ Daydream is like a fairytale ♪

486
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,460
All right. Let us start.

487
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,430
Brother-in-law, I have no ill feelings.

488
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,810
This is good for your vitality.

489
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,330
First beating!

490
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,780
This is good for blood circulation.

491
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,420
Second beating!

492
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,730
No...

493
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,770
Gosh.
Go easy. Easy.

494
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,990
This opens your eyes wide.

495
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,450
Third beating!

496
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,880
We will beat you as much as we love you.

497
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,390
Stop beating him, brothers!

498
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,180
He barely managed to make it back alive.

499
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,220
What if he dies again?

500
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,460
Sun Chaek, sit back just for today.

501
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,830
Yes, Sun Chaek.

502
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,630
This is good for your husband.

503
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,940
Sun Chaek, people do not die so easily.

504
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,680
Do you really think so?

505
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,360
You beat me 35 times in total so far.

506
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,130
Have you been keeping count?

507
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,290
The more you hit me,

508
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,240
the more you will see me privately.

509
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,660
I plan to live a long life, thanks to you.

510
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Let us meet up often... often...

511
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,520
often for a long time.

512
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,100
What are you doing? Put him down.

513
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,890
Does it hurt a lot?

514
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,070
You know, Prince Seonghyeon.

515
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,010
I heard the boat he was on

516
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,120
headed for exile caught in a storm and sank.

517
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,110
That also...

518
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,240
must be the ending Prince Seonghyeon chose.

519
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,960
What do you think my ending would be like, then?

520
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,520
After seeing how you made a big
decision regarding Prince Seonghyeon,

521
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,710
I became curious about the world you will create.

522
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,890
However...

523
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,290
I will put down that sword...

524
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,520
going forward.

525
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,380
I am not sure if I have told you this before.

526
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,010
I inflicted an unbearable wound on you as a child.

527
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,160
I am truly sorry.

528
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,770
This is my apology as your uncle.
