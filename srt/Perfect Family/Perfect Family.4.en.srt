(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,870
Is that the window to your room?

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,381
No.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,681
Then whose room is it?

15
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,920
Don't you know?

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,890
I'm sorry for asking something weird.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,661
Anyway, I'll see you around.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,060
I'll come by often.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,631
Sure.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Sun Hui.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,551
Be careful...

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,851
of your dad and mom.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,530
(Perfect Family)

24
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,361
Did you bump into the man...

25
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,761
who just left our house?

26
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,741
- Yes. - So you two met.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,641
What did he say?

28
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,340
Is he a relative?

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,581
You saw him often as a child.

30
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,750
Don't you remember him?

31
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,350
I don't.

32
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,291
I see.

33
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,331
I'll go and rest.

34
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,650
Be careful...

35
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,761
of your dad and mom.

36
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,541
Sun Hui.

37
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,721
What's wrong?

38
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,721
It's nothing.

39
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:12,291
Good night.

40
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,741
Are you able...

41
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,971
to sleep well?

42
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,380
Sure.

43
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,411
I'm glad to hear that.

44
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,281
Su Yeon,

45
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,320
you, and Gyeong Ho.

46
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,060
Did something happen between you three?

47
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,829
- What? - Gyeong Ho's death...

48
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,861
hit me hard as well,

49
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,471
which is why I get it.

50
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:30,630
But...

51
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,140
you haven't been yourself lately.

52
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,509
It's also odd that Su Yeon disappeared...

53
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,681
right around that time.

54
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,681
I really hope...

55
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,690
nothing happened between you three...

56
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,620
and that I know all there is to know.

57
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,390
Of course.

58
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:01,830
You can talk to me...

59
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,000
about whatever you're burdening yourself with...

60
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:07,411
or what you can't tell your parents.

61
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,310
It can be anything.

62
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,781
I also...

63
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:20,120
want to know where Su Yeon is.

64
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,531
Hyeon U.

65
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:31,960
Yes?

66
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
There's something...

67
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,531
I need your help with.

68
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,600
You both want to leave early?

69
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,810
Is this about Gyeong Ho?

70
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,281
I understand how you two must be feeling,

71
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,151
but you'll soon be seniors.

72
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:59,720
I really hope this will be the last time. What...

73
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,559
I'll talk to her.

74
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,059
Even if she falls from grace, she'll rank tenth in the school,

75
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,359
- but you... - Thank you, sir.

76
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,871
Hyeon U, I wasn't done talking.

77
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:32,891
Have a good shopping experience.

78
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,801
Wait a moment, please.

79
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,310
Just a second.

80
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,281
Sun Hui, wait for me!

81
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,411
Hey!

82
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,350
Sun Hui.

83
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
What...

84
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,661
Hey.

85
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,031
- Don't I get an explanation? - Later.

86
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,501
I'll hold you to that.

87
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,401
Sure.

88
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,310
Gosh.

89
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,810
If only she'd tell me what this is about.

90
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:31,681
Then I wouldn't worry.

91
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,661
Yes, Mom.

92
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:50,371
Sun Hui, I'm sorry, but I'll be late picking you up.

93
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,871
I'm already home.

94
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,740
What? Already?

95
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
I wasn't feeling well.

96
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,350
Where are you right now?

97
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm out grocery shopping.

98
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,590
I'll be home soon. Probably in about 30 minutes.

99
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,391
Sure, I got it.

100
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,251
Never...

101
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,251
enter this room.

102
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,891
Do you hear me?

103
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Yes.

104
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,391
I'm sorry.

105
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,931
This won't happen again.

106
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,681
It was the first time I encountered that tone of his...

107
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,651
and that look on his face.

108
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:52,320
Be careful...

109
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,320
of your dad and mom.

110
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,570
Darn it.

111
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:46,901
Darn it.

112
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,450
Don't be nervous.

113
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:58,580
Don't be nervous.

114
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,020
You startled me!

115
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,820
I need your help. Hurry.

116
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,590
You almost scared the life out of me.

117
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,599
It looks dangerous,

118
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,141
- so let me do it. - No.

119
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,911
I must see this for myself.

120
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,720
Be careful up there, Sun Hui.

121
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,251
Sure.

122
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,459
I'm good now, so look out for my mom's car.

123
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,531
Got it.

124
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,511
Darn it.

125
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,080
Darn it.

126
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,761
Sun Hui!

127
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,490
- It's your dad. Get down. - My dad?

128
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
No.

129
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,401
But I'm almost there.

130
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:23,301
Hyeon U.

131
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,370
Can you get rid of the ladder for me?

132
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,371
Hurry.

133
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,230
- Mr. Choi! - Hyeon U, it's you.

134
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,340
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

135
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,810
You're home from work early.

136
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:05,611
- I'm here to pick something up. - Okay.

137
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,111
- I see. - Where's Sun Hui?

138
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:16,390
She's home.

139
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,421
Is that so? Have a good day, then.

140
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,091
Mr. Choi!

141
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:25,061
There's something I'd like for you to see.

142
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:28,500
- I'm afraid I'm a bit busy. - It'll be brief.

143
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:31,341
Can you please take a look at this for me?

144
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,901
At what?

145
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,550
Why on earth am I dancing right now?

146
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,061
Sun Hui, hurry up and go in.

147
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,591
What's going on here? Hyeon U.

148
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,990
What are you doing?

149
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,161
He asked me to take a look at this.

150
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,269
- What... - Can you stop? I have to get going.

151
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,841
- Oh, gosh. - What's wrong?

152
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,510
Hyeon U.

153
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,311
Oh, my.

154
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,710
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

155
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,421
What is this place?

156
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,219
Hyeon U, should I call the ambulance?

157
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,490
No, I'll be fine.

158
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,561
I just got a cramp in my leg.

159
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,431
Are you sure that you're all right?

160
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,331
I'm really okay.

161
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,431
Why did you dance like that all of a sudden?

162
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,371
- Is Sun Hui inside? - Yes.

163
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,141
Honey, please bring the groceries.

164
00:20:58,411 --> 00:20:59,480
Okay.

165
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:05,450
Here.

166
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,351
It wasn't so bad.

167
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,861
- Take care. - Thank you.

168
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,940
Sun Hui, is this the only type of thing...

169
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,901
that I can do for you?

170
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,040
Sun Hui.

171
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm home, Sun Hui.

172
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,361
Sun Hui.

173
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,250
Honey.

174
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,091
Are you home?

175
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,351
Sun Hui,

176
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,350
are you feeling all right?

177
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,621
Yes, I feel better than before.

178
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,489
Dad, you're home early.

179
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,460
Yes, were you taking a shower?

180
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,990
Yes, I sweated a bit.

181
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,800
Sun Hui.

182
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,101
Do you dance with Hyeon U?

183
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,540
What? Dance?

184
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:19,940
Don't push yourself too hard.

185
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:23,050
Of course not.

186
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:26,279
I'm going to rest, Mom.

187
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,990
- I'll call you when dinner's ready. - Okay.

188
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:47,200
Can I help you with anything?

189
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,200
Don't worry about it.

190
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,040
You aren't feeling well.

191
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,010
Get some rest.

192
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,050
Here you go.

193
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,901
What's the matter?

194
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,081
About dad's relative.

195
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,710
Yes?

196
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,411
Does he know...

197
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:40,480
a lot about our family?

198
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,750
I'm not sure.

199
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,561
You don't see your relatives...

200
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,671
because of me, right?

201
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,030
Sun Hui.

202
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,000
Because you adopted me,

203
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:01,739
the elders are...

204
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,040
Don't say that.

205
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,940
- Did he say something to you? - Mom.

206
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,411
Why did you...

207
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,550
adopt me?

208
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:15,750
What kind of question is that?

209
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,689
You could've adopted someone younger or a boy.

210
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,720
Choi Sun Hui.

211
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm sorry.

212
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,601
She asks me questions...

213
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,440
as if she knows something.

214
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,510
We must keep it a secret no matter what.

215
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,811
What now?

216
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,821
We better...

217
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,561
move our plan forward.

218
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,469
- It's because you slept. - What?

219
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,600
You slept during class.

220
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,871
- Sleep isn't the problem. - Let's go to the PC room.

221
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:51,641
Let's go.

222
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,050
I have somewhere to go today. I'll get going.

223
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:00,321
Sun Hui.

224
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,970
Sun Hui.

225
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:27,411
Where are you going?

226
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,480
Sun Hui.

227
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,260
Hey, Sun Hui.

228
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,240
Hey...

229
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,611
Hey!

230
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,280
Don't worry about me and leave.

231
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,520
Yesterday, you asked me to act as a lookout at your house.

232
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,790
Right?

233
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,189
You entered your house secretly on a ladder.

234
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,730
How can I not worry about you?

235
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,270
What is it?

236
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,901
Where are you going?

237
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,841
You have to tell me so that I can help you.

238
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,341
It's not something that you can help with.

239
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,181
Hey, Sun Hui.

240
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:44,421
You can't decide whether I help you or not.

241
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,621
You aren't doing something dangerous, right?

242
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,891
Isn't there a doorbell?

243
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,061
Excuse me!

244
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,770
Excuse me!

245
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,940
Who are you?

246
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:45,681
Gosh.

247
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,391
My name is Choi Sun Hui.

248
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,061
Please wait here.

249
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,510
Gosh, the house looks like...

250
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,311
a palace.

251
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,960
What is this place?

252
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
It's my grandmother's house.

253
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,431
Your grandmother's house?

254
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,181
I haven't seen you in a long time.

255
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:58,880
What brings you here?

256
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,791
Do your parents know that you're here?

257
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,360
No.

258
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:09,661
Leave.

259
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
What?

260
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,930
Aren't you being too harsh to your granddaughter?

261
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,570
It's none of your business.

262
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,899
Grandma.

263
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,070
I refuse to be called your grandma.

264
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,311
I came to ask you a question.

265
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,740
Why do you have that?

266
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:00,181
Who is the boy in this photo?

267
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,851
I thought that you could tell me.

268
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:08,650
Who is he?

269
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:13,191
- Please tell me. - Why do you want to know?

270
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:23,300
Even if you find out,

271
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,000
you're neither my granddaughter nor my family.

272
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,200
I'd like to know.

273
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:33,681
Why are my parents trying to keep this boy a secret?

274
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,650
Grandma.

275
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,791
- Please tell me. - Shut it!

276
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,351
You freak!

277
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:48,360
Don't ever show up here again!

278
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,061
Get out!

279
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:08,581
Didn't you hear me?

280
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:11,251
Get out of here now!

281
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:14,581
Let's go, Sun Hui.

282
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,811
Sun Hui, you must be hungry.

283
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:43,081
This will soothe your stomach.

284
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,280
I know you like this.

285
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,150
Let's treat your wound.

286
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:53,089
Give it to me. I'll do it.

287
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,791
No, you should eat. You haven't had lunch.

288
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,931
- Your mom didn't pack you lunch? - She did.

289
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,161
I just didn't bring it.

290
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,041
It might sting a little.

291
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:16,510
I thought we would be spending...

292
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,550
our senior year bickering,

293
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,320
then go to college.

294
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,391
I thought your family...

295
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,561
would be happy forever like the ones I see on commercials.

296
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,431
But Gyeong Ho died...

297
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:37,570
And you're scared to go home.

298
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,510
Is that how you see it?

299
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,351
What kind of friend is Su Yeon?

300
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,220
Why are you asking?

301
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,691
I'm just asking.

302
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:07,360
Now that I think back,

303
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,431
since Su Yeon transferred to our school...

304
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,641
everything is going wrong.

305
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,010
I feel like you know something.

306
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,380
But you aren't going to tell me.

307
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:23,811
Hyeon U.

308
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:26,280
I guess you don't think I can help.

309
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,791
It's not that.

310
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,931
I still...

311
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,900
have not...

312
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,130
figured stuff out myself.

313
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,871
Your grandmother and the photo.

314
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,041
Are they all related?

315
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,681
I think so.

316
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:01,521
Well...

317
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,420
Can you promise me one thing?

318
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:08,791
Promise you what?

319
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,130
To those places that are too hard or scary to go by yourself,

320
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,590
go with me.

321
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:14,630
And...

322
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,231
when you want to talk to someone,

323
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,570
or when things are too hard for you to handle by yourself,

324
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:21,470
tell me.

325
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,541
I'll listen.

326
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,610
I'll listen on behalf of Gyeong Ho as well.

327
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:33,481
Okay.

328
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,090
I knew...

329
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,061
that my grandmother would be cold to me.

330
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,461
But why on earth...

331
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,371
did she get so mad after seeing the photo?

332
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,021
Sun Hui, you know what?

333
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:16,860
What?

334
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:19,931
In the Indian language, "A friend" means,

335
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:23,601
"A person who carries my sadness on their back."

336
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,400
That's what it means.

337
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,170
- Hyeon U. - Yes?

338
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:33,681
Help me.

339
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:39,950
Of course.

340
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:42,081
Just trust me.

341
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,150
Okay.

342
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:47,621
Oh, right.

343
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,191
Here.

344
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,231
What is this?

345
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,670
I've been carrying for a while to give it to you.

346
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,811
It's very sticky.

347
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:06,941
I kept it in my pocket for some time.

348
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,751
Don't tell me this is my gift.

349
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,880
Of course not.

350
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:17,420
It's not.

351
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:47,380
Many things happened today as well.

352
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,820
But what Hyeon U said comforted me.

353
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:55,920
(A friend is a person who carries my sadness on their back.)

354
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:57,831
A friend means...

355
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:01,030
a person who carries my sadness on their back...

356
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,200
in the Indian language.

357
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:06,001
The saying lingers in my heart.

358
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:15,441
To Hyeon U,

359
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,181
I feel like I can say everything.

360
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,600
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

361
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:39,570
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

362
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,311
- Happy birthday, dear Sun Hui - Happy birthday, dear Sun Hui

363
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,680
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

364
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:52,181
Happy birthday, Sun Hui. This is your birthday gift.

365
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,020
It's so cute!

366
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,351
- Do you like it? - I do!

367
00:43:58,391 --> 00:44:01,160
That's called a diary. From now on,

368
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:04,760
you write down everything that happened every day and be honest.

369
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:06,030
Okay.

370
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,020
I'm home.

371
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:33,691
- You are home. - How was school? Was it fun?

372
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,691
Yes.

373
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,800
I fought with Gyeong Mi again today.

374
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:16,601
Gyeong Mi...

375
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:19,941
told everyone that my parents weren't my real parents.

376
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,941
I can stand it when she teases me.

377
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:27,811
But it teared me up because she said bad things about my parents.

378
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,950
I don't want to go to school because of Gyeong Mi.

379
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:46,331
Gyeong Mi moved to another school.

380
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,731
I heard something happened to her family.

381
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,430
My mom said...

382
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:55,041
- Gyeong Mi got injured badly. - What?

383
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:58,911
No, my mom said Gyeong Mi's father died.

384
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:02,711
I heard Gyeong Mi's dead.

385
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,931
I will be out for a moment.

386
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,900
Where are you going so early on Saturday?

387
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,811
I have to work on my assignment with Hyeon U.

388
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:32,970
- I'll be back. - Okay.

389
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,090
Sun Hui.

390
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:52,891
- Did you have a good sleep? - I did.

391
00:46:53,661 --> 00:46:55,931
- That's good to know. - How about you?

392
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:57,700
I had a good sleep.

393
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:00,541
Did you eat?

394
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:04,441
- Yes. - That's good.

395
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:28,860
(Recent search history)

396
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,500
(Family relation certificate)

397
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:35,800
(Death certificate, Adoption certificate)

398
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:42,780
(Viewing adoption certificates, Can I change family relations?)

399
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,981
Look.

400
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,291
"Who is that person?"

401
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,391
"I'm so anxious."

402
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,431
"Many things happened today as well."

403
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,990
"What Hyeon U said comforted me."

404
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:34,360
"A friend means..."

405
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,970
"a person who carries my sadness on their back in the Indian language."

406
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,101
"The saying lingers in my heart."

407
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:44,010
"To Hyeon U,"

408
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:47,411
"I feel like I can say everything."

409
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:11,970
I'm sorry...

410
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,840
I've been worrying you.

411
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,970
It's fine. I'm okay.

412
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:22,810
Gosh, but even for me...

413
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:25,880
I don't know how I should take this.

414
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,490
Don't you think it's a bad idea to get anxious by yourself?

415
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,021
That's why I'm here to see you.

416
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,431
I feel more comfortable...

417
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:41,130
being with someone rather than being by myself.

418
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,601
Right.

419
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,641
I agree.

420
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:51,541
It looks like you still find me unreliable.

421
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,581
- Hyeon U. - Yes?

422
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,581
Thanks.

423
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:02,181
And I mean it.

424
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,431
By the way, why are you so interested in this Choi Sun Hui?

425
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:18,731
She's clearly in the center of the case.

426
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:20,771
"The case?"

427
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,041
Sir. At this rate, won't we be in danger too?

428
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,481
Listen, stupid.

429
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,581
We can't uncover the truth if we don't go against the system.

430
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,020
One of Choi Sun Hui's friends burned to death,

431
00:50:34,021 --> 00:50:35,379
and another went missing.

432
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,989
The house could've caught fire, and she could've run away.

433
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,890
Forget it. She's moving. Follow her.

434
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:41,460
All right. Gosh.

435
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:44,190
- Hurry. - What? Goodness.

436
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:46,601
How much longer are you going to stake out?

437
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:48,001
Are you here on vacation?

438
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:50,771
Dong Ho!

439
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,239
Shut it. Why do you care?

440
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,739
- It's just pathetic. - Mind your own business.

441
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,370
Don't worry about my business.

442
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,540
- But you're not. - You punk.

443
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:00,839
How dare you, jerk?

444
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,509
- The chief... - What, "Jerk?"

445
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,250
closed the case as an accident.

446
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:07,549
He closed it! Closed, you hear me?

447
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,851
Gosh.

448
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,300
Okay.

449
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:26,101
Okay.

450
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:31,570
I'm ready to listen.

451
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,880
All right.

452
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:40,181
There was an accident...

453
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:43,021
before Gyeong Ho's house caught fire.

454
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:50,731
An accident?

455
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:53,431
That day...

456
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,900
I'll tell you what I saw that day.

457
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,470
I went to Gyeong Ho's place that day.

458
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,740
Don't apologize!

459
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,581
- Let me go! - Hey!

460
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:15,021
Let go.

461
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,851
After hearing loud noises, I went into his house.

462
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:21,121
- And Su Yeon... - Su Yeon.

463
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:23,090
was holding a knife.

464
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:28,101
It's all because of you!

465
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,601
Furious, she ran toward me with the knife.

466
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:40,811
But Gyeong Ho...

467
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,010
He...

468
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,780
got stabbed while protecting me.

469
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,351
Are you saying Su Yeon killed Gyeong Ho?

470
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,461
Yes.

471
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,490
Why didn't you report her to the police?

472
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:00,731
Answer me.

473
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:02,630
- Let's report her. - No.

474
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,831
What? How come?

475
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
The police...

476
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,311
think Gyeong Ho died from the fire.

477
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:15,441
That means Su Yeon could've caused the fire.

478
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,081
No.

479
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,220
Su Yeon...

480
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:29,360
didn't start the fire.

481
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,260
What are you saying?

482
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,431
So you know who started it?

483
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:42,601
Sun Hui?

484
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:50,311
I didn't tell you so we could report to the police.

485
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,811
I'm telling you all this,

486
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,751
trusting your promise to listen to anything I would say.

487
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,521
But this is different.

488
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,121
We can't settle this by ourselves, can we?

489
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:04,490
There's something I simply need to check.

490
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,300
This is...

491
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:14,840
all I can tell you.

492
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,181
Sun Hui.

493
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,021
Report to the police,

494
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,450
and...

495
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,621
we won't be friends anymore.

496
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,030
Sun...

497
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:53,581
The beach is one of the more beautiful...

498
00:54:53,981 --> 00:54:55,411
Or is it the most beautiful?

499
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,911
Places on earth.

500
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,780
Choose the correct word.

501
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,121
Question two.

502
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,561
One of the best vacations.

503
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,431
Or...

504
00:55:11,331 --> 00:55:14,661
(Sun Hui. It's me, Su Yeon. I'm in front of school right now.)

505
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,540
(Can you come out for a second?)

506
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:21,641
(I'm really scared.)

507
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:25,840
Su Yeon?

508
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,280
(Can you come out for a second? I'm really scared.)

509
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,820
- It's finally recess. - Gosh.

510
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:43,561
Let's go to the snack bar.

511
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,280
What? Where is she?

512
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:10,990
The phone is turned off.

513
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,260
(Epilogue)

514
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,780
What is it?

515
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:44,590
It's nothing.

516
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:49,720
How many years have you been working for me?

517
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:54,800
It's been 25...

518
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,001
No, 26...

519
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,041
It's been so long that I've forgotten.

520
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,371
I see.

521
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,280
Why do you ask?

522
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:11,050
There's a memory I can't forget.

523
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,920
Watching the sunset...

524
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,990
reminds me of that day.

525
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,010
My son was an expert at climbing trees.

526
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:42,040
In autumn, he would climb the chestnut tree...

527
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,010
and shake the chestnuts off the branches.

528
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,420
But one day, he got badly injured.

529
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,521
Like usual,

530
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,859
he climbed up the chestnut tree to shake the chestnuts off...

531
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,760
but slipped and fell off the tree.

532
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:03,561
I rushed over to him.

533
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:07,101
And he was bleeding from his head.

534
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:11,811
I ran to the hospital with him on my back.

535
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,280
But actually,

536
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,521
he didn't climb the tree for the chestnuts.

537
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,121
He was being bullied.

538
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,961
To get away from the bullies,

539
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
he went up the chestnut tree...

540
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:40,840
and shook the chestnuts off to survive.

541
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,070
As you know,

542
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:48,211
I was devoted...

543
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:50,481
to expanding...

544
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:53,081
the company back then.

545
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:56,779
Only immersed in my own business,

546
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,490
little did I know what my son...

547
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,990
was going through.

548
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,530
I regret that day.

549
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:12,601
I was unqualified as a mother.

550
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,141
How strange...

551
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,240
for you to tell me...

552
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,681
about your past.

553
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,470
(Perfect Family)

554
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,760
What's giving you such a hard time?

555
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,731
Didn't abnormal events...

556
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,931
happen around you recently?

557
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:25,811
The belongings of Lee Su Yeon, the missing student, were found.

558
01:00:26,371 --> 01:00:28,740
When I went to Gyeong Ho's house, he was...

559
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,211
