12
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,111
(Episode 8)

13
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,271
We're here.

14
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
Gosh.

15
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:29,481
You call that smooth driving? My back's killing me.

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,221
Darn, my back.

17
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Get out.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,930
- Get out quickly! - On your feet!

19
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,801
Five.

20
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,441
Stand up straight!

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Gosh.

22
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,051
Is this the last one?

23
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,551
- How many are there? - Quiet.

24
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,780
One, two, three, four,

25
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:07,619
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Eleven in total.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,390
We're off. Kids, follow me.

27
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,620
Don't fall behind. Let's go.

28
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,331
Hurry.

29
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,100
Move it!

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,471
Look forward.

31
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:30,740
Only look forward.

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,721
- Get in there quickly. - Move it!

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,620
Get in there already!

34
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,620
Pick up the pace.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,590
Move it!

36
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,830
What are you looking at? Get inside!

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,640
I dare you to make a sound.

38
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:03,510
- Darn it. - Sir, you're here.

39
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,140
Where did you bring them from?

40
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,610
Their parents sold them to us.

41
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,920
That one over there is an orphan who hasn't even seen her parents.

42
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,850
There's no reason to be sad,

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,420
which takes the weight off my heart.

44
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,061
I heard we were sending them to the Philippines this time.

45
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:26,100
We're getting a better price.

46
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,670
The ship will make port tomorrow,

47
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,700
and we'll load the container as is.

48
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,010
Hey. Shut it!

49
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,281
Quiet.

50
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,680
- Shut it! - Mom!

51
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:47,991
Shut it!

52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,250
Mom!

53
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:53,660
- Mom! - Darn kids. All they do is cry.

54
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:56,661
- Mom! - Mom!

55
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,530
- Mom! - Just go to sleep.

56
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,431
- Mom! - Mom!

57
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:06,640
Mom!

58
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:12,311
- Mom! - Mom!

59
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,631
Hey. Get up already!

60
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,330
- Get up. - On your feet.

61
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,300
Gather around and move out.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,570
- Move out! - Follow me.

63
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,211
Move it.

64
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,890
Look forward.

65
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,791
- Get in there. - Where are we going?

66
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,231
Look forward.

67
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,440
We're in trouble. It's the police.

68
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,541
Hurry.

69
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,710
Get in there. Come on.

70
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:20,910
Come on.

71
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,210
Darn it.

72
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,590
- Hello, officers. - Hello.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,890
What are you doing here at this hour?

74
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,631
You see,

75
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,800
there's been a lot of theft lately,

76
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,231
so we're taking turns standing guard.

77
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,750
Well, everything seems fine. Right?

78
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,181
Nothing's out of the ordinary.

79
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,920
- We should go. - Come on.

80
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,520
- Have a pleasant day. - You too.

81
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,760
Thank you and good night.

82
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,101
Darn it.

83
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,441
Hey.

84
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,329
Hey, over there!

85
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,830
You! Get her.

86
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,970
Get her, darn it!

87
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,871
Get her!

88
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,881
Hey!

89
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,941
Stop right there!

90
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,181
You little punk. Get over here.

91
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,150
Come on.

92
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,820
Darn, that little...

93
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:47,960
Darn it.

94
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,470
Why don't you...

95
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,111
come with me?

96
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,510
Don't come closer.

97
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,650
You cheeky thing.

98
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,691
Don't come any closer!

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,220
You're cheeky but also stubborn.

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,470
I don't have any kids of my own,

101
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,601
so how about you be my daughter?

102
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,310
As if I'm that crazy.

103
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:22,290
Who'd want you as a daughter?

104
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:27,920
Wait. It's too dangerous.

105
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,890
You...

106
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,631
Get back here.

107
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:36,371
Come here.

108
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:43,471
Get over here.

109
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Come to me!

110
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,721
People die easily.

111
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,190
It's not that hard to end a life.

112
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,010
Let me go!

113
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,309
Come back to your senses.

114
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,981
But knowing that...

115
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,081
doesn't make your life easier.

116
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:06,091
Actually,

117
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,390
it may be the opposite.

118
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:19,741
Don't move.

119
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,910
Unless you want your head blown away, darn it.

120
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,550
I'll return your precious knife.

121
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,751
Here.

122
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:37,991
Hurry!

123
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,300
Lee Su Yeon.

124
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,211
You stabbed the policeman, okay?

125
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,810
And the wounded policeman...

126
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,981
shot you.

127
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,899
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

128
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,759
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors. I won!

129
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,899
I lost, but think wisely.

130
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,501
You know how it is to team up with him.

131
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,501
- Seriously? - Should I remind you of our record?

132
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,800
Here. Su Yeon, let's go.

133
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,640
- I remember a lot about Sun Hui. - Rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,451
Her laughter, her kind heart,

135
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:17,549
and the fact that she plays scissors...

136
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,390
after playing rock twice in a row.

137
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,160
That's why...

138
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,331
I can choose to win or lose while playing against her.

139
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,030
I could let her have Gyeong Ho...

140
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,800
or have him to myself.

141
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,740
- Darn it. - Nice!

142
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,711
I knew it, Sun Hui.

143
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,251
Since it has come to this, we will win no matter what. Here.

144
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,050
Let's do it.

145
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:48,821
I'm keeping Gyeong Ho...

146
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,721
to myself, Sun Hui.

147
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,331
He's worth being greedy over.

148
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,961
One, two, three. Go, team! Let's go.

149
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,701
Try to take it from me.

150
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,101
If you let me have Gyeong Ho,

151
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,741
I'll be able to forgive you for everything in the past.

152
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,910
Being forgiven by me...

153
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,221
would be better than being with Gyeong Ho.

154
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,650
Right, Sun Hui?

155
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,091
- Yes! - Nice.

156
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,930
Hurry.

157
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:32,961
Go.

158
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,461
Here you go.

159
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,001
Stop him!

160
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,650
(Perfect Family)

161
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,501
Part of the living room...

162
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,071
and the two bedrooms were completely burned down.

163
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,310
Thankfully,

164
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,040
we didn't find any dead bodies inside the house.

165
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,080
Check all surveillance cameras and dashcams in the vicinity.

166
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,280
Yes, sir.

167
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,221
How about Lee Su Yeon?

168
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:32,091
We put her on the wanted list.

169
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,830
With a hostage, she won't be able to go far.

170
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:36,890
Okay.

171
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,060
Chief.

172
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,131
We found out that...

173
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,371
Detective Lee fired a blank shot.

174
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,201
What?

175
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:41,991
You were behind it, right?

176
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,290
Where's Sun Hui?

177
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,461
How could you say something like that?

178
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,131
I stopped the fire at your house.

179
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,241
Don't worry. Just give me the money you promised.

180
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,371
I'm leaving Korea soon.

181
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,471
Exactly at noon.

182
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,211
I'll text you the address.

183
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,581
As you already know,

184
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,581
you must come alone, no matter what.

185
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,520
Until then,

186
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,790
I'll keep Sun Hui with me.

187
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,890
Swap her with the money.

188
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,131
You'd better hurry.

189
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,640
Before Sun Hui finds out everything.

190
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,730
- Welcome. - Good luck with your business.

191
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:32,200
- The meat is... - It was a rich year.

192
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,860
What would you like?

193
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,890
- About ten dollars' worth? - Ten dollars?

194
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,190
How much is this?

195
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,311
That one has a lot.

196
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:31,551
You're awake.

197
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,361
Where's Su Yeon?

198
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,900
Put these on.

199
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,861
Your dad will be here soon.

200
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:44,871
- Sorry, sir. - You punk.

201
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,801
- She almost got away. - I'm sorry.

202
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,170
- Go and get some food for us. - Yes, sir.

203
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:14,830
(Seoul Hanseo Police Station, Seohan High School)

204
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,230
(Rest in peace.)

205
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,621
Everyone, salute.

206
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:42,861
At ease.

207
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,801
A moment of silence.

208
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:57,811
At ease.

209
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,861
I'm sorry.

210
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm sorry.

211
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,760
The number you have dialed cannot be reached...

212
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,730
Why isn't Ji Woon here yet?

213
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,131
That fool.

214
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,639
(Choi Jin Hyuk)

215
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,940
Getting cash is taking time.

216
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,041
Please wait a little longer.

217
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:54,321
He must have...

218
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:56,091
abandoned you.

219
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,101
Is Su Yeon alive?

220
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:06,400
Where is she?

221
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,311
Do you hear me?

222
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,281
Your parent isn't keeping his promise.

223
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:16,581
I have no choice.

224
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,881
In this case,

225
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,321
you have to help me.

226
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,190
I don't want to.

227
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:31,061
If you help me,

228
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:33,361
Su Yeon will be safe.

229
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:37,571
Whether I kill Su Yeon or not...

230
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:39,500
depends on you.

231
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,371
You know,

232
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:46,680
the parents who raised you...

233
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,781
lived with masks on.

234
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,679
You should change your lighter now.

235
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,949
Why don't you buy me one?

236
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,680
- All you do is go to the movies... - A lighter...

237
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Detective.

238
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,990
We have something to tell you.

239
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,140
I know that you've been wanting to know.

240
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,881
I'll tell you what happened.

241
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,210
I'll tell you who started the fire at Gyeong Ho's house,

242
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,121
who killed Gyeong Ho,

243
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,791
and who also tried to kill Su Yeon.

244
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,170
We'll find Sun Hui.

245
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:58,770
We plan to put Lee Su Yeon on the public wanted list,

246
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,980
but we suspect that she has an accomplice.

247
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,280
It's impossible for a high school student...

248
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,919
to restrain a detective and abduct someone who's resistant.

249
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,620
We collected surveillance footage from the vicinity of your house...

250
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:10,420
to track down the car's license plate.

251
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,420
Su Yeon isn't the one.

252
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,730
Pardon?

253
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,761
Honey.

254
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:29,611
Su Yeon isn't the culprit.

255
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,470
And...

256
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,940
Sun Hui is probably safe.

257
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,980
Tell me everything that you know.

258
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,450
Aren't you suspecting someone in particular?

259
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:53,101
Before telling you about this,

260
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,561
I have to come clean first...

261
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,000
about who I am.

262
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:01,571
Who do you think...

263
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,771
I am?

264
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:13,851
I'm your dad.

265
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,890
Your biological dad.

266
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,430
I told you that my child was taken away from me.

267
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:27,831
That was you, Sun Hui.

268
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,170
What?

269
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:39,910
You don't look surprised.

270
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:41,781
Actually,

271
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,851
I had suspected it.

272
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,021
You...

273
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,690
For some reason,

274
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,990
you seemed familiar.

275
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,301
Ever since I saw you for the first time.

276
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,500
Dad.

277
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:24,920
The three-second rule.

278
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,160
I see.

279
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,581
They found you at the orphanage...

280
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,551
and adopted you on purpose.

281
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,420
Because you are my daughter.

282
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,291
What did you say?

283
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,121
Your parents...

284
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,061
killed their son.

285
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,631
And they tried to impute it to me.

286
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,371
They were scared that the truth would be revealed.

287
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,700
And so...

288
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:15,541
they adopted you...

289
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,740
as a hostage...

290
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,041
to seal my mouth.

291
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,410
If I didn't do as they said,

292
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,291
they would kill you.

293
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,960
- That's impossible... - I'll tell you...

294
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,660
who your foster parents are.

295
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,551
I was trapped by them.

296
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,551
And I finally was released into the world...

297
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,389
after my long sentence was over.

298
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,460
(You can restart with hope.)

299
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,959
(Thunderbolt Private Investigator)

300
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,131
We closed down. No more business!

301
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,970
How would you make a living if you closed down?

302
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,140
Hyun Min!

303
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:58,170
My goodness!

304
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:02,611
How have you been?

305
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:04,851
When did you get out?

306
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:09,791
You went through a lot.

307
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:38,910
I want to meet my daughter.

308
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,650
Help me find her.

309
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,121
Sure, why not?

310
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:50,361
Here, let me.

311
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,101
You did well.

312
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,611
Sun Hui.

313
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,581
Finding you...

314
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,680
was easier than I thought.

315
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,690
You were at this place I had seen before.

316
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:21,920
(Ha Eun Ju, Choi Sun Hui)

317
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:23,591
There is no way...

318
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,271
Is this Jin Hyuk's place?

319
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,640
I couldn't believe it.

320
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,041
I knew...

321
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:42,710
it was you as soon as I saw you.

322
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:46,551
I was touched...

323
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,281
when I saw you all grown up.

324
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:51,690
However, at that moment...

325
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,521
I was shocked to see...

326
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,460
- Did you write that girl a letter? - what was happening before my eyes.

327
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:01,061
Gosh, not yet.

328
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,771
I should get around to it,

329
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:10,111
but I don't know what I should write.

330
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,011
Right. Give it more thought.

331
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:17,249
Even those you find hard to talk to...

332
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,210
may easily understand your words when put in writing.

333
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,051
Got it.

334
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,091
Stop this now, Dad.

335
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,030
- Don't forget your lunch box. - Thank you.

336
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,430
- Enjoy your lunch. - All right.

337
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,041
So it's true.

338
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,640
What were they thinking?

339
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:48,710
Have a safe trip.

340
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,350
I was waiting for the right time...

341
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,861
to rescue you from that couple.

342
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,440
Su Yeon, you'll stay for dinner at my place today, right?

343
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:15,370
I'd rather not today.

344
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:20,440
Why? You should stay for dinner.

345
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,011
My mom's waiting for us with our meal ready.

346
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,480
It's fine. I'm good today.

347
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,650
Sure.

348
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,161
I'm sorry.

349
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:37,861
For yelling at you earlier.

350
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:42,201
I'll get going. See you tomorrow.

351
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,031
I tried to talk to you when you were on your way home.

352
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:14,400
But I couldn't.

353
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:36,620
The number you have dialed cannot be reached...

354
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,020
Then...

355
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:42,321
You ran out of your place.

356
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:44,560
And you went after Su Yeon.

357
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:19,150
I don't know.

358
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:22,460
That's none of your business!

359
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,330
- Let go of me! - Hey!

360
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,770
I got...

361
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,841
confused.

362
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:44,810
I couldn't do anything.

363
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,721
I was just waiting for you.

364
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,161
When it got dark,

365
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,960
Su Yeon quickly came out and started to run.

366
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:43,841
I was appalled...

367
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,411
to see you covered in blood.

368
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,391
I knew something had happened.

369
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:25,051
Then I watched your place a little longer.

370
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,290
This time,

371
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,861
your foster mom stepped out and headed to that place.

372
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,641
I was also about to walk into that place.

373
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,951
But I saw a car coming.

374
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,980
So I couldn't go in.

375
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:22,801
The woman walked out as soon as the car got there.

376
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:33,011
I guess...

377
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,491
she must have hidden the dead body.

378
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,721
If the family had found the dead body,

379
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,161
a police car or ambulance would have arrived right away.

380
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,471
I couldn't leave the spot...

381
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,600
because what she did bothered me.

382
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,111
Then...

383
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,241
at about 12am,

384
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,350
she came back.

385
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,861
She probably got back...

386
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,060
to wrap things up.

387
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:58,330
Fire!

388
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
Get up.

389
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,000
Get up, darn it!

390
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,870
I told your foster parents everything I saw.

391
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,210
And in return,

392
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:41,911
they blackmailed me.

393
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,011
Well, that was...

394
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,451
for Sun Hui.

395
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,451
She can't go to jail. We need her.

396
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:55,391
We just can't lose her yet.

397
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,460
Are you guys out of your mind?

398
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,131
What are you trying to do to Sun Hui?

399
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:02,559
If you want revenge,

400
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,471
- take it out on me. - Don't raise your voice.

401
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,241
Sun Hui's friend is in her room as well.

402
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,940
Keep quiet.

403
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,600
Say something!

404
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:44,411
How did the situation escalate like this?

405
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:46,741
Some more people have died.

406
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,540
Darn it.

407
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,750
It doesn't matter, though. Turn yourself in.

408
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,381
Are you once again...

409
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,790
going to pin the fire on me?

410
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,971
This puts me on the spot. I didn't know there was a witness.

411
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,611
You have to take care of her now.

412
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,411
I mean, the witness.

413
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:23,781
- What? - What's wrong?

414
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:27,221
Are you fine with Sun Hui figuring everything out?

415
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,951
What would she say if she found out...

416
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,361
that her real father killed the son of her foster parents?

417
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:41,301
Or...

418
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,230
Do you want to make Sun Hui a murderer like yourself?

419
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:49,201
Neither Sun Hui nor I killed anyone.

420
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,940
It was an accident.

421
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,841
How brazen of you.

422
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:57,911
I wonder why accidents only happen to you and your daughter.

423
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,221
Remember who caused our suffering?

424
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,150
As a father,

425
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,991
that's the least you can do for her.

426
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,600
Get rid of the witness before things get complicated. Or...

427
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,670
it'll be the end of Sun Hui's life.

428
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:23,770
Of course,

429
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,911
yours too.

430
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:33,721
If something happens to Sun Hui,

431
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,350
you'll have nothing left to lose.

432
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,150
You did this.

433
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,091
You killed them. Not just Gyeong Ho,

434
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:46,931
but also his parents!

435
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:04,551
Mr. Choi.

436
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,150
- Are you done talking already? - Sorry?

437
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:12,391
Are you leaving?

438
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,821
Sun Hui and I have somewhere to go.

439
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:20,060
Why would she leave when she's sick?

440
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,301
Where to?

441
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:28,141
Do you want me to drive you?

442
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,141
No, that's all right.

443
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,951
Take care.

444
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,870
What are you waiting for?

445
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,381
Get rid of her now.

446
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,591
(Police)

447
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,051
Without a choice,

448
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:29,190
I had to follow their orders.

449
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:33,801
Your foster parents...

450
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,361
were behind this all.

451
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,980
What backstory...

452
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:52,210
does your family have?

453
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:56,721
The one who stabbed Detective Lee...

454
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:01,560
was likely Choi Hyun Min.

455
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,661
"Choi Hyun Min?"

456
00:50:05,161 --> 00:50:06,161
Who is he?

457
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,531
That jerk killed our son.

458
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,340
He served 12 years in jail for that.

459
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:20,511
But he's not sorry about it. Rather than reflecting,

460
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,181
he blackmailed us.

461
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,350
If we didn't meet his demands,

462
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,290
he said he would kill Sun Hui.

463
00:50:45,931 --> 00:50:47,370
(Epilogue)

464
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,620
- Here. - Thank you.

465
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:06,850
- I'd like another glass. - Of what, sir?

466
00:51:07,051 --> 00:51:08,520
- The same one. - Sure.

467
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,830
- Great work, everyone. - Bye.

468
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,741
Did you run away again?

469
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:25,341
Goodness.

470
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:44,491
Why are you following me? Go away.

471
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:47,960
Sis.

472
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:51,270
What?

473
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,201
You've got something on your back.

474
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:56,540
What? Where?

475
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:04,350
- Stupid. - What's this?

476
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:09,051
How embarrassing.

477
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:11,650
Couldn't you have told me sooner?

478
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,690
You wouldn't stop walking.

479
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,201
Gosh.

480
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
Sis.

481
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,620
Can I...

482
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,631
have a dream?

483
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,591
What? "A dream?"

484
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:56,100
When we were at the orphanage,

485
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:59,531
you told me to have a dream, even if it was small.

486
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,341
Did I?

487
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,141
Yes, you did.

488
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,241
I see.

489
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:13,951
Did your dream come true?

490
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,551
Does it look like it did?

491
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,919
Gosh.

492
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,761
I'm working hard to achieve my dream.

493
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:27,060
Although reality is not that easy.

494
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:32,900
I want to live like Kim Man Deok.

495
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,500
- "Kim Man Deok?" - Yes.

496
00:53:36,701 --> 00:53:39,570
She started off as a gisaeng on Jeju Island,

497
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:43,080
then became a wealthy merchant, helping those starving to death...

498
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:45,710
and eventually even meeting the King.

499
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,980
- What an amazing person. - Right?

500
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:52,951
In a period when women couldn't travel alone,

501
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:54,891
she met the King in Hanyang.

502
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,991
She even climbed Mount Kumgang.

503
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,730
Right. Mount Kumgang.

504
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,430
I believe Kim Man Deok...

505
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:05,470
put in as much effort as possible.

506
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:08,241
- She was persistent. - I see.

507
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,600
"Persistent."

508
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:13,040
It's effort.

509
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:16,641
Let's live to the fullest!

510
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,321
Even if dreams don't come true,

511
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,891
we should live so we're happy...

512
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:32,460
looking back...

513
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,600
and there's no regret.

514
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,931
What am I saying?

515
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:02,891
Seol Kyung Gu is seriously cool.

516
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:06,190
I agree. I was totally immersed.

517
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:08,300
I know, right?

518
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,999
His eyes and the climax...

519
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
gave me goosebumps.

520
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:17,841
Really, Seol Kyung Gu...

521
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,011
is an incredible actor to everyone.

522
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:34,761
Yes. All generations like him.

523
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,031
- No one can beat his acting. - Right.

524
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:41,761
- Either way, it was fun. - It was.

525
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,971
Sun Hui?

526
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,261
- Let's watch it again. - The same movie?

527
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,491
Yes.

528
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:11,891
Okay, when it's rereleased.

529
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:16,060
- Are you going home now? - Yes.

530
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:19,170
My dad is nearby. He's coming to pick me up.

531
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:20,841
What about you?

532
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,999
I... Well...

533
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,111
Where are you going?

534
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:27,310
Don't ask. Let it go.

535
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:29,911
Why are you being suspicious?

536
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,209
What do you mean, suspicious?

537
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,511
You're acting really suspiciously right now.

538
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:36,850
Fine. Be careful on your way home.

539
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:38,919
Okay. Bye.

540
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,221
- Bye. See you at school. - See you.

541
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,810
- Sun Hui. - Dad!

542
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,800
(Guess what? I saw students with pretty uniforms passing by.)

543
00:57:24,801 --> 00:57:26,530
(So, I looked into cute uniforms!)

544
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:31,240
(Seokhan High School)

545
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:33,571
(Seoyoung Foreign Language High School)

546
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:48,660
(Yunil High School)

547
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:53,091
(Yunil)

548
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,060
It's Yunil High School.

549
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:58,370
(Yunil)

550
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,471
That day,

551
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,471
I found my dream.

552
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,991
(Perfect Family)

553
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,920
Try protecting her this time.

554
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,520
I can risk my life.

555
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:55,019
I set the house on fire to protect...

556
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,790
Sun Hui and your wife.

557
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,460
Let's forever...

558
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,261
keep it from Sun Hui.

559
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,600
I couldn't think of what I could do for my daughter.

560
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:09,801
