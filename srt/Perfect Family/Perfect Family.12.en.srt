Let's eat.

Sure.

15
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:21,881
How was...

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,151
the seaweed soup?

17
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:32,591
My daughter.

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,110
Sun Hui.

19
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,961
You're alive.

20
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,631
- Where are you? - I've been...

21
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,260
watching you.

22
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,070
What do you say to a new life together?

23
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:26,871
A man and his biological daughter. Just the two of us.

24
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,281
You can no longer...

25
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,350
live with those people anyway.

26
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,080
That being said,

27
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,920
can you do me a favor?

28
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,121
What...

29
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,730
can I do?

30
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,670
The pills I gave you were strong, weren't they?

31
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,110
That's...

32
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,110
my girl.

33
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,461
Keep your promise.

34
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,171
You don't have to remind me.

35
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,501
I have no more business with these two.

36
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,200
I'll never...

37
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,671
bother them again.

38
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,441
Would you like...

39
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,450
to taste what I cooked, Dad?

40
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,791
I'm good.

41
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,390
I'll have this.

42
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,340
Wait.

43
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,910
Is it too soon to have a drink...

44
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,140
before the deed is over?

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,611
For us to start a new life,

46
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,681
we'll need money.

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,431
There's a safe in his study.

48
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,301
It has money.

49
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,900
The lock combination...

50
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,400
is my birthday.

51
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,570
Your birthday?

52
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,311
Was it...

53
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,580
June 29?

54
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,720

59
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,580
It's not opening.

60

Whose birthday...

61
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,921
is June 29?

62
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,191
Oh, right.

63
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,121
I got it wrong.

64
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,861
Your date of birth is... Let's see.

65
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,001
I'm certain.

66
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,700
Can't you remember?

67
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,700
It came to me.

68
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,741

69
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,020

00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,460
- Enter... - My birthday.

- Invalid passcode. - Darn.

72
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,760
The date...

73
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,030
I was born.

74
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,241

Dad.

78
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,949
Don't you remember my birthday?

79
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,921
Of course I remember!

80
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:13,861
Your birthday is...

81
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:20,671

- Invalid passcode. - Darn!

86
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,451
Your birthday...

87
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,751
Your birthday.

88
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,260
That day,

89
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,501
the sun was blinding.

90
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,211
And it was scorching.

91
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,930

93
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,831
Sun Hui.

94
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,900
You were born...

95
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,650
Enter passcode.

96
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,050
(Choi Sun Hui, Date of Birth: August 27, 2007)

97
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,190
Got it.

98
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,881
With money,

99
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,251
I can be...

100
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,751
a good dad too.

101
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,180
This was...

102
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:47,621
the only way.

103
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:44,611
I'm sorry.

104
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,140
Mom?

105
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,611
You can't.

106
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,611
You're my precious daughter.

107
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,450
I told you...

108
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,450
I would protect you.

109
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,150
We...

110
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,420
are family.

111
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,440
What happened here?

112
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,621
(3 years later)

113
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,190
Have you been well?

114
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:22,861
As always, I'm doing well.

115
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,601
It's already been three years since you went to Canada.

116
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,271
Everyone is worried because we can't get a hold of you.

117
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,240
It's been the same for me.

118
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,910
Recently, I had a school assignment of making a house blueprint.

119
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,649
My professor told me that...

120
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,220
my floor plan was unrealistic.

121
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,560
I wanted to create a space where everyone living inside...

122
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,220
could have a good time.

123
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,460
A place that no one has seen before.

124
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,131
I guess my intention didn't seem clear.

125
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,301
It's difficult.

126
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:02,800
A place where...

127
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,111
someone is waiting for you.

128
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,781
A place where someone returns.

129
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,749
I want to build a house...

130
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,351
that makes the family life richer.

131
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:16,581
That's my goal now.

132
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,650
My dream that I told you about...

133
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,960
became clearer.

134
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,861
Speaking of houses,

135
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,561
I visited your house a few days ago.

136
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,970
After remodeling, the house became cleaner.

137
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,331
Thank you for letting me see the house.

138
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,500
I'll get going now.

139
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,499
Stay for dinner.

140
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,470
- But I... - You should if you have time.

141
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:08,801
Then, shall I?

142
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,611
Thank you.

143
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,910
Your parents are doing well,

144
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,450
but they can't hide how empty they feel.

145
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,960
Su Yeon is expected to be released from prison next month.

147
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,531
What are you thinking now?

148
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,700
I don't know if you'll read this email,

149
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,801
but I hope that you're staying healthy.

150
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,041
(I miss you.)

151
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:55,650
I miss you.

(Sergeant Lee Seong Woo's Tomb)

156
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,851
Is it snowing over there too?

157
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,950
Things have been the same here.

158
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,730
I'm still using the lighter that you gave me.

159
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:26,851
It looks like a famous scene from a movie.

160
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,220
Which movie was it?

161
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:35,900
You would have told me which movie it was...

162
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,101
right away.

163
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,500
A Japanese horror movie?

164
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,670
A family breaks down?

165
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,271
That sounds fun.

166
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,980
A girl named Mathilda says this to Leon who's a killer.

167
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,210
"I've never seen anyone snore with one eye open."

168
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:01,761
Oh, right.

169
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,621
You don't smoke.

170
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,650
We bought a lot again when there are only two of us.

171
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
You're right.

172
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,331
What's the matter?

173
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:17,200
I feel like...

174
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,871
someone is watching us.

175
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:25,970
I must be wrong.

177
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,591
I'm really sorry.

178
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:54,230
I don't even prick my finger even when I have an upset stomach.

179
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,730
I'm fine now, so I forgive you.

180
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,200
Thank you so much.

Gosh, okay.

189

See you.

I miss Sun Hui.

191
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:05,301
Although I have no right.

192
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,041
Sun Hui?

193
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,410
I can't get a hold of her anymore.

194
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,710
She moved to Canada,

195
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,611
but no one can get a hold of her now.

196
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:23,980
Everyone is worried.

197
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,621
I heard that she hasn't been to school for two months.

198
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,420
I see.

199
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
What is it?

200
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,240
At the orphanage,

201
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,351
Sun Hui said that she wanted to be a mom all of a sudden.

202
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,051
You mean, your mom?

203
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,680
Yes. Isn't that funny?

204
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,490
She was a child, but she wanted to be a mom.

205
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,890
I didn't know Sun Hui said something like that.

206
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,131
She probably said that...

207
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,200
because I have never seen my mom.

208
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,031
Sun Hui said, "I'll be your mom..."

209
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,041
"and protect you so that no one can hurt you."

210
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,041
That's what she said.

211
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:25,341
It made me so happy to hear that.

212
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,450
To me,

213
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,480
it was such a great hope.

214
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,771
No, that's not the way. Scratch it faster and harder.

215
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,470
No. You can't do it slowly.

216
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:55,841
Faster and harder.

217
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,180
I'm scared.

218
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:00,011
You shouldn't be.

219
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,791
I'm not scared at all.

220
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,561
You say that because you're brave.

221
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,890
You said you would become my mom.

222
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,760
A mom should be brave to protect her child.

223
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,761
You're right.

224
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,371
I'm your mom. You're my mom.

225
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,000
Moms should be brave.

226
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,380
Here. Eat this, Su Yeon.

227
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:32,381
Oh, my.

228
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,631
I could never imagine...

229
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,801
how the love and warmth of a family feels.

230
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,271
I thought she was the definition of a family.

231
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,611
When Sun Hui and I drifted apart,

232
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,381
I couldn't even sleep well because I was so lonely.

233
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,520
But since that day,

234
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,480
I was so lost...

235
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,551
to the point...

236
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:19,261
where I couldn't see my future.

237
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,460
Then I thought of Sun Hui.

238
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,071
I wished she could be there to help me.

239
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,341
That's why I went to her school...

240
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:36,710
to look for her.

241
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,310
I see.

242
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,850
It would have been better...

243
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,460
if I were honest with her from the start.

244
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,661
I was bad at expressing my feelings...

245
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,431
that I cornered her even when I liked her.

246
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:05,241
I made her suffer so much.

247
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,051
When Sun Hui comes back,

248
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,821
you can just tell her that.

249
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Right.

250
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,131
I wish I could do that.

251
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,210
It's quiet.

252
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:23,850
Right.

253
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,721
It's quiet.

254
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,290
Do you...

255
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,091
remember?

256
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:32,931
What?

257
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:36,229
When we first brought Sun Hui to our place...

258
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,330
after adopting her from the orphanage,

259
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,600
Sun Hui seemed nervous as she entered the house.

260
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,241
She couldn't move from the front door.

261
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Right, she couldn't.

262
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,939
That's when her stomach growled.

263
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,250
It was really loud.

264
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,580
I thought she was hungry.

265
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:00,250
So I wanted to feed her.

266
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,891
I asked her, "What do you want to eat?"

267
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,019
Right, what did she say?

268
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,960
She said she wanted to eat fish cake.

269
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,761
So I quickly made a dish...

270
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,730
with all the ingredients in the fridge.

271
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Right.

272
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,670
She said it was the best fish cake she'd ever had.

273
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,440
She ate a lot of it.

274
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:27,980
Then I told myself...

275
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,920
that I would make delicious food...

276
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,391
just for this little girl...

277
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,330
for the rest of my life.

278
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
I think...

279
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,690
I just saw Sun Hui.

280
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,611
Sun Hui?

281
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,520
Sun Hui!

282
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,190
Sun Hui!

283
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,170
Welcome home.

284
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,940
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

285
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:51,580
I'm sorry I made you worry.

286
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:55,750
I thought I should be gone...

287
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,361
so that both of you...

288
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,391
could be happy.

289
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,631
I should have...

290
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,900
disappeared then.

291
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,471
But I was too scared.

292
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,080
After that day,

293
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,911
no matter how far I went,

294
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,150
I missed you both...

295
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,321
very much.

296
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,620
So for the last time...

297
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,591
For the last time...

298
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,330
I wanted to leave...

299
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,131
after seeing all of you one last time.

300
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,571
That's what I told myself before coming here.

301
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,870
We were waiting for you.

302
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,841
Leave? What do you mean by that?

303
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:28,341
Do I deserve...

304
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,349
to live with you?

305
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,781
Of course.

306
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,620
You are my daughter.

307
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:41,850
You are my everything.

308
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:56,301
I don't know what to do.

309
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,881
I don't deserve...

310
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:10,381
to hear those things from you.

311
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:14,520
All I did was try to cover everything up...

312
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,361
when you said you stabbed Gyeong Ho.

313
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:22,091
I thought it was the right thing to do for you.

314
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,071
But actually, I did that for myself.

315
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:35,270
I couldn't let my family...

316
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,350
break down again without doing nothing like a fool.

317
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:44,451
I could not...

318
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:49,960
lose you no matter what.

319
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,761
Seized by those thoughts,

320
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:00,301
I failed to see you...

321
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:04,141
as you were despite being before me.

322
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,511
Even though you must've been watching me,

323
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,150
it never...

324
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,391
crossed my mind to watch you.

325
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,641
Because of me, you took on everything...

326
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,440
and ended up suffering.

327
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,641
Sun Hui.

328
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:51,120
I'm sorry.

329
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,690
Your dad,

330
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,631
you, and me.

331
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,730
None of us are perfect.

332
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,431
Even so,

333
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:12,701
if one cries, we'll give them a hug.

334
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:17,411
If one smiles, we'll hold their hands.

335
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:21,381
Can't we live like that?

336
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:26,181
We need you in our lives, Sun Hui.

337
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:30,020
As a family.

338
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,230
Your mom and I aren't perfect.

339
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,131
But can we still be your parents?

340
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,471
May I...

341
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,611
live...

342
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,681
as your daughter?

343
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:07,730
Of course, Sun Hui.

344
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,000
Mom.

345
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:41,830
Dad.

346
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,071
Thank you.

347
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,911
Dear Grandmother.

348
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,020
I hope you're doing well.

349
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:44,821
Please forgive me for sending you this letter...

350
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:46,431
out of the blue.

351
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:51,100
Dad once told me...

352
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,730
to write a letter...

353
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,900
if I wanted to convey my sincerity.

354
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,270
He said...

355
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,411
Mom was the one who suggested it first.

356
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:16,350
I want to take a family photo.

357
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:23,531
It would be nice if you could join us.

358
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,701
Hoping you would come,

359
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:32,940
I will be waiting.

360
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,551
From your granddaughter who believes you,

361
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:41,951
Sun Hui.

362
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,091
I abandoned my family.

363
00:49:57,201 --> 00:49:59,361
I couldn't keep the family together.

364
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
It's my fault.

365
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,301
I was desperately trying to survive alone.

366
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:12,011
Little did I know my youngest was getting bullied.

367
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:14,150
I left him to die.

368
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:17,951
My eldest...

369
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,591
blamed himself for it and was in pain.

370
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:27,631
And yet, I didn't take good care of my eldest.

371
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,400
That was the sort of mother I was.

372
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:36,900
I was...

373
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,710
also quite hard...

374
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,341
on Sun Hui.

375
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,250
But to ask me to come.

376
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,991
Will you really not regret joining them?

377
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,591
What would I do if I go there?

378
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,391
I'm not sure.

379
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,631
But you have...

380
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,201
always made...

381
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,841
a decision...

382
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,071
without consulting me until now.

383
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,040
If, by any chance,

384
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,611
you're debating whether to go or not,

385
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,350
doesn't it mean...

386
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,750
you haven't given up yet unconsciously?

387
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:37,131
My apologies for crossing the line.

388
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:03,959
Where's Sun Hui?

389
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,830
She asked us to wait a little.

390
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,761
Your necktie.

391
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:44,500
Thank you for coming.

392
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,100
I'll walk from here.

393
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,841
I'll wait here.

394
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,491
What do you think?

395
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,261
Will it look empty without it?

396
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:20,730
Let's see.

397
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:25,741
Dad.

398
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,971
Yes, Sun Hui?

399
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:20,661
- Mother. - Your daughter told me to come.

400
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,540
Let me apologize to you.

401
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:38,210
I put you in agony, didn't I?

402
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,181
I'm sorry for everything.

403
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,290
I...

404
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,261
didn't try to understand your feelings.

405
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:56,230
I'm sorry for everything.

406
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:13,681
Eun Ju.

407
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:18,321
You must've suffered the most.

408
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:21,690
I'm sorry for everything.

409
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:25,891
Mother.

410
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:51,620
I'll take the photo.

411
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:56,020
A big smile, everyone.

412
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,721
One, two, three.

413
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:55,111
Goodness, the color looks very appetizing.

414
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,120
- Honey. Take this, please. - Sure.

415
00:56:58,221 --> 00:56:59,281
Thank you.

416
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,971
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

417
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,931
(Thank you for watching Perfect Family.)

418
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,781
(Perfect Family)
