would never.

Are you sure you saw Su Yeon that night?

103
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:18,125
Why do you think it was her that pushed Sun Hui?

104
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,135
Because I saw her.

105
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:26,465
- What? - I saw Su Yeon in that alley...

106
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,005
the night Sun Hui was pushed.

107
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:30,836
- Really? - And I know what I saw.

108
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:36,845
I see.

109
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:39,615
Let's say the person you saw was Lee Su Yeon.

110
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,815
You're also saying you saw her...

111
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,485
push Sun Hui?

112
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:47,926
Well...

113
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,196
No, I didn't see her doing that.

114
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:52,865
You didn't?

115
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,865
Then why do you suspect her?

116
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,265
You see...

117
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:00,265
Well...

118
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,975
There must be a reason.

119
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:08,645
Something like Su Yeon and Sun Hui not being on the best of terms.

120
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,625
I doubt the person you saw was Su Yeon.

121
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,495
Sorry?

122
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,365

123
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,595
and we're questioning the culprit.

124

We'll soon...

125
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,836
find her body as well.

126
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:55,296
Su Yeon might be dead?

127
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:07,836
Then, who did I see?

128
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,274
- Goodness. - My gosh.

129
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,874
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

130
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,144
- Hurry. - What is this?

131
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,114
- Call an ambulance. - Isn't this blood?

132
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,145
Was he stabbed?

133
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,955
Excuse me. Coming through.

134
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,655
- Excuse me. - Do something.

135
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,055
- What's going on? - Hyeon U!

136
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,426
- There's so much blood. - Ji Hyeon U!

137
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:06,094
Who did this?

138
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,594
- Quick. - Someone call an ambulance.

139
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,796
Hyeon U, who did this to you?

140
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,436
Hyeon U!

141
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,004

144
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:36,855
Mr. Choi.

145
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:42,166
Blood was found in your car.

146
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,805
The DNA test showed...

147
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,406
that the blood was Lee Su Yeon's.

148
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,406
What's with his attitude?

149
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,216
Choi Jin Hyuk used to be a prosecutor.

150

152
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,326
Gosh.

153
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,124
Laws regarding DNA tests have changed.

154
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,265
We were asked how the DNA sample was collected.

155
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,436
It doesn't count without the subject's agreement.

156
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,435
Lee Su Yeon is missing,

157
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,035
so how can we get her permission?

158
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:24,176
It's game over once it matches the DNA from her hair at home. Darn it.

159
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,406
I know, but we can't do anything...

160
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,546
about the new law.

161
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:31,215
Why did you arrest him...

162
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:33,215
so quickly?

163
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:34,816
You punk.

164
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,225
You're the one who told me to arrest him.

165
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:43,326
The memory card in your dashcam was new.

166
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:53,906
It's clear that you did it, and we have the evidence too.

167
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:58,135
It's about time you came clean.

168
00:14:58,446 --> 00:14:59,645
About what?

169
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,515
Where's Lee Su Yeon?

170
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:11,515
- Lee Su Yeon... - My car had been stolen.

171
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:15,555
Do you mean the black van that was rented?

172
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,995
No, I'm talking about my car.

173
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:23,295
Two vehicles were stolen one after the other?

174
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,336
Do you expect me to believe that?

175
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:26,536
It's true.

176
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,475
Then why was your rented van found in the river?

177
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,076
I don't know since it was stolen.

178
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,676
On which date was your car stolen?

179
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,885
I don't remember the exact date,

180
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,186
but I think...

181
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:49,225
it was the day after the fire at Gyeong Ho's house.

182
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:52,625
It's the day Lee Su Yeon is suspected to have disappeared.

183
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,436
Is there any witness or proof?

184
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:04,436
The theft of the van rented under your name wasn't reported.

185
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:06,875
On that day,

186
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,545
the police told me that they got a call from someone...

187
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:13,446
who saw a man flee after abandoning the van.

188
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:15,985
He said that he was from Jangwoon Substation.

189
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,755
Contact Jangwoon Substation immediately.

190
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:20,985
Yes, sir.

191
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,156
After that, I got ahold of the van.

192
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,666
(Detective Lee Seong Woo)

193
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,696
(Detective Lee Seong Woo)

194
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:39,046
When I got the van, I tried to check the dashcam.

195
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,676
However, it was gone. Perhaps, the thief took it.

196
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:46,144
The van didn't seem to have any problem,

197
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,984
so I didn't report the theft.

198
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,786
You didn't report that the rented van was stolen?

199
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:54,586
Could it be...

200
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:58,395
that it wasn't a theft...

201
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,365
and that you lent it to someone?

202
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,505
And you can't tell us whom you lent it to.

203
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,745
Detective, you must feel impatient.

204
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,916
Do you have proof?

205
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,696
Do you have proof...

206
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,095
that I killed her?

207
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:38,495
(Detective Lee Seong Woo)

208
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,466
Aren't you investigating assuming that Su Yeon is dead?

209
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,436
Was there even a body?

210
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,735
And regarding the blood that you found in my car.

211
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,446
I don't know what you're thinking, but...

212
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,385
Illegally obtaining evidence...

213
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,146
by fabricating the accident.

214
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:04,685
Without clear evidence, you handcuffed me and took me in...

215
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,186
in front of my family.

216
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,335
Will you be able to cope with all this?

217
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,106
Things are getting complicated.

218
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,966
What's this?

219
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,575
What is it?

220
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:14,045
Detective Lee needs you to call him back. It's urgent.

221
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:36,706
It's all right.

222
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:38,805
It will be fine, Hyeon U.

223
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,946
- Yes, Detective. - What's going on?

224
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,846
Hyeon U got stabbed a moment ago.

225
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,045
- What? - I asked who stabbed him, and...

226
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,984
(Hanseo Police Station)

227
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,485
Hyeon U definitely told me...

228
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:53,985
that he was stabbed by...

229
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:57,055
He was stabbed by Lee Su Yeon.

230
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:12,906
Sun Hui.

231
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,446
Where are you going?

232
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:24,055
Su Yeon.

233
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:28,285
Yes.

234
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,866
Lee Su Yeon could be alive.

235
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:34,795
Did he say anything else?

236
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,936
- He said that it's dangerous. - What is?

237
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,906
I don't know.

238
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:49,545
I'll call you back.

239
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:54,346
I came to testify...

240
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,285
my husband's alibi.

241
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:09,795
Sun Hui.

242
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:14,265
Why are you running away from me?

243
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,876
I see.

244
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:27,285
This?

245
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,085
Sorry.

246
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,525
I saw Hyeon U on my way here.

247
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:36,795
What?

248
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:40,896
Don't worry. I won't stab you.

249
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:45,866
I'm not leaving so fast.

250
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:53,245
I'm going to stay here until the rain stops.

251
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:58,376
What do you mean by that?

252
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:02,416
Hyeon U...

253
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:04,186
Shall we talk inside?

254
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:09,196
I have...

255
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:11,926
so much to tell you.

256
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:20,206
Su Yeon, what do you mean by that?

257
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,905
You've already seen Hyeon U?

258
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:25,475
It's not the time to talk about Hyeon U.

259
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:27,505
Sun Hui.

260
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:37,886
I said, let's talk inside.

261
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:43,096
Why don't you...

262
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,795
ever listen to me?

263
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:52,295
This is infuriating.

264
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,616
Are you watching the nearby surveillance cameras?

265
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:08,616
What are you doing? You should keep an eye out!

266
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:12,216
Darn it.

267
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,555
How's Hyeon U?

268
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,294
I'll go and see Hyeon U at the hospital.

269
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:24,795
You check where she went and stand by on-site, got it?

270
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:28,636
Darn it.

271
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:39,245
Who am I to scold him?

272
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,005
Are you awake?

273
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,706
Do you know what this is?

274
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,585
I had a hard time preparing it.

275
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,065
It's time...

276
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:38,495
for you...

277
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,106
to experience my pain.

278
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,206
What do you think?

279
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:18,206
Isn't this enough to burn everything quickly?

280
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,156
You called for it.

281
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:34,426
Don't you know?

282
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:44,936
On the news,

283
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,136
they said that Gyeong Ho's paint thinner caused the fire.

284
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:54,545
I thought you'd need it too.

285
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:57,916
Where should I pour it?

286
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,795
You promised to turn yourself in for killing Gyeong Ho.

287
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,995
I understand why you didn't.

288
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:18,196
You must have been scared.

289
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:21,835
Let's just say...

290
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,936
that you burned Gyeong Ho's house to get rid of evidence too.

291
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,646
But...

292
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:33,485
Tell me.

293
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,616
Why did you also try to kill me?

294
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,686
Why would I...

295
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:43,055
try to kill you?

296
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:47,564
Su Yeon, I would never do that.

297
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:48,926
Don't act innocent.

298
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,366
What are you talking about?

299
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,275
What happened to you?

300
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:05,416
You are playing innocent again, you shameless wench!

301
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:21,196
(Hanseo Police Station)

302
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:33,376
Shall we go home, or...

303
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,176
Sun Hui's home, right?

304
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:36,975
Yes, she's home.

305
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:39,386
Let's go home, then.

306
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:42,346
Mr. Choi.

307
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:47,455
I'm sorry.

308
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,656
I apologize for what happened.

309
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:56,935
I don't see that detective. Where is he?

310
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:59,365
I'll make sure...

311
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:02,734
that Detective Shin visits you and apologizes.

312
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,075
Where did he go?

313
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:09,744
He's visiting the emergency room at Miseong Hospital...

314
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,646
regarding Lee Su Yeon's case.

315
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,415
We got a call...

316
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,116
that a student named Ji Hyeon U got stabbed.

317
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:18,815
Hyeon U got stabbed?

318
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,186
Yes.

319
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,125
Okay, then. We have to go now.

320
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:26,126
All right.

321
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:33,735
It's all...

322
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,335
It's all...

323
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,545
It's all because of you.

324
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:48,785
You ruined my life like this.

325
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,196
Sun Hui, how could you do this to me?

326
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:01,366
Gyeong Ho died because of you too!

327
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:04,335
Let's...

328
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,065
Let's not do this.

329
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:12,846
Why don't we stop...

330
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,706
and talk it out?

331
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:17,716
What do you say?

332
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:22,916
"Talk it out?"

333
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,325
You always lie when I ask you a question.

334
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:28,926
Come on, Su Yeon.

335
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:30,725
Calm down, Su Yeon.

336
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,936
I'll do the same.

337
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,366
Let's calm down and talk.

338
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:48,646
I want to know...

339
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,315
what happened to you...

340
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:54,886
after Gyeong Ho died.

341
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:57,886
Hey.

342
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:01,485
I killed Gyeong Ho.

343
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:10,436
What difference does it make if I talk to you now?

344
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:13,906
It just upsets me even more.

345
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,606
I don't want to hear your excuses!

346
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,106
Back then,

347
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:24,475
Gyeong Ho was still alive.

348
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:30,386
What?

349
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:35,755
My mom checked.

350
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:40,565
She went to Gyeong Ho's place that night.

351
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:44,636
She told me she clearly saw him alive.

352
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,666
Right.

353
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:51,475
So your mom did it.

354
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:55,305
When you told her that you stabbed Gyeong Ho,

355
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:59,116
she went to set fire to his house.

356
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,216
She wanted to get rid of evidence.

357
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:06,015
She did not set fire to his house.

358
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:10,055
That makes no sense.

359
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,456
I clearly checked.

360
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,325
He had stopped breathing.

361
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:15,725
So...

362
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:18,995
Are you telling me that my mom is lying?

363
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,475
Stop it with your act. It's no use.

364
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,005
I've had enough of your lies!

365
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:35,346
You told your parents to do this, right?

366
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:40,055
You tried to kill me.

367
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,226
I found this here a while ago.

368
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:16,625
You should admit it now.

369
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:22,696
You're the culprit.

370
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:27,235
You killed not only Gyeong Ho but his parents too.

371
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,205
You killed them all.

372
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,406
And you told your parents.

373
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,616
And your parents bought people off to cover this up.

374
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:43,885
You scary people.

375
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,656
- That's not true. - What's not true?

376
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:48,226
You don't even like me.

377
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:50,596
I don't like you either.

378
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,525
I've hated you all this time.

379
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:25,326
Hyun Min.

380
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:27,726
Should I come with you?

381
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:31,496
No, you can wait there.

382
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:33,306
I'll call you.

383
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,025
Sir.

384
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:08,985
(Authorized Personnel Only)

385
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:19,665
How's Hyeon U?

386
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:23,676
Well...

387
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:25,605
He's in a serious condition.

388
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:33,016
So, was Su Yeon alive?

389
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:39,016
My apologies.

390
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:41,226
Su Yeon...

391
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:44,226
is still alive.

392
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:47,794
Hyeon U said that he was stabbed...

393
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:49,096
by Su Yeon.

394
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,735
Honey.

395
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:55,906
Sun Hui's not picking up my calls.

396
00:39:57,505 --> 00:39:58,705
It's dangerous.

397
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,275
"It's dangerous."

398
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:06,846
Excuse me?

399
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:10,315
That's what Hyeon U told Detective Lee.

400
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:13,386
He said, "It's dangerous."

401
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:41,145
Can't you pick up faster? Where are you now?

402
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:43,616
Go to Sun Hui's place right now.

403
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:46,885
The number you have dialed cannot be reached...

404
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:48,025
She isn't...

405
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:50,426
picking up.

406
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:57,766
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

407
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:02,504
Don't worry.

408
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:05,306
Detective Lee is nearby. He'll get there before we do.

409
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,644
This way!

410
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:51,786
(911 Firefighting)

411
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:57,326
- Sun Hui. - No!

412
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:04,036
Sun Hui!

413
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:05,664
Hurry!

414
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:06,766
- Sun Hui! - No!

415
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:09,435
Get out of my way.

416
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,914
- Sun Hui. - Sun Hui.

417
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,584
- Get out of my way. - Sun Hui!

418
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,644
- Sun Hui! - Sun Hui!

419
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:24,556
Hold on. Sun Hui!

420
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:26,984
Detective Lee! Are you okay?

421
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,056
Open your eyes.

422
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,156
Detective Lee!

423
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:33,426
You idiot! Hang in there.

424
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:35,365
- Sun Hui! - Sun Hui!

425
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,434
- Sun Hui! - Calm down!

426
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:40,366
- Sun Hui! - Oh, no! Sun Hui!

427
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:43,434
- Sun Hui! - Sir, please get back.

428
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,704
Sun Hui!

429
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,705
- It's dangerous! - Sun Hui!

430
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:54,846
- Sun Hui! - Please step back.

431
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:46,636
What?

432
00:43:49,136 --> 00:43:50,136
Are your parents here?

433
00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:53,375
I don't know.

434
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:10,156
I'll stab you if you scream.

435
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:30,775
Sir.

436
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:37,315
What are you doing?

437
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:41,855
What's wrong, Su Yeon?

438
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:45,496
Don't come closer!

439
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:50,395
Tell me. Did you call him?

440
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:55,105
What did you pour?

441
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,136
You did something...

442
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:02,275
dangerous.

443
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:03,946
Don't move!

444
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:07,716
Move, and I'll stab her.

445
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:11,716
Fine.

446
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:18,496
What's that?

447
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:22,966
What are you doing?

448
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:37,846
Put that out now!

449
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:44,355
Why?

450
00:45:46,755 --> 00:45:48,656
Are you scared that I might drop...

451
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:50,625
this cigarette?

452
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:54,925
Even if this place catches on fire,

453
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:56,826
I won't be suspected.

454
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:02,335
If you bought and transported this much gasoline,

455
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:05,434
you would've been caught on camera.

456
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:06,636
Put that out!

457
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:08,746
Do you want to kill Sun Hui as well?

458
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:18,476
Hold on.

459
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:21,886
Su Yeon.

460
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:24,056
Darn it.

461
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:29,585
Come on.

462
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:43,065
Get up.

463
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:45,806
Come on.

464
00:48:11,996 --> 00:48:13,065
This way.

465
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:35,985
No matter how furious you are,

466
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:40,156
you shouldn't set things on fire, Su Yeon.

467
00:48:43,726 --> 00:48:45,136
What were you going to do with this?

468
00:48:48,935 --> 00:48:50,036
Get up.

469
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:52,275
Shall we return to the house?

470
00:48:57,946 --> 00:48:58,946
Get up.

471
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:14,366
You...

472
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:16,866
almost killed Sun Hui.

473
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:20,466
Sir.

474
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:25,076
Are you really a detective?

475
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:28,105
I'm sorry, Sun Hui.

476
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:30,406
This wasn't my intention.

477
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:33,415
Let's talk after wrapping this up.

478
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:36,746
You. Go back inside.

479
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:39,516
You set fire to kill...

480
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:43,326
the witness, your friend, after killing your boyfriend.

481
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,596
But that very person dies in that very fire.

482
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,125
How does such a story sound?

483
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:52,596
Su Yeon! Run away!

484
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:55,036
- Sun Hui? - Hurry! Go!

485
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:02,406
She's fine.

486
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:09,616
I told you she was fine!

487
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:13,855
Go inside.

488
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:17,295
You heard me!

489
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:20,156
I'm the police.

490
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:34,746
Drop the knife.

491
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:37,846
And raise your hands.

492
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:48,185
Which department are you in?

493
00:50:49,455 --> 00:50:50,855
I'm also from the police.

494
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:56,096
She was threatening everyone with a knife, so I simply stopped her.

495
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,366
That's a lie.

496
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:01,665
- He tried to kill... - This girl...

497
00:51:02,866 --> 00:51:04,476
is Lee Su Yeon.

498
00:51:04,976 --> 00:51:05,976
"Lee Su Yeon?"

499
00:51:10,505 --> 00:51:11,616
If you can't believe me,

500
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,584
the ID is in my pocket...

501
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:15,716
Take your hand out of the pocket!

502
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:19,455
Stay still.

503
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,355
Well... All right.

504
00:51:26,056 --> 00:51:27,795
As you can see, I've arrested the suspect.

505
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,195
Possibly stabbed by the suspect,

506
00:51:31,196 --> 00:51:32,795
the victim is unconscious.

507
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,914
- No. - You must hurry.

508
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,116
The fire in the house is spreading.

509
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:49,516
I already called the fire department.

510
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,914
No. He's lying!

511
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:54,056
Come over here...

512
00:51:54,826 --> 00:51:56,426
and help me move the victim.

513
00:51:57,596 --> 00:51:58,596
No.

514
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:05,596
No.

515
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:24,016
All right.

516
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:23,476
You persistent jerk.

517
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,016
Don't move.

518
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:34,016
Unless you want your head blown away, darn it.

519
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,556
I'll return your precious knife.

520
00:53:40,966 --> 00:53:41,966
Here.

521
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:46,295
Hurry!

522
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:34,286
Lee Su Yeon.

523
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:37,286
You stabbed the policeman, okay?

524
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:39,886
And the wounded policeman...

525
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:42,156
shot you.

526
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:56,935
(Epilogue)

527
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:22,825
- I'm back. - Hey.

528
00:55:22,826 --> 00:55:24,934
Welcome back. I'll get the food ready in no time.

529
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:25,996
Okay.

530
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:31,275
(Hoehyun Dry Cleaner)

531
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:34,275
(Dry Cleaning)

532
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:46,255
My dad and mom work diligently.

533
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:49,355
I admire my sincere parents.

534
00:55:57,766 --> 00:56:01,136
- Here it is. - The stew is here.

535
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:03,735
All right.

536
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,275
Wait. Let me scoop some up for you.

537
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:07,975
Here. I'll do it.

538
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:10,644
It's okay. It's tastier when I do it.

539
00:56:10,645 --> 00:56:11,676
Gosh.

540
00:56:12,476 --> 00:56:13,775
Here you go.

541
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:17,045
It's hot. Dig in.

542
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:22,485
All right. Some tofu for you too.

543
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:25,826
Here.

544
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:27,696
Hurry up and dig in.

545
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:30,496
It's hot. Be careful. Were you hungry?

546
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,335
- Here. - Okay.

547
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:35,565
Gosh.

548
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:38,935
- It's good. - Here.

549
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:41,445
- My son. - Give me lots of meat.

550
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,275
Sure thing. A scoopful.

551
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:46,315
A scoopful of your favorite meat.

552
00:56:47,315 --> 00:56:49,385
- Here. - Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

553
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:50,516
Eat up.

554
00:56:51,355 --> 00:56:52,415
Goodness.

555
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,886
Your sister is taking yours. Dig in.

556
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:56,684
Eat up.

557
00:56:56,685 --> 00:56:57,755
You've got to grow.

558
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,124
You should eat too, Mom.

559
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,125
I will when your dad comes.

560
00:57:02,426 --> 00:57:04,665
Goodness, don't get it on your clothes.

561
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,734
Even if we run a dry cleaner,

562
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:08,165
stop spilling food.

563
00:57:09,605 --> 00:57:11,505
- Enjoy. - Okay.

564
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:18,215
Dig in. Stop eating so little at a time.

565
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:19,946
You have to eat lots to grow taller.

566
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:45,705
I will make my dream come true...

567
00:57:47,105 --> 00:57:50,176
so my family can keep smiling like they do right now.

568
00:58:07,056 --> 00:58:11,596
(Perfect Family)

569
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:33,915
You were behind it, right?

570
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:35,826
Where's Sun Hui?

571
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,295
I have to come clean first...

572
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:42,966
about who I am.

573
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:44,696
(Rest in peace.)

574
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:48,735
The parents who raised you...

575
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,935
lived with masks on.

576
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,946
What?

577
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:58,246
Are you fine with Sun Hui figuring everything out?

578
00:58:59,775 --> 00:59:03,645
What backstory does your family have?
