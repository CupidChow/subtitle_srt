190
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:10,533
Sir!

191
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:17,942
Honey!

192
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:20,872
Why didn't you answer my call?

193
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,083
- Sang Ho... - We found where he got abducted.

194
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:25,682
- "Abducted?" - Hurry and get in.

195
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:28,252
Let's go.

196
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:31,293
- Honey. - Get in now.

197
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,482
Dad?

198
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:58,513
Sun Hui.

199
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,323
Are you awake?

200
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,833
It's all right. Your dad will be back soon.

201
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:35,883
What?

202
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,293
Is there a fire?

203
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,422
Sun Hui.

204
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,392
Let's get out for now.

205
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:48,662
- Okay. - We'll get out and...

206
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:52,502
What?

207
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,113
Sun Hui.

208
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,912
Wait here for a minute.

209
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:43,982
Do not worry.

210
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:48,492
Everything will be fine.

211
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,161
It's 234-6 Gongseo-dong.

212
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,961
There's a fire in a mega office.

213
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,773
Please send help.

214
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,141
It's 234-6 Gongseo-dong.

215
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:03,671
There's a fire in a mega office.

216
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,411
- Mr. Choi, we're going... - Please send help.

217
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,043
to the same place where the fire is.

218
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:23,892
(Dasam Paint Store)

219
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,873
(Paint)

220
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:50,783
Hey.

221
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,922
Sang Ho, I'm scared.

222
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:56,962
It's okay.

223
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,692
People will come and save us.

224
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:01,732
Sang Ho.

225
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:07,972
Sun Hui.

226
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:10,902
Wait here for a second.

227
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:12,672
Turn around.

228
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:21,383
Sang Ho.

229
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,533
Sun Hui.

230
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,432
Come here.

231
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:44,702
Go, Sun Hui.

232
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:48,482
Carefully and slowly.

233
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:49,883
It's all right.

234
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,283
Go slowly.

235
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:54,412
Slowly.

236
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:57,353
There you go.

237
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,323
Sun Hui, people will come soon.

238
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,952
Gosh, please.

239
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,863
(Paint thinner)

240
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:30,982
Please help me.

241
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,712
Please!

242
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,842
- Excuse me. - Sang Ho.

243
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,241
Have you seen our child?

244
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:01,312
- Sang Ho. - Our child is still inside.

245
00:24:01,313 --> 00:24:02,711
- You can't go in. - Sang Ho.

246
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:03,812
- Sang Ho! - It's dangerous.

247
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,981
- Please stay out. - Sang Ho!

248
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,582
- Sang Ho! - Please stay out.

249
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,622
Sang Ho!

250
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,182
- Please stay out of here. - Hurry up.

251
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,651
No, you cannot go in.

252
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:12,951
Sang Ho!

253
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,651
- Please calm down. - Sang Ho!

254
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,391
- Mom is here! - Look for him!

255
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:17,891
- It's dangerous! - Sang Ho!

256
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,593
- Please stay calm! - Sang Ho!

257
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,133
Sang Ho!

258
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,333
- Is he all right? - What?

259
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:31,843
Are you all right?

260
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:35,513
Hurry inside.

261
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:38,812
(Paint)

262
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,212
We found a body.

263
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,962
- Identify the body! - Hurry.

264
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:13,073
What about Sang Ho?

265
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,412
What about Sang Ho?

266
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:20,613
Please find Sang Ho!

267
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,672
Please save Sang Ho.

268
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:06,751
The court revealed that they upheld the ruling...

269
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:07,823
and sentenced him to ten years.

270
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:11,421
Last April, Mr. A was convicted of attempted murder for stabbing...

271
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:14,232
his partner at a private casino with a lethal weapon.

272
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,363
His partner's injury kept him hospitalized for four weeks.

273
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:21,032
Investigation found Mr. A in monetary conflict with his partner.

274
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,842
Mr. A committed the crime when he witnessed his partner...

275
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:26,142
fleeing with their business funds.

276
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:30,382
In a rear-end accident on Cheonsu Jangseo Expressway,

277
00:28:30,383 --> 00:28:33,882
two men in their fifties in the front seat of an SUV...

278
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,283
were killed.

279
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:38,623
Six, including the driver, in the other vehicle got injured.

280
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:41,391
- The police said that... - Hello, sir.

281
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:44,391
the car in the back failed to slow down on the downhill road.

282
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:46,692
It resulted in serious damage.

283
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,701
Next story.

284
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:49,961
- Honey. - Do you remember the fire...

285
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,373
- in Gongseo-dong a few months ago? - I'm here.

286
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,401
Inside a mega office with raw materials for paint,

287
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,772
there was a fire due to short circuit.

288
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:00,712
A middle school student named Choi was killed.

289
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,382
Recently, the court overturned the sentence.

290
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:07,651
There's been a controversy as the culprit received a sentence...

291
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,482
longer than the 1st and the 2nd trial.

292
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:12,552
Some argue that as the victim's father is a prosecutor,

293
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,691
strings had been pulled,

294
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,762
and the judgment is biased.

295
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,461
The suspicion has risen about the story.

296
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:20,363
Reporter Wang Il Bo is covering the story.

297
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,102
Facing a charge of fraud and impersonating a prosecutor,

298
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,602
the culprit had already been arrested by the police.

299
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:28,603
He consistently claimed that there was no human trafficking.

300
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:32,372
He also claimed that he did not blackmail anyone for money.

301
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:35,613
Despite appealing against his charges...

302
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:38,711
on kidnapping, confinement, and murder,

303
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,612
the suspect claimed that none of the appeal was accepted,

304
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,083
although his daughter was at the same place as where the victim was.

305
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:45,421
In addition, he claimed that the victim's father...

306
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:49,891
signed up for a large amount of life insurance on his son.

307
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:51,822
The suspect believes that there could be...

308
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,891
a real culprit behind the case and that the victim's parents...

309
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:56,533
could have incited their son's death.

310
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,672
So what happened?

311
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,712
What happened to that child?

312
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:39,171
Gosh.

313
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,873
Let me push it for you.

314
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:43,883
- Oh, nice. - Goodness.

315
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:46,452
- Hey! - Let me push.

316
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,823
- Look at this. - I'll have a go this time.

317
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,922
This is so much better than the other ride.

318
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,093
You mean the culprit's daughter?

319
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:03,863
She's here.

320
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:13,741
Her dad got arrested.

321
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:16,113
Her grandmother raised her. But she passed away.

322
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,952
She has no other relatives.

323
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,162
Honey, let's go.

324
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,333
Let's never come back.

325
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:38,093
(House of Children)

326
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:42,092
- Yes, quail eggs! - You like quail eggs?

327
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,201
- I want more of them. - Please give me some more.

328
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,772
- Enjoy your meal. - I'll give you two more pieces.

329
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,731
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

330
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,542
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

331
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:50,971
- Nice, seaweed soup. - Thank you.

332
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:52,741
- Do you like quail eggs? - Yes.

333
00:32:52,742 --> 00:32:55,372
- Do you like seaweed soup? - I love seaweed soup.

334
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,182
- The side dishes look good, yes? - Thank you.

335
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,612
- Eat this. - You're the youngest.

336
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:00,981
- You like this? - Yes.

337
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,053
- This is delicious. - Enjoy.

338
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,151
You like seaweed soup.

339
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,552
- Give me. - That's my favourite side dish.

340
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:08,553
- Are you only smart on the outside? - You didn't do it wrong, right?

341
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,133
- Let me try. - You know how to do it?

342
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,633
You come here every day.

343
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:21,972
Is your child here too?

344
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:25,102
Don't worry.

345
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,742
I won't tell anyone.

346
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:31,813
Some parents come here and watch their kids in secret.

347
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:37,283
Some kids who have parents still live here.

348
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:40,391
They cry the whole week...

349
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:42,492
when they see their parents.

350
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:45,123
So even if some parents come,

351
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,333
I don't tell the kids.

352
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:48,833
It's troublesome.

353
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:51,932
That girl...

354
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,432
Why is she always alone?

355
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:01,412
Which girl?

356
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:08,212
Oh, you mean Sun Hui?

357
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:10,683
She's always alone.

358
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:13,622
She doesn't answer me even when I talk to her.

359
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,893
- Can you be her friend? - Sorry?

360
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:19,593
Why should I?

361
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,732
Just because.

362
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:27,533
She looks sad.

363
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:36,183
Hurry up.

364
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:46,292
No. You can't scratch it slowly.

365
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,493
Quickly and firmly.

366
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:50,292
Goodness.

367
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:52,223
Well done!

368
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,113
Thank you.

369
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,311
Let me go over the documents.

370
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:11,312
Okay.

371
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:17,852
Do you think...

372
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,152
she can recognize us?

373
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,362
Kids don't recognize people well...

374
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:26,462
after a year or two.

375
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,062
She must have been in shock after that incident.

376
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,973
She must have forgotten us.

377
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:35,772
But honey...

378
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:44,982
This decision...

379
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:48,183
Nobody in this world would get it.

380
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:51,752
If Mother finds out about this,

381
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,852
she would never forgive us.

382
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,763
It's fine as long as you understand why I'm doing this.

383
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,363
I'm sorry.

384
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:05,933
You changed your name and job to forget the whole incident.

385
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,643
I know this isn't easy for you too.

386
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:14,442
Raising the child of our nemesis.

387
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:15,913
No.

388
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,553
She isn't the child of our nemesis.

389
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,152
She's the life that Sang Ho saved.

390
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:31,893
We can't be...

391
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:35,562
a perfect family from the start.

392
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:46,113
Every time I see her,

393
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:51,112
I might be reminded of Sang Ho, which could torment me.

394
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,183
But...

395
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:54,812
she's the child...

396
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:00,723
that Sang Ho saved before he died.

397
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,033
Sun Hui.

398
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:10,133
Come here.

399
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,922
I will never...

400
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,933
I will never make you unhappy.

401
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:50,763
Are you okay?

402
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:57,803
Sun Hui!

403
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,283
- Sun Hui. - Mom.

404
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:19,692
Oh, gosh...

405
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:28,473
Mom...

406
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:35,573
- Mom... - My baby...

407
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,182
We found a girl on the ground floor.

408
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,453
She's seriously injured.

409
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,192
Su Yeon.

410
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:51,122
No!

411
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,493
No. No, you can't.

412
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:03,772
Mom...

413
00:40:12,183 --> 00:40:13,212
Are you okay?

414
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:15,053
Are you okay?

415
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,893
We need emergency assistance on the ground floor immediately.

416
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,203
Hyun Min.

417
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,002
Choi Hyun Min!

418
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:55,192
Choi Hyun Min!

419
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,573
Hyeon U.

420
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,272
Hey, Sun Hui.

421
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:11,703
Gosh.

422
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:13,672
It's been a while.

423
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,283
Right, it's been a while.

424
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:18,441
How's your wound?

425
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,282
It's perfectly fine now.

426
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:21,413
I'm all okay.

427
00:41:23,053 --> 00:41:24,053
That's nice.

428
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:26,421
What happened to your parents?

429
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:27,751
They get investigated by the prosecution every day...

430
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:28,823
for that incident.

431
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,163
But people around my dad are helping.

432
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:35,093
They will be fine.

433
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,533
Are you done settling down in your apartment?

434
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,272
Tell me if you need any help. I'll be there.

435
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:45,473
Gosh. It's okay. I'm all packed.

436
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,372
Good job.

437
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:51,212
Sun Hui. Don't you think they'll like this?

438
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,212
No?

439
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:56,522
Goodness. Then what do they like?

440
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,222
- Maybe octopus? - "Octopus."

441
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:03,162
There aren't many dishes...

442
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:04,763
to make with octopus.

443
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:08,363
There isn't much to make with octopus.

444
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:11,363
No, there isn't.

445
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:17,401
Webfoot octopus is similar to octopus.

446
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,842
How about stir-fried webfoot octopus?

447
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:21,843
- What do you say? - "Stir-fried webfoot octopus."

448
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,441
But my parents can't handle spicy food.

449
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,442
Is that so?

450
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:29,851
Oh, how about this? Won't they be able to eat it raw?

451
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:30,982
What do you think?

452
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,751
It's not like they hate octopus or webfoot octopus.

453
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,622
(Fresh fruit)

454
00:42:40,033 --> 00:42:41,332
Wait for me, Sun Hui.

455
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,062
Hey... Sun Hui!

456
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,672
- Sun Hui. - What?

457
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:48,933
Do you sleep well?

458
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,513
All you do is worry.

459
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:57,183
Getting good sleep is important.

460
00:42:58,183 --> 00:42:59,852
What about you? Do you sleep well?

461
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,022
Yes, I do.

462
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:05,422
And I dream every day.

463
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,852
About what?

464
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,522
It's a secret from you.

465
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:14,062
- How come? - No reason.

466
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,363
I'll tell you one day.

467
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:20,973
"One day?"

468
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:25,502
We'll end up old.

469
00:43:25,643 --> 00:43:28,743
There are tons of things I want to do before I grow older.

470
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:31,683
Like what?

471
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,413
Let's see. I...

472
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,252
There are numerous places I want to visit.

473
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,952
Le Passage de la Boule Blanche in Paris,

474
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:42,722
Heydar Aliyev Center in Azerbaijan,

475
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,722
the Dancing House in the Czech Republic,

476
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:48,093
the Aragon Pavilion in Spain,

477
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,662
the Dubai Frame in Dubai,

478
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:53,672
and the Prada Building in Aoyama, Japan.

479
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:56,902
The place on the top of my list...

480
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,102
is the Sagrada Familia in Spain.

481
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,312
What are those?

482
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:05,113
Famous architectures around the world.

483
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,953
Actually, my dream is to become an architect.

484
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:11,323
Really?

485
00:44:13,122 --> 00:44:15,723
This is the first time I'm hearing this from you.

486
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,323
I haven't told anyone until now.

487
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:23,703
I see.

488
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,933
An architect is cool.

489
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,073
But I might not become one.

490
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:30,843
Do your best.

491
00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:33,843
Yes, I will.

492
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,812
I'll design your house in the future.

493
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:43,121
It would be best if we could live together...

494
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:45,553
in that house.

495
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,573
Sun Hui?

496
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:06,272
- Hyeon U. - Yes?

497
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:10,442
Thanks for everything.

498
00:45:10,613 --> 00:45:12,343
What's this all of a sudden?

499
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:17,723
I'm serious.

500
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:20,652
You helped me out all the time.

501
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,422
I always felt grateful.

502
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,732
Come on, Sun Hui. What's going on?

503
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:32,002
Stop talking as if we won't see each other ever again.

504
00:45:36,772 --> 00:45:39,303
- Sun Hui, I... - My parents must be waiting.

505
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,413
I'm leaving first.

506
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:42,913
Get back home safely.

507
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:49,383
Hey, Sun Hui!

508
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:11,042
Sun Hui.

509
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:16,582
Mom. Dad.

510
00:50:24,562 --> 00:50:25,723
We're home.

511
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:28,533
I'm back.

512
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:38,842
(Happy Birthday, Sang Ho.)

513
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:40,073
What's this?

514
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:45,383
Today is Sang Ho's birthday.

515
00:50:48,352 --> 00:50:49,383
Sun Hui.

516
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:52,883
I wanted to cook him a birthday feast.

517
00:50:53,993 --> 00:50:55,192
Sang Ho...

518
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:59,962
I heard he passed away trying to save me.

519
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:03,863
I'm sorry.

520
00:51:05,203 --> 00:51:06,832
Why are you apologizing?

521
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:07,933
The man...

522
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,272
No.

523
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:15,872
My biological father told me everything.

524
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,883
No wonder...

525
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,922
there were times when...

526
00:51:27,422 --> 00:51:31,522
how you looked at me felt a bit...

527
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,332
hollow and sad.

528
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:40,073
Now I understand.

529
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:43,743
I understand why you looked lonely...

530
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:49,442
even though you were smiling.

531
00:51:49,712 --> 00:51:52,343
- I don't know what you've heard... - I know.

532
00:51:53,312 --> 00:51:55,712
Some parts must have been lies.

533
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:57,223
But...

534
00:52:00,022 --> 00:52:01,093
I get...

535
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:03,993
everything now.

536
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:06,192
We kept that incident from you...

537
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:09,093
to protect you.

538
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:12,502
If it was possible,

539
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,272
we wanted to keep it from you forever.

540
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:26,283
Sang Ho...

541
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:29,352
brought us together.

542
00:52:31,553 --> 00:52:33,352
He must be thrilled.

543
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:44,133
Our daughter cooked for us. Let's eat before it turns cold.

544
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:47,533
All right. Great work, Sun Hui.

545
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:58,512
Take a seat.

546
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:00,712
I also made seaweed soup. I'll bring it over.

547
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:45,183
All right.

548
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:48,852
Let's dig in.

549
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:55,292
All right.

550
00:54:56,633 --> 00:54:57,663
Let's dig in.

551
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,352
It's good.

552
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:24,093
Yes. It sure is good.

553
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:33,772
Thank you.

554
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:38,772
Mom.

555
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:43,413
Dad.

556
00:56:25,323 --> 00:56:28,823
Thanks for everything.

557
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,763
What's this all of a sudden?

558
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:31,993
I'm serious.

559
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:36,263
You helped me out all the time.

560
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:39,962
I always felt grateful.

561
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:57,183
Hi, Detective Shin. It's me, Hyeon U.

562
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:00,393
I can't shake off this bad feeling.

563
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:02,252
Something might happen to Sun Hui.

564
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,292
Did you cook...

565
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:41,562
the seaweed soup well?

566
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,033
My daughter.

567
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,343
Isn't the drug I gave you effective?

568
00:58:02,953 --> 00:58:05,652
As expected from my daughter.

569
00:58:20,433 --> 00:58:24,872
(Perfect Family)

570
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:48,062
For us to start anew...

571
00:58:49,763 --> 00:58:50,763
Dad?

572
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:55,033
What should I do?

573
00:58:56,602 --> 00:58:58,973
Press the password.

574
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,212
The password is my birthday.

575
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:05,913
Dad. Do you not remember my birthday?

576
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,252
Keep your promise.
