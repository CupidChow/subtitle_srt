Hi.

68
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:12,776
No way.

69
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,544
I had no idea I'd meet you here.

70
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,675
Tell me about it. What brings you by?

71
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,946
Oh, that. My allergies.

72
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,956
I come by sometimes to manage my severe peanut allergy.

73
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,115
I see.

74
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,055
Just eating a little bit of it could kill me.

75
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:31,196

76
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:36,095

84
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,016
Right, I guess.

85
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,516
I've been selling insurance,

86
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,855
but there's a limit to asking your acquaintances for favors.

87
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,256
I'm barely selling one a month as is.

88
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,456

89
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:09,495
Gosh. Sorry about that.

90
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,895
I shouldn't have piled my worries on you.

91
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,865
Not at all. It's all right.

93
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,376
I have a favor to ask.

94
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:23,776
Yes?

95
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:26,276
I'll shortly be called for my examination.

96
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,656
Could you perhaps watch my daughter for me?

97
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,516
Right.

98
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:36,285
But I'll be called in for additional tests too.

99
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,355
It won't take long.

100
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,664
I brought her with me since my mother was at work.

101
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:43,725
- Ten. - Ten.

102
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:46,795
Then which did he have the most?

103
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,135
- Apples. - Nice.

104
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:50,735

- Seven. - Seven.

108
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,215
Let's count the melons too.

109
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,016
Sure. Let's do that.

110
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:05,886

120

I couldn't leave Sun Hui like this.

121

Did Prosecutor Choi go in for his test?

122

Yes.

123
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,836
Don't worry about her and get yourself tested.

124
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,766
I'll keep her company.

125
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:30,975

Sun Hui, let's have a snack.

130
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,555
Do you want a snack? How about this?

131
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:49,156
Or maybe... There's more. Would you like this instead?

132
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,465
- This one. - This one?

133
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:59,596
- This instead of this? - Yes.

134
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,106
To get closer to someone,

135
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,675
it's way more effective to begin the relationship...

136
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,886
with pity...

137
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,626
rather than gratitude.

138
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,526

139
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,425

140

They said it wasn't life-threatening,

146
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:10,636
so she'll be fine.

147
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:18,815
I'm the moron.

148
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,284
I should've known...

149
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,016
that there's a good chance allergies could run in the family.

150
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,055
But more importantly,

151
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,825
your son seems to be rattled.

152
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,636
It must be because he saw Sun Hui pass out.

153
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,236
He'll soon brush it off.

154
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:45,976

Yes.

156
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,285
But she doesn't have health insurance,

157
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,915
and that will jack up her medical bill.

158
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:00,886
It's worrying me already.

159
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,356
Even though I'm her father,

160
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,596
my first concern was her medical bill.

00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,535

173

00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,295
Sorry about that.

188
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,236
I'm startled every time I say your name.

189
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,335
You worked hard during your therapy session.

190
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,276
Treatment for depression should be consistent,

191
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,006
so come and see me often.

192
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,746
Thank you very much...

193
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,315
for your help.

194
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:44,016
Eun Ju.

195
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,866
Wait.

196
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:00,496
Here you go.

197
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:05,906
It's beautiful.

198
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,545
- Thank you. - Sure.

199
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,346
I haven't gotten such a present in a while.

200
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:15,085
Doesn't your husband bring you flowers?

201
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,585
He's terrible when it comes to giving presents.

202
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:28,965
Oh,

203
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:31,465
how is your child?

204
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,295
Her name is Sun Hui, right?

205
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:35,906
Thanks to you, she's gotten much better.

206
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,875
Since she's a child, and you're her guardian,

207
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,906
you should be careful of what she eats.

208
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:45,246
The doctor told me to be careful too.

209
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,886
She could die if something goes wrong.

210
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,784
How about a meal with the children?

211
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:58,195
How about dinner tonight if it's okay with you?

212
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,455
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,596
- I have something to do tonight. - I see.

214
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:06,866
Then come to our house for a meal next time.

215
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,106
Yes, have a good day.

216
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,236
Eun Ju.

217
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:22,246
Doctor Ha.

218
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,246
Yes?

219
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:30,155
Aren't you being too close to him?

220
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:33,026
Right. I'm a little scared of him.

221
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,464
His criminal record...

222
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,835
We shouldn't have prejudice against our patients.

223
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:41,465
He works very hard to support his sick mother and his child.

224
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,305
We should feel bad for him.

225
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,175
(Choi Hyun Min)

226
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,486
I'm counting on you, Prosecutor Choi.

227
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:02,185
I'm a good person, so don't be scared.

228
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,554
I'm really counting on you.

229
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:08,366
Of course. You can count on me.

230
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:12,465
I'm very close to the head of your borough.

231
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,136
Please have your drink.

232
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:34,626
Come in.

233
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,325
Thank you for inviting us.

234
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,295
This is for you.

235
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,424
It's so beautiful.

236
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,465
Thank you. Come in.

237
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,606
- Sun Hui. - Sang Ho.

238
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,276
- Please come in, Hyun Min. - Thank you.

239
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,945
- Put these on. - Thank you.

240
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:38,955
Do you like the food?

241
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:41,656
It's delicious.

242
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:45,425
I'm so jealous of you.

243
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:48,925
Mom.

244
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,396
You cooked much more than usual.

245
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:52,896
Sang Ho.

246
00:17:58,906 --> 00:17:59,906
What's the matter?

247
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:05,775
I understand that the food is good, but you don't have to cry.

248
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,215
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,086
Sun Hui doesn't know...

250
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,326
what mom's cooking is.

251
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:23,765
After giving birth,

252
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:27,896
my wife continued...

253
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:30,566
to be very sick.

254
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,705
She was bedridden.

255
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:36,876
She couldn't make a proper meal...

256
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,546
for our daughter.

257
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:45,156
I resented her for it.

258
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:48,886
Then she died.

259
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,255
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,096
Sun Hui.

261
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:59,664
You can come here whenever you want.

262
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:00,995
Think of this as your home.

263
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:04,906
Thank you.

264
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,576
Don't mention it. Let's enjoy the meal.

00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:53,815
Thank you very much.

273
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,255
Don't do this. Please get up.

274
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,126
Let's have a drink.

275
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:00,695
Seriously.

276
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:03,396
I consider you my big brother now.

277
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:05,796
Sure.

278
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,566
Gosh.

279
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:10,265
I heard you.

280
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:12,975
Goodness.

281
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,275
He's very affectionate.

282
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:19,046
All right. That's enough.

283
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:28,185
- Hyun Min. - Yes?

284
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:32,695
Aren't you being too close to that man with the same name?

285
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,826
You met him as a suspect.

286
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,235
One's past isn't important.

287
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,995
I'm just trying to help a man who pulled himself together.

288
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,566
I just feel uncomfortable about it.

289
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,376
Many people approach prosecutors with ulterior motives.

290
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,145
He keeps mentioning his mother and being a single parent.

291
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:55,444
I think he's trying to use your soft spot.

292
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:58,655
You're young but so stuck-up. You should trust people more.

293
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,626
It's just too much.

294
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,684
He makes people around him sign up for insurance.

295
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,495
He gets therapy sessions from your wife.

296
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:09,795
Why did you sign up for Sang Ho's life insurance? It's ominous.

297
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,095
It doesn't mean anything.

298
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,665
I signed up for insurance because I could. It's nothing.

299
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,735
You're nagging.

300
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:17,636
You deserve to be more successful.

301
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:20,235
I feel like...

302
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,975
your life drags you down because you're too affectionate.

303
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:29,316
You aren't a good fit for being a prosecutor.

304
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,656
How about becoming a civil rights lawyer...

305
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:34,215
or a legal advisor for a corporation?

306
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,285
Are you looking down on your senior?

307
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,796
I'm just saying that it could be attractive.

308
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,455
Attractive like a pushover.

309
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,536
"Attractive like a pushover?"

310
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:47,935
Yes, I'm a pushover.

312
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,316
The fake prosecutor?

313
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,286
You duped me, didn't you?

314
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:11,995
Where's the rest of the money?

315
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:15,296
You won't tell me?

316
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,126
Start.

317
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,805
Darn it.

318
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,816
Why are there so many insurance documents?

319
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:33,675
What?

320
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:36,215

You're a real punk, aren't you?

326
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:20,096
He put both his mom and daughter's name.

327
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,596
He got a foreign insurance plan for his daughter.

328
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,235
Do you always pull bad tricks?

329
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,536
Answer me.

330
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:34,435
Hey, that's enough.

331
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:37,906
It's not my business anyway.

332
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:40,576
It looks like...

333
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:43,786
he spent all our money...

334
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,985
on horse race betting.

335
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,885
I still don't think...

336
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,455
he should die here today.

337
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:57,566
He prepared how to get all his money back.

338
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:10,504
- Let's go. - Please let me go.

339
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,474
Please let me go.

340
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:16,785
If you want to live, bring me my money, you punk.

341
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:18,755
Please!

342
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,785
Sir, how many rounds will you play today?

343
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,826
- Fifteen rounds should be enough. - Gosh.

344
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:27,555
His head will be smashed today.

345
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:29,464
No!

346
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:32,335
Hey, keep his head steady.

347
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,036
Gosh.

348
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:41,806
No!

349
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:46,945

350
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,046
Come on!

351
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:51,755

356
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,316
Why are you crying?

357
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:32,296
Dad, Grandma is sick.

359
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:49,675
I heard that you're sick.

360
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:56,386
What are you up to these days?

361
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,885
What's wrong with your face?

362
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,414
Don't worry about me.

363
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:02,985
If you're sick, go to the hospital instead of staying at home.

364
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:05,626
Sun Hui, shall we go out?

365
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,156
What about Grandma?

366
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,265
She'll be fine, so don't worry.

367
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,626
Where are you taking Sun Hui to?

368
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:14,994
What on earth are you up to?

369
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:18,535
You admitted a perfectly normal child to a hospital last time.

370
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,934
It's none of your business.

371
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:22,346
None of my business? Of course, it's my business.

372
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,475
You are acting like a good mother.

373
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:28,415
You pretended like nothing happened when Dad beat me so much.

374
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:30,915
What's that thing...

375
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:34,685
you told me to sign last time?

376
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:38,185
Did you sign up for Sun Hui's life insurance as well?

377
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:43,066
Why would you need life insurance? She's only a young child.

378
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:48,765
The news says that the law has been changed...

379
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:51,265
because there are many child-related crimes.

380
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,974
- I said it's fine. - No, it's not!

381
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,775
I signed up for it before the law changed.

382
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:00,775
So it's fine.

383
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,146
What?

384
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:10,156
Sun Hui, shall we go?

385
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:11,626
Where do you want to go?

386
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,896
- Do you want to go see the sea? - Sure.

387
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:22,005
I'll take Sun Hui with me. So don't wait for her.

388
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:26,505
Don't do anything stupid like calling the police.

389
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:29,205
You don't want to make your son a criminal.

390
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:33,275
Sun Hui!

391
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,896
Dad, look! It's the sea.

392
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:14,915
Dad.

393
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,755
- What? - I'm so happy.

394
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,126
You got me ice cream too.

395
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:32,975
Dad, aren't we getting on the boat?

396
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:44,346
Sun Hui.

397
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:46,856
Let's go.

398
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,255
To get on the boat?

399
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,586
No, we are going home.

400
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:53,955
Let's stop it now.

401
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:55,665
Let's stop.

402
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,536
Where do you think you are going?

403
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:14,415
I thought you got all the way here to keep your promise.

404
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:17,115
It would have been much better if you signed up...

405
00:29:17,116 --> 00:29:18,386
for your own life insurance.

406
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,386
You are going through all this because you signed up for hers.

407
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:25,185
Where is your mother? How come you only brought the kid?

408
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:28,826
Well, that is...

409
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,866
Oh, figures.

410
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,264
A kid would be better...

411
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,705
to disguise it as an accident since she doesn't know anything.

412
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,435
Don't we need a witness?

413
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:42,445
Insurance companies don't easily give you the money these days.

414
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,745
You will get caught if you don't prepare it well.

415
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,556
Hyun Min.

416
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:55,955
- Sun Hui! - Hyun Min!

417
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:08,395
I took a day off at work to have fun with you today.

418
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:10,005
Thank you, sir.

419
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:12,935
What happened to your face?

420
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:17,475
Hyun Min.

421
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:19,316
I mean...

422
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,215
Prosecutor Choi.

423
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:23,215
How have you been?

424
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:30,326
Prosecutor? Is he scamming again?

425
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:33,255
No, he is a prosecutor.

426
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,626
When I did the background check, I found out...

427
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:38,865
that there was a prosecutor with the same name...

428
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:39,896
in Central District Prosecutors' Office.

429
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:41,636
And that's him.

430
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,136
So he pretended to be that prosecutor?

431
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,175
So they actually know each other.

432
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:51,175
What should we do?

433
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,775
Getting a real prosecutor involved is quite risky.

434
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:57,415
No.

435
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,985
- I think he's playing smart. - What?

436
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,786
Who can be a better witness than that man?

437
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,056
An actual prosecutor can prove that it's an accident.

438
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,725
- Isn't it beautiful? - Yes, it is.

439
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:51,234
Seagulls!

440
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:53,705
- Hi, seagulls. - Hi.

441
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,175
At this rate,

442
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:01,876
I'll be killed instead.

443
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,596
- We're almost there. It's there. - Okay.

444
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:21,596
- Honey, get ready to get down. - Okay.

445
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:23,205
Sang Ho.

446
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,336
Make a fishing rod as soon as you get down. The water's perfect.

447
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:27,435
All right.

448
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:32,005
He's such a child.

449
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:39,485
Sun Hui, let's get ready to get down.

450
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:41,215
Fishing sounds fun, right?

451
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,326
I'm so excited.

452
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,925
Let's catch some fish and grill them.

453
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,355
Honey. Aren't you hungry?

454
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:18,326
- I brought many delicious things. - All right.

455
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,735
Okay, then. What about you, Sang Ho?

456
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:28,195
I'm good.

457
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,435
All right, then.

458
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:34,036
Whoever fails to catch fish today won't get to eat.

459
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:36,046
Sun Hui.

460
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:38,576
Be careful.

461
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:54,296
I got it.

462
00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:23,786
Look over there.

463
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,025
Do you see this beautiful sea?

464
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,536
I'm scared.

465
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:36,735
It's okay. Daddy is here with you.

466
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:29,956
My teddy bear!

467
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:12,226
Sun Hui, come here. Let's eat.

468
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,105
Dad?

469
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,675
What are you doing, Sun Hui?

470
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:29,185
Let's catch some fish too. Doesn't it sound fun?

471
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,886
Yes, it sounds fun.

472
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:34,315
Sir, what's up with you?

473
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,795
Sun Hui, watch out. Walk slowly.

474
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:41,496
Don't walk too fast.

475
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,766
Let me carry you, Sun Hui.

476
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,306
What are you doing here?

477
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:28,005
Hyun Min.

478
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,445
You are acting strange.

479
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,746
You are not hiding something from me, are you?

480
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:42,386
What?

481
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,755
Don't suffer all alone. Talk to me.

482
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:50,024
You called me so many times.

483
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,425
That's why I'm here with you today. I thought something went wrong.

484
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,136
Right.

485
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,936
I wanted to get fresh air by the sea after a long time anyway.

486
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:03,775
Go, Sang Ho!

487
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,315
- Let's go! - Let's go!

488
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,815
Everyone was once a child like her.

489
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:14,255
What did you want to be when you were young?

490
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,886
- What I wanted to be? - Yes.

491
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,326
I forgot.

492
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:31,005
I can't remember it either.

493
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:35,505
I just carried on. And time has passed.

494
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:37,076
You know...

495
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,945
I struggled so much with my life to survive.

496
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:45,746
"What am I doing all this for?"

497
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,485
I wondered every single day.

498
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:55,625
You are a lot like someone I know.

499
00:38:58,525 --> 00:38:59,565
Who?

500
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:06,105
We have the same name.

501
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:09,806
Right.

502
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:13,175
But right now...

503
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,076
I have Sang Ho.

504
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:17,585
- Oh, goodness. - Oh, my.

505
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:20,315
He is my hope.

506
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:23,425
His future is the reason why I carry on with my life.

507
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,855
You have Sun Hui.

508
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:28,056
Do you agree?

509
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:32,866
- I do. - Gosh, I got it!

510
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:35,335
Did you really?

511
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,936
My gosh! It's unbelievable.

512
00:39:40,536 --> 00:39:43,406
Hey, guys. Watch out.

513
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:45,575
Sang Ho, you're great.

514
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:48,275
- Here. - That's amazing.

515
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,044
- Goodness. - My, gosh.

516
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,916
- Goodness. - It's so pretty.

517
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,925
What should we do with this fish?

518
00:39:56,456 --> 00:39:58,886
- Should we fry it? - Should we?

519
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,225
No, we can cook it nicely.

520
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:05,694
- Goodness, we got the fish. - That's amazing.

521
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,766
Sang Ho...

522
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:16,045
You can neither kill yourself...

523
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:17,875
nor your daughter.

524
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:19,206
My gosh!

525
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:22,576
I guess this punk has no hope.

526
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:24,786
What's your purpose in life?

527
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,855
I'll get the money no matter what. Just give me more time.

528
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:30,656
Please, I beg you.

529
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,894
- You should kill yourself. - Please don't kill me.

530
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,935
Please don't kill me!

531
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,565
Don't kill me!

532
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:49,775
(Prosecution Service)

533
00:40:57,016 --> 00:40:58,016
All right.

534
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:05,355
I'm sorry for everything.

535
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:10,496
Don't let people take advantage of you anymore.

536
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,775
(Choi Hyun Min)

537
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:33,616
I need to get this.

538
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:39,125
Hey, what's up?

539
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,996
I just got a new job.

540
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,335
Do you want to visit me in the office one day?

541
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:51,536
- Your office? - Yes.

542
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,675
When I listened to you...

543
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:56,105
about your future,

544
00:41:56,576 --> 00:41:58,005
I learned a lot too.

545
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:00,275
I don't even have time to sleep now.

546
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:02,916
For Sun Hui,

547
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,315
I thought I should get a stable job.

548
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:09,315
Selling insurance alone isn't enough, so I found another job.

549
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,226
I see.

550
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:16,425
Got it. Let me call you back.

551
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:18,226
I'll be waiting.

552
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,985
I'm sorry, everyone.

553
00:42:38,286 --> 00:42:39,346
But...

554
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,556
do you mind giving him another chance?

555
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:46,925
I'll go talk to him. Give me some time.

556
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:51,766
I'm truly sorry.

- Darn it. - This...

559
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:20,125
The circuits are a mess.

560
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:23,424
It'll be bad if it short circuits.

561
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:25,524
Hurry up. I'll have a guest soon.

562
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:27,936
This isn't something I can fix right now.

563
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:30,936
It's too old and should be replaced.

564
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:34,675
What's more, look at the things all over the place.

565
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:38,145
Leaving those substances around is dangerous.

566
00:43:38,246 --> 00:43:40,875
Like I can do anything about it. My job is to sell those.

567
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:43,984
That's the more reason you should be careful.

568
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:46,255
Don't leave your wires like this.

569
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:48,116
It'll cause a fire.

570
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:51,685
Keep the electricity off for a while or it might short circuit.

Darn it!

572
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:57,025
Leave if you can't fix it.

573
00:43:57,395 --> 00:43:58,565
Get moving!

574
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:02,335
All right. Fine.

575
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,435
I won't fix it. I won't.

576
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,175
For goodness' sake.

577
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:17,085

580
00:44:39,406 --> 00:44:40,476
Welcome.

581
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:47,645
What a big office.

582
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,585
I couldn't organize the place yet.

583
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:56,255
- Take a seat over there. - Okay.

584
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:09,806
- What do you do at this place? - You see...

585
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:13,775
An acquaintance introduced me to this job delivering paints.

586
00:45:14,706 --> 00:45:16,505
But we're low on funds.

587
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:19,375
So I was about to ask you.

Hyun Min.

589
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,186
- Do you have something to say? - Don't you...

590
00:45:30,755 --> 00:45:32,425
have something to say?

591
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:35,925
- Sorry? - Just...

592
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:38,465
be honest.

593
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:41,465
Be honest with me.

594
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,666
No, I don't.

595
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:47,306
Why do you ask?

596
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:51,005
The insurance fee you got from my people.

597
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:53,476
Are you embezzling it?

598
00:45:55,945 --> 00:45:58,385
No way.

599
00:45:58,386 --> 00:45:59,685
Believing you'd pay in their stead,

600
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:01,386
they transferred the money to your bank account.

601
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,326
You know it's illegal, right?

602
00:46:08,025 --> 00:46:09,556
That...

603
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,565
I just wanted to have it done properly.

604
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:17,105
Little did I know it was illegal. I'm sorry.

605
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,775
Return the money immediately.

606
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:22,205
Or I'll have to investigate you for fraud.

607
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,406
Listen, Hyun Min.

608
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:38,056
I...

609
00:46:41,056 --> 00:46:42,226
was hoping...

610
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,735
you would make...

611
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,366
a fresh start.

612
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:53,375
We had drinks and meals together.

613
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:55,436
While making good memories,

614
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:57,706
you were open,

615
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,846
smiled gently,

616
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:02,516
and shed tears.

617
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,916
Seeing those sides...

618
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:11,656
made me think you weren't a bad person.

619
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,295
I wanted to trust you.

620
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:23,436
Even now.

621
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:26,335
I still want to trust you.

622
00:47:30,846 --> 00:47:33,976
They say people can't change, but I don't believe that.

623
00:47:34,275 --> 00:47:35,275
You can...

624
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:38,045
definitely start anew.

625
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:40,886

628
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,016
I heard there was a good sushi place...

629
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:10,616
nearby run by a Japanese and made a reservation.

630
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:12,916
Let's...

631
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:15,885
talk about it over some drinks.

632
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:16,985
Hyun Min.

633
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,025
I have faith that you won't let me down.

634
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:46,855
Welcome back.

635
00:48:51,826 --> 00:48:52,956
What's wrong?

636
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:54,826
Are you tired?

637
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,826
Well, a bit.

638
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:22,786
Can you not fall asleep?

639
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:30,226
Hyun Min.

640
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:36,806
He might not be the man we thought he was.

641
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:42,536
My suspicions won't die down.

642
00:49:47,145 --> 00:49:48,246
Is that so?

643
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:05,465
Hyun Min reminds me of this one person.

644
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,105
My little brother, Tae Hyun.

645
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:18,206
He...

646
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:21,516
couldn't adjust to school well...

647
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:23,985
and got into lots of fights.

648
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:28,815
It got to the point Tae Hyun had to go to the police station.

649
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,625
Mom slowly stopped talking to him...

650
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:36,795
and eventually stopped believing whatever he said.

651
00:50:40,395 --> 00:50:42,166
Mom always said,

652
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:45,465
"You can't change a man."

653
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:49,076
Actually, Tae Hyun...

654
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:55,645
was being bullied...

655
00:50:56,476 --> 00:50:58,346
and fought desperately.

656
00:51:09,596 --> 00:51:11,125
I was aware of it.

657
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:19,436
But I pretended I wasn't.

658
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:25,746
I was having dinner with Mom one day...

659
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:29,346
when the police called us.

660
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:32,645
There was a fight at school,

661
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:39,755
and Tae Hyun died in an accident.

662
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:46,936
It was strange.

663
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:54,335
It felt as if I knew it was coming.

664
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,255
It felt like I killed him.

665
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:23,866
"I should feel bad."

666
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,476
"Of all people, I should've believed him."

667
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,175
I kept telling myself those until now.

668
00:52:45,456 --> 00:52:49,195
But even now, I can't trust anyone.

669
00:52:57,906 --> 00:53:00,306
I resented my mom back then.

670
00:53:05,775 --> 00:53:08,775
Truthfully, I was worse than her.

671
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,386
That's not true.

672
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:15,815
I trust you.

673
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:18,686

674
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:23,195

But you don't have the guts to kill them? What a coward.

681

683
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:23,484

00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:25,455
- Let go, jerk. - Please don't kill me!
