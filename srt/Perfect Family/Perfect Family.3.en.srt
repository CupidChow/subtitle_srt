(Episode 3)

13
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:23,309
Who is it?

14
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:27,979
It's Sun Hui's friend, Su Yeon.

15
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,149
Su Yeon, it's you.

16
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,719
Is Sun Hui home?

17
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:38,688
I'm afraid she isn't feeling well today,

18
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,958
and we have a visitor.

19
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:43,029
- Maybe some other time... - I must see her.

20
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,899
It won't take long. Can you let me in?

21
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,738
Please.

22
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,619
Get up.

23
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,559
Get up, darn it!

24
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,299
What are you playing at?

25
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,168
You set the fire, didn't you?

26
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:29,008
Why did you do it?

27
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,608
Why?

28
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:33,608
Why?

29
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:37,219
Why on earth did you set the house on fire?

30
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,489
Whatever you do...

31
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,459
won't change the fact that you killed Gyeong Ho.

32
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,158
Right?

33
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:25,829
You killed him.

34
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,399
That's what we agreed on.

35
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,098
Right, Sun Hui?

36
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:35,709
Right?

37
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:38,038
Say something!

38
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,878
How did the situation escalate like this?

39
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,049
Some more people have died.

40
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,739
It doesn't matter, though.

41
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,138
Turn yourself in.

42
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:23,788
Are you once again...

43
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,358
going to pin the fire on me?

44
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,558
Like you did back in the day?

45
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,899
No.

46
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:39,199
No, Su Yeon.

47
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,819
You were adopted by this family...

48
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,219
and have been living the dream.

49
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,589
But because of you,

50
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,129
my life was flushed down the drain.

51
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,908
This is the very moment to pay back the debt.

52
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:16,939
Sun Hui.

53
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,519
Your dad's a hotshot lawyer.

54
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:28,019
Wouldn't he get you out of this mess somehow?

55
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,089
I'm sure he'll handle the matter...

56
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,319
as long as you turn yourself in.

57
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,029
I can't.

58
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:41,498
What?

59
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,098
I...

60
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,368
I can't turn myself in, Su Yeon.

61
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,339
If...

62
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,347
If I do,

63
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:58,949
my mom...

64
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:06,858
Your mom?

65
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,029
Are you worried you'll disappoint her?

66
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:14,769
You think you'll be abandoned?

67
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,868
I almost had a mom of my own!

68
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,939
If only you hadn't ruined my chances.

69
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,038
You took everything from me,

70
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:30,178
but you still won't help me?

71
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:33,347
Su Yeon, it's not what you think.

72
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,949
Shut it, you obnoxious cow!

73
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:41,428
I'm reporting you.

74
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,029
I'm reporting you to the police.

75
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,598
I won't be lying since you started the fire.

76
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:50,598
You did this.

77
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:54,509
You killed them. Not just Gyeong Ho,

78
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,178
but also his parents!

79
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,738
We're off to the police station, so get ready.

80
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,319
Mr. Choi.

81
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,788
Are you done talking already?

82
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:44,418
Sorry?

83
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:46,488
Are you leaving?

84
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:51,629
Sun Hui and I have somewhere to go.

85
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:55,969
Why would she leave when she's sick?

86
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,038
Where to?

87
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,038
Do you want me to drive you?

88
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:07,779
No, that's all right.

89
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:14,748
Take care.

90
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,839
Oh, no.

91
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:41,069
(Perfect Family)

92
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:52,579
(Self-Directed Learning Room 3)

93
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:06,597
(Did you watch the news? It's Gyeong Ho's place, right?)

94
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:09,497
(It's his house. I've been there before.)

95
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:12,168
(No way!)

96
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,867
(That's insane.)

97
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:19,878
(It's terrifying.)

98
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,558
(Paint thinner was found at his house.)

99
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,658
(Has he been inhaling that?)

100
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,728
(Could he have set the house on fire while inhaling it?)

101
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,637
(He set the house on fire while intoxicated on paint thinner?)

102
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,137
(It wasn't paint thinner, but drugs.)

103
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:50,209
Drugs?

104
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,079
Drugs?

105
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:01,848
Well,

106
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,559
you saw Gyeong Ho's house burn down.

107
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,059
What about it?

108
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,159
Rumour has it that he set the house on fire...

109
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:15,329
while intoxicated on paint thinner or drugs.

110
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:57,169
(Police)

111
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,719
Hey, what brings you here?

112
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,589
Hey, I have something to tell you.

113
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,858
You came at the right time. Come in.

114
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,579
Come in.

115
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:22,659
Ta-da!

116
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,059
What is all this?

117
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,568
It's a surprise for Sun Hui.

118
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,728
What do you think? Does it look okay?

119
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,299
My goodness, this one is...

120
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:49,348
It's horrible.

121
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,758
What?

122
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,059
Gosh.

123
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,469
What a nice thing to say.

124
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:02,868
Don't do stuff like this.

125
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,069
- Why not? - You will fail.

126
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:11,978
You...

127
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,778
Do you...

128
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,179
Do you also...

129
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:25,959
like Sun Hui?

130
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:27,888
What?

131
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:33,858
I was only joking.

132
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,668
Can you text her...

133
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,469
to drop by my place after her classes end?

134
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,768
It'll be more of a surprise if it comes from you.

135
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,179
You can do that for a friend, right?

136
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,948
Check this out. Once she enters the house,

137
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,348
she'll be led this way...

138
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,789
Darn, that's out of place again.

139
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,228
Gyeong Ho.

140
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:14,709
Yes?

141
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,709
You gave this to Sun Hui, didn't you?

142
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,079
Why do you have it?

143
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,209
She gave it to me,

144
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,748
saying she wasn't interested in you.

145
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:36,959
Sun Hui couldn't care less about your feelings.

146
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:42,329
Will you still tell her how you feel, though?

147
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:47,539
Sun Hui...

148
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,939
isn't like that.

149
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:54,278
What?

150
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,079
She isn't like that.

151
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:00,449
Whether you found it or stole it, give it back to her.

152
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:03,919
I don't want to.

153
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,528
- Then give it to me. - I don't want to.

154
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,299
It's mine now.

155
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:25,409
Gosh, why are you doing this?

156
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,079
Why are you giving Sun Hui a hard time?

157
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,199
Give it to me.

158
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,228
Why...

159
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,638
can't I have anything?

160
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,848
Hand it over.

161
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,297
What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?

162
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:22,028
Yes, I'm out of my mind.

163
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:24,098
- Let go. - Stop it.

164
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,099
Let go of me!

165
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:28,808
What's wrong with you?

166
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,638
I'm out of my mind. Let me go.

167
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:32,908
Let me go!

168
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,679
- Come back to your senses. - Hey!

169
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,189
Gosh.

170
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:04,508
- Su Yeon. - Stay away from me!

171
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,719
Why did...

172
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,119
the hope that I barely found...

173
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,518
disappear so fast?

174
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,528
Please don't look.

175
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,998
Don't look.

176
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:33,869
Don't look.

177
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:36,738
Don't look.

178
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:58,998
Goodbye.

179
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:01,469
- Su Yeon. - Now...

180
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:06,469
Put that down.

181
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:08,668
Put it down, Su Yeon.

182
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:09,939
People like me...

183
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:14,678
might as well die.

184
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,507
Su Yeon, what's wrong with you?

185
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:17,879
- What are you doing? - Let me go.

186
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,548
Don't apologize!

187
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,317
- Let me go! - Hey!

188
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,048
This is none of your business!

189
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:31,998
Su Yeon.

190
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:33,099
Sun Hui.

191
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,828
Why are you here?

192
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:40,369
Su Yeon...

193
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:41,709
Why are you here?

194
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:46,139
You promised me that you wouldn't come.

195
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,609
Why don't you keep your promise?

196
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,578
You are making me miserable!

197
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,199
My life is ruined...

198
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:11,599
all because of you.

199
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,068
It's all because of you!

200
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:09,419
Sun Hui.

201
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:15,528
Sun Hui, you should eat.

202
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,008
Dad stepped out for a moment,

203
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:31,709
so let's eat first.

204
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:36,278
Mom.

205
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:38,548
Yes?

206
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:42,889
If...

207
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:46,258
the police come...

208
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:49,258
Why would the police come here?

209
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,699
Let's eat.

210
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:01,838
Mom.

211
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:07,278
Are you really not going to tell me?

212
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:12,548
Why my cell phone and workbook are...

213
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:16,018
back in my room?

214
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:20,459
What happened...

215
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,129
at Gyeong Ho's house last night?

216
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,998
How would I know what happened at Gyeong Ho's place?

217
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:31,939
My daughter,

218
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,768
you still seem unwell.

219
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,578
Let's eat when your dad returns home.

220
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:01,728
(We're Happy to Serve Our Citizens.)

221
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:11,038
Now that I've gotten old,

222
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:14,179
every joint in my body hurts.

223
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:20,449
(Rejuvenate Your Joints)

224
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,527
I'm all good. I feel much better now.

225
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:39,599
I'm good. Nothing hurts at all.

226
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,238
Detective Lee.

227
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,838
Did you find anything in Park Gyeong Ho's cell phone and computer?

228
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,389
Hey, what are you doing? Did you fall asleep?

229
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,219
No.

230
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:01,827
I tested if I could sleep with one eye open.

231
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:02,958
That's ridiculous.

232
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,297
Haven't you seen "Leon: The Professional?"

233
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:07,699
What about "Leon: The Professional?" Are you bringing up movies again?

234
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:10,699
This is what Mathilda says to Leon who is a killer.

235
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:15,439
"I've never seen anyone snore with one eye open."

236
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:19,738
That's exactly what I'm saying.

237
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,248
Did you find anything in his computer?

238
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,747
Nothing interesting.

239
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:26,318
I found nothing in particular in his recent history.

240
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,287
He was in Australia until a year ago.

241
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:32,588
Like a troublemaker, he smoked and inhaled paint thinner there too.

242
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,588
It's not so surprising.

243
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:39,827
Girls acquainted with him were absent.

244
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:42,599
And his guy friend went home early, so I couldn't meet any of them.

245
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:44,429
Wasn't she at the scene of the accident?

246
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,838
Gosh. Yes, that's her.

247
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,337
She's one of the students who were absent.

248
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:52,477
Her name is Lee Su Yeon.

249
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:54,738
I need to meet her.

250
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,478
Lee Su Yeon.

251
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,888
At which speed do you want me to push you?

252
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,128
Speed level four.

253
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:12,528
Okay.

254
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:16,898
Faster. This is fun.

255
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:18,599
- Is it fun? - Su Yeon.

256
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:27,038
Come in.

257
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,449
Come in, Su Yeon.

258
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,659
Su Yeon, say hello.

259
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:42,389
Hello.

260
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:46,599
Hello.

261
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:51,169
Is your name Su Yeon?

262
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,568
Would you let me see your face?

263
00:26:57,808 --> 00:27:00,609
What's wrong? Do you find me scary?

264
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,478
My goodness.

265
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:06,879
It's okay.

266
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,689
We'll get going.

267
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:13,018
Please get back safely.

268
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:31,838
What a fool.

269
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:34,078
I'm so stupid.

270
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,058

271
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:58,128

(Lee Su Yeon)

273
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,327
The phone is turned off.

274
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,497
Please leave a message after the beep...

275
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:10,267

276
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:11,737
The phone is turned off.

277
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:14,138
Please leave a message after the beep.

278
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:15,139
There will be charges...

279
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:30,558
It's for you.

280
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:34,057
I got it customized. That's why it took so long.

281
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,129
Gosh.

282
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:50,748
That's hilarious.

283
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:53,018
It's fascinating.

284
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,389
I know.

285
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:20,439

00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:29,149
Yes?

291
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,078
Oh, hello.

292
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,788
Hello.

293
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:37,648
Hyeon U.

294
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:40,988
I wanted to go to Gyeong Ho's funeral with Sun Hui.

295
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,889
Oh, I see.

296
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,868
Hyeon U, you're here.

297
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:49,899
Hey.

298
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:52,099
Are you feeling okay, Sun Hui?

299
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,568
Yes.

300
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:43,988
Are you okay, Sun Hui?

301
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,768
Are you okay, Sun Hui?

302
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:03,538
Sun Hui.

303
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:06,038
Sun Hui?

304
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:09,649
Are you okay?

305
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:14,219
Have some water.

306
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:41,738
Dad.

307
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:47,548
Sun Hui, are you okay?

308
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:50,518
She seems to be in a big shock.

309
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:54,659
Let's go.

310
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:06,538
Get home safely.

311
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,608
Thanks, Hyeon U.

312
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:11,809
Sure.

313
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:14,608
See you.

314
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,838
Are you sure you don't have to see a doctor?

315
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,208
I just want to go home.

316
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:58,648
Since you were close to Gyeong Ho,

317
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,358
you won't feel better anytime soon.

318
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,898
Losing a close friend...

319
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,499
could fade over time.

320
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,398
But you'll have to live with that scar...

321
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,639
in your heart for the rest of your life.

322
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:19,409
Dad.

323
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:23,179
Have you also parted with a friend before?

324
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:25,409
A friend?

325
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:31,488
Sure, I could call it that.

326
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,289
Anyway, what matters...

327
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,758
is the family that is living with us.

328
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:42,969
I have...

329
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:45,769
you and your mom.

330
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:50,369
And you have Mom and Dad.

331
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,608
Not everything will go back to its place right now.

332
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,878
But as time goes by,

333
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:05,858
it will all go back to when it was perfect.

334
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,159
Your mom and I will help,

335
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:15,398
so will you follow us?

336
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:20,938
Yes.

337
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,508
Okay.

338
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,778
Let's go home.

339
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,369
It's here.

340
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,499
Gosh, it's incredible.

341
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,909
It is a huge mansion.

342
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:58,508
I should've become a lawyer too.

343
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,208
You couldn't have with that brain of yours.

344
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,207
I could have! And...

345
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,979
- Let's go. - Okay.

346
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,229
- Wait in the car. - Okay.

347
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:38,608
What's going on?

348
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,318
We're the police.

349
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:44,547
Regarding the fire at Gyeong Ho's house,

350
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:46,218
we have a few questions to ask his friend.

351
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:47,389
Please cooperate.

352
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:49,659
A fire?

353
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:52,027
Yes, we have a few questions we'd like to ask your daughter...

354
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,059
regarding the fire.

355
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:26,258
Give me this as a present.

356
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,699
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

357
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:31,798
I can't have it?

358
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:37,438
Why is this...

359
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:39,708
in this car?

360
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,349
Thank you.

361
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,508
Thank you.

362
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,208
Thank you.

363
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:26,389
We're the detectives in charge of the recent fire case.

364
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,188
There are some things we need to check.

365
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:33,228
Sun Hui, we heard you were close to Gyeong Ho,

366
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,127
one of the victims in the house that burned down.

367
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,199
Is that right?

368
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:38,969
Yes.

369
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:43,268
Did you hear anything from Gyeong Ho recently?

370
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,168
Like his concerns and stuff.

371
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,809
Not much.

372
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,179
Not much?

373
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:56,188
Then do you know a girl called Lee Su Yeon?

374
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,528
Yes.

375
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,358
Was she Gyeong Ho's girlfriend?

376
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:11,369
No, she wasn't.

377
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:13,639
I see.

378
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,608
We can't reach her.

379
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:21,979
Can you reach her?

380
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,969
Sun Hui, you're in the same class as Su Yeon, right?

381
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:48,398
Yes.

382
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:51,238
And you two were close?

383
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:56,707
Yes, we were,

384
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,208
- but... - But?

385
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:06,688
I also...

386
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:09,119
didn't see her.

387
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,737
- Let's go. - Sorry?

388
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:21,838
Please excuse us.

389
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,369
- Thank you for your time. - Wait, Dong Ho.

390
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:27,809
Oh, gosh. Goodness.

391
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:44,229
Oh, right.

392
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:53,138
Sun Hui, if Su Yeon calls you,

393
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,139
please call us at this number.

394
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:57,768
Sure.

395
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:00,079
Okay. Goodbye, then.

396
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,108
Goodness.

397
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:14,458
Sun Hui.

398
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,889
Why didn't you tell them that Su Yeon was here?

399
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,599
Well, I...

400
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,969
Sun Hui, you sure take after me.

401
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,969
It's good that you didn't tell them that Su Yeon was here yesterday.

402
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,207
It's true that you didn't see her today,

403
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,578
so you weren't lying about that.

404
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,448
And the detectives didn't ask if you saw her yesterday,

405
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:37,548
so there was nothing wrong with your answer.

406
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,678
She's indeed the daughter of a lawyer.

407
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,778
- Are you happy? - Of course.

408
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:44,889
Choi Sun Hui.

409
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:51,889
Don't be scared.

410
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:53,298
I got you.

411
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:58,398
No matter what happens,

412
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:01,568
I'm on your side.

413
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:07,878
I...

414
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:11,909
will go back to my room and rest. I'm tired.

415
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:35,468
Dong Ho, I had more questions to ask. Why did you leave?

416
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:36,668
What more was there ask?

417
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:39,837
She's obviously hiding something.

418
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:42,438
Asking any further questions would've been a waste of time.

419
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,849
Dong Ho! Wait for me!

420
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,828
(Lee Su Yeon)

421
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:07,138
(Su Yeon, where are you?)

422
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,369
(Did something happen? Su Yeon, are you okay?)

423
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,578
The phone is turned off.

424
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,987
You will be redirected after the tone.

425
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:23,988
There will be charges...

426
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,039
Hey, Hyeon U.

427
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:15,897
Hey, Sun Hui. What's up?

428
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:19,507
Did you happen to get any text from Su Yeon?

429
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,208
No, not yet.

430
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:25,608
The police just came by our place.

431
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:28,048
The police went to your place?

432
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:29,849
Why?

433
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,288
They asked about Su Yeon and Gyeong Ho.

434
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:34,318
I see.

435
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,058
Do the police think the fire...

436
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:40,628
at Gyeong Ho's place is related to Su Yeon?

437
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:42,898
Last time,

438
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:46,199
you walked Gyeong Ho and Su Yeon to their houses, right?

439
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:49,469
Can you tell me where Su Yeon lives?

440
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:52,469
Sure. Should I tag along with you?

441
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:01,048
No, it's okay. I'll go alone.

442
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:10,818
Oh, gosh.

443
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:14,219
Who are you?

444
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,728
I'm Su Yeon's friend.

445
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:20,128
Okay. What about her?

446
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:25,368
You see, I can't get in touch with her.

447
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:27,168
Did she cause another problem at school?

448
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:29,039
Sorry?

449
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:31,568
She hasn't come home in days.

450
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:34,208
Even the police came by this morning.

451
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:37,008
She promised to attend school diligently.

452
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:39,978
If she contacts you,

453
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:42,118
tell her that her sister is worried...

454
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,519
and to call me first.

455
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,088
Oh, okay.

456
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:54,599
You punk!

457
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:57,128
What on earth is the problem?

458
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:00,837
It simply doesn't feel right.

459
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:03,538
Feel right, my foot. Stop spouting nonsense.

460
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:06,937
Are you implying this case is connected to teenagers?

461
00:48:06,938 --> 00:48:08,638
Then, quit being a detective...

462
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,749
and guide teenagers to the right path!

463
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:12,148
And...

464
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,449
think like a modern detective.

465
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:16,619
Stop investigating with your gut!

466
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,987
Why don't you resign...

467
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:20,818
and become a fortune teller, you hayseed?

468
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:23,429
Good grief. What an eyesore.

469
00:48:23,588 --> 00:48:24,628
Get lost.

470
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:27,898
Why don't you get lost?

471
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,559
You little...

472
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:32,168
You pretended to cough to badmouth me, right?

473
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:34,369
No. I'm coming down with a cold.

474
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:42,008
Stop causing trouble.

475
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:44,349
Only do what you're told. Got it?

476
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:48,218
Gosh. What's the use of not investigating deeper?

477
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,618
(The Nation's Police, Righteous Korea)

478
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,559
If you're that unhappy with the orders, quit your job!

479
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,828
Quit your job as a detective and establish your own police station.

480
00:48:56,829 --> 00:49:00,527
Seriously. And how am I supposed to do that?

481
00:49:00,528 --> 00:49:04,269
Look at you. How dare you talk back at me?

482
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:06,969
What a cheap and nasty guy. I should get promoted.

483
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:08,798
What was that?

484
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:10,869
I can hear you, you know?

485
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:14,207
I'll become the Commissioner General.

486
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,909
You jerk. Do you have a death wish?

487
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:19,449
Enough.

488
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,148
- Chief. - What is it?

489
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:25,648
- What? - We have the autopsy results.

490
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,418
It's unlikely to be asphyxia.

491
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:30,688
Look at the stab wounds.

492
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:35,058
- What is it? - You punk!

493
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,968
Aren't these Park Gyeong Ho's autopsy results?

494
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:38,027
Give it back!

495
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:39,428
- Come on! - Give me a minute.

496
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:41,138
Let me take a look, all right?

497
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:44,968
"Results show the cause of death was not carbon monoxide poisoning."

498
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:48,639
"There is a possibility that it was caused by a stab wound."

499
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:50,349
"The possibility!"

500
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:55,548
Are you still going to tell us to close the case?

501
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:58,418
Are you?

502
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:01,918
- Are you? - Are you?

503
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,758
That day, after leaving my house,

504
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,128
she cut off all contact and disappeared?

505
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,568
And...

506
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:21,238
Su Yeon's belonging was found in Dad's car.

507
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:25,168
But why?

508
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,079
Sun Hui.

509
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:40,418
You're so big now.

510
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:43,829
Do you remember me?

511
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:51,429
Who are you?

512
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:53,898
Did I scare you?

513
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:56,469
I'm a relative of your dad's.

514
00:51:57,139 --> 00:52:00,139
I came by last time, but only got to see you today.

515
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,679
Oh, I see. Hi.

516
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:08,418
I don't blame you.

517
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,519
We met when you were little.

518
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,418
It's natural not to remember me.

519
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:23,498
Why are you looking at me like that?

520
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:24,568
What?

521
00:52:25,628 --> 00:52:26,699
It's nothing.

522
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:30,039
Is that the window to your room?

523
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:35,608
No.

524
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,648
Then whose room is it?

525
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:43,048
Don't you know?

526
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:50,188
I'm sorry for asking something weird.

527
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:51,988
Anyway, I'll see you around.

528
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:54,398
I'll come by often.

529
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:56,729
Sure.

530
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:02,539
Sun Hui.

531
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:11,749
Be careful...

532
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:15,979
of your dad and mom.

533
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:56,858
(Epilogue)

534
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:11,769
It's boring.

535
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,958
I hate myself for not living up to the expectations.

536
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:42,269
My father won't acknowledge my paintings.

537
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:45,168
It apparently has no personal appeal.

538
00:54:49,338 --> 00:54:51,179
I don't agree with him.

539
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:54,648
I believe...

540
00:54:55,278 --> 00:54:58,119
you should paint as you wish.

541
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,869
Why don't we draw each other's faces?

542
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:21,108
- Sun Hui. - Yes?

543
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:22,938
Face the front.

544
00:55:23,438 --> 00:55:24,508
- The front? - Yes.

545
00:55:25,008 --> 00:55:26,548
Yes, just like that.

546
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:29,949
Perfect.

547
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:35,889
How am I supposed to draw like this?

548
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,068
Don't expect too much.

549
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:56,338
But I like it.

550
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:23,068
I'm almost done.

551
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:27,079
All it needs are some final touches.

552
00:56:33,008 --> 00:56:34,019
I'm done.

553
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,059
What?

554
00:56:43,588 --> 00:56:44,628
It's amazing.

555
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:48,228
Hey, stop it. It's embarrassing.

556
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:50,158
No, I'm serious.

557
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,269
Here. Let me take a look.

558
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:55,238
I see.

559
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,039
Let me have this.

560
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:02,539
Okay.

561
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:34,207
I may be an ugly duckling right now.

562
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,838
But I should live as I am.

563
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:40,579
I'll give it to her tomorrow.

564
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:00,539
(Perfect Family)

565
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,519
How much more must we hide it?

566
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:25,788
I'm home, Sun Hui.

567
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:28,499
What is it? Where are you going?

568
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,128
Please wait here.

569
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,199
She seems to know something.

570
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:36,039
Why do you have that?

571
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:37,909
What now?

572
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:41,377
We better move our plan forward.

573
00:58:41,378 --> 00:58:44,678
Why are my parents trying to keep this boy a secret?

574
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:45,979
Shut it!
