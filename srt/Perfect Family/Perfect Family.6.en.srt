I'll make sure this doesn't happen again,

19
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:43,927
so please tell her that.

20
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:50,436
I do not intend to meddle in your family matters,

22
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:58,737

23
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,106
Can't you be more understanding as her son?

24
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,317
- Come by the house more. - And then what?

00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:11,417
She...

26

will never forgive us.

27

28
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,207

Can I just see...

90
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,217
- how she's doing? - No.

91
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:24,196
I think we should let her rest today.

92
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,996
You should head home.

93
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,126

I see.

115
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,786
I'm telling you all this,

116
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:52,317
trusting your promise to listen to anything I would say.

117
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,227
But this is different.

Yes?

00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:17,876
Sure.

122
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:59,786
- They must be killed quickly! - Calm down, will you?

123
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:02,656
No.

124
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:05,357
No.

125
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,526
I must've heard wrong.

126
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,766
That can't be right.

127
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,307
Mom and Dad...

128
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:20,776
would never.

that Su Yeon texted you.

134

I'm sorry I made the decision without discussing it with you.

135
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,166
You weren't picking up,

136

138
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:06,146
Su Yeon's phone was constantly turned off.

139
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,446
The last time it was turned on...

140
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,257
was the day after Gyeong Ho died.

141
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:13,857
It was last pinged...

142
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:16,656
at the river where her belongings were found.

143
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,307

149

This wasn't sent by Su Yeon.

150
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,386
Then who could it be?

151
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,267

152
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,007
Have some porridge.

Look at this cold sweat.

154
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,956

167

I can catch Jin Hyuk red-handed.

168
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,757

171
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,047

00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,706
ran away from home.

190
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,876
What are you talking about?

191
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,807
My mom...

192
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:45,476
Your mom?

193
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:47,547
What about her?

194
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:49,517
She...

195
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:51,247
My mom...

196
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,926
Where are you? I'll come right now.

197
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:07,436
I'm near my house.

198
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,107
On the other side of the post office.

199
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,206
I'll be right there, so stay there.

200
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,385
- What happened? - My goodness.

201
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:34,885
Are you all right?

202
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:35,926
Hey!

203
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:37,726
Hey!

204
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:40,626
Please call 911.

205
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,636
Can you hear me? Please call 911.

206
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:49,966
Hey!

207
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:57,946
- I'll take this. - Okay.

208
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,297
You need to pay for that.

209
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:19,665
Sir, you need to pay.

210
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,297
I'll be back.

211
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,337
Excuse me!

212
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:24,767
Wait!

213
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:26,436
Excuse me.

214
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,186
Mr. Choi.

215
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:45,757
Hyeon U.

216
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:47,626
What are you doing here without an umbrella?

217
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,807
Here. Take this with you.

218
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:01,847
Thank you.

219
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:15,557
Yes, honey.

220
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:20,926
Sun Hui?

221
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:45,016
It isn't life-threatening,

222
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,416
but there's been a lot of epidural haematoma.

223
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:51,757
Why isn't she conscious yet?

224
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,655
She probably lost consciousness temporarily.

225
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,567
Please try not to worry so much.

226
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,896
- Okay. - Please excuse me.

227
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:12,916
Honey.

228
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:15,817
You heard the doctor, right? Don't worry so much.

229
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,486
Choi Sun Hui's guardian?

230
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:27,027
- Yes. - The police have questions for you.

231
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:28,827
Honey.

232
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,107
I'll be right back. Wait here.

233
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:43,176
Hyeon U. I'm sorry,

234
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:46,715
but can you get something to drink for my wife?

235
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:48,587
Sure, I will.

236
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,347
- I'll be back. - Thanks.

237
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:55,527
I'll be back.

238
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:02,426
- They're waiting in the rest area. - Okay.

239
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,837
Is the patient...

240
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:12,307
allergic to anything or taking medicine right now?

241
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:17,107
She's allergic to peanuts.

242
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,317
Sometimes,

243
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,186
it can be so serious...

244
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:23,916
that she needs medical care.

245
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,176
Mom?

246
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:00,287
Why are you...

247
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,797
Why are you...

248
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,136
Why are you...

249
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:18,537
still alive?

250
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:42,027
Mrs. Choi.

251
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:46,367
Here you go.

252
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,547
Don't worry so much.

253
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,587
Sun Hui will be fine.

254
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,027
No!

255
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:25,107
What's wrong, Sun Hui?

256
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:28,705
Wake up, Sun Hui!

257
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,077
I'll call the doctor.

258
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,047
Sun Hui.

259
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,087
Sun Hui? Sun Hui!

260
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,057
Mom.

261
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:47,027
Yes, it's me.

262
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:49,126
It's okay.

263
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,297
I'm right here.

264
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,547
Ma'am, Choi Sun Hui is awake.

265
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:11,716
We need you here, Doctor.

266
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,617
- Thank you. - Okay.

267
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:16,257
This is the dashcam footage from the car that was in the accident.

268
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,926
When you watch what happened...

269
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,027
Do you see anything strange?

270
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:33,736
Sir?

271
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,476
What's strange about it?

272
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,787
It isn't clear in the recording,

273
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,856
but if you watch it carefully,

274
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:48,286
it looks like Sun Hui suddenly ran out onto the road.

275
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,386
Doesn't her posture look unnatural?

276
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:58,936
- Is that so? - Yes.

277
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:02,406
It looks like she was pushed onto the road.

278
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:09,446
Are you saying that someone pushed her intentionally?

279
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:15,317
We'll have to hear what Sun Hui says once she wakes up.

280
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,347
But this is it for now.

281
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:23,986
I understand.

282
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:31,466
Mr. Choi! Sun Hui is up.

283
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,936
Doctor, what is wrong with her?

284
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:43,276
- Ms. Choi, try to breathe. - Oh, my goodness!

285
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,405
Sun Hui, are you okay? Can you hear me?

286
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,375
- Sun Hui! - My gosh.

287
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,787
Ms. Ha, please step back.

288
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:52,587
Ms. Ha, please step back.

289
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:53,857
Ms. Choi!

290
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:55,287
Please calm down.

291
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:59,257
- Ms. Choi. - Please grab her legs.

292
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:14,636
Ms. Choi.

293
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:16,546
Ms. Choi.

294
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:21,446
A dream?

295
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:23,586
Was it a dream?

296
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:30,486
(Heemang General Hospital)

297
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:44,437
Please set it to 120cc.

298
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,106
Gosh, shall we go?

299
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:55,477
I don't think we can hear anything from Jin Hyuk tonight.

300
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,886
Starting with Gyeong Ho, and now it's Su Yeon...

301
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:04,326
You can run a CT scan.

302
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:07,195
- Get help from the neurologist. - Okay, Doctor.

303
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:08,327
And her parents...

304
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:12,766
People around him are getting in trouble...

305
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,836
one by one, including Sun Hui.

306
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:25,477
It reached the point where we can't call it a coincidence.

307
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:39,295
It looks like transient seizures due to trauma.

308
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,426
It's important that she stays stable.

309
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:44,526
Please refrain from visiting.

310
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:45,836
Yes.

311
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:55,877
Hyeon U.

312
00:35:57,077 --> 00:35:58,647
Sun Hui, are you okay?

313
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:00,176
Help me.

314
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,986
- What? - My mom...

315
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,546
and dad are trying to kill me.

316
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:08,557
My mom and dad...

317
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,727
They are trying to kill me.

318
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,827
Hyeon U, my mom and dad...

319
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,195
are trying to kill me.

320
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:18,296
- They are trying... - Sun Hui, calm down.

321
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,695
What do you mean, Sun Hui? Get out of my way.

322
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,366
Sun Hui, it's me. I'm the detective.

323
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:26,636
What did you mean by that? Could you tell me more about that?

324
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:28,106
Sun Hui.

325
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:32,207
Sun Hui. You can't fall asleep now. Please wake up.

326
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,816
Sun Hui!

327
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,006
My goodness.

328
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:01,477
Dong Ho.

329
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,446
Here is your coffee.

330
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:05,747
What? Thank you.

331
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,827
Coffee suits you really well.

332
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:18,526
You're like Bruce Willis in "Die Hard."

333
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,296
Did you find out anything?

334
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:24,497
Yes.

335
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:27,296
They don't know if it's Su Yeon for sure.

336
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,835
Based on the tracking of the girl who was said to have been seen...

337
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:31,466
near Gyeong Ho's place...

338
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,206
On the day she was recorded on the surveillance camera,

339
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,605
she was seen near the street.

340
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:37,076
That's where Sun Hui's place is.

341
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:39,176
And she wasn't seen after that.

342
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,017
What about the dashcams from the surrounding cars?

343
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:44,046
The parking regulation is quite strict there.

344
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,917
There weren't many cars that were parked.

345
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:49,787
Not many cars were parked? You won't do your job, then?

346
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:53,526
I'll do my job.

347
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:57,026
I'll ask for cooperation from those who live nearby.

348
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:03,937
She disappeared near Sun Hui's house.

349
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,647
- Detective Lee. - Yes?

350
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:12,077
Please get me a search warrant.

351
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,716
What?

352
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:15,577
Where?

353
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,256
There.

354
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:43,946
(Heemang General Hospital)

355
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:48,446
Are you really doing this?

356
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:50,687
You can get me a warrant...

357
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,086
if you don't like the idea.

358
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,486
How can I get it? They can't issue it for us.

359
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:59,957
There's no evidence. And he's a successful attorney.

360
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:01,196
What can I do?

361
00:39:01,796 --> 00:39:03,066
Where are you?

362
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:05,766
- Where? - Here.

363
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:06,835
Here, pull over there.

364
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:09,096
Hello, brothers.

365
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,635
I mean, detectives.

366
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:13,906
You look better each time you get out of jail.

367
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,536
The food there must be nice.

368
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,176
- Thanks to you... - Don't try to...

369
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:19,216
Don't let them find out about you.

370
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,516
How far can I go?

371
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,917
You know it. Just do it right.

372
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:27,616
Yes, sir. Just right.

373
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,727
Okay, just do it until it works.

374
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:33,627
- "Just until it works?" - You know what I mean, right?

375
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,327
- You got that? - "Until it works?"

376
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,796
It's that car! Go on, do your job.

377
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,106
Yes, sir.

378
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:46,836
My gosh.

379
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:51,247
"Do it just right?"

380
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:53,776
"Until it works?"

381
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:00,655
Go.

382
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:03,756
My gosh, I don't know how far he wants me to go.

383
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:05,926
I don't know.

384
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,026
I'll just do whatever he says.

385
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:20,937
My gosh!

386
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:29,687
I'm so sorry.

387
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,247
I'm still new to driving.

388
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:38,986
Let's call the insurance company.

389
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:40,426
Insurance company?

390
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:42,997
Your business card, I see.

391
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,827
- My business card is in my car. - Okay.

392
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:56,006
I told him to play it just right.

393
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,176
It's going to cost a lot to fix that car.

394
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:05,486
Fast.

395
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:07,656
Hard.

396
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:11,156
Fast.

397
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,327
Hard.

398
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:17,026
Fast.

399
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:19,537
Hard.

400
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,437
Sun Hui.

401
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,066
Why can't you do it?

402
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:27,937
Are you scared?

403
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:37,287
Just think that it's easy.

404
00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:41,287
You know how everything adds up.

405
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:45,187
Didn't the detective tell you?

406
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,796
To be careful of your parents.

407
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:54,966
The car that ran into you when you were with Hyeon U.

408
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:58,807
Who do you think drove that car?

409
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:02,275
You think it's a coincidence that the car was the same...

410
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,376
as the one your dad rented?

411
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,146
Who bought that peanut powder?

412
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,576
Who pushed you on the street?

413
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:10,445
Because you wouldn't eat the porridge with peanut powder...

414
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,187
didn't they chase you and push you from behind?

415
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:14,856
Who should be blamed...

416
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:19,156
for my current state?

417
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:33,336
Fast.

418
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:35,377
Hard.

419
00:42:38,477 --> 00:42:40,276
See? It works.

420
00:43:01,897 --> 00:43:04,437
You act like you don't know, but you've noticed, right?

421
00:43:05,236 --> 00:43:08,207
That the swan keyring was found in your dad's car.

422
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:10,046
You know, don't you?

423
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:14,176
I most likely...

424
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,617
died because of you too.

425
00:43:59,997 --> 00:44:01,196
Mom.

426
00:44:06,696 --> 00:44:07,696
Sun Hui.

427
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:09,867
Are you awake now?

428
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:22,546
How do you feel?

429
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:25,816
It seemed like you were having a nightmare.

430
00:44:28,617 --> 00:44:29,787
Yesterday,

431
00:44:31,486 --> 00:44:33,057
I said something strange, didn't I?

432
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:34,397
What?

433
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:38,497
That...

434
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,236
must've been a nightmare.

435
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:46,437
In my dream,

436
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:49,176
you...

437
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,446
- and Dad... - It's okay, Sun Hui.

438
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,747
You've been going through a lot lately.

439
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:57,446
Things will get better soon.

440
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:03,886
Thanks, Mom.

441
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:14,066
Don't move. You're not better yet.

442
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:17,937
I'm okay.

443
00:45:20,437 --> 00:45:21,437
Mom.

444
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,446
Where's my phone?

445
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:24,977
Your phone?

446
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:27,716
I have it.

447
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:32,517
It was found at the scene of the accident.

448
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,026
I'll call the doctor.

449
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:41,026
Rest, okay?

450
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:43,127
Okay.

451
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:08,057
Sir.

452
00:46:09,856 --> 00:46:11,356
Please help me.

453
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,066
All right.

454
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,397
Let's meet as soon as possible.

455
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:40,617
Lee Su Yeon.

456
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,566
It's me, Hyeon U.

457
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:33,676
Excuse me!

458
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:34,977
Wait!

459
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:38,477
It was you, right?

460
00:47:53,597 --> 00:47:54,656
Lee Su Hyun.

461
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:04,636
Here it is.

462
00:48:07,377 --> 00:48:08,606
Come on.

463
00:48:08,937 --> 00:48:10,346
I'll treat you to some drinks.

464
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:12,846
Drinks and whatnot. I'll get in trouble if I get caught.

465
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:13,876
You won't get into trouble.

466
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:15,916
- Stop worrying. - Gosh.

467
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:19,316
The memory card in the dashcam is new.

468
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:22,755
See that?

469
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:25,456
There was a reason it had to be changed to a new one.

470
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,557
- Take it. - I was dead tired, you know?

471
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:30,326
Are you shooting a detective drama or something?

472
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:33,597
- That hunch of yours is ridiculous. - Come on.

473
00:48:34,236 --> 00:48:35,866
When will you be done?

474
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,436
You simply need to spritz some chemicals...

475
00:48:37,437 --> 00:48:40,105
and tell us if it's there or not. Stop complaining so much.

476
00:48:40,106 --> 00:48:41,807
Hey, do you think this is easy?

477
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:44,405
- Why don't you do it? - Like I can.

478
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:47,617
Shut it. He's helping us, isn't he? Stop yapping at him.

479
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:51,045
You should change that 20-year-old lighter.

480
00:48:51,046 --> 00:48:52,346
Why don't you buy me one?

481
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,956
- All you do is go to the movies. - A lighter...

482
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:55,017
Wait!

483
00:48:55,316 --> 00:48:57,686
- What is it? - It's here!

484
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:58,756
The bloodstain.

485
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:02,127
You're busted now.

486
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:08,566
(Heemang General Hospital)

487
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:16,606
There's no need to be in such a rush.

488
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:21,216
Didn't the doctor say I was fine?

489
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,787
I'll receive treatment as an outpatient if it gets worse.

490
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:27,656
Good grief.

491
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:37,066
I've settled the bill.

492
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:39,026
You'll leave right away, right?

493
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:41,397
Yes. Thank...

494
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,236
Sun Hui?

495
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:47,636
Will you really be okay?

496
00:49:48,937 --> 00:49:50,207
Yes.

497
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:53,377
I was only a bit dizzy.

498
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,127
Why did you say...

499
00:50:08,796 --> 00:50:11,026
your mom and I would kill you?

500
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:13,997
Honey.

501
00:50:17,066 --> 00:50:18,066
By any chance,

502
00:50:19,506 --> 00:50:22,377
are you hiding something from us?

503
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:46,526
Sun Hui. Get some rest in your room.

504
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:49,026
All right.

505
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:11,517
Who is it?

506
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:14,787
Hi, we're the police.

507
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:37,946
We're the police.

508
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:45,287
Mr. Choi Jin Hyuk?

509
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:48,856
Yes, that's me.

510
00:52:50,256 --> 00:52:52,385
You're arrested without a warrant as the suspect...

511
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:54,557
of the kidnapping and murder of Lee Su Yeon.

512
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:56,155
You have the right to appoint an attorney...

513
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:58,127
and the right to remain silent. Take him.

514
00:52:59,466 --> 00:53:00,537
Dad?

515
00:53:01,267 --> 00:53:02,336
Hold on.

516
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,367
I'll be back soon, Sun Hui. Don't worry about a thing.

517
00:53:06,066 --> 00:53:07,336
Take good care of her, honey.

518
00:53:07,537 --> 00:53:08,606
Honey!

519
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:12,906
Sun Hui!

520
00:53:14,477 --> 00:53:15,816
Sun Hui...

521
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:27,627
(Epilogue)

522
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:06,086
Gosh! Mom, Dad, it's a bicycle!

523
00:55:23,747 --> 00:55:24,776
Go to your dad.

524
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:26,477
Dad!

525
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:27,917
Good job.

526
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:30,246
You're riding it so well.

527
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,617
Make a turn.

528
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:37,856
You're good at it, Sun Hui. Come to Mom.

529
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:39,656
Great job!

530
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:52,336
It was stolen?

531
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:56,136
But you were riding it just now.

532
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:01,676
You must be so upset, Sun Hui.

533
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,747
It's okay.

534
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:07,386
Sun Hui.

535
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,086
Stop it!

536
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:33,636
Shall we ride something else?

537
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:38,807
Up you go.

538
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:46,886
Let's go.

539
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:21,086
(Perfect Family)

540
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,377
Where's Lee Su Yeon?

541
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:46,946
The text message.

542
00:58:47,477 --> 00:58:48,546
What did it mean?

543
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:53,316
Let's say the person you saw was Lee Su Yeon.

544
00:58:53,816 --> 00:58:55,256
I came to testify.

545
00:58:55,486 --> 00:58:57,756
Things are getting complicated.

546
00:58:58,187 --> 00:58:59,886
You should suffer as much as I have.

547
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:05,296
Aren't you investigating assuming that Su Yeon is dead?

548
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,696
- Was there even a body? - Sun Hui!
