32
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,099
I once dreamed of falling into the sea.

33
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,180
Why...

34
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,680
did I dream of that?

35
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,740
Hyeon U.

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,710
Hyeon U, are you all right?

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,249
Hyeon U, wake up.

38
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,680
Hyeon U.

00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,819

Mom.

44
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,808
I don't think I need any tests.

45
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,818
As if you don't. You were in a car accident.

46
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,318
I wasn't hit by a car...

47
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,219
but fell to the ground while dodging one.

48
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,049
Be quiet and let them run tests.

49
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,558
You even lost consciousness.

50
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,859
What if you have a concussion?

51
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,828
See for yourself.

52
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:35,989
I'm fine.

53
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,829
Stop moving your head and lie back down.

54
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,400
I can't believe you.

55
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,040
I said I was all right.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,139
Sun Hui, I'm sorry for putting you through this.

57
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,550
Don't say that. I'm the one who should apologize.

58
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,180
My mom wasn't trying to scold you, so don't mind her.

59
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,420
I know, and I'm fine.

60
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,600
Sun Hui, I...

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,840
These days, I'm reminded of the little things.

62
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,069
Gyeong Ho and I would joke around,

63
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,879
and you'd be laughing next to us.

64
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,780
Those frivolous moments...

65
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,220
were what I cherished.

66
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,119
But that's no longer an option.

67
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,600
I guess we can't have those old times back.

68
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,350
Here you go.

69
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,519
It's for you.

70
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,709
That's why I won't do something that'll cost us our friendship.

71
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,540
I can't lose you too.

72
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,180
However,

73
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,550
I can't turn a blind eye to Gyeong Ho's case either.

74
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,980
I feel the same way.

75
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,790
Will you call the police once your head clears?

76
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,230
Yes.

77
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,100
Good.

78
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,499
Anyway, the van...

79
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,069
Didn't it seem odd to you?

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,638
- What? - When you're about to hit someone,

81
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,638
you normally slam down on the brakes...

82
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,240
or swerve.

83
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,249
But the van kept coming at you.

84
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,689
As if it wanted to hit you.

85
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,420
Should we report this to the cops?

86
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,860
Yes. It was black, wasn't it?

87
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Yes.

88
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:28,329
The security camera must have caught it.

89
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,670
It's all right. Don't worry.

90
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,240
I will take care of it.

91
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,709
Be careful...

92
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,850
of your dad and mom.

93
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,889
Actually, let's not report this.

94
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,160
What's wrong?

95
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,388
Thanks to you,

96
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,759
we weren't hit by the van.

97
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Also...

98
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,199
That's true, but...

99
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,939
What's going on?

100
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:11,840
Hyeon U.

101
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:16,879
You see...

102
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,050
Sun Hui!

103
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,689
Sun Hui, are you all right?

104
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,119
Are you hurt?

105
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm all right. I took a tumble, that's all.

106
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,359
Hyeon U had it way worse.

107
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Gosh, Hyeon U.

108
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,469
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

109
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:38,939
Is it serious?

110
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,139
No, I just got some scrapes.

111
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,709
Goodness, your face.

112
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,010
Unbelievable.

113
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,709
This must've startled you.

114
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,479
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,449
We're all right, though.

116
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,640
It's always Choi Sun Hui.

117
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,049
There was a witness...

118
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,120
who saw a black van fleeing the scene.

119
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,589
- And the security footage? - Being checked as we speak.

120
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,270
(Attorney Choi Jin Hyuk)

121
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,309
Are you free to talk?

122
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,250
Maybe you should ask that before entering.

123
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,189
You actually did a stellar job.

124
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,329
There's no need to glare.

125
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,430
I'm here to congratulate you on winning the case.

126
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:19,969
Right.

127
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,370
So that's what you meant.

128
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:26,739
Infringement of copyright...

129
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,809
and violation of the Unfair Competition Prevention Act.

130
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,420
I never doubted your competence,

131
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,229
but I thought that it would be wiser for you...

132
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
to turn down that client.

133
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,729
Don't you worry.

134
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,870
I'll make sure my actions don't cost you anything.

135
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
Gosh.

136
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,750
I can't believe we actually made it this far.

137
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,949
Tell me about it.

138
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:07,949
Is something up?

139
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:12,420
You've always been one to carry the weight by yourself.

140
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,329
What's going on?

141
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,969
It's nothing.

142
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:24,199
Don't bite off more than you can chew...

143
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,199
and let me know if you need help.

144
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,010
A client's calling me at this miserable hour.

145
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
Back when we weren't working so much,

146
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,379
we bumped shoulders all the time to the point it got old.

147
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,348
But now, we don't even have the time to chat.

148
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,349
I'll get going.

149
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,620
Yes?

150
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,859
Yes, it's fine. What's this about?

151
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,160
Thank you.

152
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,760
Detective, to what do we owe this pleasure?

153
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,829
Well, we heard about the hit-and-run.

154
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,040
It wasn't a hit-and-run.

155
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,338
We never filed a report,

156
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,040
and such an event didn't occur.

157
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,239
Right, I see.

158
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,308
That's not why we're here, though.

159
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,520
We actually had some questions for you, Mr. Choi.

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,890
- Me? - Didn't you rent...

161
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
a black van from a rental company?

162
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,660
We verified that you had rented a car.

163
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,458
And?

164
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,458
The black van you had rented was found in the river.

165
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,930
(Can you come out for a second? I'm really scared.)

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,599
Was it identity theft?

167
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,410
No, it was me who rented the van.

168
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,680
Pardon?

169
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,650
In that case, was it you...

170
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,250
Come to my office tomorrow. I'll explain to you as a lawyer.

171
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,489
It's time for you to leave.

172
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,599
Okay.

173
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,679
Is he being serious?

174
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,880
What difference would it make to respond to us tomorrow?

175
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,349
You fool, he's one of the top lawyers.

176
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,359
You think we'd be able to figure it out so easily?

177
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,900
Well, let's wait until tomorrow.

178
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,430
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,670
Goodness.

180
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,729
(Mother)

181
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,250
Hello?

182
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,309
I understand.

183
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:51,129
When you're about to hit someone,

184
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,029
you normally slam down on the brakes...

185
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,829
or swerve.

186
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,439
But the van kept coming at you.

187
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,770
As if it wanted to hit you.

188
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,810
Did Dad try to kill me?

189
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,390
No way. I have to trust my parents.

190
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,489
But what about Gyeong Ho's house that caught on fire...

191
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,799
and the keychain in Dad's car?

192
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,269
Where could Su Yeon be?

193
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,080
Who is the boy in this photo?

194
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,709
What secret are my parents hiding?

195
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,029
I should ask them about everything.

196
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:40,100
I should also trust them.

197
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,380
- Dad. - Choi Sun Hui.

198
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,150
Why did you do it?

199
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,539
- Dad. - Where is it?

200
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,479
Why did you go into the room on the second floor?

201
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:42,989
The photo!

202
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,499
Where is it?

203
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,670
In my bag.

204
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,130
Dad.

205
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:39,120
The boy in the photo.

206
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
Who is he?

207
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,590
I mean,

208
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,560
this is what I'd like to know.

209
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:54,729
Why was there...

210
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,939
a fire at Gyeong Ho's house after Mom had gone there?

211
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,269
Why did I find...

212
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,239
Su Yeon's thing inside your car?

213
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,449
I feel...

214
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,650
very scared.

215
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,660
Please answer me.

216
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,439
I'm...

217
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,910
terribly scared of you two.

218
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,380
What...

219
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:51,320
What are you hiding from me?

220
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:01,999
Sun Hui.

221
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
You know what?

222
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:24,789
I'm scared of you.

223
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,330
Because of you...

224
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,969
- Because of you... - Honey.

225
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:39,900
That's enough.

226
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,259
Sun Hui.

227
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,670
Don't ever...

228
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,739
go inside that room again.

229
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,850
Hello, this is the police.

230
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,850
- I'd like to ask you to cooperate. - Okay.

231
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:38,458
I'm here to check the surveillance camera footage.

232
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,459
One moment, please.

233
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,340
The black van.

234
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,479
- Could you please zoom in? - Zoom in?

235
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,548
Since he came to work,

236
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:10,688
Choi Jin Hyuk never left the office until he went...

237
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:12,590
to see Sun Hui at the hospital.

238
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,430
The question is, who drove the van?

239
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:26,599
Let's check the van leaving the office.

240
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,670
Okay.

241
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Sir.

242
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,299
Sun Hui? What's going on?

243
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:03,269
Let's talk in person. I'll be there soon.

244
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:21,019
(Samok)

245
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,870
Welcome.

246
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,310
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

247
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,870
I was hungry.

248
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,640
Are you uncomfortable at a place like this?

249
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,080
The broth here is excellent.

250
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,189
You seem quite weary.

251
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,799
It's really good like this. Do you want to try?

252
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,810
I...

253
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,209
Try it.

254
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,330
The three-second rule.

255
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,209
Sun Hui.

256
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,110
Smile.

257
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,340
If you smile, things will be fine.

258
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,080
- Okay. - However,

259
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,549
I know that smiling won't solve it.

260
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,930
What's giving you such a hard time?

261
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,529
Sir.

262
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,739
You know about the room on the second floor, right?

263
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,539
Was there a boy...

264
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,640
in my family?

265
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,850
What did your parents tell you?

266
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,150
They didn't tell me anything.

267
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,590
I see.

268
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,229
Didn't abnormal events...

269
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,259
happen around you recently?

270
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,670
Are you all right?

271
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,029
Sir.

272
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:22,810
Are you really my dad's relative?

273
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,810
I'm sorry.

274
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:31,610
Actually...

275
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,028
(Police Officer Kang Hyeong Min)

276
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,160
This is who I am.

277
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,199
A police officer?

278
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,799
I pleaded with your parents...

279
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,299
to pretend to be your relative.

280
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,910
For a long time,

281
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,709
your father and I have been close.

282
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:03,779
And I think that...

283
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,320
he is wearing a mask.

284
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:09,949
What do you mean?

285
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:18,229
What's that?

286
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,180
It's someone's head!

287
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,920
There's someone's head over there.

288
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,630
Where did you find the body?

289
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,360
Over there by the thicket.

290
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,029
Okay.

291
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,630
Did you notice anything else?

292
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,170
I'm not sure.

293
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,709
We found a wallet.

294
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,920
We found the student ID.

295
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
What's the name?

296
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,860
- It's Lee Su Yeon. - "Lee Su Yeon?"

297
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,630
- Lee Su Yeon? - Her name is Lee Su Yeon?

298
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,899
Lee Su Yeon?

299
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,900
(Yunil High School, Lee Su Yeon)

300
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:57,759
Where have you been?

301
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,469
I went to see Hyeon U for a while.

302
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,039
Sun Hui.

303
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,249
Let's talk for a minute.

304
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,870
Sun Hui.

305
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
What is...

306
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:51,049
this?

307
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,319
We wanted to send you abroad after high school,

308
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,549
but many bad things happened recently.

309
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:04,559
Are you telling me to go study abroad all of a sudden?

310
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,360
Once you get there, your dad and I will...

311
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,730
follow you soon.

312
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:12,640
When am I going?

313
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,469
As soon as you're ready.

314
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,679
That fast?

315
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,679
The school year starts in February over there,

316
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,679
so you'd better hurry as much as possible.

317
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,779
Dad...

318
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:28,619
But...

319
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,390
You don't have to go to school anymore.

320
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,560
- I'll be back. - All right.

321
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,940
Sun Hui, I'm sorry.

322
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,569
Don't hate your dad too much.

323
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,239
This is all for you.

324
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,250
That kid in the photo...

325
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:15,299
- Should I fry it? - Sure, why not?

326
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:25,109
He's your older brother.

327
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,250
When you were really young,

328
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,549
before you met your dad and me,

329
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,120
he died in a fire.

330
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:45,128
- Let go of me! - You can't get in.

331
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,398
- You can't go in! - Let go of me!

332
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,599
- Sang Ho! - You can't go in!

333
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,959
- Calm down. - Sang Ho!

334
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,269
- Step back. - Mom is here!

335
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,499
- Move! - It's dangerous.

336
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,639
- Sang Ho! - Sang Ho!

337
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,140
- Calm down! - Sang Ho!

338
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,448
I should have saved him...

339
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:08,819
even if I burned to death.

340
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:14,219
I've been living...

341
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,259
my whole life, regretting that I couldn't do that.

342
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,870
It's a heartbreaking memory for your dad and me.

343
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
So we couldn't tell you, Sun Hui.

344
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,449
Sun Hui.

345
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,819
Do you trust your dad and me?

346
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,330
Your dad and I...

347
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,370
We would do anything...

348
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,500
to protect you.

349
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,180
Mom.

350
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I have a question.

351
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:18,089
That night.

352
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,660
What did you do at Gyeong Ho's place?

353
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,129
When I went to his place that night,

354
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,339
Gyeong Ho was still alive.

355
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
What?

356
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,930
Ms. Ha...

357
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,000
Gyeong Ho!

358
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,969
My goodness.

359
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:10,969
She...

360
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,509
She thinks I'm dead.

361
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,180
Stop talking.

362
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,488
Let me call someone now.

363
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:24,589
You should go.

364
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:27,318
I tried to call an ambulance, but...

365
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,060
I'm fine. Please go.

366
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,100
My parents will be here soon.

367
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,469
Gyeong Ho.

368
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,370
Sun Hui...

369
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:45,569
She didn't do anything wrong.

370
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
That night,

371
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,349
I got out through the back door after getting your phone...

372
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,379
and the math workbook.

373
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,799
I don't know what set the fire.

374
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,310
That's all.

375
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,669
For a long time,

376
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,469
your father and I have been close.

377
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,379
And I think that...

378
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,850
he is wearing a mask.

379
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:34,020
What do you mean?

380
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,149
Did you know...

381
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:38,949
that your father used to be a prosecutor?

382
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,690
No, I didn't know that.

383
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,230
Your father...

384
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,169
is an excellent attorney now.

385
00:40:52,629 --> 00:40:53,899
There is no case he can't settle...

386
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,440
if he wants to.

387
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
I'm sure...

388
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,080
that you are proud of your father.

389
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,480
No matter what happens,

390
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,419
he can cover it up with his power.

391
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,560
And before too...

392
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,529
Before?

393
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:22,399
That room you were curious about...

394
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:24,629
That room belonged...

395
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,669
to their real son.

396
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,239
That son...

397
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,149
died.

398
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:38,680
What?

399
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,850
Do you really want to know about this?

400
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:00,169
About 13 years ago,

401
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:03,009
there was this case that shook the world called,

402
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:05,910
"Gongseo-dong Fire and Kidnapping Case"

403
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,810
It's hard to find an article about that case now.

404
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,810
But it was even on the news.

405
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,819
But the record was deleted.

406
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,819
Somebody must have pressured the media.

407
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,259
He died in that case.

408
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,890
So...

409
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,128
What are you trying to say?

410
00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:31,299
I know it's hard to believe,

411
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:34,100
but your foster father, Choi Jin Hyuk,

412
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:38,009
was obviously the prime suspect.

413
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,640
But he found a way out of it,

414
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:44,850
though I don't know what he did.

415
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,350
In the end,

416
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,790
someone that had nothing to do with the case was caught.

417
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,460
So that's how the case was closed.

418
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,390
You are in a dangerous situation.

419
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,330
Are you aware of that?

420
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,839
And what are the police doing?

421
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,739
They are so slow about this.

422
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,310
Maybe,

423
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,040
someone with power is controlling all this,

424
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:19,750
even when something dangerous is happening around you!

425
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:27,719
Why aren't you asking for help from the police?

426
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,529
Well...

427
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,529
For instance,

428
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,529
if you get killed right now,

429
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,429
I can catch Jin Hyuk red-handed.

430
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,738
I can also make sure that he pays for what he did.

431
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:42,739
However,

432
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:45,040
it would be too late, then.

433
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,810
I can't wait until you get killed!

434
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,850
Sun Hui.

435
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,890
I want...

436
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:01,620
to save you.

437
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:05,759
I want...

438
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:07,960
to protect you.

439
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,739
Just trust me for now.

440
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,949
I hope you don't speak to the other detectives.

441
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,520
You don't know when power can get through.

442
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,949
We all might let him get us again,

443
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
just like that fire case in Gongseo-dong.

444
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,859
I do feel bad for you,

445
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,930
Sun Hui.

446
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,730
But I must catch Jin Hyuk...

447
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:44,830
with my own hands.

448
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,569
Your foster parents...

449
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,910
owe me.

450
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:00,180
Your foster parents...

451
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:04,850
even took away my kid.

452
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,040
We never filed a report,

453
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,839
and such an event didn't occur.

454
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,540
I have...

455
00:45:30,649 --> 00:45:32,310
you and your mom.

456
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,719
And you have Mom and Dad.

457
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,819
As time goes by,

458
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,690
it will all go back to when it was perfect.

459
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,430
Your mom and I will help,

460
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:50,299
so will you follow us?

461
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
The photo!

462
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:00,580
Don't go into this room, no matter what happens.

463
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,120
He's your older brother.

464
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,419
When you were really young,

465
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,560
he died in a fire.

466
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,319
Your foster father, Choi Jin Hyuk,

467
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,529
was obviously the prime suspect.

468
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:22,529
It's a heartbreaking memory for your dad and me.

469
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,739
So we couldn't tell you, Sun Hui.

470
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:30,569
Maybe, someone with power is controlling all this,

471
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:32,569
Do you trust your dad and me?

472
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:45,520
And I think that...

473
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,120
he is wearing a mask.

474
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,730
This is Reporter Park at the scene.

475
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:58,628
The police had filed the runaway of Lee Su Yeon,

476
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,139
a student of Yunil High School,

477
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,440
and searched for her.

478
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:06,108
And the belongings of Lee Su Yeon, the missing student, were found...

479
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:08,940
at the southern end of the Jamsu Bridge riverside.

480
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,309
The police announced that it could be a kidnapping,

481
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,649
and not a simple run away from home.

482
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:16,789
The police say tracking the whereabouts as soon as possible...

483
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,389
is the top priority if it is a kidnapping.

484
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,918
So they will expand the search parameters...

485
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,160
and ask local government agencies to...

486
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,640
(We're Happy to Serve Our Citizens.)

487
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:40,540
Go home first.

488
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,940
Really?

489
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:44,448
You're a newlywed.

490
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:46,109
I don't want your wife to hate me.

491
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,620
- In my day... - Yes, Ji Yeon?

492
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:52,219
I'm done for the day. How about we go to the movies tonight?

493
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:55,759
A Japanese horror movie?

494
00:47:56,629 --> 00:47:58,129
The family falls apart?

495
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:00,629
That sounds interesting.

496
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,830
Okay. I'll see you later.

497
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,169
I love you. Bye.

498
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,469
Goodness. Another movie night?

499
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:11,838
My wife wants to watch this movie.

500
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,539
Is that so? Enjoy.

501
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,580
Will do.

502
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,180
You should also go home.

503
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:20,080

506
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,758
I'll get going. Bye.

507
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:28,060
Go home soon.

508
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,359
Bye.

509
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,120
Do you want some coffee?

510
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,460
Who are you?

511
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,160
Me? Lee Su Yeon.

00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:10,770
"Lee Su Yeon?"

513
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,469

00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:41,339
No one?

560
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,608
- Yes? - Eggs.

561
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:45,710
"Eggs." Many are allergic to eggs too.

562
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:48,319
As for me...

563
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,210
Sun Hui. Have you been well?

564
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,750
Who...

565
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,449
Right.

566
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,089
Yes. Thanks for recognizing my voice.

567
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,819
How did you get my number?

568
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:30,330
Are you curious?

569
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,129
Yes.

570
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,329
Right. It's good to be wary...

571
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,770
in this day and age.

572
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:41,239
You'll be at ease if I tell you the truth.

573
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,669
But I must keep things from you due to some circumstances.

574
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:48,040
Here's one thing I can tell you.

575
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,410
I'm worried about you.

576
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,379
You know...

577
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,919
a lot about my family, right?

578
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,690
Yes.

579
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:05,160
By any chance,

580
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,930
was there another child in this family besides me?

581
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:13,839
So you went to the room on the second floor.

582
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,509
A boy.

583
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:23,310
Call this number if anything happens.

584
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,710
Wait...

585
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,469
(Ji Hyeon U)

586
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:17,168
The number you have dialed cannot be reached.

587
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:18,230
After the tone...

588
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,299
That means Su Yeon could've caused the fire.

589
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:28,879
No.

590
00:55:32,879 --> 00:55:36,180
Su Yeon didn't start the fire.

591
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,989
I didn't tell you so we'd make a report to the police.

592
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:44,330
We can't settle this ourselves, can we?

593
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,500
There's something I simply need to check.

594
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,009
This is everything I can tell you.

595
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,279
Sun Hui.

596
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:05,680
Report to the police,

597
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,520
and...

598
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,549
we can't be friends anymore.

599
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,140
Did you watch "Indulgence" last night?

600
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:30,469
- The drama? - Yes. The main character died.

601
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,469
Seriously?

602
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,580
In a car accident. It was lame.

603
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,410
Wait. All of a sudden?

604
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,409
The main character was uncovering the truth.

605
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,219
And the culprit tried to keep him quiet, so...

606
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,418
The cliche of disguising a murder as a car accident.

607
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:47,060
It's really ridiculous.

608
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,259
There's no time for him to die from an illness.

609
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,100
That's why he died in an accident.

610
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:57,000
Only then does a sudden death not look suspicious.

611
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,229
A car accident must've been...

612
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,500
the most reasonable of all accidental deaths.

613
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,338
Even so,

614
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:06,339
it takes away one's life too easily.

615
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,879
But life is taken away easily.

616
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,180
You sound like you've figured out everything.

617
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:17,588
Watch the news.

618
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:20,088
Thousands of people die from car accidents.

619
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:21,790
So the drama is quite realistic, isn't it?

620
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,190
In short, car accidents can happen at any time?

621
00:57:26,489 --> 00:57:29,858
Is that why car accidents are frequent in dramas?

622
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:33,129
Still, isn't it too much?

623
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,440
(Perfect Family)

624
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:34,430
We must be cautious.

625
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,930
They must be killed quickly.

626
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,699
My mom...

627
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:44,009
Are you scared?

628
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,469
Didn't the detective tell you?

629
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,508
To be careful of your parents.

630
00:58:48,509 --> 00:58:50,109
Excuse me! Wait!

631
00:58:57,419 --> 00:58:58,750
Why are you...

632
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,460
still alive?
