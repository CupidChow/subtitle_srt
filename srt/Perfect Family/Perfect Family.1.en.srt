Why is she at Gyeong Ho's place?

Ta-da!

00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,449
What is all this?

20
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,391
It's a surprise for Sun Hui. What do you think?

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,161
Does it look okay?

22
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,430
My goodness, this one is...

23
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,611
It's horrible.

What?

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,580
What a nice thing to say.

26
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,820
Don't do stuff like this.

27
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,090

Do you also...

What?

33
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,451
I don't know. I'll just go.

Why are you here?

41

You promised me that you wouldn't come.

42
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,590
Why don't you keep your promise?

43
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,391
You are making me miserable!

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000

48
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm in the kitchen.

49
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,921

57

59
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:29,921

61
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:40,661
Gyeong Ho.

62
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,630
I killed Gyeong Ho.

63
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,041
No.

64
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,570
That can't be true.

65
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,551
You would never do something like that. Right?

66
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,551
You didn't do it, right?

I mean...

88
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,181
You know...

- Do you remember me? - You check the list again.

114

- the cold virus is going around. - No. I must have been confused.

No.

126
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,971
There is a high possibility that the plaintiff knows about the note.

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,581
- Make them think... - Spread your arms.

128
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,880
that we aren't aware of the note.

129
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,081
That's right.

130
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,191
It will be nice if we retort when they attack us at the trial.

131
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,120
Right.

I'm sorry.

You look great.

137
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,611
You should get changed too.

138
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Stop it.

139
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,530
I'm going to do it.

140
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,400
All right.

141
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,700
- We'll be late. - Put your arms here.

142
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,140

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,351
They show food labels on the menu.

147
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,820
No, she can't.

148
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,721
I was really shocked then.

149
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,320
I had no idea peanut powder could hurt her like that.

150
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,890
You're right. I was so scared.

151
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,930
Food allergies can kill people.

152
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,731
My mom is still scared too.

153
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,571
Your father is having an awards ceremony tonight.

154
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,200
- Right. - Yet, she still packs this for you.

155
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,471
An awards ceremony?

156
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,010
My gosh, your father is on a whole new level.

157
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,841
Well...

158
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,111
Your family is perfect.

159
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,451
- This is so good. - It's delicious.

160
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,821
Here, you can have more.

161
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,061
I want the eggs.

162
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,760
Isn't it delicious?

163
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,030
Sun Hui, enjoy your meal.

164
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,800
Okay, you too.

165
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,540
You know her?

166
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,509
No. She confused me with another kid.

167
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,550
I see.

168
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,749
Just bring it there and have it.

169

He's the 1st person to win the award for 4 consecutive...

For four consecutive years.

183
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:19,211
As his fellow lawyer, I couldn't be more shocked...

184
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:26,221
I couldn't be more proud. Give him another round of applause.

185
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,331
Isn't a nervous lawyer like him likely to lose the trial?

186
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,361

00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,280
Congratulations.

190
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,411
Thank you.

191
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,839
Gosh, Choi Sun Hui.

192
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,481
You're so popular.

193
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,010
You even got a present for your belated birthday.

194
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,150
Stop teasing me.

195
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,921
Oh, my.

196
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,631
Gosh, I think I know what this is.

197
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,760
- Hey, that's not for you... - Sun Hui.

198
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,330
By the way...

199
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,871
Here you go.

200
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,040
It's for you.

201
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,010
I got it customized.

202
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,580
That's why it took so long.

203
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,221
Gosh, it's beautiful.

204
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,461
Thank you.

205
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,360
I'll get going.

206
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,850
I got rejected.

207
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,050
Well...

208
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:48,991
I see.

209
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:51,691
What?

210
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:53,661
Why do you look relieved?

211
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:57,330
No, that's not true.

212
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:09,411
(Self-Directed Learning Room)

213
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,550
Goodness, I'm starving.

214
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,681
- Sun Hui. - Yes?

215
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:19,721
Let's go.

216
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,221
Let me finish this up.

217
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,560
You're the top student for a reason.

218
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,560
- I'll wait for you there. - Sure.

219
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's go.

220
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:01,391
You still remember how to tie your hair like this.

221
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,570
What?

222
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,371
Don't you remember?

223
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,381
Hey, why are you so short?

224
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,080
Hey!

225
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,000
Look at this.

226
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,901
Isn't it pretty?

227
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,300
People say...

228
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,070
that my dad killed my mom.

229
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,941
But I have no dad.

230
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,010
Do you know why?

231
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,221
Mom started a fire...

232
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,661
and burned down the house.

233
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,790
She also killed Dad,

234
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,201
but don't you find it strange?

235
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,741
I heard that Dad killed Mom,

236
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,500
so when did Mom...

237
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,711
put everything on fire?

238
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,451
I figured it out after thinking hard about it.

239
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,850
Mom didn't start a fire...

240
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,721
just once.

241
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:37,461
Mom kept putting things on fire,

242
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,530
so Dad got angry.

243
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,760
He killed Mom,

244
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,030
and he also killed himself.

245
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,770
I wonder what it feels like...

246
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,110
to burn.

247
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,141
Will you tell me?

248
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,109
Why you...

249
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,181
- You know what? - What?

250
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,350
Here's another thing that people told me.

251
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,901
They said...

252
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,441
that I'm a chip off the old block.

253
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:24,701
Boo!

254
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:33,881
Those darn cowards.

255
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,481
Su Yeon.

256
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,749
What if they tell on you to the teacher?

257
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,161
It's okay.

258
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,431
- Which color do you like? - Yellow.

259
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,141
Yellow.

260
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:05,510
It's done.

261
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,290
By the way,

262
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,760
do you have...

263
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,090
a mom and dad?

264
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,530
Mom died,

265
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:24,800
and Dad is still alive.

266
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,330
But I don't know where he is.

267
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,610
I see.

268
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,181
I have never seen...

269
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,850
- my mom or dad. - What?

270
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:43,550
I made up the story about my dad...

271
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,790
- burning my mom to death. - Are you kidding?

272
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,520
Before coming here,

273
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,290
I was abandoned.

274
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,330
Sun Hui.

275
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,871
Do you miss your dad?

276
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,701
I don't know.

277
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,911
One winter day...

278
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:13,010
Since that day, we always stayed together.

279
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,280
It was like having a little sister, so I was happy.

280
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:23,161
No, do it faster and harder.

281
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:28,860
No, don't scratch it so slowly.

282
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:31,131
Faster and harder.

283
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,070
I'm scared.

284
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,131
There's nothing to be scared of.

285
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,201
Watch carefully. Fast.

286
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,241
And hard.

287
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:45,711
Here, give it a try.

288
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,121
Try it again.

289
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,721
Fast and hard.

290
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,090
Gosh!

291
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,130
Good job.

292
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:02,731
I also taught you how to light a match.

293
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,030
Here you go.

294
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,171
Why are you giving it to me?

295
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,871
I'm getting adopted tomorrow.

296
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:16,381
Like the others, I'll have a mom and dad too.

297
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,881
Su Yeon, you should get ready.

298
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,651
What?

299
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:28,421
Goodbye. Take care.

300
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:30,891
Come here.

301
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,881
I'm glad to see you happy.

302
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,310
Me too.

303
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,020
I'm glad to see you happy.

304
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,121
I'm living with a girl whom I met at the orphanage.

305
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:06,991
What?

306
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:10,030
Didn't you get adopted?

307
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,030
Remember how I got injured?

308
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,631
So my adoption got canceled.

309
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,371
Really? Where did you get injured?

310
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:20,310
You didn't know?

311
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:23,941
No.

312
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,850
If I had been adopted then,

313
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:35,020
would I have been living happily like you?

314
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,040
You can be happy from now on.

315
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,871
I'll help you.

316
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,211
Okay.

317
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,381
- Promise me that you'll help me. - I promise.

318
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:12,391
To celebrate becoming friends again,

319
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,661
give me this as a present.

320
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,431
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

321
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:26,010
- But that's... - What's wrong?

322
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,840
I can't have it?

323
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,090
Hey, did she explain why?

324
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:51,431
She'll go out with someone only after high school.

325
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,671
- She's too busy for a boyfriend. - I see.

326
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,500
Really?

327
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,270
Why are you smiling?

328
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,280
I didn't smile.

329
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,080
I just saw you smile. Tell me the truth.

330
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,580
It's just that...

331
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,891
Sun Hui is no different.

332
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,621
What about her?

333
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,191
Everyone says that when they reject someone.

334
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,201
Then they always go out with someone else.

335
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,030
It's so banal.

336
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:35,711
We may think that,

337
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:37,580
but Sun Hui is different.

338
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,350
I know her.

339
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:41,711
I bet she was telling you the truth.

340
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:45,820
She leads a busy life like she's afraid of missing something.

341
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,360
That's probably why she's too busy to go out with you.

342
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,491
Right?

343
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:56,461
I still have hope, right?

344
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,471
Hey, Hyeon U.

345
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:04,099
Where's my birthday present? I got you one, didn't I?

346
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,201
Sorry about that.

347
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:08,210
I mean it when I say I forgot. I'll get you one later.

348
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,580
You forgot?

349
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,680
How can you forget your friend's birthday?

350
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:14,880
I'll get you a gift later.

351
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,620
Later? Hey, get back here.

352
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,151
Later when?

353
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I promise.

354
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:22,319
Fine, but remember that Gyeong Ho saw you promise me.

355
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
You know I always keep my word.

356
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:24,961
Promise me.

357
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,759
- Whatever. - Hold on.

358
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,100
- Don't be dramatic. - What do you mean?

359
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,381
Is it good?

360
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,151
Of course, it's delicious.

361
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,290
Sun Hui?

362
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,260
Oh, right. It's delicious.

363

366

(Lee Su Yeon)

367
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,201
Dad, I need you.

368
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,770
I provide free round-the-clock advice.

369
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,840
Here. It's only for my daughter, though.

370
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,750
I'd love to be as eloquent as you.

371
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:32,820
Thanks for saying so.

372
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,921
Who are you finding it hard to talk to?

373
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,931
No way.

374
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,191
That's so cool.

375
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:50,600
There's a new transfer student.

376
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,110
I want to get to know her better,

377
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,940
and it seems as though she wants that too.

378
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,010
Go on.

379
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,750
But how should I put it...

380
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:07,320
For some reason, I find her unapproachable.

381
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:11,320
Unapproachable? I wonder why.

382
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,560
With Hyeon U and Gyeong Ho,

383
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,930
I don't have to ask to know what they're thinking.

384
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,701
That's how it is with teenage boys.

385
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,671
Were you like that too?

386
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:26,640
Every group has an exception,

387
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,810
and I was always different from others.

388
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,780
In a good way?

389
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:54,570
What? Is it not open today?

390
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,840
Su Yeon!

391
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,340
Hey.

392
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,350
Did the boss say he'll be closing for the day?

393
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,221
Su Yeon, didn't you know?

394
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,360
Our boss put the property on the market and fled.

395
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,621
What?

396
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:19,960
He closed the shop and took off...

397
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,260
to pay off his gambling debt.

398
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,759
Then what about our paychecks?

399
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,060
We get nothing, of course.

400
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:29,401
No wonder he was being nice to us yesterday.

401
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,401
He told us to take the leftover meat and side dishes.

402
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,340
Darn it.

403
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,940
He was just making us clear out the trash.

404
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:39,810
- Gosh. - I...

405
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,049
- Darn. - I didn't even receive...

406
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,080
last month's paycheck.

407
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,550
What?

408
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,349
I can't believe he took off when he barely paid you enough.

409
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,320
Darn, that piece of trash.

410
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,860
What now?

411
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,030
Gosh.

412
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,300
Did you write that girl a letter?

413
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,911
Gosh, not yet.

414
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,480
I should get around to it,

415
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,820
but I don't know what I should write.

416
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:21,791
Right. Give it more thought.

417
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:25,220
Even those you find hard to talk to...

418
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:27,230
may easily understand your words when put in writing.

419
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,931
Got it.

420
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:37,069
Should we keep doing that when I'm in high school now?

421
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,971
Why are you being self-conscious?

422
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,840
Su Yeon, we're off to get snacks. Would you like to come?

423
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:46,751
No.

424
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,081
Oh, right. Sure.

425
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,980
Sun Hui.

426
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,181
I need to buy supplies for class.

427
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,550
Well...

428
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,891
Can you lend me some money?

429
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,460
I'll pay you right back once I get paid.

430
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:34,190
Gosh, Su Yeon. What did you say?

431
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,760
Was that on purpose?

432
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,201
To annoy me?

433
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,799
Of course not. I had my earphones on, and...

434
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,030
I need to borrow some money! There, do you hear me now?

435
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,010
I don't have any cash on me today.

436
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,650
Sorry.

437
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,351
Can I borrow some tomorrow?

438
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,920
Sure.

439
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,140
(Transportation, Cell phone,)

440
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:21,811
(Textbooks, Supplies, Rent, Utility bills)

441
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,951
I'm home.

442
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,721
- Hey. - What's up? Are you studying?

443
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,820
As if.

444
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,101
Hey, what if I dropped out of school?

445
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,061
What is it this time around?

446
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,440
Well, it costs a lot to put myself through school,

447
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,840
and I can't be bothered to make friends.

448
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:57,940
If only you had listened to me.

449
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,880
I said financial aid wouldn't cover all the costs.

450
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:04,780
It still costs a lot to study at a general private school.

451
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,319
But you said you had a friend...

452
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,990
who was a student there...

453
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:12,360
and insisted on enrolling.

454
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,360
It's not how I expected it'd be.

455
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,931
In what way? Doesn't she remember you?

456
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,170
It's not that.

457
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,811
She finds me uncomfortable.

458
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,210
But you said she was your best friend.

459
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,480
She was when we were kids.

460
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,351
Got it.

461
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,420
- Hey! - This way.

462
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,060
Go ahead. I'll push.

463
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:49,390
Come on!

464
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,730
Got it.

465
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:17,891
She was the only friend I had.

466
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,790
Then work more part-time jobs.

467
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,700
You have to graduate somehow.

468
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,100
- Gosh. - Hey. What was that for?

469
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,529
You think you can take me on?

470
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,100
- Really? - Ouch.

471
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,101
Gosh.

472
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,590
Hey, Su Yeon.

473
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,721
Oh, hey.

474
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:19,121
What's this?

475
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,951
Money.

476
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,521
I know.

477
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,089
So why are you giving me this?

478
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,891
I'll tell you why I must give this money to you,

479
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,701
so listen up.

480
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,630
Don't you dare bully Sun Hui.

481
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,041
I won't let it slide.

482
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,110
What?

483
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:48,550
Is that what she said? Did she say I've been bullying her?

484
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,850
That's none of your business.

485
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,491
Just let me know if you need more.

486
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,050
I'll give you the money.

487
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,540
- What? - What?

488
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:13,300
Someone stop them! My gosh.

489
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,311
Take your money, you jerk.

490
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,751
- What... - What's going on?

491
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,221
Hey, do you see me as some common beggar?

492
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,021
What?

493
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,190
You cow.

494
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,900
Su Yeon.

495
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,130
What...

496
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,871
Su Yeon!

497
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,061
Sun Hui.

498
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,529
- Hey, Gyeong Ho. - Hi, Ms. Ha.

499
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,601
- Hop in. I'll drive you. - Sure.

500
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,190
That annoying cow.

501
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Doesn't Sun Hui annoy you as well?

502
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,169
Hey, Su Yeon.

503
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,209
I heard you transferred from Omok High School.

504
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,811
You made quite the name for yourself there.

505
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,041
That reminds me.

506
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,680
I heard you tried to take Sun Hui's money...

507
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:00,311
and got into it with Gyeong Ho.

508
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,109
Choi Sun Hui.

509
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,720
She sure is annoying, isn't she?

510
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:07,951
She's wealthy, a model student,

511
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,690
and even has a handsome bodyguard.

512
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:16,930
If you think about it, she's kind of allowed to be a snob.

513
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,561
- Right? - Totally.

514
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:21,871
You two blabber way too much.

515
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,641
What?

516
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,311
What are you trying to say?

517
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,541
Well,

518
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,510
if she's getting on your nerves,

519
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,951
we could teach her a lesson.

520
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,751
It'll be to commemorate our new friendship. What do you say?

521
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,721
Forget it.

522
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,420
But why? It's not like you have any friends.

523
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,791
We'll hang out with you.

524
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,230
I don't need this.

525
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,831
"I don't need this."

526
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,001
Freak.

527
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,100
But I don't have the time for that.

528
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,971
- You should make time. - I mean it.

529
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,040
It'll be just for today and only for 30 minutes.

530
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,779
- Sounds good. - Thirty minutes.

531
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,280
Aren't you in the best of shape today?

532
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:09,780
No, but 30 minutes...

533
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:12,650
And go.

534
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,721
This is...

535
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,959
- Slow and steady. - Try to keep up.

536
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,661
Right, slow and steady.

537
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,931
One, two.

538
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,541
(Yunil High School)

539
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,070
I'm leaving if you have nothing to say.

540
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,241
Wait.

541
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,581
Listen, I...

542
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,820
I'm sorry.

543
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,331
I misunderstood and crossed the line.

544
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:29,561
That...

545
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,431
hurt you.

546
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,400
I'm sorry.

547
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,701
- Su Yeon. - Hey.

548
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,471
Shall we go to the snack bar?

549
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,811
All right.

550
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,840
You're not angry anymore, right?

551
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,550
I'm not.

552
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,121
Let's go.

553
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,221
Gyeong Ho may be hot-tempered and immature,

554
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,760
but he's not that bad.

555
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,530
Did you tell him to apologize?

556
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,800
Yes. After all, I was the cause of it.

557
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,009
- Why? - Kick it!

558
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,339
- Hey! - Keep kicking it!

559
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,850
Kick it!

560
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,750
- Hey! - Kick it, will you?

561
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,750
- Look at the ball! - Kick it!

562
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:02,221
- Let's go! - Come on!

563
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,190
Hey.

564
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:11,030
What is it?

565
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:14,730
Do you like Sun Hui?

566
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:17,201
What? Me?

567
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,070
No way. That's ridiculous.

568
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,570
It's obvious.

569
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:24,840
Stop joking around.

570
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,251
Have you confessed to her?

571
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:32,550
I don't like her, okay?

572
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,851
There's no reason for me to confess.

573
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,791
- Is it because of Gyeong Ho? - What has he got to do with this?

574
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:43,061
Then it's fine.

575
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,831
Seriously, pass it!

576
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,670
Sun Hui and Gyeong Ho's families...

577
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,610
are on a whole different level.

578
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:57,980
Is that so?

579
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,110
Sun Hui's father is a famous lawyer.

580
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,480
Gyeong Ho's father is a renowned painter.

581
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,050
My family runs an ordinary dry cleaner.

582
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:13,221
A child doesn't choose their parents.

583
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,260
And what about a dry cleaner?

584
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,339
So you won't give it a shot...

585
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,701
because your parents are not as famed as theirs.

586
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,741
Then, a person from an orphanage with no parents...

587
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,380
shouldn't even dream about dating.

588
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,331
(Myunghyeon Academy)

589
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,900
Sun Hui.

590
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,001
Su Yeon?

591
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,640
(Rising Grade 10 Presentation for Current Grade 9 Students)

592
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,681
- What brought you here? - I have something to tell you.

593
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:08,549
Can you spare a moment?

594
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:12,180
(Rising Grade 10 Presentation for Current Grade 9 Students)

595
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:13,251
Sure.

596
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,550
Su Yeon.

597
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:50,391
What is it that you want to tell me?

598
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,780
It's something you must know.

599
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,210
What is it?

600
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:19,221
Remember I told you I couldn't get adopted because I got hurt?

601
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:21,550
Yes.

602
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,561
Guess where and how much I got hurt.

603
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,190
And why.

604
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,190
What?

605
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,440
Look.

606
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,811
Medical treatment for burns is expensive.

607
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,480
So who would adopt someone...

608
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:53,951
looking like this?

609
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,661
Now, how did I end up with this burn?

610
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,931
Shall I tell you?

611
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,101
Shall I tell you...

612
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,971
what you've done to me?

613
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:31,291
I can't forget that day.

614
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,590
It was the day...

615
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,561
before I was going to get adopted.

616
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,300
If Su Yeon also leaves,

617
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,300
I'll be left all alone again.

618
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,550
Fire.

619
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:20,459
Fire.

620
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,400
- The fire is spreading! - Kids.

621
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,400
- It's really bad. - Kids.

622
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,300
Is everyone here? Is everyone safe?

623
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,570
- Yes. - Nobody is missing, right?

624
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,280
Gather around.

625
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,110
Because my adoptive parents were to get me early in the morning,

626
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,650
I was sleeping in a different room than usual...

627
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,991
and couldn't escape in time.

628
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,060
Over here! Please help!

629
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:48,230
It's bad. We need more support!

630
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:58,770
Kids, are you all right?

631
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,271
Is anyone hurt?

632
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:11,581
Sun Hui.

633
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:08,109
"Once upon a time,"

634
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,910
"there was a beautiful statue of a smiling prince in a village."

635
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:12,979
(Epilogue)

636
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,580
"His whole body was made of gold,"

637
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:17,210
"his eyes were sapphires,"

638
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,780
"and his sword had gems like rubies."

639
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,720
"When winter was just around the corner,"

640
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:26,120
"a swallow flew..."

641
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:27,990
"to the prince's foot..."

642
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,791
"and decided to take a rest."

643
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,930
"While the swallow was resting,"

644
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:34,271
"water dropped onto it."

645
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:38,471
"And that droplet of water was the prince's tears."

646
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,971
"'I can see...'"

647
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,311
"'countless sadness on the streets.'"

648
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,480
"'That child over there is sick.'"

649
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,181
"'But he is too poor to buy medicine.'"

650
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,420
"'Dear swallow. Can you give...'"

651
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:59,621
"'the ruby on my sword to that child?'"

652
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,460
"As the prince asked,"

653
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,061
"the swallow took the ruby to the child."

654
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:12,170
"After that, the prince asked the swallow..."

655
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,241
"to take his sapphire eyes..."

656
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,479
"to the talented yet poor young man..."

657
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,840
"and the little match girl."

658
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,210
"The prince lost both of his eyes."

659
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:28,420
"And yet, the prince spoke with joy."

660
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,291
"'I'm all right.'"

661
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,061
"'As long as...'"

662
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,790
"'they can become happy with them.'"

663
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:39,459
"Upon hearing that, the swallow didn't leave for Egypt."

664
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,730
"It decided to become the prince's eyes."

665
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,570
"'Thank you, dear swallow.'"

666
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:48,610
"'Can you take the gold on my body...'"

667
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:52,811
"'and give it to the people in need?'"

668
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:55,280
"When winter came,"

669
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,279
"the swallow froze stiff..."

670
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,681
"and couldn't move."

671
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:02,750
"'Prince.'"

672
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,720
"'I was happy...'"

673
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:07,190
"'to be of help.'"

674
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,129
"With those words, it used its last strength..."

675
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,130
"to give the prince a kiss,"

676
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,300
"and died."

677
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,831
"Crack."

678
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:19,270
"At that moment,"

679
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:21,510
"the prince's heart couldn't handle the sadness..."

680
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,411
"and broke into pieces."

681
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:25,811
"An angel brought..."

682
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,110
"the prince's heart and the swallow."

683
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,779
"When the deity saw them,"

684
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,081
"he was very pleased and nodded."

685
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:38,021
"The prince and the swallow went to paradise..."

686
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,920
"and lived happily ever after."

687
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,670
(Perfect Family)

688
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,820
Will we...

689
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,890
be able to get along well again?

690
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:48,991
Take one for us too.

691
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,830
Hey!

692
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,129
- Fate? - Don't you have a thing...

693
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,299
with Su Yeon?

694
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,670
I wouldn't like anyone but Sun Hui.

695
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,800
It's all because of you!

696
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,070
Su Yeon?

697
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,410
This is the very moment to pay back the debt.

698
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:03,541
It's okay.

699
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,240
I'll take care of it.

700
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,851
- The whole family was found dead. - What happened...

701
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,780
yesterday?
