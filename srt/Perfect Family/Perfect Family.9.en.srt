(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

11
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,651
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

12
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,791
I told you that my child was taken away from me.

13
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:58,361
That was you, Sun Hui.

14
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,772
Your parents killed their son.

15
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:05,972
And they tried to impute it to me.

16
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:08,272
They were scared that the truth would be revealed.

17
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,942
And so...

18
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,840
they adopted you...

19
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,210
as a hostage to seal my mouth.

20
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,382
Sun Hui!

21
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,261
Come on.

22
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:32,662
(Episode 9)

23
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:34,731
What backstory...

24
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,102
does your family have?

25
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,412
The one who stabbed Detective Lee...

26
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,522
was likely Choi Hyun Min.

27
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:52,722
"Choi Hyun Min?"

28
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,151
Who is he?

29
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,532
That jerk killed our son.

30
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:06,131
He served 12 years in jail for that.

31
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:08,131
But he's not sorry about it.

32
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,432
Rather than reflecting,

33
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,241
he blackmailed us.

34
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,011
If we didn't meet his demands,

35
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,152
he said he would kill Sun Hui.

36
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:30,861
Drive safely.

37
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,391
- Bye. - Have a good day.

38
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,352
After his release from prison, he came to see us.

39
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,391
Ms. Ha, it's been a while.

40
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:13,972
What about Jin Hyuk?

41
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,372
Has he been well?

42
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:22,312
That horrifying face of his that I never once forgot...

43
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:25,782
was right there in front of me.

44
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:29,412
I was petrified...

45
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:32,021
and froze on the spot.

46
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,981
It's been a while, Jin Hyuk.

47
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:15,361
I'm curious...

48
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,162
as to what you're planning.

49
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:21,472
Is she your hostage?

50
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,741
Is this payback?

51
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:29,272
Well, tough luck.

52
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,380
Those tricks don't work on me.

53
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,412
Sun Hui...

54
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,212
is my daughter.

55
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:42,921
Unbelievable.

56
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,991
I don't get you at all.

57
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:48,861
Are the privileged...

58
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,631
generous to a fault?

59
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:57,772
Fine.

60
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,311
Have a happy life, then.

61
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,511
There isn't a parent...

62
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,481
who'd block their child's happiness,

63
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,121
but how much...

64
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,931
will you pay me?

65
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,712
Wouldn't Sun Hui want to know...

66
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:40,381
about her biological father and about what he did...

67
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,352
to her adoptive parents?

68
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,421
Why did they adopt...

69
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,022
the daughter of their mortal enemy?

70
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,921
If it were me, I'd definitely want to know.

71
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:06,671
Did that hurt?

72
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:08,972
Sorry about that.

73
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:12,681
You asked for it by not saying anything!

74
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:25,762
Sun Hui...

75
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,662
will be left in the dark.

76
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,462
Together,

77
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:36,532
we'll make sure of it.

78
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,142
Got it?

79
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,852
And the night Gyeong Ho's house burned down...

80
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:24,512
Goodness.

81
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,981
This is quite the scene.

82
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,452
I was tailing Sun Hui...

83
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,621
but stumbled onto this.

84
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,491
It was me.

85
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,931
I did this. It was me.

86
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,761
Whether it was you or Sun Hui,

87
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,001
it's still wrong either way.

88
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,602
Getting mixed up in this...

89
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:50,741
will be a hassle.

90
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,212
I'll clean things up here.

91
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:00,611
However,

92
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,981
you will pay me extra for my services.

93
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,092
Don't worry and go home.

94
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,401
Go on before the homeowners return.

95
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,202
Do you want Sun Hui...

96
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:30,141
to be a murderer?

97
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:33,712
No.

98
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,410
No...

99
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,651
Then get lost!

100
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,530
I wasn't in my right mind at the time.

101
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:57,741
And like that,

102
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,472
I did as ordered.

103
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:10,312
Gosh. Thanks for the ride.

104
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,352
Honey, don't forget...

105
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,921
to pay our driver generously.

106
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:18,121
Goodness, you're plastered.

107
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,261
I drove us home, remember?

108
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,861
Snap out of it, will you?

109
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:47,251
Do you want Sun Hui to be a murderer?

110
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,461
Around 1am this morning, a fire broke out...

111
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,792
in a residential area in Ian-dong, Hanseo-gu, Seoul.

112
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,561
It is especially saddening...

113
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:01,730
that the whole family was found dead,

114
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,871
including the famous artist, Park Ki Yeon,

115
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:05,741
who was sleeping at home.

116
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,370
The police have requested the National Forensic Service...

117
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,371
to identify how the fire started...

118
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,381
and perform an autopsy on the deceased.

119
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,980
They're also investigating the possibility of arson...

120
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,010
by analyzing...

121
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,182
surveillance camera footage from residential areas.

122
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:20,682
We turn to Reporter Kim So Hyun at the site for more details.

123
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,991
Something horrendous happened,

124
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,161
but I tried my best to stay calm.

125
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,092
I needed Sun Hui to keep her composure.

126
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,001
Did you have nightmares?

127
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,151
Who is it?

128
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,552
I'm Soo Yeon, Sun Hui's friend.

129
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,861
Soo Yeon, it's you.

130
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,432
Sun Hui's home, right?

131
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:07,361
I'm afraid she's feeling under the weather today,

132
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,771
and we have a guest.

133
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,741
- Maybe next time... - I must see her!

134
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:15,371
It won't take long.

135
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:16,812
Please.

136
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:27,952
What?

137
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:29,952
Sun Hui...

138
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,521
stabbed him?

139
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:39,832
Jin Hyuk, come on. Don't lose your cool.

140
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,101
The last thing I want...

141
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:45,541
is for her to go to prison or be in and out...

142
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,672
of juvenile detention.

143
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:50,341
I set fire to that house to protect her...

144
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,042
and Ms. Ha.

145
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,980
That means, there's added service you must pay for.

146
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,750
- You punk! - Please lower your voice.

147
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,082
Sun Hui will hear you.

148
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,092
Hush. Quiet.

149
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,462
What about that friend who went to Sun Hui's room?

150
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:13,360
When I got to the house, Gyeong Ho was already...

151
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,500
Let's call the police.

152
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,572
No, the police can't be involved.

153
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,271
I may have set the fire,

154
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,212
but my dash cam footage...

155
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:24,481
shows Sun Hui fleeing Gyeong Ho's house covered in blood.

156
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:26,911
Ms. Ha going in and out...

157
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,911
of Gyeong Ho's house at night...

158
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,722
got caught on camera.

159
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,932
Whom will the police suspect?

160
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,472
Things got messy,

161
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,241
but they must be sorted out by all means.

162
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,501
While you're living happily after getting adopted,

163
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,202
my life became less than trash...

164
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,842
because of you.

165
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,211
Now is the time to pay me back.

166
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,611
- There's an accomplice in here. - Sun Hui.

167
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:38,822
The accomplice is...

168
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,621
threatening Sun Hui right now.

169
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,092
Your dad is a successful lawyer.

170
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,521
Wouldn't he do anything to protect you?

171
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,531
He'll definitely sort it out...

172
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,832
as long as you turn yourself in.

173
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,771
I can't do it.

174
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:00,141
- This will be difficult. - What?

175
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,442
- I... - You're the culprit.

176
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,281
Not only did you kill Gyeong Ho,

177
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,082
but you also killed his parents!

178
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:18,261
Get ready to go to the police station now.

179
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:28,731
Mr. Choi.

180
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,271
Are you already done talking?

181
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,072
- Pardon? - Are you about to leave?

182
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,082
Sun Hui and I have somewhere to go.

183
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:40,881
Where would Sun Hui go? She's sick.

184
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,281
Where are you going?

185
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,651
Shall I give you a ride?

186
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:50,021
No, it's okay.

187
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,031
Goodbye.

188
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,121
Is this your car key?

189
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:28,932
Let me use it.

190
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,131
I didn't bring my car today.

191
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,731
It'll become a pain in the neck unless we handle it quickly.

192
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:38,972
What?

193
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:46,881
Honey.

194
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:10,331
Why did you start the fire?

195
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:12,302
Who's the one that put me in this misery?

196
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,171
After accusing me of being a murderer,

197
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,482
you want Sun Hui to become a murderer too?

198
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,982
Do you want people to curse at Sun Hui...

199
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:25,680
for being a murderer like her father?

200
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:28,421
Don't be ridiculous. Sun Hui is my daughter!

201
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,431
Hey, think about it.

202
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,861
What should a parent do in a situation like this?

203
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,332
Try to protect her this time.

204
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,671
Instead of watching your child die in front of you...

205
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,572
like last time.

206
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:23,441
I couldn't resist it.

207
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:26,441
My sense of justice was questioned.

208
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:29,951
I didn't know what to do...

209
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,881
as my judgment became unclear.

210
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:38,961
What could I do for my daughter?

211
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:44,562
I had no idea.

212
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,131
I don't deserve to be a father.

213
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:04,111
(Peanut powder)

214
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,151
What's the matter with him?

215
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,252
How could he threaten Sun Hui?

216
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:13,221
I think he's trying to warn us.

217
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,961
Still, he can't do this to Sun Hui.

218
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:21,931
Honey, I feel very worried.

219
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,671
Lower your voice. Sun Hui shouldn't hear us.

220
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,282
I gave him the money,

221
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,512
so let's wait.

222
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,921
We should hurry and send Sun Hui abroad.

223
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:41,921
That man is threatening us again.

224
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,762
What don't you and Sun Hui go to Canada first?

225
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:50,131
What if he follows us there?

226
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,231
He will harass us until the end.

227
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:54,931
Sun Hui will be in danger.

228
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,131
We must protect her.

229
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:02,371
Didn't you say...

230
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:06,941
that he has the same allergy as Sun Hui?

231
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,322
I have the ingredient in the kitchen.

232
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:20,792
Will you really do it?

233
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:24,261
Yes. We have no choice.

234
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:26,400
We must not act rashly.

235
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,401
What if...

236
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:31,232
he tells everything to Sun Hui?

237
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,940
We can't let him interact with Sun Hui anymore.

238
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:37,042
It's only a matter of time.

239
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,552
Either way, we must be careful.

240
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,880
We must kill him now!

241
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,252
Please calm down.

242
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:55,062
Sun Hui?

243
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:08,671
I even thought...

244
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:14,680
of killing him knowing...

245
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,681
what allergy he had.

246
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,151
We can...

247
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:29,361
no longer bear it.

248
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:36,171
I understand.

249
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,611
Where is Sun Hui?

250
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:00,420
Special forces have been deployed.

251
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,891
Sun Hui will be safe.

252
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:05,691
Got it.

253
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,512
Choi Hyun Min is calling me.

254
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:32,881
Please buy us time.

255
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,191
(Choi Hyun Min)

256
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:40,022
What are you going to do?

257
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,161
I'm driving.

258
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:44,561
I'm on my way. Wait a little longer.

259
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:45,762
Are you trying to buy time?

260
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,871
You aren't trying to pull a trick, are you?

261
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:53,471
How's Sun Hui?

262
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:25,141
- Sun Hui. - Sun Hui.

263
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,482
What's the situation?

264
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:09,281
We confirmed the hostage and Choi Hyun Min's identity.

265
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:10,381
How's Sun Hui?

266
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:12,880
Is she all right?

267
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,822
Yes, she's all right.

268
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,621
That punk is his accomplice.

269
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:21,522
He won't tell us how many more of them there are.

270
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:26,231
We identified the suspect and the hostage,

271
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,232
but aiming isn't easy due to obstacles.

272
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:32,842
Wait here.

273
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:38,681
I'll go.

274
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:42,681
- There's no time. At this rate... - Mr. Choi.

275
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:45,082
The situation is very dangerous.

276
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,120
I don't want more people to get hurt.

277
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:49,522
I'm Sun Hui's dad.

278
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,092
Please let me go. I must save her.

279
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:05,302
Detective.

280
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,111
Do you have a child?

281
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,312
Yes, I do.

282
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:17,911
So you understand.

283
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:23,022
I'm willing to die to protect Sun Hui.

284
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:33,762
Okay.

285
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,171
Darn it.

286
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:42,742
In the end,

287
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,641
it became miserable for us.

288
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:49,552
To rich people like them, you're only a toy...

289
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,381
to play with for a while.

290
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,052
They use you as much as they want,

291
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:59,661
and you get abandoned in the end.

292
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:00,822
No.

293
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:07,061
My parents would never do that.

294
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:08,572
How can you still say that?

295
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:12,441
I don't blame you. You probably want to believe it.

296
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,411
They're your parents, after all.

297
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:28,852
Choi Hyun Min!

298
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:30,992
Dad.

299
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,391
This is unbelievable timing.

300
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,691
Your dad must be here for you.

301
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:52,381
Gosh, I didn't think you'd come.

302
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:54,981
You brought the money as promised, yes?

303
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,381
I brought the money.

304
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,381
Let Sun Hui go as promised.

305
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:14,631
Let Sun Hui go.

306
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,631
Do you really want to take her with you?

307
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:22,911
How shameless!

308
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:33,651
My gosh.

309
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:36,151
What do you want me to do?

310
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:44,232
What do you think you are doing?

311
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,131
You know what?

312
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,701
I don't think I want the money.

313
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:57,711
I realized that I wanted to take revenge on rich people like you.

314
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,411
You know that...

315
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:01,411
Choi Hyun Min?

316
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:11,752
When I see rich people like you acting righteous,

317
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:16,361
poor people like me start to have a twisted mind.

318
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,032
We are both born as humans.

319
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:22,572
We use the same names. But you and I are different...

320
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:26,272
no matter what we do!

321
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:51,161
Sun Hui!

322
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,802
We have a situation. The hostage is approaching the suspect.

323
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,401
What on earth happened?

324
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:50,411
Stay away from me!

325
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,022
What a stupid daughter...

326
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:02,651
Sun Hui, you...

327
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:45,631
A puppy.

328
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,431
A puppy? A barbershop.

329
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:50,072
A calf.

330
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:54,141
- An earthworm. - An earthworm.

331
00:33:58,611 --> 00:33:59,681
Giddy-up!

332
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,252
Giddy-up!

333
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:28,201
There. I got it!

334
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:30,841
I...

335
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:33,442
surely...

336
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:36,112
loved this child.

337
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,951
It's cold now. Have it, Sun Hui.

338
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,091
- Is it good? - Yes, it's good.

339
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:56,732
Here.

340
00:34:57,402 --> 00:35:00,042
Okay. That's enough.

341
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:08,641
That's so refreshing.

342
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:10,712
Hey, Sun Hui!

343
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:14,152
I was so happy with you.

344
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,792
But why...

345
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:20,462
Come here, you naughty girl.

346
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:22,991
Why did things turn out like this?

347
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:26,732
- Hey, I got you! - No.

348
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,172
How did things...

349
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:33,801
go so wrong...

350
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,071
for me?

351
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,002
Dad... Dad!

352
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:53,411
Are you okay?

353
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:02,051
Sun Hui!

354
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,591
- Sun Hui. - Mom...

355
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:20,042
- Dad... - It's all right.

356
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:23,942
Dad...

357
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:26,042
It's all right, Sun Hui.

358
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,301
(Munsan Grocery Store)

359
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:04,911
What are you looking at?

360
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:06,681
Let's go now.

361
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:42,922
Who is it?

362
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,321
Mom, it's me.

363
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:49,731
What brought you here?

364
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,862
How heartless. Your son is here after a long time.

365
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,002
She's Sun Hui, my daughter.

366
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,371
Please take care of her.

367
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:02,441
I have to go somewhere.

368
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,542
And I need some money.

369
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,321
Take care of her? What do you mean by that?

370
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:21,292
Where is her mother?

371
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:28,501
She's dead.

372
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:30,102
The doctor killed her.

373
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:38,442
How can that happen when she is so young?

374

Shut it! Give me money!

375
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,161

380

I'll be back soon.

381

- Go faster. - No, not that way.

That was so close.

405
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,982
I almost had it there.

406
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:35,821
If only it got in one step ahead, I would have won.

407
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:38,621
Speaking of which, honey...

408
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:40,422
Could you lend me some money?

409
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:44,732
What? She hung up on me?

410
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:47,800
What a rude wench!

411
00:43:47,801 --> 00:43:49,161
I'm going to kill her...

They're not the same kind. But you've got a record here.

427
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:45,212
Prosecutor, this is so unfair.

428
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,982
I didn't mug anyone.

429
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:49,582
I see.

430
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,281
We don't have any footage or witnesses.

431
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:56,152
But you used the victim's stolen credit card.

432
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,261
Prosecutor, that's not true.

433
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:03,661
I just picked up a wallet that had credit cards.

434
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:07,502
It's true.

435
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,301
I know I should have returned it.

436

I'm sorry.

437

I need solid evidence or confession.

445

Of course, you used someone else's credit card.

446
00:47:59,352 --> 00:48:00,621
It's clearly a crime.

447
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:05,121
I'll pay back the amount of the credit card I used.

He got caught buying bread with a stolen card,

like Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables."

What are you saying?

477

00:56:11,212 --> 00:56:13,511
Great. Help as much as you can.

559
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:15,482
Dong Hyun!

560
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:20,951
- What are you doing? - Mom's here.

561
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:28,922
What's with you?

562
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:31,661
I told you, didn't I?

563
00:56:32,362 --> 00:56:34,362
Not to contact Dong Hyun as you please.

564
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:38,801
- I'm sorry. - Can you stop this?

565
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:40,402
Dong Hyun...

566
00:56:41,672 --> 00:56:43,911
has finally adjusted to the new life.

567
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,542
Don't get in touch first.

568
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:50,812
Got it. I'm sorry.

569
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,812
- But... - You...

570
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:56,422
even forget about yourself when immersed in something.

571
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:00,922
Stop dragging people into your matters.

572
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:03,522
Live the life you want now.

573
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,531
We...

574
00:57:07,402 --> 00:57:09,261
will live happily in our own way.

575
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:12,871
I'm sorry.

576
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:17,241
- But Min Ha... - Bye.

577
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:27,451
I...

578
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:30,852
want...

579
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,792
us to live together again.

580
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:17,402
(Perfect Family)

581
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:41,321
I heard peanuts can lead to death.

582
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:45,332
Help! Over here!

583
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:49,801
You can definitely start anew.

584
00:58:50,672 --> 00:58:51,672
Keep that in mind.

585
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,571
I'll take care of you like my older brother.

586
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:57,370
The past doesn't matter.

587
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,172
I'm only helping someone who's pulling himself together.

588
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:03,680
Many approach prosecutors with something in mind.

589
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,812
Stop!

590
00:59:05,652 --> 00:59:06,680
I can get you money.

591
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:08,320
I can, so please.

592
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:11,022
He might not be the man we thought he was.

593
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:13,422
My suspicions won't die down.

594
00:59:14,991 --> 00:59:16,591
Help me.
