(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

12
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,196
(Episode 2)

13
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,046
Look.

14
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:11,316
Medical treatment for burns is expensive.

15
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,116
So who would adopt someone...

16
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,656
looking like this?

17
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:21,726
Now,

18
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,067
how did I end up with this burn?

19
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:34,207
Shall I tell you?

20
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:40,277
Shall I tell you...

21
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:43,916
what you've done to me.

22
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:13,546
Fire.

23
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:19,556
Fire.

24
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,687
- The fire is spreading! - Kids.

25
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,956
- It's really bad. - Kids.

26
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:26,126
Is everyone here? Is everyone safe?

27
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,827
Because my adoptive parents were to get me early in the morning,

28
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:33,437
I was sleeping in a different room than usual...

29
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,607
and couldn't escape in time.

30
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,607
Please take care of the kids!

31
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,306
It's bad. We need more support!

32
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:44,747
Hurry.

33
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,527
Oh, what about Su Yeon's adoption today?

34
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,797
Let alone the treatment fee, she's got burns.

35
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,036
It's likely to be cancelled.

36
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,737
By the way, I heard the fire started from the back of the building.

37
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:14,206
The kids told me that Su Yeon and Sun Hui...

38
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,976
- often played with matches. - Shush.

39
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,346
For the first time,

40
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,786
I felt despair and frustration.

41
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:34,797
Sun Hui.

42
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:07,527
Sun Hui. Let's go.

43
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,136
Sun Hui.

44
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:16,036
Without seeing me again,

45
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,437
you were adopted to a place far away.

46
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,945
(Assemblyman Kim Sung Wook's Children with Burns Sponsorship Day)

47
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,345
One, two, three.

48
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,117
(Welcome to the House of Children!)

49
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,416
It looks pretty!

50
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,487
I'm jealous!

51
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:48,967
(Welcome to the House of Children!)

52
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,117
Who said I needed a wig?

53
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,396
Without being able to resist,

54
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:20,597
everything simply...

55
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:22,766
felt miserable.

56
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,047
I was furious.

57
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,417
Extremely furious...

58
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,427
to the point I didn't know what to do.

59
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,526
In short,

60
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,537
you set fire with the matches I gave you...

61
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,537
and ruined my chances of adoption.

62
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,737
I...

63
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,336
I...

64
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,506
I had no idea.

65
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,276
I...

66
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:09,716
I...

67
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,316
I thought you had already left.

68
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,196
It can't be helped, then.

69
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:27,966
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,537
I'm sorry. Little...

71
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,607
Little did I know...

72
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:37,047
you got so severely injured.

73
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,316
You, who's got everything,

74
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,787
can't imagine how pitiful...

75
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,987
my life has become since that day!

76
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:51,326
Darn it.

77
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,357
Sun Hui.

78
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,826
From now on,

79
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,266
I'll slowly get back what I deserve.

80
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:57,487
(Perfect Family)

81
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,437
You, who's got everything,

82
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,867
can't imagine how pitiful...

83
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:13,937
my life has become since that day!

84
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,516
Sun Hui.

85
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,287
From now on,

86
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,787
I'll slowly get back what I deserve.

87
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:01,656
Even those you find hard to talk to...

88
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,756
may easily understand your words when put in writing.

89
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,056
Hi.

90
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:06,656
- Yes! - Come on.

91
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,485
- This isn't right. Do it again. - No.

92
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,896
- No more. - Let's do it one last time.

93
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,725
- Seriously? - Hurry up and do it.

94
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,065
Let's go to the snack bar.

95
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,566
If they had been fried eggs...

96
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,336
Stop joking around.

97
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:24,507
- Hey! - One last round. Come on.

98
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,605
- Stop it already. - For real.

99
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,646
- One final round, okay? - It's so cute.

100
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,806
- Ready? - Okay, go.

101
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,946
(To my friend Su Yeon)

102
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,657
- My bad. - It's okay.

103
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,627
Did you go to that new place?

104
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:51,596
What new place?

105
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,667
Su Yeon.

106
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:58,637
It's me, Sun Hui.

107
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:04,007
Since I don't know what to say, I'm writing them down in words.

108
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,246
Everything must've felt unfamiliar.

109
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,585
I'm sorry I didn't take good care of you...

110
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,716
despite meeting again after a long time.

111
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,116
To be honest,

112
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:17,057
I was quite shocked.

113
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,657
I had no idea...

114
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,826
you were badly hurt...

115
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,366
because of my mistake.

116
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:30,437
I was adopted just a few days...

117
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,807
after you were hospitalized.

118
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,647
And I thought...

119
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:38,216
you were adopted after me...

120
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:40,517
and were living happily.

121
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,336
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,537
I'm really sorry, Su Yeon.

123
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:07,206
I will...

124
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,777
pay back the debt my entire life.

125
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:14,177
It's probably too late to say this now.

126
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,687
But...

127
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:21,216
will we be able to get along well again?

128
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,157
Hey, Lee Su Yeon!

129
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,167
Did you make up with Sun Hui?

130
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:37,667
What did you talk about with her?

131
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,736
- What? - I heard...

132
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:44,046
you were wearing a wig. Is it true?

133
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,346
Wait. Seriously?

134
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,946
So what is it? Tell me.

135
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:52,017
I bet it's something interesting.

136
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:54,116
Do you two...

137
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,927
have a secret past or something?

138
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,725
It seems like it.

139
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:01,495
Su Yeon. Don't enjoy...

140
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,726
something like that all by yourself.

141
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,167
Let us in on it too.

142
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:07,996
Come on.

143
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,187
Listen carefully.

144
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,216
Okay.

145
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,856
You're dead if you mess with Sun Hui.

146
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,027
- Got it. - Got it.

147
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:45,736
- Shall we get chicken on our way? - Sure.

148
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:52,216
- Hey, Su Yeon. - Sun Hui.

149
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:56,787
What is it?

150
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,486
Thanks...

151
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:03,356
for the letter.

152
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,297
Hey.

153
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:47,096
Are you Lee Su Yeon?

154
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,777
So why on earth did you act up?

155
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:04,316
Su Yeon.

156
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,157
Su Yeon.

157
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,986
She's one spiteful girl.

158
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,156
She won't scream at all.

159
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:14,096
Go ahead and hit us like you did earlier.

160
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:30,746
Darn. You just don't know when to give in.

161
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,547
Answer me.

162
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:34,147
Answer me!

163
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:37,086
- Why you... - You punk!

164
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,556
Keep moving if it's none of your business.

165
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,996
I can't since it sort of is my business.

166
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,137
Are you her boyfriend or something?

167
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,437
Her boyfriend?

168
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,267
Is that how it has to be?

169
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,976
Let's say that I am, then.

170
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:09,187
It's odd that I ran into you...

171
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,017
in the shortcut I take.

172
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:14,716
Is it fate?

173
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:17,927
Fate?

174
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,627
Why you...

175
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,807
Bring it, you punk.

176
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,476
You took the words right out of my mouth.

177
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,596
Su Yeon.

178
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:05,167
I'm afraid hitting girls has never been my thing.

179
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,037
Should I let them go?

180
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:08,507
What?

181
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:12,017
Go ahead. Get going.

182
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,687
You'd better stay away from her!

183
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:19,917
Get lost.

184
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,066
Unbelievable.

185
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,096
Were you also around?

186
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,336
Well...

187
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,575
Are you okay?

188
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,845
Hey, it's the cops!

189
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,806
Cops are here!

190
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,777
It's the cops!

191
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,486
Hey, the cops!

192
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:37,496
Why are you still following me?

193
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,236
You never know.

194
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,067
They could double back.

195
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:43,966
Yes, what if?

196
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,867
I'm good, so get going. I'm almost there.

197
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:25,147
Let's go.

198
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,646
You really can pack a punch.

199
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,056
And you were the expert in hiding.

200
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,686
Hiding isn't what I did.

201
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,556
I was on standby.

202
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,255
- Get it? - Whatever.

203
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:40,756
I was waiting to call the police if necessary.

204
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,956
Now you know.

205
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,696
Hey, that hurts.

206
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,766
Stop that.

207
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,067
One, two, three.

208
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,577
Smile. One, two, three.

209
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,946
Hit a different pose. One, two, three.

210
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,577
Okay.

211
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:31,976
Let me see.

212
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:35,616
This phone takes the best photos.

213
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,515
You'd better not have left half of me out again.

214
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,455
- Give me that. - I bet you love it.

215
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,785
- Nice. - I'm next.

216
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,485
- Take my photo too. - Stand over there.

217
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,856
- Over there. - Sure.

218
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,495
- We look great. - Don't we?

219
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,157
- We look amazing. - Why am I flying solo?

220
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:49,396
- Sun Hui, take one with me. - Sure.

221
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:52,136
Actually, you look best when posing on your own.

222
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,936
- The backdrop is incredible... - On my own?

223
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,535
- On my own, you tyrant? - Go ahead and pose.

224
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,636
Stand over there together and let me take the shot.

225
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:00,837
- What? - With Gyeong Ho?

226
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:02,847
I'll take one of the three of you.

227
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:09,147
Go ahead.

228
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,486
One, two, three.

229
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,796
One, two, three.

230
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:23,766
One, two, three.

231
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:26,437
One, two, three.

232
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:28,806
Take a look.

233
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:33,536
That's adorable.

234
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,205
- Gosh. - We look great.

235
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,545
- That one's cute. - This is a good one.

236
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,846
- This is nice. - I know.

237
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,146
She takes nice photos.

238
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,446
Take one for us too.

239
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:43,887
- What's with you? - Is it a big deal?

240
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,157
- Take one for them. - Sure.

241
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,927
Look friendlier.

242
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,055
- All right. - Look friendly.

243
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,126
You look great.

244
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:55,126
One, two, three.

245
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,127
There!

246
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:11,545
All right. Galbijjim is served.

247
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,647
Nice.

248
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:15,377
Su Yeon, enjoy.

249
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:16,986
Okay.

250
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:19,087
Thanks to Su Yeon, we're being treated today.

251
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,327
Tell me about it. I'd love for her to come over every day.

252
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:24,555
Let us raise our glasses to welcome her.

253
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,556
Good.

254
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,597
- Su Yeon, welcome. - Welcome.

255
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,927
Thank you.

256
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,106
Enjoy the food.

257
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,536
- Enjoy the food. - Have your fill.

258
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:39,736
Go ahead.

259
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:42,806
Su Yeon, try this.

260
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,377
It's what my mom makes best.

261
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,917
Thank you for the food.

262
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,377
Let me know if you want more.

263
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,025
You don't have to eat that.

264
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,556
Gosh, no.

265
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,926
Su Yeon, forget that and have the galbijjim.

266
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:05,995
Sure.

267
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:07,736
We haven't had galbijjim in a while.

268
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,667
Don't be ridiculous, honey. I made it last week.

269
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,805
Of course. You made it last week.

270
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:13,837
You're hilarious.

271
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:15,776
How is it?

272
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,975
Goodness. What a delight.

273
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:20,577
- No way. - Right?

274
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,716
I'm amazed at how better my cooking gets.

275
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,046
How?

276
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,056
What?

277
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:28,316
Try this too.

278
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:30,387
- Honey, dig in. - I will.

279
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,627
The soy sauce marinated shrimp was made yesterday.

280
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:35,966
It's your favourite.

281
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,617
You're welcome to stay the night.

282
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,216
I'm good.

283
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,857
Thanks for offering, though.

284
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,755
That reminds me. I received a copy...

285
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,555
of past academy exam questions to give to you.

286
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,696
- I'll be right back with that. - Get it to me some other time.

287
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:26,546
I'll get going.

288
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:28,677
Sure. Get home safely.

289
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:04,746
What's wrong?

290
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,456
It's nothing.

291
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,387
Why don't we go on a trip sometime...

292
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,157
with Su Yeon?

293
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:16,766
Gosh, Dad.

294
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,667
Thanks.

295
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:21,536
Let's head inside.

296
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,617
Really?

297
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,087
But she rejected you.

298
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:43,627
It wasn't a rejection.

299
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,755
It was...

300
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:48,726
College is her priority, that's all.

301
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,736
She wouldn't want a clingy guy.

302
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:56,067
No matter how I think about it,

303
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,466
it feels wrong to force your love onto someone.

304
00:25:58,806 --> 00:25:59,806
You couldn't have sounded...

305
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:02,137
more obnoxious.

306
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:04,706
There's no need to be mean.

307
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,746
Besides, what about Su Yeon?

308
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,446
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

309
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,816
Don't you have a thing with Su Yeon?

310
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,417
As if.

311
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:15,286
I wouldn't like anyone but Sun Hui.

312
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:19,897
I doubt Su Yeon thinks that way.

313
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:21,756
As if I care.

314
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:25,596
What matters is that I'm going to tell Sun Hui how I feel.

315
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,396
And I mean it when I say you'll make her uncomfortable.

316
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,806
She might find it burdening,

317
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:31,766
but she wouldn't hate it.

318
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,427
Su Yeon,

319
00:26:58,466 --> 00:26:59,466
what is it?

320
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,437
Did Gyeong Ho say he had something to tell you today?

321
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:08,177
No.

322
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:10,976
I see.

323
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,577
Even if he says he has something to tell you,

324
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:19,216
don't take it seriously and brush it off.

325
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,417
Let me do that.

326
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:24,686
Why? Is something up?

327
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:26,696
Just listen to me, okay?

328
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:34,296
If you take him seriously, I'll end our friendship.

329
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:58,786
Sun Hui.

330
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:00,996
Hey.

331
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,126
Why did you leave without us?

332
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,927
You could've waited. That wasn't nice.

333
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:05,726
Being nice has nothing to do with it.

334
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:08,666
You two can head home hand in hand as well.

335
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,706
I have something...

336
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,577
to tell you today.

337
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,406
Well, I'm afraid...

338
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,076
I'll be too busy with classes at the academy today.

339
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:22,587
Is that so?

340
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,816
But it won't take long.

341
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:26,256
I also have something to show you.

342
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:30,526
Sorry, Gyeong Ho.

343
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:32,526
- See you tomorrow, boys. - Sure.

344
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,266
What was that?

345
00:28:45,736 --> 00:28:48,776
That sigh of yours just now was impure and wicked.

346
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,806
Am I not even allowed to breathe?

347
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:54,876
It seemed like a sigh of relief.

348
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,285
A sigh of relief, no?

349
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,015
- It wasn't. - It was.

350
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,587
No, it wasn't!

351
00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:10,226
Su Yeon, you'll stay for dinner at my place today, right?

352
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,196
No.

353
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,667
I'd rather not today.

354
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,677
Why? You should stay for dinner.

355
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:23,446
My mom's waiting for us with our meal ready.

356
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,976
It's fine. I'm good today.

357
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:33,956
Sure.

358
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,286
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,357
- What? - For yelling at you earlier.

360
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,167
I'll get going. See you tomorrow.

361
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,446
Oh, right.

362
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:38,817
The math workbook.

363
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:41,657
I have to give it to Su Yeon.

364
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:00,137
The number you have dialled cannot be reached...

365
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:08,716
Su Yeon...

366
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:17,327
Why is she at Gyeong Ho's place?

367
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:25,296
Hey, what brings you here?

368
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:27,667
Hey,

369
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,607
I have something to tell you.

370
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:32,367
You came at the right time. Come in.

371
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:00,667
Come in.

372
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:13,746
Ta-da!

373
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,147
What is all this?

374
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:20,516
It's a surprise for Sun Hui. What do you think?

375
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:22,216
Does it look okay?

376
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:25,357
My goodness, this one is...

377
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,476
It's horrible.

378
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:46,817
What?

379
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,216
Gosh.

380
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,986
- What a nice thing to say. - Don't do stuff like this.

381
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,256
- Why not? - You will fail.

382
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,127
You...

383
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,937
Do you...

384
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,367
Do you also...

385
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,147
like Sun Hui?

386
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,107
What?

387
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:46,706
I don't know.

388
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:48,677
I'll just go.

389
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:53,776
That's none of your business!

390
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:56,716
- Let go of me! - Hey!

391
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,587
Su Yeon.

392
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:05,387
Sun Hui.

393
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:11,567
Why are you here?

394
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,437
- Su Yeon... - Why are you here?

395
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:19,877
You promised me that you wouldn't come.

396
00:34:21,377 --> 00:34:22,976
Why don't you keep your promise?

397
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,147
You are making me miserable!

398
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:41,927
My life is ruined...

399
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,266
all because of you.

400
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:49,667
It's all because of you!

401
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,676
Gyeong Ho.

402
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:10,567
Is it you, Sun Hui?

403
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,886
Mom.

404
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:36,286
I'm in the kitchen. Wash your hands, sweetheart.

405
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,087
Mom.

406
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:41,926
Mom...

407
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,197
Mom?

408
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,757
You...

409
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:13,656
What's wrong?

410
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:15,527
Mom...

411
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,197
I...

412
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:25,507
I killed someone.

413
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:30,346
I...

414
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:34,147
I killed Gyeong Ho...

415
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:38,246
Gyeong Ho...

416
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,056
I killed...

417
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:46,627
Gyeong Ho.

418
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,397
I killed Gyeong Ho.

419
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:53,567
No.

420
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:56,437
That can't be true.

421
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:03,576
You would never do something like that. Right?

422
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,877
You didn't do it, right?

423
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:11,717
Mom.

424
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,257
I'm going to turn myself in.

425
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,857
Are you sure that he's dead?

426
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,926
Are you really sure?

427
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:25,596
Yes.

428
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:28,797
- I think so. - How did you kill him?

429
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,167
I stabbed him.

430
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:35,607
Where's the knife? Where's his body?

431
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,947
Gosh.

432
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:43,246
I left the knife...

433
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:45,547
at Gyeong Ho's house.

434
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,616
Were there any witnesses?

435
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:50,687
Witnesses.

436
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:53,156
Witnesses?

437
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:55,326
I...

438
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,127
I don't know.

439
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,636
I didn't see anyone on my way back home.

440
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:06,437
My phone.

441
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:09,877
I left my phone there.

442
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,346
Also...

443
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:16,417
the math workbook.

444
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:18,987
Mom.

445
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:22,056
I'll turn myself in now, okay?

446
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:23,527
There's no need for that.

447
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:28,857
It's all right.

448
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:31,167
Don't worry.

449
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,437
I will take care of it.

450
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,266
You didn't do it.

451
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:41,136
You wouldn't do something like that.

452
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:43,806
There is absolutely...

453
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:48,476
no way you killed someone.

454
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:54,357
Mom...

455
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:57,886
Mom.

456
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,507
Wash up...

457
00:43:52,377 --> 00:43:53,676
and get changed.

458
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:56,317
Mom.

459
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:57,817
I...

460
00:44:00,656 --> 00:44:01,656
Go on.

461
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:43,456
Drink this.

462
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,866
Drink it when it's still warm.

463
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:03,406
I will check and come back.

464
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,447
You don't know if he's still alive.

465
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,647
Mom!

466
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:18,987
I'll turn myself in.

467
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,127
Turn yourself in if you're going to make me an accomplice too.

468
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:27,686
My phone. I left my phone there.

469
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:30,187
Also...

470
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:32,726
the math workbook.

471
00:49:10,996 --> 00:49:12,467
I will check and come back.

472
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,897
You don't know if he's still alive.

473
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:43,127
It smells so good.

474
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:45,397
- Is it good? - Yes.

475
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:50,067
It looks delicious.

476
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:53,265
Honey, please take these.

477
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:56,076
All right. Goodness, you made pot rice.

478
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:57,806
Yes.

479
00:49:59,147 --> 00:50:00,306
Gosh, it looks delicious.

480
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:02,776
It smells so good.

481
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:03,886
- Is it good? - Yes.

482
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:07,115
- Could you bring that to the table? - Sure.

483
00:50:07,116 --> 00:50:08,156
Thank you.

484
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,257
Good morning, Sun Hui.

485
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:13,757
Good morning.

486
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:21,897
This is for you. And this is for Sun Hui.

487
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,865
As the car changed lanes from the 1st lane to the 2nd,

488
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:28,337
- Take a seat. - the car behind it collides.

489
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:31,475
- This time, another car... - Let's eat breakfast.

490
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:32,575
As the car makes a left,

491
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:35,947
a lady with a baby in her arms falls after getting hit.

492
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,345
- The car made an illegal U-turn... - You don't look great today.

493
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:40,446
- And the car... - What's wrong?

494
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:42,586
With the car that tried to change lanes...

495
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,285
What's wrong? Did you have nightmares?

496
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:48,126
This man in his 20s has been doing this for years...

497
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:49,797
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

498
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:53,167
All right. Forget about everything. Enjoy your breakfast.

499
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:54,866
Here you go.

500
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:58,736
- To avoid suspicion... - Okay.

501
00:50:58,737 --> 00:50:59,865
of insurance fraud, he made...

502
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:01,436
- his wife and baby join the crime. - Thank you for the meal.

503
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:02,777
Enjoy your meal.

504
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:06,575
The police arrested him and two other accomplices...

505
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:09,276
for insurance fraud and violation of special laws.

506
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:11,746
Ten people were suspended without detention.

507
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:15,786
Next on the news.

508
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:17,425
Around 1am this morning,

509
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:20,826
a fire broke out in a residential area in Ian-dong, Hanseo-gu, Seoul.

510
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:23,925
It is especially saddening...

511
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,166
that the whole family was found dead,

512
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,495
including the famous artist,

513
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,237
Park Ki Yeon, who was sleeping at home.

514
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:32,865
The police have requested the National Forensic Service...

515
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,777
to identify how the fire started and perform an autopsy on the deceased.

516
00:51:36,237 --> 00:51:38,475
They're also investigating the possibility of arson...

517
00:51:38,476 --> 00:51:40,646
by analysing surveillance camera footage from residential areas.

518
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:41,717
(The whole family died while they were sleeping.)

519
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:43,745
Next on the news.

520
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:45,986
The suspect of the Achilles tendon incident...

521
00:51:45,987 --> 00:51:48,856
that recently occurred in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province...

522
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,016
- Honey. - Yes?

523
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:52,726
He's a consulting doctor.

524
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:55,397
- Do you know his name? - No, I don't.

525
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:57,566
He's a psychiatrist.

526
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,697
Check on it after the meal.

527
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:01,697
I'm sorry.

528
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:07,877
Don't worry.

529
00:52:08,937 --> 00:52:10,306
I will take care of it.

530
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,576
The anchovies are good.

531
00:52:12,906 --> 00:52:14,476
You like all of my food.

532
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:34,337
This is a scene of fire.

533
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:39,437
- Did you find anything? - Nothing much.

534
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:42,306
The fire is estimated to have started at 1am.

535
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:45,646
The couple must have died in the fire while sleeping drunk...

536
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:47,616
after having some couples' gathering that same night.

537
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:50,016
They were all found on the bed.

538
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:52,115
No matter how drunk and suffocated they were,

539
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:54,516
one of them could have escaped after getting to their senses.

540
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:01,897
Where did the fire start?

541
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:03,495
It started in the son's room.

542
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:05,766
They believe cigarettes and paint thinner were the cause.

543
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:08,166
Paint thinner? Who uses that these days?

544
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,035
His father is a famous painter.

545
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:12,437
The son could have stolen the paint thinner from the bottle.

546
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:16,306
My goodness.

547
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:21,846
Gosh.

548
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,916
- From the mountain... - It's clear.

549
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:25,785
- My gosh. - Is that correct?

550
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,487
- We're just checking. - All right.

551
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:29,655
But usually, this place is...

552
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:30,886
I didn't hear anything then.

553
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,607
- Detective Lee. - Yes?

554
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:48,777
Let's start with the people close to the son.

555
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,147
Yes, sir.

556
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:13,797
The number you have dialled...

557
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:16,667
Darn it.

558
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:30,947
The number you have dialled cannot be reached...

559
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:05,187
Sun Hui.

560
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:08,087
Are you sleeping?

561
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:16,925
(Lee Su Yeon)

562
00:55:16,926 --> 00:55:18,796
(Missed Calls)

563
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:19,797
(Lee Su Yeon)

564
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:21,697
It's all because of you!

565
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:23,667
(Lee Su Yeon)

566
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:27,206
(Missed Calls)

567
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:31,076
(Lee Su Yeon)

568
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:41,687
(Lee Su Yeon)

569
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:45,786
(Missed Calls)

570
00:55:56,897 --> 00:56:00,167
(Epilogue)

571
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:15,616
You are Sun Hui, right?

572
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:23,326
How's your scar?

573
00:56:24,726 --> 00:56:26,467
Who are you?

574
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,467
Sun Hui.

575
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,737
I'm someone who wants to become your mom.

576
00:56:33,536 --> 00:56:34,706
My mom?

577
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:37,976
I should have been here earlier. I'm sorry.

578
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:41,317
I was so shocked to hear about the fire.

579
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:44,886
Thank you for being fine.

580
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:49,817
Will you really become my mom?

581
00:56:50,087 --> 00:56:51,127
Of course.

582
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:53,687
Dad, too.

583
00:56:56,257 --> 00:56:57,257
Honey.

584
00:56:59,826 --> 00:57:00,897
Honey.

585
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,616
I'm Choi Jin Hyuk.

586
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:18,246
From now on,

587
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:23,886
do you want to be my daughter?

588
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:14,676
(Perfect Family)

589
00:58:35,156 --> 00:58:38,397
Not everything will go back to its place right now.

590
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:40,167
Some more people have died.

591
00:58:40,527 --> 00:58:42,167
As time goes by,

592
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,106
it will all go back to when it was perfect.

593
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:46,507
None of your business!

594
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,337
Are you done talking already?

595
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:51,947
She's obviously hiding something.

596
00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:54,777
We can't reach her.

597
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:56,217
Can you reach her?

598
00:58:57,016 --> 00:58:58,016
Sun Hui.

599
00:58:58,846 --> 00:58:59,846
Be careful.

600
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:03,317
Your dad and mom.
