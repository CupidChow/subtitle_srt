1
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:09,666
Honor to the Exalted One,
the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One.

2
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,041
Honor to the Exalted One, the Worthy One,
the Fully Enlightened One.

3
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:21,291
Honor to the Exalted one, the Worthy One,
the Fully Enlightened One.

4
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,708
Ma, why are you praying here?

5
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,416
Do you even know whose plot this is?

6
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,750
Sort of.

7
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,208
It's a prayer for the future.

8
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,833
I ask the sacred beings to bring
me a plot like this one.

9
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,166
Oh, I think they'll grant you your wish.

10
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,500
For a million baht.

11
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,125
Ma?

12
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,625
Are you done?

13
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,791
The owners wanna pay respects.

14
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:44,750
Oh.

15
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,458
Hold on just a second.

16
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,041
This way, Ma.

17
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,583
You can be buried in a
shared plot like this.

18
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,916
And be close to your parents.

19
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,125
It's comfortable and reasonable.

20
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,125
Please don't listen to her.

21
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,458
I'll buy you your dream.

22
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,333
Getting a million is easy these days.

23
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,125
Get away from me.

24
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,833
Your cigarettes stink.

25
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,041
Mm-whah!

26
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,625
Try paying me back what I lent you, first.

27
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,125
You hear me, Soei?

28
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,208
It's a few hundred thousand, isn't it?

29
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,250
I don't know.

30
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,333
- I only remember the good things in life.
- Isn't that practical?

31
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,583
- Hey.
- Don't step over them.

32
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,041
And Sew…

33
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,000
Why do you always get this wrong?

34
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,500
You put the duck and chicken butts facing
your grandparents' faces again.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,125
How does it go?

36
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,250
M?

37
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,958
YAFANG ZHENG QINXING ZHOU

38
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,625
M.

39
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:47,916
M.

40
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,791
Come and help us.

41
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,208
I laid the mat down for you, Ma.

42
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,083
You must be exhausted.

43
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,500
Hm?

44
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,291
Bad boy!

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,083
Wait for the ceremony.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,041
Qing Ming is sacred.

47
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,416
We honor the dead, not silly games.

48
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,000
Give me a break. I'm here aren't I?

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,958
His family couldn't bother.

50
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,541
Well, that's nice.

51
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,208
Very pretty.

52
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,458
- Yes, everybody came out today.
- I see that.

53
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,416
Is it hot?

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Not bad actually.

55
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,458
I guess you won't be coming?

56
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,083
I'll light some incense for you.

57
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay?

58
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,458
- Oh, Ma.
- Rainbow.

59
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,041
- Say hi to Ahma.
- Smile.

60
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,791
Say hi to Grandma.

61
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,625
Morning, Grandma.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,791
- Morning…
- It's once a year, Kiang.

63
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,708
Good--

64
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,041
We honor our ancestors.

65
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,791
Rainbow and Pinn have
never paid their respects.

66
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,458
Oh.

67
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,750
Wait a sec.

68
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,375
Scatter these on top.

69
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,416
What a face.

70
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,083
Oh.

71
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,041
I said scatter, not dump.

72
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,416
Can't you even try?

73
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,875
Huh?

74
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,041
- So lazy.
- What does it matter how we do it?

75
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,000
The ancestors are up in the clouds, Amah.

76
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,541
Can you not be such a qi-chou for once?

77
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,750
Hm?

78
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,416
A good-for-nothing slacker.

79
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,416
Ma, you shouldn't be up there.
You could fall.

80
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,291
They'll be scattered by the wind anyway.

81
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,041
Stubborn as a mule.

82
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,291
Come down, please!

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,458
You're looking for trouble, Ma.

84
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,458
Let him do that.

85
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,833
Ma!

86
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,166
Come down before you break your neck!

87
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,583
- No!
- Hey, Ma!

88
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,000
Ma!

89
00:04:59,125 --> 00:04:59,500
Ma!

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,291
Someone from the family will
need to fill out some forms.

91
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,833
- Okay.
- Thank you.

92
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,250
Bye, Ma.

93
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:06,916
Sis,

94
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,208
- you gotta go fill out the forms.
- Excuse me, nurse. We need help.

95
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,250
I have to go.

96
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,625
I need to take Rainbow to the store

97
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,041
I'll leave you guys money
to pay for today.

98
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,708
I left my bike at your house.

99
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,833
- I need to get it.
- Oh yeah.

100
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,833
Why don't I ride back
to your house with you?

101
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,583
And then…

102
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,208
I'll come back and stay with her.

103
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,458
That's ridiculous!

104
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,041
I mean, Kiang lives out in the boonies.
It'll take you too long.

105
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,166
I'll stay with her for now.

106
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,625
Alright.

107
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,208
- Okay.
- Go.

108
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:31,708
Out.

109
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,000
M!

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,791
Are you going by the MRT, Uncle?

111
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,750
Yeah. Why?

112
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,125
Could drop me off there.

113
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,625
Now?

114
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:41,916
Oh.

115
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,791
Okay. Here. Let's go.

116
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,583
Thanks.

117
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,583
See ya later, Sew.

118
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,916
This place is full of talismans, guys.

119
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,208
Ah!

120
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,750
Evil spirit!

121
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,166
Ah!

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,958
I'm scared of ghosts! Take that!

123
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,791
- Wait, where'd it go? Where'd it go?
- A measly four viewers, today?

124
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,875
Ma, everyone can hear you!

125
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,750
Ma…

126
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,500
Why don't you relax?

127
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,916
You've been on your feet all day.

128
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,958
Did you read my text?

129
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,916
Another computer for gaming.

130
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,125
Why do you wanna use my card?

131
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,208
You have your own card, use that.

132
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,833
It's maxed out,
the bank threatened to freeze it.

133
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,500
I hope they do that!

134
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,666
Teach you a lesson.

135
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,041
And if your internet gets cut off again,
I won't pay for it.

136
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,166
What did you say when you decided to
quit school to become a game caster

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,416
from our living room?

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,833
You'd be rich in no-time.

139
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,875
You would rent your own house.

140
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,833
You'd give me an allowance.

141
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,750
I wanna to retire when I'm 60.

142
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,750
I know you do.

143
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,166
Don't kick a man when he's down.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,916
It hurts.

145
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,500
When Amah went to the hospital,

146
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,375
she mentioned to the doctor that she's had
stomach aches and blood in her stool.

147
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,750
So they did tests while she was there.

148
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,000
This morning, I got the results.

149
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,041
Amah has cancer.

150
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,375
It's in the final stages.

151
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,083
She probably has 12 months.

152
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,041
You're dead!

153
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,250
Geeze,

154
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,583
they won't listen.

155
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,500
Man…

156
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,541
Anyway,
M, I expect you to spend time with her.

157
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
But don't mention her diagnosis.

158
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,541
I don't want her to worry.

159
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,041
What'll you give me to go see Amah?

160
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,458
My time is money now, yeah?

161
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,750
HONEYHANIYAH:
GET THE GHOST

162
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,208
MUIII:
THE TV'S ACTING UP AGAIN

163
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,875
MUIII: CAN YOU COME
TAKE A LOOK FOR AGONG?

164
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,083
You need to keep updating the app.

165
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,416
That's why it's freezing.

166
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,125
Uh.

167
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,875
Hm?

168
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,500
My Agong says you need to eat more.

169
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,791
You're too skinny.

170
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,833
Hm.

171
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,333
How do you know what he said?

172
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,000
All his grunts sound the same.

173
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,833
Actually, I made it up.

174
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,125
He probably said you're blocking his view.

175
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,041
Ah-uh.

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,166
Hey.

177
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,916
Whoa, Agong!

178
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,833
You still got it!

179
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,583
Your diaper feels full.
I'm gonna change it, okay?

180
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,500
Mm-hm.

181
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,625
We're going down.

182
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,291
You know you're a grandparent's dream,
Mui?

183
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,916
A graduate from nursing school.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is that true, Agong?

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,625
Who…

186
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,125
do you love the most?

187
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,166
Seriously?

188
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,166
You're hurting my feelings.

189
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,541
Maybe I'll leave you alone tonight.

190
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,750
Do you ever think about
doing something else?

191
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,500
When do you ever have time for yourself?

192
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,541
Agong gave me advice once.

193
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,666
He said to get a high-paying easy job.

194
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,125
So why don't you?

195
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,833
I'm doing that already.

196
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,333
This belt is pure silver.

197
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,416
It's worth at least 10,000 baht.

198
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,000
- That's amazing. Thanks.
- Your dad's not around any more.

199
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:01,750
Thank you.

200
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,250
But Agong wanted you to have something.

201
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,041
- I'm very grateful.
- And I will keep it safe for you.

202
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
You might pawn it for a computer.

203
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,833
- Ma…
- Hm.

204
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,583
Agong was a sly fox.

205
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,958
He divied up his inheritance a while ago.

206
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,291
But he didn't want to reveal anything
until after his death.

207
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,666
Which means I'm the lucky
one to get all the grief.

208
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,791
- So…
- The flowers are here.

209
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,250
Did he leave me something
else for helping him?

210
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,500
Helping him? You?

211
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,833
Of course not!
He left almost everything to Mui.

212
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,250
Including the house.

213
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,583
Your dad's siblings didn't
get much either.

214
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,791
Agong only left them
a little bit of money.

215
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,125
TALAT PHLU STATION

216
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,166
The train heading towards
Talat Phlu Station

217
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,250
has departed

218
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,458
from

219
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,375
Mahachai Station.

220
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,041
Amah?

221
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:06,375
HOW TO MAKE MILLIONS
BEFORE GRANDMA DIES

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,833
Damn ancient.

CONTACT M THANAPAT

227
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,583
Who's that out there?

228
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,541
Hello?

229
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,333
Amah.

230
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,041
It's M.

231
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,958
I just wanted to come and say "hi."

232
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,541
- Oh.
- I miss you.

233
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,166
You're the third.

234
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,750
Your uncles Kiang and
Soei came by this week.

235
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,333
Yeah?

236
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,666
What's going on?

237
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,291
Why the visits all of a sudden?

238
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,458
I came to see if your
leg's healing properly.

239
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,708
Open up for your only grandson?

240
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,583
So, how you doin'?

241
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,166
Have you eaten yet?

242
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:24,750
Yeah, noodles.

243
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,500
I got some for you too.

244
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,708
They're still warm.

245
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,000
It's not time for my meal yet.

246
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,000
Where did you get the noodles?

247
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,666
From that famous beef noodle place.

248
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,166
I had them specially make up
a mix of offal that you love.

249
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,041
You have the tendons,

250
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,250
tripe,

251
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,375
some liver and flat-iron steak too.

252
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,000
You won't believe how tender.

253
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:48,916
I'll fix it up.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,791
You know, I pray to the goddess Guanyin?

255
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,625
I don't touch beef.

256
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,583
Well, what do you eat then?

257
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,458
Fresh fish!

258
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,250
- Is this Michelin-star fish?
- Fresh fish!

259
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,666
Who wants some hot fried fish?

260
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,875
With tasty sauce!

261
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,958
Fried fish!

262
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,333
Who wants some fish?

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,541
- Nice big fish!
- One, two, three, four,

264
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,041
- five, six, seven, eight, nine…
- And tasty sauce!

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,166
Fresh fried fish!

266
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,416
No grease! Just flavor! Try it!

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,958
Wo-ho-ho!

268
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,958
Your favorite fish from
Uncle's fish stand.

269
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,791
You managed that so fast.

270
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,833
There must not have been a line.

271
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,583
He had two woks going at once.

272
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,500
He was…

273
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,791
trying something new.

274
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,125
I've only gone to his stall
for the last 40 years.

275
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,625
I haven't gone blind, you know.

276
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh? I only go there

277
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
because it's not greasy like this.

278
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
I'm not eating it.

279
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,666
If you're going to eat fried food,
you might as well have a little grease.

280
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,500
I got what you wanted, Amah!

281
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,500
It's piping hot!

282
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,541
I'm already full.

283
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,750
What did you eat?

284
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,583
I had the fish you bought earlier.

285
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,083
Oh.

286
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,625
Are you making some tea?

287
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,000
To offer to the gods, not for myself.

288
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,125
Let me do it for you.

289
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,083
Hey.

290
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,791
The water boiled already?

291
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,625
Yeah, it did.

292
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,083
How come I didn't hear the kettle whistle?

293
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,208
I used the microwave.

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,416
For the gods' tea?

295
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,208
What?

296
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,208
Take it down right now!

297
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,958
Why? I boiled it!

298
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,291
- Not the right way!
- It's good!

299
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,875
But this saves gas
and it's so much faster.

300
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,541
No, M!

301
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:36,791
Take it down!

302
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,291
It's not right!

303
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,208
Yes, it is!

304
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,500
The modern ways are good ways.

305
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,791
You offered tea to them.

306
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,500
- The gods don't care how it's boiled!
- If you do things just to get them done,

307
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,625
then don't do them at all.

308
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,083
I'll come back tomorrow
to boil the water right.

309
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,083
Just go home.

310
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,666
Go.

311
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,250
- I'll even use two kettles.
- I don't need you.

312
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,208
You never came to visit.

313
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,625
Why bother now?

314
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,250
Watch where you walk.

315
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:13,875
Hello.

316
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,250
Thanks for coming.

317
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,458
I'm not sure she meant to but Ms.
 Mui left this.

318
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,125
It'd be a shame to throw it out.

319
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,625
Why are you so stubborn?

320
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,958
I don't want these things.
They were supposed to be thrown out.

321
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,416
Now I'm stuck with them.

322
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,458
If you came here to ask me
for money like the others,

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,875
the answer is no.

324
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,708
That's not why I'm here.

325
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,125
I just…

326
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,000
want to say you did a
great job with Agong.

327
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,625
You were…

328
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,916
the one who took care of him,
so you should be rewarded.

329
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,333
Here. Gimme that.

330
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,625
I also wanted to hear more…

331
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,791
about how I could get paid

332
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,916
for the easy work

333
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,208
that you mentioned.

334
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,250
I want to save the money I got
from selling Agong's house.

335
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,083
So, I'm renting this hotel
room by the month.

336
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,916
The rent includes breakfast

337
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,666
and daily housekeeping.

338
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,500
If I get bored, I can just move out.

339
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,708
You got a proper uniform for work?

340
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,916
I'm diggin' it.

341
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,541
It's not real.

342
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,458
It's for my OnlyFans account.

343
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,666
Wearing a nurse's uniform
gets me a higher rate.

344
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,500
Wanna subscribe?

345
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,041
Mm… That's alright.

346
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at you all shy.

347
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,083
We've kissed before, remember?

348
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,125
When we were a lot younger

349
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,791
and our families would get together
to play cards at Agong's.

350
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,416
You and I always played house.

351
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,791
I was the mother,

352
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,250
you were the father.

353
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,041
And we cuddled under the blanket.

354
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,125
Uh, yeah.

355
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,416
I remember now.

356
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:17,958
We did.

357
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,958
So tell me why you wanna
look after your Amah?

358
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,916
So I can get a place of my own.

359
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
It takes so long when
you're not privileged.

360
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,250
Some people are just born
with a head start.

361
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,541
They're rich or inherit a business.

362
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,375
So, you think of Amah as an asset?

363
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,041
Hm…

364
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,500
That hurts.

365
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,166
Do you think it's so wrong…

366
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,375
what we're doing?

367
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,291
Hm?

368
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,416
Honestly…

369
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,375
I really hate Agong's kids.

370
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,916
They would come once
a week for 15 minutes.

371
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,166
So why even bother?

372
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,708
It's time.

373
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,708
Mm?

374
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,500
Our time is what they're
really craving the most.

375
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,291
It doesn't matter what we're there for.

376
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,291
How'd you skip over everyone else?

377
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,416
And get to be number one?

378
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,208
Do you know what…

379
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,458
older people want more
than anything each day

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,583
but most of their children
are not willing to offer?

381
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,166
To not count the minutes.

382
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,875
But I was with her all day.

383
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,208
Did you think she smelled funny…

384
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,083
when you were with her?

385
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,750
Old people just smell.

386
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,416
You notice it because you don't
spend enough time with her.

387
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,666
You'll know you have when
you stop noticing.

388
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,458
Agong was incontinent

389
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,916
but I became immune to it.

390
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,625
Woah!

391
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,875
I'll buy you back when I get the money.

392
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,333
So you're going to be moving in with Amah?

393
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,375
I'm doing what you wanted, aren't I?

394
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,333
Breaking into houses now?

395
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,458
I used the key that you gave to Ma.

396
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,208
What's with all this stuff?

397
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,750
I brought some…

398
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,833
and I

399
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,208
bought some of it.

400
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,791
And this is for you.

401
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,083
I made it selling stuff online.

402
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,750
Tell me why everyone's visiting now?

403
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,916
If all those tests say I'm fine.

404
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,708
I don't need all this fuss.

405
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,041
But the traditional methods endure.

406
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,041
The charcoal burning industry
at Ban Khon Huay Nang

407
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,583
is a mainstay of the
Nong Chang Subdistrict.

408
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,375
They gave Ma the
results of the tests you did.

409
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,583
The traditions have been
handed down for generations.

410
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,625
Most things look good.

411
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,208
The industry is steady but
faces constant challenges.

412
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,333
But you have cancer.

413
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,916
Wood and sawdust prices have
increased and added pressure.

414
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,125
And Ma and the uncles
don't want you to know.

415
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,500
Prices for other materials used in
the process have also increased.

416
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,083
Battery prices have
gone up in all categories

417
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:16,875
Is it serious?

418
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,583
- By an average of 20 percent.
- It's stage four.

419
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,208
And transportation costs
have continued to increase.

420
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:23,500
They've given you a year.

421
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,833
The industry has also come to a
crossroads between tradition and

422
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:26,750
innovation with the advent

423
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,291
But you don't need to listen to them.
Doctors… sometimes they think they can

424
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,916
predict the future. Remember what they
told Yen down the street? Six months if

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,875
she was lucky.

426
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,916
Of higher-performing kilns
increasing productivity and efficiency.

427
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,791
And now it's been ten years and she's
still bossing everyone around in that big

428
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:38,791
house of hers.

429
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,250
However the ancient methods attract
tourists and school groups interested in

430
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,208
- seeing
- I had such a great time as a kid

431
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,958
here. You were so good to Ma and me.

432
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,958
- These traditional work methods in use.
- Now I think it's time I

433
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,125
did something for you.

434
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,458
While some embrace the new technologies
and see them as a way of preserving a

435
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,291
- vital part
- I have time. I'd like to

436
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,708
spend it with you if I can.

437
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,666
Of the local economy,

438
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,208
others see them as the beginning
of the end for small family

439
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,333
enterprises

440
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:16,375
who are not able to compete with the
output from more efficient and numerous

441
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,541
- modern kilns.
- I'm off.

442
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,000
They used to light 100 kilns a day.

443
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,750
Now they are able to light 200 to 300.

444
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,541
As for the prices of raw materials for
the kilns, the price is higher due in

445
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,916
- large part
- I'll put this money

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
towards the utility bill.

447
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,166
To shipping costs,

448
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,708
making the charcoal stove business a
fine balancing act for all involved.

449
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,583
- I'll help you sell congee tomorrow.
- There is also pressure for increased

450
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,041
production to export the charcoal to other
regions or factories

451
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,416
- What time do you leave?
- 5 a.m.

452
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,833
- What?
- 5 a.m.

453
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,541
Why so early?

454
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,083
Do you expect to sell
congee late in the day?

455
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,583
People eat congee at night too, you know.

456
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,583
You can eat congee all day.

457
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,166
The early bird gets the worm'.

458
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,750
I don't think your generation
has ever heard that saying.

459
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,458
Have you ever heard the saying:

460
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,375
“the worm that wakes up at 5

461
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,333
will not stay alive?“

462
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,041
He's the one that gets eaten first, Amah.

463
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:13,916
Hm.

464
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,083
You're scowling.

465
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,875
Why didn't you wake me up?

466
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,041
I'm your Amah, not an alarm clock.

467
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,375
I'll do this bag.

468
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:08,916
Oh, fine.

469
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,500
Are you hiding it because you
don't know what you're doing?

470
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,291
Please.

471
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,541
If you want,

472
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:29,541
I can deposit your money at the ATM then
you won't have to walk to the bank now.

473
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,375
Stop meddling.

474
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,916
I take this walk to the bank every month.

475
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,000
I thought you might like a
break from going for once.

476
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:36,666
Ngek!

477
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,208
Ngek!

478
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,541
- Who's Ngek?
- A friend.

479
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,916
Careful.

480
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,750
Hold this.

481
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Thank you. Oh, Ngek.

482
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,333
How are you?

483
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,583
Did they let you come back already?

484
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,041
I got back yesterday.

485
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,000
Really?

486
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,041
They made me leave to give the
bed to someone worse off.

487
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,500
I've been hit as well.

488
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,333
Where is it?

489
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,000
Intestines.

490
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,708
What's the stage?

491
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,333
It's four.

492
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,333
Mine too.

493
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:16,500
Mm…

494
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,166
I'm here for you if you need it.

495
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,083
- Same to you.
- Although it must be a great

496
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,500
- comfort to have your grandson.
- Sure.

497
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,875
You are so lucky.

498
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,625
You see?

499
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,500
I think your friend is jealous.

500
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,500
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

501
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,458
You stay out here.

502
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,208
You'll use my bank details behind my back.

503
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,500
Oh so now you think your
grandson's a thief?

504
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,625
- You watch too much TV.
- Whatever. Stay there.

505
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,416
- So good to see you, ma'am.
- I would never do that, Amah.

506
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,458
Thank you so much.

507
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,875
- Are we making the usual deposit?
- Yes. We are.

508
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,083
Whoa, Ma.

509
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,458
This is bad.

510
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,333
The fridge smells like a garbage can.

511
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,458
Why do you insist on holding
on to things that are expired?

512
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,375
It's not expired. I can still eat it.

513
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:11,125
No wonder you've got stomach aches,
eating all this moldy stuff every day.

514
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,541
I'll bring it back even
if you throw it out!

515
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,791
How can you two bicker before breakfast?

516
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:21,541
Why are you sleeping in the living
room instead of upstairs?

517
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,375
Amah locks her room.

518
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,875
She doesn't want me in there.

519
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,916
You put your fancy clothes on today?

520
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,666
Fancy?

521
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,041
Hm.

522
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:46,708
Hold on.

523
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,125
The last button's undone.

524
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,333
You trying to show off?

525
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,666
Leave it. It's too tight.

526
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,291
I like it loose, so I can move.

527
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,458
Yeah, 'cause it's so tight.

528
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,333
Why are you bothering me?

529
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,333
Hey.

530
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:03,041
Did you steal Rainbow's sandals?
Those look way too small for you.

531
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,291
They fit perfect.

532
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:05,750
Perfect?

533
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:06,875
Yes.

534
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:10,916
- Thats a perfect fit?
- Go away.

535
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,458
I can dress myself, thank you.

536
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,333
A perfect fit doesn't cut off circulation.

537
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,750
These are my feet, not yours.

538
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,833
If I can get my feet in them,
they fit fine. What about your shoes?

539
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,250
Also a perfect fit.

540
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,916
So why are you dressed so nice?

541
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,666
She always dresses up on Sunday.

542
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,583
Everyone comes on Sundays.

543
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,083
Which you would know if you bothered.

544
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,041
Here we are!

545
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,000
I ordered this chicken
from the Montien Hotel.

546
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,208
It's where all the famous
people go to eat.

547
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,666
Whoa-ho-ho-ha!

548
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,541
Rainbow,

549
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,708
did you know…

550
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,166
when were growing up here,
we had a pet chicken downstairs.

551
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,125
- Cool, huh?
- I would like a baby chick.

552
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,791
- I think they're the cutest in the world.
- True!

553
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,333
But your aunt and your dad used to
chase that chicken around all day.

554
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,166
Until one Chinese New Year,

555
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,875
Amah had to chop him up for dinner.

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,375
Chop. Chop.

557
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,208
Chop.

558
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,333
And she made us steamed chicken
just like this one.

559
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,708
Except we were so sad,

560
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,541
we gave all our pieces to the dogs.

561
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,083
- You've got the memory of an elephant!
- Right, sis?

562
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,791
And you remember whenever Kiang
cried, he would blow snot bubbles?

563
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,541
- He would!
- Can you stop?

564
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm not here to have my baby
listen to your stupid stories.

565
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,250
Why don't we look at your stickers, okay?

566
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,416
Relax, bro.

567
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,958
Passing down the family history
to the next gen is important.

568
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
Kids.

569
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:41,583
When we've finished eating,

570
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,375
- who's up for playing cards?
- Mm?

571
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,291
When's the last time we played together?

572
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,958
I see, you, Ma. you want to take your

573
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,250
boys to the cleaners, huh?

574
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,750
Crack open your safe,
I'm taking you to the cleaners.

575
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,500
- I'd like to see you try, boy.
- Ah! The big talker!

576
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,916
You'll have to play without us,

577
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we have to leave.

578
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,750
Rainbow has a ballet
class in a little bit.

579
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,250
- Kiang, relax.
- Mm?

580
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,791
You have time for a game or
two before you have to leave.

581
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:05,916
Yeah, bro.

582
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,750
There's traffic to deal with.
We need to go.

583
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:08,750
Soei, you too.

584
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,125
You shouldn't be playing cards either.

585
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,083
Why not?

586
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,416
Because Ma needs to rest.

587
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,791
Ma, you still have pain in your stomach?

588
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,875
Yeah.

589
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,250
Are you hurting anywhere?

590
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,708
I know all about the cancer.

591
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,333
Huh?

592
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,875
M told me everything.

593
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,916
Well,
Amah has a right to know what's going on.

594
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,875
It's her body and she can make
her own decisions about it.

595
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,750
I'll see the doctor on my own.

596
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,208
I'm not going to be a burden to you.

597
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,166
It's not a burden.

598
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,208
I'm glad you know,
because I think you should

599
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,333
be getting treated, okay?

600
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,708
But they made me promise to keep it quiet.

601
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,416
What's that?

602
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,083
Don't be trying to make yourself
look like the good son.

603
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,125
You barely visit and you
mooch off of everyone.

604
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:06,833
Ah.

605
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,666
Always with the finances?

606
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,791
I'd pay for more things
if I had any money.

607
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,250
That's because you don't work.

608
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,166
I do work, okay? It's been
slow, so I'm not working right now!

609
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,541
Please don't be starting that again!

610
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,666
- I have a real job.
- You're not being fair, Kiang.

611
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,791
Construction's not steady.

612
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,375
- Anyway, I come here more than you do.
- You're always too busy.

613
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,625
My job is very demanding.

614
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,291
Are you saying our work doesn't count?

615
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,208
Mm-hm!

616
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,875
When I got to school,
I'll be a doctor so you can get

617
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,500
better and we'll play cards.

618
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,250
Don't worry, Ma.

619
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,958
My friend knows all the best doctors
who deal with important people.

620
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,541
I'll foot the bill for your treatments
and you will beat this thing.

621
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,166
You don't need to worry about me.

622
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,750
Don't you be stubborn about this,
when you have appointments,

623
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:57,708
I will take you.

624
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,250
It's my daughter's duty, Ma.

625
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,000
Hey.

626
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:04,875
Ma.

627
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,666
When I took a dump earlier,
I almost broke my neck.

628
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,833
I'll install some handrails
so you don't slip and fall.

629
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:10,750
Okay?

630
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,250
I am proud of my children
and very thankful.

631
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:18,708
Mm-hm.

632
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,208
No need to be so dramatic.

633
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,541
You'll get better soon.

634
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,666
Aren't you supposed to be
working at the market?

635
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,416
Not until later.

636
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,500
I'll be doing night shifts for a while.

637
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,291
This way I'll be able to take
Ma to her chemo in the day.

638
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,458
I can't just take the day off when I want.

639
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,583
What are you expecting from her?

640
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:52,750
Expecting?

641
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:56,833
My mother has cancer.
Don't you think I should support her?

642
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,916
Otherwise I'll be seen
as a terrible daughter.

643
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,958
This is the one and only time we do this.

644
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,291
I'm not coming back here.

645
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,875
Don't you remember what the doctor told
you about making sure you exercise?

646
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,666
I can walk on my own.

647
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,208
You took a day off work for this,
didn't you?

648
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,541
They'll replace you if you call too often.

649
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,458
Ma won't get fired.

650
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,041
She'll be working on the
night shift for a while.

651
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,916
So she can come to your appointments.

652
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,083
Really?

653
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,625
You work at night now?

654
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,416
Until what time?

655
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:42,833
What time, Sew?

656
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:44,833
Until dawn, Amah.

657
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:46,541
She works all night.

658
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,458
Oh.

659
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,375
That means you haven't even slept yet?

660
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,208
That's enough.

661
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,166
Get me out of here.

662
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,708
We're here now. Stay!

663
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,125
Why can't you let me do something
nice for you for once?

664
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,916
Because whenever I let
you do things like that

665
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,208
it always backfires.

666
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,083
Like when you dropped out of school,

667
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,500
to help me sell congee.

668
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,916
Why are you saying that was bad?

669
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:12,291
I couldn't bear to see you work so
hard while my brothers did nothing.

670
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,166
You broke your back for all of us

671
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,000
working all those long
hours with your cart.

672
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:16,958
You work harder than me.

673
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,583
And look where it got you.

674
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,208
- Tired and wet.
- If Kiang were available,

675
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,750
you'd be okay to come with him.

676
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:22,916
Oh…

677
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:23,958
Right.

678
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,750
I'll make sure he knows that.

679
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,708
I'm not sure he'll be free,
but I'll give him the message.

680
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,208
Amah's crying in the changing room.

681
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:51,916
That's impossible.

682
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,125
That woman's never shed a
tear for me in her life.

683
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,375
True.

684
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,291
You're always the one who sheds the tears.

685
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:10,041
All I know is the more you bicker,
the worse she is.

686
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,541
I'll take Amah in for
her chemo from now on.

687
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,083
I'll be representing our family.

688
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,166
- Did you turn off the lights in the house?
- Yes, I did.

689
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,583
- Upstairs and down?
- Yep.

690
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,041
Mui.

691
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,875
Amah.

692
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,458
This is Mui.

693
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,250
One of my cousins.

694
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,875
Amah, have you eaten?

695
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,250
Yes, thank you.

696
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,541
Where are you going, Amah?

697
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,666
I'm going to see the doctor.

698
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,208
I'm going to drive you there.

699
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,541
Thank you.

700
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,791
You speak teochew?

701
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:15,875
You suck-up.

702
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,416
You owe me one, M. I'm not a taxi.

703
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,916
Yeah, I got it.

704
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,416
Please make sure that
your documents are ready.

705
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,375
I think you used to
play cards with my Agong

706
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,375
when I was little.

707
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,666
You need to put your shoes
at the end of the line, M.

708
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,750
They'll start calling patients at eight.

709
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,833
We woke up at four for this?

710
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,208
Amah and I will go find a seat.

711
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,458
Wait for me here, Amah.

712
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,000
I'll find you a wheelchair.

713
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,416
Please ensure that your
documents are ready.

714
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,291
Next time, go in and keep her company.

715
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,583
You'll get huge brownie points.

716
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,666
Mm…

717
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,916
My insides feel like they're on fire.

718
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,458
- Hm.
- Hmpf.

719
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,250
Goodness.

720
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,125
Go put this in the cabinet.

721
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,416
- With the rest.
- Sure.

722
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:11,583
Hey!

723
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,500
- No, wait for me to help you.
- Not a chance.

724
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,208
When you were a kid,

725
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,916
you offered to let me hold your hand.

726
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,666
But

727
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:20,000
your eyes were glued to the television

728
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,625
and I banged up my shins.

729
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,708
I don't remember that.

730
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,125
I'd rather climb on my own.

731
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,208
Come on.

732
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,708
Hold out both your hands.

733
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,583
Mui said I'm supposed to lead the way.

734
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,333
That way we're sure you won't
go tumbling backwards.

735
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,083
- She said that, did she?
- She did.

736
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,166
C'mon. Hands up.

737
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,083
Eyes on me, then.

738
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,250
Careful where you step.

739
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:52,791
That's good.

740
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,000
Now get some rest.

741
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:02,333
Is this Uncle Soei?

742
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,291
Uh-huh.

743
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,333
Hilarious.

744
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,833
Hey.

745
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,041
You and Grandpa were pretty cool,

746
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,666
you look like you were having fun.

747
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,583
Mm-hm.

748
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,541
Back when you used to live here.

749
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,500
You were afraid of ghosts.

750
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,291
You would squeeze in right here

751
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,666
between your Agong and me every night.

752
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,208
I was afraid of ghosts?

753
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,000
Something awful.

754
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,291
I had to sing you at least three
lullabies to get you to sleep.

755
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:41,916
Hm?

756
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,166
No way.

757
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,333
Hopefully you outgrew all that?

758
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:47,791
Because your Agong

759
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,958
likes to come back and wander
around downstairs.

760
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,125
Every night.

761
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,125
If you see his ghost,

762
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,958
don't say anything to him.

763
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:11,541
Shit!

764
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,708
I thought you said you
weren't afraid any more.

765
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,500
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

766
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,333
But you're real.

767
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,916
I needed to pray.

768
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,458
I had a dream about my parents.

769
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,916
They came to take me to stay with them.

770
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,291
M?

771
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,041
Do you think I'm about to die?

772
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,083
Amah.

773
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,708
You worship the goddess.

774
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,458
It's been decades since you ate beef.

775
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,208
Cows should be praying to you.

776
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,625
You've got plenty of life left, I'm sure.

777
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah.

778
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,458
I guess so.

779
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,916
I'll go back upstairs.

780
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:19,916
- Hey, no more stairs.
- You need your sleep.

781
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,875
No stairs.

782
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:21,916
Save your energy.

783
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,291
We sleep together in here.

784
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,208
Come in.

785
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,625
So the bugs don't bite.

786
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:40,500
You're kinda taking up the whole bed.

787
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,208
Hmpf.

788
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:42,916
Can you scoot over, Amah?

789
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,833
Are you insulting me again?

790
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,833
That means I thank you.

791
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,208
Are you sure you're Chinese?

792
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,500
You can't understand a single word.

793
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,083
I'm Chinese-Thai, Amah.

794
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,250
Chinese-Thai.

795
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,208
Whatever.

796
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,458
I'm going to sleep now.

797
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,375
Okay.

798
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,291
Goodnight.

799
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,333
Amah?

800
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,916
Sing to me?

801
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,541
Keep doing this whenever you're free.

802
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,166
Sure thing.

803
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,625
You'll be out of job soon.

804
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,625
You're not doing it tight enough.

805
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,916
I'm leaving some space,

806
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,250
so the vinegar breathes.

807
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,000
The counter is now open.

808
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:48,666
Amah.

809
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,375
Come on. Get up.

810
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,208
Get up.

811
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,291
Are you finished?

812
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,166
Just a second.

813
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:02,958
Amah?

814
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,375
Hey.

815
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,625
What's wrong?

816
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:13,541
Are you in pain?

817
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,708
N-Not so fast.

818
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,291
Um…

819
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,833
Let's skip the market this morning.

820
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,333
I'm going to give you a sponge bath,
you're too warm.

821
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,041
I have to sell my congee.

822
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,833
Come on up. Bath time.

823
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,833
We'll turn around. Slowly.

824
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,500
Go on three.

825
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,125
One, two, three.

826
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:37,125
Up!

827
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,625
Alright. Arm.

828
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:02,291
Mm.

829
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,083
You need to get underneath too.

830
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,041
- I'm sticky.
- Woah!

831
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,375
You're taking it off?

832
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:08,625
Hm.

833
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,833
I wanna feel really clean everywhere.

834
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,416
I'm old, you know. I'm not embarrassed.

835
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,750
Just give me a second.
I've never done this.

836
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,500
Give a guy some warning.

837
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,208
Hm-hm.

838
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,500
What's with your moaning?

839
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,291
Shit!

840
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,458
What? Did you see another ghost?

841
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,916
Was that bump I felt your nipple?

842
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:37,833
Are you that dumb?

843
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,291
I've got a mole.

844
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,250
Who has boobs that would sag
all the way down there?

845
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,166
I dunno. H-How would I know?

846
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,083
Give me that.

847
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:48,208
You might think my knees are my boobs.

848
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,416
What's with the camera?

849
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,458
It's for watching things.

850
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,458
I can't watch that.

851
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,125
No, I mean watching you.

852
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,458
If you fall or faint, I'll see it.

853
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,208
I could come and help.

854
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:06,250
If anything bad happens to you,
I can see it right away.

855
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:07,541
Don't jinx me.

856
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:08,916
Don't worry.

857
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,625
Here. Check this out.

858
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,458
No!

859
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,291
You can't move the goddess like that!

860
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,375
Never.

861
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,916
Why not?

862
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,916
It's just wrong.

863
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,458
Put her back and apologize.

864
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,791
Right this instant.

865
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:30,833
You can't shove her around.
Where's your respect, M?

866
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,083
- There.
- No. Like you care. That was sloppy.

867
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,083
She's all crooked.

868
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,583
Use both your hands, gently.

869
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:37,875
Yes.

870
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,416
Very gently.

871
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
- Careful.
- Done.

872
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,041
She's all set.
Right back in the same exact spot.

873
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,583
It's like she never moved at all.

874
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:52,916
All done.

875
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Easy peasy. The throne is secure.

876
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,125
You're done?

877
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,916
Ma, move away.
You hate the smell of smokes.

878
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,208
You should be resting.

879
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,666
Woah.

880
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,416
Hey, Ma.

881
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,916
The pomegranate's looking nice.

882
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,625
Can I?

883
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,458
Don't touch it. It's not yours.

884
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,833
It looks too good, I'm taking it.

885
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,500
You can't have it!

886
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,666
Why not?

887
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,666
Ooh.

888
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,750
It's not yours.

889
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,833
Well,

890
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,166
whose is it?

891
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,583
It's not yours, that's all.

892
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,375
Ah.

893
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,958
- What?
- You're saving it for your

894
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,750
favorite son, Mr. Money Bags.

895
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,208
You have something to eat?

896
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,750
Take a look.

897
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:50,958
Hey, M?

898
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:51,916
Did you know

899
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,375
that when they first met,

900
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,958
Ma thought Kiang's wife was a real dud.

901
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:58,666
What do you mean a dud?

902
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,208
Shit.

903
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:05,208
Make me explain the simplest words.
Did you sleep through school?

904
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,000
Huh?

905
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,625
A dud sucks. Like a firecracker that got

906
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,125
all wet or a total bore.

907
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,833
Ah…

908
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,708
When Pinn got her hooks into your uncle,

909
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,583
Kiang changed into a totally
different person.

910
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:20,625
He became a snob.

911
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,416
All about image.

912
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,041
Sending his kid to an
international school.

913
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,708
- Did you know?
- Shut your mouth, Soei.

914
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,583
- I can tell when you've been drinking,
- He borrowed tons of money.

915
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,708
- What?
- You have no filter.

916
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,375
I haven't finished gossiping yet.

917
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,500
She protects her favorite.

918
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:37,291
Fine! I'll shut my mouth.

919
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,041
Anyway,

920
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:43,291
my motto's always been:
live within your means and be modest.

921
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:45,416
But your favorite, he just hoards it away.

922
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,875
- That's enough from you.
- The guy's loaded but when people like

923
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,541
me need a little hand out where is he?

924
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,458
Eh…

925
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,875
I'm short about a thousand, help me out?

926
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,250
- Hm?
- No way.

927
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:54,916
Please?

928
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,583
- I spent it.
- If I find it, can I have it?

929
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,041
- No.
- Come on.

930
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,708
Mm! Liar.

931
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,958
- Not today, Soei!
- I'll kiss you 'til you cave.

932
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:02,625
Hm?

933
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:10,916
With Soei,

934
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,000
it's best when he stays away.

935
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,291
Why's that?

936
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,166
Because it means that he's okay
when he doesn't come around.

937
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:27,875
That's just how it goes.

938
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,083
Her kids versus grandkids.

939
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:31,875
She's loved them a lot longer.

940
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,333
There's a chage for extra sauce.

941
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,041
Can you rate your current position?

942
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,666
Who's your Amah's favorite?

943
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:43,000
The number one spot is either
Uncle Kiang or Uncle Soei.

944
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,500
One's too serious and the other's a clown.

945
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,375
I think I've moved ahead of my mom,
though.

946
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,208
Number three gets a big zero.

947
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:56,541
What about you?

948
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:58,416
How did you know you were top of the list?

949
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Did he tell ya?

950
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,916
Most older people aren't
that straight forward.

951
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:03,791
But you can feel it.

952
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:07,750
Feel what?

953
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,291
Not the love if that's what you mean.

954
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,916
I just feel her sarcastic shit.

955
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,416
Every day.

956
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,833
Hm.

957
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:26,500
I was sure I snagged the spot
when Agong sang my praises.

958
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,041
To the rest of the clan.

959
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:29,958
Mm… I guess.

960
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,958
We're almost there, Ma.

961
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,125
It's a bit far, but the air is better.

962
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,625
I'm sorry I haven't brought
you here before.

963
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,375
Welcome to our house, Amah.

964
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,208
Welcome, Ma.

965
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,250
Show Amah the picture you drew for her.

966
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:08,708
Hm.

967
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,250
Careful.

968
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,541
Do you like it, Amah.

969
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,208
Very much.

970
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,000
Thank you.

971
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,166
Did you notice the bed?

972
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,291
We got it specially for you.

973
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,000
Rainbow chose the red flowers.

974
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,375
The TV's internet cable

975
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,333
You can watch the Chinese opera.

976
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,458
- I still have a house and business to run.
- Oh, Ma!

977
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,750
Pinn and I want you to sell that
house and move in with us.

978
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,875
Besides there's salons,
restaurants, a club.

979
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,750
The club has seniors activities.

980
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,916
There's tai-chi each morning.

981
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,416
What about her chemo appointments though?

982
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,291
The commute is tiring.

983
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,833
Uh…

984
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,458
I run my stock trading from home,
I'll be around to take care of her.

985
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,958
Yeah but there's her congee shop.

986
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,875
Her regulars are wondering
why she's not there,

987
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,708
- on Sundays.
- I think it's time for Ma to

988
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:20,250
be closed every day, don't you?

989
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,416
And I can support her.

990
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,958
Moving here is best.

991
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:26,291
- I can be there for her treatments.
- But you're so far from the clinic.

992
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:29,291
You'll be getting up at two in
the morning to make it work.

993
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,208
M.

994
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:54,500
M!

995
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,041
Yep?

996
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,333
I appreciate the work
you've been putting in.

997
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,208
And so…

998
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:04,291
I wanted to give you a little something
for taking care of Amah for us.

999
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,583
That's nice of you, Uncle.

1000
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,541
But I'm not in it for the money.

1001
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:13,541
So it wouldn't feel right.

1002
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:29,625
Ma.

1003
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,208
You raised your son right.

1004
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,791
I will take care of my mother.

1005
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:35,541
I can't burden my nephew with your care.

1006
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,333
Ma.

1007
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,458
Let me do what a son should.

1008
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,083
And you locked everything up?

1009
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,166
Of course.

1010
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:18,708
Rainbow.

1011
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,166
It's big girl time.

1012
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,625
Please go ask Amah if she's having fun.

1013
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,625
I'm sure she would like
you to sit with her.

1014
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,625
Can you do that?

1015
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:26,833
Okay.

1016
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,166
Ah!

1017
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,125
- Do you like the train, Amah?
- I love the train.

1018
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,833
- I like riding places, don't you?
- It's so much fun!

1019
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,416
- Such a smart, pretty granddaughter.
- You can make coffin

1020
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,166
donations at this temple.

1021
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,250
We'll contribute for you.

1022
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,833
Rainbow's friend and her
mother came recently.

1023
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:45,791
And her condition improved in no time.

1024
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,583
You know what this reminds me of, Ma?

1025
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,333
Taking the train when we were kids.

1026
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,166
It brings back memories of
when you and Pa took us on trips.

1027
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,916
And you were so tiny for your age.

1028
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,250
- Me?
- Puny but quick.

1029
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,375
- I remember Soei running all over.
- Of course, all three of you did.

1030
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,666
May you all be blessed

1031
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,166
- for coming to visit our temple today.
- Seven.

1032
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:09,958
- Eight.
- We invite you

1033
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,041
to fill out

1034
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:12,500
Nine.

1035
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:14,458
- Our coffin donation labels.
- Amah!

1036
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,458
- Ten.
- Are you good to climb up?

1037
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:16,916
- We are grateful for your donations.
- Eleven.

1038
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,750
You can go ahead,
Uncle. We'll catch up to you.

1039
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,375
- Thank you for coming and enjoy your stay.
- Twelve.

1040
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,125
- Thirteen.
- So have you made up your mind yet?

1041
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,541
Are you gonna move in with Kiang?

1042
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:28,291
Be quiet, will you?

1043
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,166
I'm counting the steps. You'll mess me up.

1044
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,750
Why are you counting?

1045
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:33,958
For the lottery.

1046
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:39,666
Hm.

1047
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,166
Do your feet hurt?

1048
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,083
Good, Amah?

1049
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,333
Back in the day,

1050
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,083
when Kiang was just a kid,

1051
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:48,916
we came to offer prayers here.

1052
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:51,458
When it was time to leave,

1053
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,708
his shoes were gone.

1054
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,000
So…

1055
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,916
I had to give him my sandals
so he didn't go home barefoot.

1056
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,125
It was a gorgeous day.

1057
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,875
Sunny and bright like today.
The ground was just as hot as today too.

1058
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,125
Did he buy these to try
to make it up to you?

1059
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:12,500
Mm.

1060
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,458
Good, Rainbow.

1061
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,166
Perfect.

1062
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,125
- Your names?
- Let's go.

1063
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:19,041
Start it with Misses…

1064
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,083
then Mengju

1065
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,208
Saejiew

1066
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,500
We're going to put up our labels
and then wait for you outside.

1067
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,041
- Your wish?
- I want to regain my health.

1068
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:33,541
Okay.

1069
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,000
I have more.

1070
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,250
You can't rush the wishes you know.

1071
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,541
- Oh?
- Write.

1072
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,000
How many do you have?

1073
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,958
I wish for my

1074
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:42,666
eldest son…

1075
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:48,708
my daughter…

1076
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,583
and my youngest son…

1077
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,291
to be healthy and strong.

1078
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,708
- And have money and gold.
- Ah.

1079
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,958
Any more and we'll need another label.

1080
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:08,500
Only because your letters
are big as elephants.

1081
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,291
Hm.

1082
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:11,500
And…

1083
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,500
I ask for my one and only grandson…

1084
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,750
to have a very good job.

1085
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,000
Alright.

1086
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:39,291
I'll put it up.

1087
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,791
Thank you.

1088
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,375
Look, Amah.

1089
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:51,458
One.

1090
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:53,708
Two.

1091
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,500
Three.

1092
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,500
Nobody made wishes for you.

1093
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,625
Seems that Kiang's only pretending
how much he cares.

1094
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:07,083
It's all an act get on your good side.

1095
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,791
He has a family of his own.

1096
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,875
He has to use his wishes
for their happiness first.

1097
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,458
You're part of his family, aren't you?

1098
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:01,666
MRS. MENGJU SAEJIEW:
I WANT TO REGAIN MY HEALTH

1099
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:06,750
M:
MAY AMAH WIN THE LOTTERY

1100
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:23,625
Ma.

1101
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,250
Can you try to have your things
ready to move by next Sunday?

1102
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,083
I'll arrange the transportation.

1103
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,083
M, wait.

1104
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,791
I want to buy some new shoes today.

1105
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,958
These hurt my feet too much.

1106
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,000
Here. Start with these.

1107
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,000
How are they?

1108
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,291
They feel big.

1109
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,583
- They look big.
- Yes.

1110
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,500
Hm.

1111
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,083
Honestly.

1112
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:41,333
You might get that perfect fit after all.

1113
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,000
Hey, M.

1114
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,416
Uh-huh.

1115
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:47,666
Maybe you're just trying to
get on my good side too, huh?

1116
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:56,875
It's the same

1117
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,250
as Kiang in a way.

1118
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:05,375
Let me do what a grandson should.

1119
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,875
You are absolutely full of it.

1120
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,541
Ooh you're so full of it.

1121
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,583
Telling the truth, though.

1122
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,791
I say we try these next.

1123
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,166
One on each foot so

1124
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,250
you can compare.

1125
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,833
Mm?

1126
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:33,708
Oh my.

1127
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,791
Are you taking pictures?

1128
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:45,583
Sort of.

1129
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,000
It's a filter.

1130
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:48,958
Huh?

1131
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,833
It's you only a little sparklier.

1132
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:51,791
I know you.

1133
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:54,250
- You're proud of your looks.
- Hm.

1134
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,416
And when your chemo's done…

1135
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,208
I'm pretty sure you'll look
something like this.

1136
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:02,875
Ah!

1137
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:04,625
What nonsense.

1138
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,666
How? You look cool.

1139
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,250
You look good!

1140
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,875
And you won't have to wake up
early to do your hair any more.

1141
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:17,083
You like it?

1142
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,041
Uh-huh.

1143
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,250
It's good to see you laugh.

1144
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:24,833
Get some rest.

1145
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,583
Go on.

1146
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,000
Close your eyes.

1147
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,250
I want pork. Gimme more pork.

1148
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,208
- You only want pork?
- Get me pork and some veggies too.

1149
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,083
You said you wanted only pork.

1150
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:32,500
I meant give me a lot of pork.

1151
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,125
Fine.

1152
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,375
Lots of pork.

1153
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,250
Listen and learn, M.

1154
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,083
Keep stirring.

1155
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:47,666
In the future,

1156
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,541
my customers can be yours.

1157
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:52,333
I can't wake up at four for
the rest of my life, Amah.

1158
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,083
Can I sell at night?

1159
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:55,666
As long as you remember…

1160
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,666
that every kind of hard work

1161
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,333
can bring a Zhuang-wen into existence.

1162
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,583
You just have to practice your skill

1163
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,166
with intent.

1164
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,166
Because that will allow you

1165
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,500
to have a comfortable life.

1166
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,291
Like the Zhuang-wen have
done for centuries.

1167
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:14,583
Don't you have to be castrated to be one?

1168
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,416
Those are eunuchs, silly.

1169
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,166
You really slept through school.

1170
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,458
I'm gonna take you to the cleaners!

1171
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,708
Oh, yeah? Try me.

1172
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,375
Sassy!

1173
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,083
You're on.

1174
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,500
Un-huh. Think hard.

1175
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Should you bluff?

1176
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,000
Does Mengju from Talat Phlu

1177
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,333
have what it takes to be
the big winner tonight?

1178
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,500
Shut your mouth, would you?

1179
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,458
- You're jinxing my hand.
- Hm?

1180
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:43,416
- Show it.
- Go away.

1181
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,041
I think I see where Uncle Soei
gets his gambler's blood from.

1182
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:51,500
During the ghost festival
and on Chinese New Year,

1183
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,250
we didn't know what else to do

1184
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,125
once we'd observed the rituals.

1185
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,291
So we'd play cards late into the evening.

1186
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,208
You've lived alone for a long time.

1187
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,583
Do you ever get lonely?

1188
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,833
I wouldn't call it loneliness.
It's part of life's process.

1189
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,375
I do have a problem

1190
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,666
with the day after Chinese New Year.

1191
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,291
When all the leftovers
from the night before…

1192
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:22,500
are in the fridge.

1193
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:27,916
And…

1194
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,458
I know I'm going to have
to eat them all alone.

1195
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:35,750
Hm.

1196
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,375
Back to the cards.

1197
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,166
Go.

1198
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,041
- Hmpf.
- You show your's first.

1199
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:40,833
Okay.

1200
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:42,416
Seven double score.

1201
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,250
Let's see.

1202
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:49,916
I got eight.

1203
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,125
Double score, too.

1204
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:52,875
Liar.

1205
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,541
You're a bad, bad cheater, okay?

1206
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,458
Double score because it's two eights.

1207
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:01,333
Your customers must rob you blind
if that's how you count.

1208
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:03,833
And I forgot to count this one.

1209
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,291
I'm the winner here, Amah.

1210
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:07,708
- What was it?
- Let's go.

1211
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,791
Hand it over, I see 20 baht right there.

1212
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,708
You scoundrel.

1213
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,708
Taking advantage of your Amah.

1214
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:14,791
Woah!

1215
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,166
Do I complain when I have to pay you?

1216
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:18,500
Nice try.

1217
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,708
Go again?

1218
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,458
It's a blessing to have you here.

1219
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:26,500
And you're fun.

1220
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:38,958
You know I'm on to your stalling tactics.

1221
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,833
Sure.

1222
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,458
No cheating, okay?

1223
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:48,916
We'll see.

1224
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,666
Uncle Kiang isn't answering.

1225
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,666
He's probably upset you didn't move in.

1226
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,000
Uncle Soei's phone is turned off.

1227
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,625
And Ma says she has to work because
they're short-staffed.

1228
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,958
I don't think anyone's coming today, Amah.

1229
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:11,416
Then please put all the food away in the
cabinet, so the bugs don't get to it.

1230
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:14,125
Okay.

1231
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,916
Why is the lid loose?

1232
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:36,291
Hey!

1233
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:38,208
What happened to all my money? It's gone.

1234
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:38,875
M!

1235
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,208
Just a sec.

1236
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,500
There's nothing in there.

1237
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,083
I didn't touch it.

1238
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,333
I didn't touch it!

1239
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,166
I'm not a thief, I swear.

1240
01:10:58,875 --> 01:10:59,708
See?

1241
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,041
He took the pork floss and
stole all your money.

1242
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,750
That's why his phone's off, I guess.

1243
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:13,791
Was it a lot?

1244
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:41,291
Hey.

1245
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:42,625
Shithead.

1246
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,708
Have you ever even helped
Amah sell congee?

1247
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,333
She only earns 10 to 20 baht a bag.

1248
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,083
Do you know how many bags she has
to sell to get 200,000 baht?

1249
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,500
Where's your conscience?

1250
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:58,500
My own mother's never
told me off like this.

1251
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:01,625
How much do you owe?

1252
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,291
Huh?

1253
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,041
A million.

1254
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:10,750
A million?

1255
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,250
So I'm…

1256
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,750
gonna ask Ma to bail me out one last time.

1257
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,208
Uncle.

1258
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:48,958
Here.

1259
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,416
Huh?

1260
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,000
What's that?

1261
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,041
Silver belt.

1262
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,916
Should get a good price for it.

1263
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,125
Awesome. Bring it in.

1264
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,333
You're a lifesaver.

1265
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,291
Disappear for a until you're sorted out.

1266
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:10,416
You deserve better, M.

1267
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:15,458
You take good care of Ma for us, alright?

1268
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,500
Soei wasn't at his apartment.

1269
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,791
His motorcycle wasn't there either.

1270
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,750
I asked his neighbor if he'd seen him.

1271
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:28,333
He said he left town for work.

1272
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:32,291
Hello?

1273
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:33,666
Is anyone home?

1274
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,166
Who is that?

1275
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:39,333
I'll go see.

1276
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,625
Hello? Hello?

1277
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,916
It must be someone Soei owes money to.

1278
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Hide somewhere.

1279
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'll get rid of him.

1280
01:13:58,541 --> 01:13:59,458
Hello, ma'am.

1281
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,166
If you're looking for Soei,
you're too late.

1282
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,500
He's been ordained as a monk.

1283
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,458
I'm just a humble housekeeper,
but I'm not supposed to let anyone in.

1284
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:08,208
Oh.

1285
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,541
Well, I'm not looking for
anyone named Soei, ma'am.

1286
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,333
Oh?

1287
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,833
I'm here about the listing
I saw for this place.

1288
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,333
I texted the seller but he
never replied to my message.

1289
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,500
Uh, so I thought I'd drop by.

1290
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,708
Oh. Thank you so much.

1291
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,416
This house isn't for sale, sir.

1292
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:25,250
No.

1293
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,541
Here's the internet post.

1294
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,708
The seller is listed as M Thanapat, ma'am.

1295
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:31,250
I don't suppose you recognize the name?

1296
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:34,500
Mm…

1297
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,375
I don't believe I know that person.

1298
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,291
Oh.

1299
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,291
Amah.

1300
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:50,750
Is he gone?

1301
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,833
How'd you get him to go away?

1302
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:56,333
Hm.

1303
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,166
I told him I'm the maid.

1304
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,666
Well, you can pull it off.

1305
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,750
You have the outfit.

1306
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,916
And the scowl.

1307
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,083
Now get to work,
you silly maid. Enough sitting around.

1308
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:30,666
I bought you a new shirt.

1309
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,500
It looks formal.

1310
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,125
So you can look professional.

1311
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:39,625
I dunno.

1312
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:41,833
It's kind of old-fashioned.

1313
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,333
Hm.

1314
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,083
You know,

1315
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,291
I think the next chemo treatment
could be the last one.

1316
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,583
And then I'll be cured.

1317
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,208
Then…

1318
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,791
you won't be stuck here doing all of this.

1319
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,125
Are you kicking me out?

1320
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,208
When you were in elementary school,

1321
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,416
people could see your potential.

1322
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,625
You can do anything but you have to try.

1323
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:14,916
Huh?

1324
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,791
Put in the effort and find
yourself a proper job.

1325
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:27,375
I'm just a slacker, Amah.

1326
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,333
I can't compete in the real world.

1327
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,166
This pomegranate tree

1328
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,291
was planted to celebrate your birth.

1329
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,250
It's just as old as you are.

1330
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:24,500
They say that growing a pomegranate
tree brings the child good health.

1331
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,708
When I told you it was yours,

1332
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,125
you asked me to promise
that when the fruit

1333
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,916
was ready, I'd keep it all for you.

1334
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,083
Nobody else could have any.

1335
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:33,250
Here.

1336
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,625
Eat.

1337
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,583
I don't remember that at all.

1338
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,750
I want to say I'm sorry,

1339
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,541
for calling you "qi-chou" all these years.

1340
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:09,333
Would you let me use this as
my hang-out a bit longer?

1341
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:12,875
I promise to leave when
you beat this thing.

1342
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,541
If that's okay?

1343
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:20,958
Tomorrow,

1344
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,791
there's someone I want you to meet.

1345
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:30,250
Your older brother lives in this mansion?

1346
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,750
Why wasn't I born into this family?

1347
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,833
Just look at this gate.

1348
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:41,541
Wow.

1349
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,625
The reason why my grandson
and I are here today,

1350
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,833
is because I have stomach cancer.

1351
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:50,250
And I'd like to get a burial
plot to increase my chances.

1352
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,833
Only I can't afford it right now.

1353
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,083
Can you give me a million baht?

1354
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,250
When we lost our parents,

1355
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,916
you basically got everything they owned.

1356
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,500
You got several million for the house.

1357
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,583
I got nothing.

1358
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:20,083
I've never asked you for a single baht.

1359
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,041
I got what our mother and
father wanted me to have.

1360
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,666
You were there when this happened,
don't you forget that.

1361
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,458
And don't you forget that I'm
the one who wiped their butts.

1362
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,666
I never received anything from them.

1363
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,750
Ever since I can remember,

1364
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,416
whatever our parents had

1365
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,166
always went to you first.

1366
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:47,291
And there was nothing left over.

1367
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,333
I did more than my duty.

1368
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:50,875
And got nothing.

1369
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,250
Why am I not entitled to something?

1370
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,375
They respected our tradition…

1371
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,500
and protected us.

1372
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:03,291
Because that lousy husband of
yours would have squandered it.

1373
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:04,833
You might think he was lousy,

1374
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,375
But he was chosen

1375
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,291
for me by tradition.

1376
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,000
If you want the money so badly,

1377
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,916
you should ask your children to help you.

1378
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,000
Understand?

1379
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,541
As for me,
I won't give you a single penny.

1380
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,000
Hey, M?

1381
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,458
Let's go back home.

1382
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,791
And don't you bother coming
to my home ever again.

1383
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,250
You and I don't share
the same name any more.

1384
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,041
- Approaching Tha Phra Station.
- Amah.

1385
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,291
- Tha Phra Station.
- Please.

1386
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,791
We remind you to mind the gap between
the train and the platform.

1387
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:16,833
Tha Phra Station.

1388
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:20,500
We remind you to mind the gap between
the train and the platform.

1389
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,166
Why do you want a big
burial plot so badly?

1390
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,875
Because if I'm buried
on a good plot of land,

1391
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:34,208
then my children will be prosperous.

1392
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:37,666
People will see it and think
you guys have filial piety.

1393
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,375
That's nonsense, Amah.

1394
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,166
It doesn't work that way.

1395
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,791
Your parents are buried in one of
those regular, small family plots.

1396
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,541
But your brother still got rich.

1397
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,708
When people die, they die. Game over.

1398
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:51,500
The brain stops working.

1399
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,166
And the body will either become part
of the earth and help flowers grow or…

1400
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,833
become part of the stratosphere.

1401
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:00,458
You don't know from a burial plot
how someone has lived. Rich or poor

1402
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:01,833
doesn't make a difference.

1403
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,708
Someday, when I am dead,

1404
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:07,583
if you dump petals on my grave carelessly,

1405
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,250
I will…

1406
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,708
come back to haunt you.

1407
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,541
Bring it.

1408
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:17,041
Be a ghost.

1409
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,041
I hope you come.

1410
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:20,333
Only I don't think you'll
know who actually

1411
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:21,708
showed up for you on Qingming.

1412
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:24,458
Uncle Kiang might pay someone
to do the ritual.

1413
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,583
I could pull your plot on Google Street
Maps and pay respects through the screen.

1414
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:34,583
But if I have a beautiful burial plot,

1415
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,708
you all might want to meet up there.

1416
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,833
Please wait in front of
the examination room.

1417
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,333
Have your hospital card
and identification ready.

1418
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:10,916
Hello.

1419
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:12,416
Please. Sit down.

1420
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,625
Let's just see here…

1421
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,750
After going over the results
of your mother's treatment,

1422
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:28,583
we unfortunately haven't
seen any improvement.

1423
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,250
The doctor said you're better.

1424
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:37,750
You don't need any more chemo.

1425
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,375
You told us that the chemotherapy
would get rid of the cancer.

1426
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,333
Is it possible that the results are wrong?

1427
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,625
He said we can treat your
pain as it comes along.

1428
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,583
I don't need to complete the treatment?

1429
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,375
What I'd recommend

1430
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,291
is to spend as much time
as you can with her.

1431
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,291
- It's alright.
- It's very important for the patient.

1432
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,333
- It's alright.
- The family must stay strong.

1433
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:04,458
I didn't tell you.

1434
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,250
Ngek's gone already She
died a few days ago.

1435
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,541
She didn't finish her treatment, either.

1436
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:15,166
I have a right to know.

1437
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,500
What did he really say?

1438
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:32,958
Ma, what did she say?

1439
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:41,000
What did she tell you, Ma?

1440
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,833
The rice grains have become cooked rice.

1441
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:54,333
It's a saying that means accept
what can't be changed.

1442
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,291
Baba. Mah.

1443
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:31,208
Come and take me with you.
It hurts too much.

1444
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:37,208
I want to join you and
Amah and the others.

1445
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:41,416
Shh…

1446
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:45,416
I want to

1447
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,416
die.

1448
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,666
I want to die.

1449
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,416
Agong.

1450
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:57,541
Help me.

1451
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:12,916
Hey.

1452
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:14,458
Is Ma getting worse?

1453
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,125
They'll be running some tests.

1454
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,208
If there's nothing new, she can go home.

1455
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,416
Get up.

1456
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,250
Let's talk outside for a minute, Sew.

1457
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,125
Do you know where the
deed to her house is?

1458
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:48,583
She hasn't been buried yet, Kiang.

1459
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:52,375
Ma's not dead,
why are you asking about her house?

1460
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:55,125
When we have buried her,
someone's going to have

1461
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,083
to take care of it.

1462
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:58,708
If we do it while Ma's alive,
it'll be much easier.

1463
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,916
Pinn put you up to this business, right?

1464
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:11,708
This…

1465
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,791
is precisely why I don't want
to be around you guys.

1466
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:18,791
I'm not gonna let my wife be treated like
she's not a member of this family.

1467
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,625
Do you know where the deed is?

1468
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:25,083
She keeps her papers,

1469
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:26,750
in her bedroom closet.

1470
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:37,958
Ma.

1471
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:41,208
If Uncle Kiang asks her to sign
something don't let her do it.

1472
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:42,333
Ma!

1473
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,000
Are you listening to me?

1474
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:47,250
Maaa?

1475
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,250
You better do this now, Soei.

1476
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,041
You're the best, sis.

1477
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,375
Amah gave her house to your uncle.

1478
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:02,625
Just a second.

1479
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:03,916
M?

1480
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,875
I need to go settle the bill.

1481
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:08,125
Take her over to the taxi
line and wait there.

1482
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,125
Let's go!

1483
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:11,875
M!

1484
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,625
PATIENT PICKUP AND DROP-OFF POINT

1485
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:31,208
You gave your house to Soei?

1486
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:33,083
Haven't you learned your lesson?

1487
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:37,000
He'll always struggle
more than the others.

1488
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:39,416
Because you enable him.

1489
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,416
That's why he's such a loser.

1490
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:49,750
Your parents did the same thing.

1491
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,333
Cutting out the caregiver.

1492
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,250
I don't have anything else to give.

1493
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,291
You don't have to look after me any more.

1494
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:03,416
I've been doing a good job, haven't I?

1495
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,125
You have done good work.

1496
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,958
Quite impressive, actually.

1497
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,375
How come I'm not gonna be rewarded?

1498
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,416
When I should be first?

1499
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,166
Where do I stand with you?

1500
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,458
Huh?

1501
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:41,208
Tell me!

1502
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,083
Tell me, Amah?

1503
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,041
Stubborn fool.

1504
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,250
I should be first.

1505
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:05,791
Die! Die!

1506
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:06,416
Die!

1507
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:07,750
Die! Your mom's dead!

1508
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:10,583
You're mine now.

1509
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:13,458
Have you even been to bed yet?

1510
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,208
Ma…

1511
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:15,916
Everyone can hear you.

1512
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:17,458
Huh?

1513
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:20,041
You actually have viewers on at this hour?

1514
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,125
Don't you know that expression?

1515
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,791
The early bird gets the worm.'

1516
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:25,666
Especially if the worm,

1517
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,375
is in another time zone.

1518
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:43,833
The new owner of Amah's house
is going to start renovations.

1519
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,958
Can you go help clean it out?

1520
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,708
Everything can just go in the garbage.

1521
01:33:58,041 --> 01:33:58,958
What's that face?

1522
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:00,541
That's not nice.

1523
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,291
You're almost as bad as your Uncle Kiang.

1524
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,708
You know what he said today?

1525
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,541
That if Ma dies,
he won't bother coming to the funeral.

1526
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:15,500
It really is a blessing that neither
of us got Amah's house.

1527
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:21,666
My favorite saying is "It's better to
give than to receive." And it's true.

1528
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,916
Are you trying to cheer
yourself up or what?

1529
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:28,666
Weren't you hoping for Amah's house?

1530
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,000
Whatever gave you that idea?

1531
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,083
Come on.

1532
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:36,416
Why else would you have changed your
work schedule and gone to all

1533
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,416
those appointments?

1534
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,000
So that I could be with her.

1535
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:49,041
That house was a little too quiet

1536
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,250
when you went to Amah's, M.

1537
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,416
Were you lonely?

1538
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:57,875
It helped me understand,

1539
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,416
how once we had all moved out,

1540
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:02,708
she must have found that hard.

1541
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,583
Hi.

1542
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:35,208
You can bring the car into the garage.

1543
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:36,916
Your room's waiting for you, Mui.

1544
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:38,583
Thank you, Auntie.

1545
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:39,666
Of course.

1546
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,833
Last week, Auntie fainted.

1547
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,583
It turns out something's
wrong with her heart.

1548
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,500
So she asked me to come and help her.

1549
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,708
Her only son passed away
several years ago.

1550
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,458
And her daughter-in-law and grandkids
moved away overseas.

1551
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,000
We could do this as a team.

1552
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:14,416
I'll be her nurse around here.

1553
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,583
You take her to all her appointments.

1554
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,416
When she makes me her number one,

1555
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,291
I'll give you a share.

1556
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,083
I really thought the house would be yours.

1557
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,458
Amah told me you worked hard.

1558
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,708
And took good care of her.

1559
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,125
Do you ever dream of your grandpa?

1560
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,708
On the day that we lost him…

1561
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,291
he was eating and choked on his food.

1562
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:46,916
I could have cleared his airway.

1563
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,875
Except I chose not to.

1564
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,541
At the end, he was always asking me…

1565
01:38:02,416 --> 01:38:04,125
to let him join his ancestors.

1566
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:14,166
So I have to assume he's
happy where he is.

1567
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,208
Because he hasn't been in my dreams yet.

1568
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:09,875
I humbly pay my respect to the
benevolent goddess Guanyin.

1569
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:13,041
Please deliver me from sorrow and illness.

1570
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,916
… Important thing is…

1571
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,250
to keep up the pace.

1572
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:21,041
Alright? We want the heart rate

1573
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,875
to be somewhat elevated.

1574
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:12,916
NURSING HOME

1575
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,125
Ma, did you know?

1576
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:21,875
Uncle Soei didn't take
Amah to live with him.

1577
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:23,958
He put her in a nursing home.

1578
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:26,333
I'm gonna go visit her.

1579
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:27,000
Hello.

1580
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,000
Hello.

1581
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,416
Nice to see you.

1582
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,166
Hi.

1583
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:32,083
- Hi!
- Hello.

1584
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,541
Good afternoon.

1585
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:35,833
Hello.

1586
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:38,083
Hello. Are you visiting your family?

1587
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:39,750
- Hello.
- Hi.

1588
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,708
- You have someone here?
- Hi.

1589
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:42,625
Yes, ma'am.

1590
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:46,708
Mr. Chaiyapon,
your nephew's here to visit.

1591
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:47,833
I'll be right out.

1592
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:48,833
Enjoy your time.

1593
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,291
She's asleep, so you have to be quiet.

1594
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:02,708
Mm-hm.

1595
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,041
I got everything paid off.

1596
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,041
But there's a little left over.

1597
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,500
I want you to have it.

1598
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:20,875
You can hold on to it.

1599
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,625
Come on. It's for you.

1600
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:25,666
No one's gonna rescue you when she's gone.

1601
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:58,916
Who is it?

1602
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:02,250
It's your qi-chou, Amah.

1603
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,166
Have you eaten yet, M?

1604
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:27,583
That's better for showing
myself off like I want.

1605
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:46,958
How about you come home with me, Amah?

1606
01:42:48,291 --> 01:42:50,166
I'll make you congee for breakfast.

1607
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:57,750
Let's go home.

1608
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,041
Ma…

1609
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,416
Why are you keeping these things?

1610
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,375
They're fine.

1611
01:44:21,458 --> 01:44:23,208
Anyway, I learned that from you.

1612
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:26,500
What are you even doing in here.
You should be resting.

1613
01:44:28,041 --> 01:44:28,750
Go.

1614
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,625
You shouldn't follow my example
when it comes to food.

1615
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,500
Eat things that are fresh and healthy.

1616
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:35,666
Because cancer can be genetic.

1617
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:37,958
Oh, I know.

1618
01:44:38,958 --> 01:44:40,208
Sons inherit the goods.

1619
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:41,750
Daughters get the genes.

1620
01:44:42,416 --> 01:44:43,083
Mm.

1621
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,166
Are you guys having a moment?

1622
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:47,083
Or just gossiping?

1623
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:49,208
Don't let me interrupt.

1624
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:55,916
Your M…

1625
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,541
All through my illness he's
badgered me to answer…

1626
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:03,208
which one of you

1627
01:45:03,916 --> 01:45:05,208
I love the most of all.

1628
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,666
I don't know the answer.

1629
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,333
But I do know

1630
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:16,583
if there's someone I most want
to stay with, it's you.

1631
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:43,833
MAY GOOD FORTUNE COME TO OUR FAMILIES

1632
01:45:43,916 --> 01:45:45,333
MAY YOU BE PROSPEROUS

1633
01:45:49,916 --> 01:45:51,041
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hi, M.

1634
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,875
Happy Chinese New Year, cousin.

1635
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:03,333
Amah's gonna be amazed at
how much you've grown.

1636
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,708
Let's go see her, Rainbow.

1637
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,333
Not sure if you know, Uncle.

1638
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:27,916
Amah told me the story

1639
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:30,916
of how beef used to be
her absolute favorite.

1640
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:33,916
But you used to get sick a lot as a boy.

1641
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:37,416
She prayed to her goddess to
boost your immune system.

1642
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:41,083
In exchange for Guanyin making
you strong and healthy,

1643
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:44,583
she gave up something she really loved.

1644
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,375
Kiang.

1645
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,125
Come inside.

1646
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:11,375
You're making yourself sick with guilt.

1647
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:40,000
Amah.

1648
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:42,291
Kiang came to see you.

1649
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:43,750
Smile.

1650
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:47,250
Eh?

1651
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:57,958
Amah?

1652
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:01,416
Can you feel him holding your hand?

1653
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:13,541
I see you have your blessings here.

1654
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,791
M is a dedicated grandson.

1655
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,000
Rock, oh rock…

1656
01:49:53,958 --> 01:49:56,333
Rock my golden master

1657
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:08,250
May you grow up to be prosperous

1658
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:18,666
Surrounded by servants

1659
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:23,291
Waiting on your hand and foot

1660
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:28,750
Rock, oh, rock…

1661
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,583
Rock, my golden master

1662
01:50:39,583 --> 01:50:43,416
May you grow up to be prosperous

1663
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:50,416
Surrounded by servants

1664
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:59,750
Waiting on your hand and foot

1665
01:51:04,333 --> 01:51:06,083
Rock, oh, rock

1666
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:14,041
Rock, my golden master

1667
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:28,708
DAOCHAI FAMILY

1668
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,208
I got you tripe, liver,

1669
01:51:39,291 --> 01:51:41,541
tendons and super tender bits of steak,
Amah.

1670
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:47,208
Have you see the silver belt
that I got at Agong's funeral?

1671
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:49,708
I've been looking everywhere
and I can't find it.

1672
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:05,166
Hello?

1673
01:52:10,333 --> 01:52:11,625
Is this some kind of scam?

1674
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,916
But… She passed away recently.
What's this about?

1675
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:33,041
SAVINGS PASSBOOK

1676
01:52:38,958 --> 01:52:40,041
I don't remember that.

1677
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:45,000
It's been open how long?

1678
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:17,666
All you do is play those games.

1679
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:22,958
And it makes you slow as a snail.
The bank'll close before we get there.

1680
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:26,250
I only walk slow so you
don't get too tired.

1681
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:29,625
I'm starting an account
at the bank for you.

1682
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:30,416
Look, M.

1683
01:53:30,916 --> 01:53:32,375
We're going to put money in.

1684
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:35,333
To celebrate your good grades.

1685
01:53:35,958 --> 01:53:38,833
I'm going to keep putting in
deposits throughout the year.

1686
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,708
Can you keep putting in
money until you die?

1687
01:53:45,666 --> 01:53:47,125
I wanna have a million baht.

1688
01:53:48,666 --> 01:53:49,291
Oh.

1689
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:51,083
Are you jinxing me to die?

1690
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:53,541
What would you do with a million baht?

1691
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:56,541
I would start by buying you a new house,
Amah.

1692
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:58,958
'Cause your place is so old.

1693
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:01,333
And bugs are crawling all over the food.

1694
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:04,125
- Well, that's harsh.
- Just talking about it

1695
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:05,583
gives me goosebumps. See?

1696
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:07,041
My goodness. You got goosebumps?

1697
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:10,041
You are absolutely full of it.

1698
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:31,583
I'll withdraw it all and
close the account, ma'am.

1699
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:52,083
M.

1700
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:55,125
Knock on the coffin and tell
Amah where we're going.

1701
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:01,625
Amah.

1702
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:04,750
We're on our way.

1703
01:55:34,166 --> 01:55:35,000
Amah.

1704
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:37,916
We're passing your congee shop.

1705
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:49,541
Amah.

1706
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:51,416
We're crossing the old bridge.

1707
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:25,833
Amah.

1708
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:29,208
We're almost at the big plot I bought you.

1709
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:53,791
Amah.

1710
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,291
You're the top of my list.

1711
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,416
Rainbow.

1712
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:42,791
What are you doing?

1713
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:44,333
Here.

1714
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:46,666
Go scatter the flowers for Amah.

1715
01:57:48,041 --> 01:57:50,083
Soei, why don't you help lay out the food?

1716
01:57:50,166 --> 01:57:52,208
I'm trying to win the 12,
000,000 lottery, bro.

1717
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:53,125
Ooh.

1718
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:54,916
There.

1719
01:57:55,416 --> 01:57:56,791
Do a nice job for Amah, now.

1720
01:57:56,875 --> 01:57:57,833
Kiang?

1721
01:57:58,375 --> 01:57:59,458
Ma was 78, wasn't she?

1722
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:00,416
Rainbow.

1723
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,833
- 79 on the Chinese calendar.
- Here. Lemme help.

1724
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:02,791
- 78.
- Thanks.

1725
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:03,541
79.

1726
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:05,583
- So, 78, 79, 87.
- I'll show you how. Watch.

1727
01:58:05,666 --> 01:58:06,708
- 9-9-7.
- Ready?

1728
01:58:06,791 --> 01:58:08,875
- I think I'm gonna get one more ticket.
- Woop!

1729
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:11,416
Jeez, guys.
It doesn't matter what numbers you choose.

1730
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:12,333
You'll never win.

1731
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:14,625
Do you have 22?

1732
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:17,208
Why 22? Ma was 79.

1733
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:21,500
It's from that one time when Ma took
a picture with the three of us.

1734
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,250
Where did it say that?

1735
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:25,750
Here.

1736
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,458
Let's do the kids' ages too.

1737
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,541
Oh. Let's use Ma's address to
her house. She would want that.

1738
01:58:30,625 --> 01:58:31,250
Okay.

1739
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:33,041
Now one more, then we eat.
