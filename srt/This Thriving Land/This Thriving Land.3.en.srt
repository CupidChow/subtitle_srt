[Episode 3]

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,560
Stay here

4
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,789
and don't let anyone go inside.

5
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,120
Yes, Madam.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,590
Thank you, thank you.

7
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,960
Come on, sit, sit! Enjoy!

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,470
Sit, sit, sit.

9
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,040
We'll serve steamed buns in a bit!

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,530
There's enough food
for all of you tonight.

11
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,110
The steamed buns are coming right up.

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,990
Are you still holding up?

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,730
Yeah, I'm good.

14
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,890
You have to.

15
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,030
No matter who else you skip drinking with,

16
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,079
you have to drink
with your Uncle Xueshi today.

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,079
If it weren't for Uncle Xueshi,

18
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,630
your wedding wouldn't have happened today.

19
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,150
Sister-in-law, I know.

20
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,920
Uncle Xueshi, let me offer you
three toasts.

21
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,670
Okay, okay.

22
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,900
Fill it up, fill it up.

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Uncle Xueshi, here's to you.

24
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,650
Who else should I toast?

25
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,030
There's plenty more.

26
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,570
Even though it's this late,

27
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,540
they still came to celebrate your wedding.

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,000
You should thank them all.

29
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,280
Then, I'll toast them all.

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,290
I'll toast them all.

31
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,000
You can handle it?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,670
Yes, yes.

33
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,990
I'm happy today.

34
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,670
-That's good. Okay.
-Come on.

35
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,830
The groom is here to make a toast!

36
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,860
Xiuxiu, you're asleep, eh?

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,680
Sister-in-law?

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,170
Sister-in-law?

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,720
I can't hold my liquor,

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,980
but I'm really happy today.

41
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,310
Come on, leave him to me.

42
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,000
Sister-in-law...

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,070
Keep your voice down.

44
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,810
Sister-in-law.

45
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,000
Quieter, Xiuxiu's worn out
from the whole day

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,620
and has already fallen asleep.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,750
Don't wake her up.

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,880
I'll keep it down. You keep it down too.

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,490
Come on, come here.

50
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,520
Xiuxiu.

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,280
Get on the bed.

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,079
Xiuxiu.

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,230
Sister-in-law, I can do it myself.

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,560
I can do it. See?
I can take them off myself.

55
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,110
I can do it myself.

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,000
Xiuxiu.

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,630
Xiuxiu.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Xiuxiu.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,720
Xiuxiu.

60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,300
Sleep.

61
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,030
Sleep soundly.

62
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,470
After tonight,

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
everything will be alright.

64
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,660
Slow down.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Slow down.

66
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,930
Once we get over this hill, we'll be safe.

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,050
Slow down, Dajiao. I need a break.

68
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,430
Thank you, thank you.

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,659
These... Here, take these.

70
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,310
I don't want them.

71
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,500
-Take them!
-I don't want them. I don't want them!

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,620
I didn't come to save you for these.

73
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,870
I really don't know

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,890
how to thank you properly.

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,370
I'll remember your great kindness
for life.

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,780
If I can't repay you in this life,

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,530
I'll repay you in my next life.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,360
The fact that I rescued you
from the bandits' lair—

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,140
let's just keep that between us forever.

80
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,670
Don't mention it to anyone.

81
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,340
I can't even tell anyone

82
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,590
about your great kindness to me?

83
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,070
I don't need it.

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,190
You still have to live your life

85
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,260
with Fei Wendian.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,870
The less said, the less trouble.

87
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,830
Hurry, hurry!

88
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,380
Come on, let's hide over there.

89
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,340
Get down, get down.

90
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,080
Stop hiding!

91
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,909
Come out if you know what's good for you!

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,370
If you don't come out,

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,340
don't blame me for what happens!

94
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,000
You two, search over there.

95
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,270
Remember, don't beat them to death.

96
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,090
Go.

97
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,950
Come out yourself, or I'll drag you out!

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,720
Listen up!

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,310
Xiuxiu, stay here. Don't move.

100
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,270
I'll go lure him away.

101
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,680
Once he's gone, you run for it.

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,120
Don't go.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,060
I'll skin you alive!

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,900
Dajiao.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop right there!

106
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,790
How dare you run!

107
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,390
Dajiao.

108
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,110
How dare you run? You've got some nerve.

109
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,970
How dare you!

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,150
I'll skin you alive once I catch you!

111
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,110
Bastard,

112
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,290
you can't get away!

113
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,310
Man...

114
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,480
Man.

115
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,750
Thank you.

116
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,190
I owe you...

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
I owe you my life.

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
D-Don't talk anymore.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,320
You're hurt in your leg and your body.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,360
Let me take you back to the village
to find a doctor.

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Man,

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,040
could you take me to the county hospital?

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,060
Do you know the way?

124
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,190
It's a long way from here
to the county town.

125
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,240
I can make it, but you can't.

126
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,030
I've lost too much blood.

127
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,600
We have to leave now.

128
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,800
I... I can walk.

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,430
D-Don't move, don't move.

130
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,410
Wait here for me!

131
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,090
Okay.

132
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,210
Xiuxiu should make it
to the village by now.

133
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,460
Just as I was about to leave the forest,

134
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,030
I found this man, barely breathing.

135
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,390
Later, I found out

136
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,770
I'd saved a man who does great things—

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,530
someone who helps the poor and suffering

138
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,210
live better lives.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Mother!

140
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,120
Miss Xiuxiu?

141
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,250
Where is my father?

142
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,600
Master! Master! Madam!

143
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,120
M-Miss Xiuxiu is back!

144
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:09,990
Mother...

145
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,830
Xiuxiu!

146
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,750
Xiuxiu... Xiuxiu!

147
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,510
How did you come back?

148
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,080
My poor child...

149
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,970
How did you come back?

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,380
The bandits let you go?

151
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,000
Your head...

152
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,030
How did you come back?

153
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,600
Why didn't you ransom me?

154
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,870
Why...

155
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,890
Let's go inside.

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Why didn't you come to ransom me?

157
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,570
I'll explain it to you slowly.

158
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Why?

159
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
-Why?
-Kuangzi, close the door.

160
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,510
Don't let anyone see.

161
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,120
Okay!

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Why didn't you?

163
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,160
You must be hungry.

164
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,600
I'll have Kuangzi

165
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,480
bring you some food.

166
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,150
Let's go inside and rest.

167
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,750
Take a rest on the bed.

168
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,090
Go inside and rest.

169
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,520
Come on, get on the bed.

170
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,220
Where is my dowry?

171
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,750
Where is my dowry?

172
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,240
Did the Fei family already come?

173
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,890
I've held up my wedding.

174
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,990
I'll go now.

175
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,670
You can't go to the Fei family.

176
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,900
Why?

177
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,090
You really can't go to the Fei family.

178
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,860
I've held up my wedding.

179
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,230
Susu married him in your place.

180
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,670
What did you say?

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,750
Susu married him in your place!

182
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,260
Xiuxiu!

183
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,200
Xiuxiu!

184
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,420
Kuangzi. Kuangzi,

185
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,930
get her back, get her back.

186
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,110
She went to the Fei family.

187
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,990
Okay, okay.

188
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,760
Tell me,

189
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,690
is Susu at the Fei family's now?

190
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,580
Who had her sent there?

191
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,160
I... I don't know!

192
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,670
I only know

193
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,110
that the master had Young Master Kebi
send her.

194
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,430
He sent her with the dowry.

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,010
Get lost.

196
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,840
Get lost!

197
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,840
Go back and tell Ning Xuexiang

198
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,000
he's not my father!

199
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,270
Get lost!

200
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,510
Madam,

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
are you up?

202
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,020
Come in and talk.

203
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,840
Madam, you...

204
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,720
didn't sleep at all last night?

205
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,910
I couldn't settle my mind

206
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,040
and couldn't sleep.

207
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,310
What's wrong?

208
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,840
Miss Xiuxiu is at the door.

209
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,630
Xiuxiu?

210
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,610
She's back?

211
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,430
The sun's out.

212
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,480
Who sent her here?

213
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,940
She came alone.

214
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,150
Alone?

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,510
Tell her to wait in the front courtyard,

216
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,840
and I'll be right there.

217
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,360
Sister-in-law, where is Wendian?

218
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,240
Wendian? W-Wendian...

219
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,750
he hasn't woken up yet.

220
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,550
Didn't we set up a feast
all over the yard just yesterday?

221
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,670
He had to toast table by table...

222
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,400
When I was at the bandits' lair,

223
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,480
he was having a wedding feast here?

224
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,080
Xiuxiu,

225
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,450
there's something I have to
make clear to you.

226
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,210
You know our customs here.

227
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,750
If the bride is sent over before midnight,

228
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,840
she's considered married into the family.

229
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,750
Then they had to go through the rites

230
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
to complete the wedding
and consummate the marriage.

231
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,010
Who would've thought
your father would send Susu instead?

232
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,670
And Wendian accepted it?

233
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,660
He married Susu?

234
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Go close the door

235
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,110
and don't disturb the young master
and young mistress sleeping.

236
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,110
I don't believe it.

237
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,300
I need to ask him myself.

238
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,170
Wendian!

239
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,510
-Miss Xiuxiu...
-Wendian!

240
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,270
Move aside! Let her see!

241
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
Let her see
Susu and Wendian sleeping together!

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
What can she say then?

243
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,040
You go back to your room.

244
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,430
Xiuxiu,

245
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,230
a woman who's been abducted
to a bandits' lair

246
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,130
can't marry into our Fei family.

247
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
As you know,

248
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,480
Wendian is a boy...

249
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,320
who knows the rules
and considers the bigger picture.

250
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,120
He knows the rules of our family,

251
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,740
and he won't do anything to disgrace it.

252
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,180
He sent this to me

253
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,440
last night.

254
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,670
It's already been presented
to the ancestors.

255
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,930
Do you want to check it?

256
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,590
Xiuxiu,

257
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,750
remember what I told you:

258
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,070
when I graduate,

259
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,770
I'll marry you.

260
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,060
I'll take you with me to become a teacher,

261
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,820
to teach and educate people,

262
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,790
and to help the Chinese people
emerge from ignorance.

263
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,920
Where should I go?

264
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,220
Xiuxiu.

265
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,280
Xiuxiu?

266
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,870
I was worried sick about you yesterday...

267
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,340
What...

268
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,940
Susu, why is it you?

269
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,470
Sister-in-law!

270
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,350
Sister-in-law!

271
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,480
Don't shout! Don't...

272
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,410
Sister-in-law!

273
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,570
Hasn't my sister come back yet?

274
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,080
Keep your voice down.

275
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,990
Sister-in-law,

276
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,370
why is it her?

277
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,510
Calm down first,

278
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,950
and let Susu tell you.

279
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,610
Father said that
as long as I got into the bridal sedan,

280
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,370
it would buy him time to rescue my sister.

281
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,360
When she came back,

282
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,560
he'd bring me home.

283
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,130
Xiuxiu hasn't come back yet?

284
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,210
I'm going to the Ning Residence.

285
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,330
I'm going to find Xiuxiu.

286
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,450
I want to go home too.

287
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,110
Stop right there, both of you!

288
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,270
Sister-in-law!

289
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,400
If you two show up in the village now,

290
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,410
how will Xiuxiu be able to
face the people in the future?

291
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,850
Why wouldn't she?

292
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,790
Wouldn't that be telling everyone

293
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,680
that Xiuxiu was kept at the bandits' lair
the whole night?

294
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you want to drive her to her death?

295
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
I didn't!

296
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,410
I'm here to help save my sister!

297
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,350
Then you two had better stay quietly

298
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,240
in the bridal chamber

299
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,500
and don't go anywhere!

300
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,500
Dead! Dead! Dead!

301
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,750
She... she's dead!

302
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,680
Tietou! Tietou! Tietou!

303
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,590
Tietou with braids...

304
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,000
Stop it, stop it!

305
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,890
Silly Tiao,

306
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,470
have you seen Dajiao?

307
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,750
Dead.

308
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,080
Dead?

309
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,750
Dead.

310
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,570
Who died? Where?

311
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,940
Ox...

312
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,070
Ox!

313
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,510
Ox!

314
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,560
Dajiao!

315
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,630
You old miser,

316
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,790
you just couldn't give up that land deed.

317
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,090
You didn't ransom Xiuxiu,

318
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,370
and you even sent Susu to the Fei family.

319
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,140
I don't even know what you were thinking.

320
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,350
You ruined both my daughters at once.

321
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,640
Aren't they your own flesh and blood?

322
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,590
Have you lost your conscience?

323
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,070
Your daughter's right there on the bed.

324
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
How's Xiuxiu supposed to

325
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,970
go on living after this?

326
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
How's she supposed to face anyone outside?

327
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,030
How's she supposed to get married?

328
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,300
Tell me.

329
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,270
You think saying this a thousand times

330
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,530
will change anything?

331
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
Remember, when she wakes up,
ask her right away

332
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,130
how she got back.

333
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,310
Did the bandits...

334
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,400
Xiuxiu!

335
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,270
Xiuxiu, you're awake. Xiuxiu.

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,750
Xiuxiu.

337
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,440
Are you still my father?

338
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
What do my virginity

339
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,180
and my life

340
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
mean to you?

341
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,160
I was going to ransom you.

342
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,440
I even brought out the box
containing the land deeds

343
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,770
and was ready to sell the land
to ransom you. I'd do anything.

344
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,690
It's just that it was too late.

345
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,830
Xiu,

346
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,230
tell Father the truth.

347
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,220
The bandits didn't do anything to you,
did they?

348
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
What do you think?

349
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,830
You left me there

350
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,600
in the bandits' lair.

351
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,670
My own parents abandoned me.

352
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,810
No...

353
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,490
Didn't care about me anymore.

354
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,710
You tell me.

355
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,850
What could happen?

356
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,750
Last night, in the bandits' lair,

357
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,740
the door was never closed.

358
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,670
The bandits came in one by one,

359
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,860
taking turns defiling me.

360
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
And at dawn,

361
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,920
they threw me out like garbage.

362
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,240
Now you're satisfied, aren't you?

363
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

364
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,400
You are my daughter!

365
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
How could I not want you back?

366
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,130
But the whole household still needs to
survive!

367
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,680
Xiu,

368
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,120
I promise you.

369
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,690
I'll definitely find you
another good family.

370
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,610
If you don't want to get married,

371
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,240
we'll

372
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,090
take care of you forever.

373
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,480
You are not my father.

374

I don't need that.

375
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,510
Xiuxiu, it was all my fault.

376
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,350
Even if my heart bleeds out,

377
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,250
it's useless now.

378
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,170
We couldn't gather enough money
at that time.

379
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,870
Your brother went to save you

380
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,920
but nearly lost his life.

381
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,570
Just trust Mother this once, okay, Xiuxiu?

382
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,840
Kejin.

383
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,740
You heard everything?

384
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,440
Let her hate only me!

385
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,930
Son,

386
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,370

387

388
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,690
They've defiled my sister.

389
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,110
How can I possibly face her now?

390
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,830
I have to take my men

391
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,630
up the mountain to go after them!

392
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,570
Go then, go, go.

393
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,930
Go get yourself killed.

394
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,430
Go get yourself killed!

395
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,800
What are you doing standing there?

396
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,510
Get lost!

397
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,430
Her hair was all messed up,

398
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,860
and her bun fell apart.

399
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm telling you,

400
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,520
if a woman is taken by the bandits,

401
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,130
there's no way

402
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,150
they'd let her come back.

403
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,860
Come off it.

404
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,750
You're talking
as if you witnessed it yourself.

405
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,270
What?

406
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
You really saw it?

407
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
You don't believe me?

408
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,550
When Tietou carried her back,

409
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,510
I happened to see it.

410
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,590
It's true.

411
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,010
Kuangzi?

412
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,310
-Kuangzi.
-Kuangzi.

413
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,340
-Come, come, come.
-Come here, come here!

414
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,810
-Come here.
-Come down and talk.

415
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,010
Come here, come here.

416
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,520
Kuangzi, Kuangzi.

417
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Did Miss Xiuxiu come back by herself,

418
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,550
or

419
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,460
did the bandits let her go?

420
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,750
I don't know!

421
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,750
I've never heard of any woman

422
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,200
being released by the bandits.

423
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,960
Unless...

424
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,070
Is Miss Xiuxiu doing well?

425
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,600
How could she be well?

426
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,580
No ransom was paid to those bandits.

427
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,780
How could she be well?

428
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,350
The miss said it herself.

429
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,590
Because the master didn't pay the ransom,

430
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,450
she was violated by many bandits.

431
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,120
How could she be well?

432
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,930
What a pity.

433
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,510
Such a shame.

that Miser Ning has done

437
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,680
too many bad things.

438
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,720
And here comes the retribution.

439
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,120
This is his retribution!

440
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,550
What a pity.

441
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,490

Her character is just like her mother's.

443
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,910
She's a good girl.

444
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,390
Yes, yes, right.

447
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,240
would dare to marry Xiuxiu now?

Well, do you still want to eat that?

No.

458
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,880

459
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,550
the place
where he used to collect firewood.

460
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,210
He'll check the road
to the bandits' lair later.

461
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,420
Why go there?

Don't worry anymore.

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,590
I heard some fresh news.

473
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,070
You weren't focused on
looking for our son,

474
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,160

She's back?

Weren't they saying
that she was kidnapped by bandits?

479
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,270
They ransomed her back?

480
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,600
Ransom? Keep dreaming.

481
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,510
Would that swollen-eyed miser be willing
to pay the ransom?

482
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,480
Let me tell you,

happen to our family.

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,640
my left eyelid kept twitching
the whole time.

495
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,000
Left eyelid twitches mean money,
and right eyelid twitches mean trouble.

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You have long hair but short sense.

560
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,910
Wait until we've got a new plot of land.

561
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
When you stand on that land

562
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,820
and when you see the grain growing,

563
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,590
you'll know I'm right.

564
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,480
Put this away.

565
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,350
Madam,

566
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,510
I'm back!

567
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,610
Come in and talk.

568
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,510
How are things at the Ning family?

569
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,750
According to Kuangzi,

570
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,240
ever since Miss Xiuxiu returned home,

571
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,970
she's been lying in bed,
refusing to eat or drink.

572
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,340
Any girl who's gone through something
like that

573
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,940
would feel that life is worse than death.

574
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,590
All along my way,

575
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,710
I heard all kinds of nasty gossip

576
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,150
from the villagers.

577
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,960
Looks like I guessed right

578
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,250
and did the right thing.

579
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,670
Madam,

580
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,409
we'll just keep it from the young master?

581
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,840
Sooner or later, the young master
and Miss Susu will find out.

582
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,000
From now on, change how you address her—

583
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,530
call her "Young Mistress."

584
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll have the servants change
how they address her right away.

585
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,280
And ask Xiaoqin to look after her more.

586
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,989
She's a poor girl.

587
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,770
Sister-in-law!

588
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,880
Sister-in-law!

589
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,030
Sister-in-law.

590
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,920
Susu.

591
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,120
It's already this late.

592
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,190
Why hasn't my sister come to replace me?

593
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,929
Did my father decide to abandon my sister?

594
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,969
Sister-in-law, you have to help me.

595
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,030
From now on,

596
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,820
I'll take good care of you.

597
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,660
I'm not asking you to take care of me.

598
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,100
I...

599
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,580
Hasn't Xiuxiu been released
because the Ning family wouldn't pay,

600
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,840
or because they don't have enough money?

601
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,680
If that's the case, we can pay.

602
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,060
Even if we have to sell our house or land,

603
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,250
or have to go out to borrow money,

604
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,080
we must ransom Xiuxiu!

605
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,960
Sister-in-law,

606
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,300
we can't let Xiuxiu

607
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,260
stay in that kind of place anymore.

608
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,480
Sister-in-law,

609
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,790
I'll go beg my father,

610
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,550
my brother, and my uncles.

611
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,550
After all, my sister is Wendian's wife.

612
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,410
You can't just ignore him, right?

613
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,770
Yes, Sister-in-law,

614
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,300
let's ransom her together.

615
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,550
No need.

616
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,170
Xiuxiu is already back.

617
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,670
When did she come back?

618
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,800
Then why didn't she come to replace me?

619
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,960
Because she can't.

620
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,630
Why not?

621
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,490
I have to go home and ask

622
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,410
why she didn't come to replace me.

623
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,710
Y-Young...

624
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,230
-Don't stop me!
-Young Mistress!

625
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,960
-Let her go.
-I'm not your "young mistress"!

626
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,190
Let go of me!

627
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,190
Stop the young master.

628
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,880
Young Master!

629
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Get out of the way!

630
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,080
Young Master!

631
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,670
Young... Young Master!

632
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,150
Where are you going...

633
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,630
Wendian!

634
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,560
Get out of my way.

635
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,760
You can't go!

636
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,440
Why?

637
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,580
Sister-in-law,

638
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,830
I want to know

639
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,150
why the Ning family didn't send her
to replace Susu.

640
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,030
Wendian!

641
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,370
Listen to me,

642
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,110
not only can you not go see her,

643
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,370
but you absolutely cannot take her back.

644
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,810
Sister-in-law,

645
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,900
the girl I want to marry is Xiuxiu.

646
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,170
Why can't I go get her?

647
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,610
Because Xiuxiu...

648
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,590
is no longer the Xiuxiu she used to be.

649
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,110
How is she not the same Xiuxiu?

650
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,510
Xiuxiu was defiled by the bandits!

651
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,970
Sister-in-law, what are you talking about?

652
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,480
Didn't Susu say

653
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,940
that her father'd already gone to
ransom Xiuxiu?

654
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,880
Her father was reluctant to
sell land to pay the ransom,

655
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,810
so Xiuxiu was...

656
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,660
was left at the bandits' lair.

657
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,930
Sister-in-law,

658
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,710
who told you this nonsense?

659
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,710
Xiuxiu said it herself.

660
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,440
Now, everyone in the village knows.

661
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,840
Ask Beard Liu if you don't believe me.

662
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,970
Yeah, Young Master,

663
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,890
everyone in the village knows.

664
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,710
They say Xiuxiu was defiled
by the bandits,

665
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,280
and...

666
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,920
and not just by one of them.

667
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,670
Shut up.

668
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,960
I-I'm not making it up.

669
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,360
Everyone in the village said that.

670
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,440
What they said is even worse than that.

671
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,230
Shut up!

672
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,220
No matter what Xiuxiu has become,

673
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,550
she's still my Xiuxiu.

674
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,540
She's still my Xiuxiu.

675
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,670
Wendian!

676
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,640
Young Master.

677
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,760
I know

678
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,230
you can't get over it.

679
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,960
Still,

680
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,230
even though Susu married you
in her sister's place,

681
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,510
it was Heaven

682
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,480
that sent her,

683
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,680
a pure and innocent girl, to our family.

684
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,480
Sister-in-law,

685
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
Xiuxiu has suffered so much.

686
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,370
You shouldn't be saying this.

687
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,250
I'll say one more thing.

688
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,630
When I've finished,
if you still want to go,

689
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,560
I won't stop you.

690
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,510
Our family's ancestral rule:

691
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,150
we do not accept a remarried woman,

692
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,680
much less one
who has been defiled by bandits.

693
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,630
So, Xiuxiu,

694
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,880
no matter what,

695
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,770
cannot enter our home.

696
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,600
Sister-in-law,

697
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,400
let me tell you, then,

698
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,240
I don't care.

699
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,190
Xiu.

700
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,760
Xiuxiu.

701
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,320
Get up and eat something.

702
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,440
Xiuxiu,

703
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,630
these are your favorite dishes.

704
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,960
I made these for you.

705
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,630
Xiu,

706
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,710
if you don't eat,
you'll waste away to nothing.

707
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,130
If you make yourself sick with anger,

708
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I don't want to live anymore either.

709
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,440
Xiu,

710
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,630
I know you're suffering.

711
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,050
I really wish I could bear
those sufferings for you.

712
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,760
I really wish Heaven

713
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,930
would take away my years of life instead,

714
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,960
so you wouldn't have to...

715
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,120
endure such torment.

716
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,840
Mother!

717
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,880
Mother!

718
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,550
Can you believe it?

719
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,710
The matchmaker came,

720
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,640
saying she wanted to
arrange a marriage for Xiuxiu.

721
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,630
When I heard that,
I thought that was important,

722
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,830
so I rushed to listen.

723
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,760
Guess,

724
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,960
guess which man she was talking about?

725
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,550
Who?

726
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,880
Dajiao, small-eyed Feng Er's son.

727
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,510
Feng Dajiao?

728
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,450
Yes!

729
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,880
Feng Er,

730
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,190
that greedy, stingy pauper!

731
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,000
When Xiuxiu was kidnapped by bandits,

732
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,030
he came to our house, wanting to
take advantage and buy our land cheaply!

733
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,400
Now that he's heard
Xiuxiu was defiled by the bandits,

734
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,000
he's sent you to propose marriage
for his son, Dajiao!

735
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,230
He's just a pauper
who never stops trying to take advantage!

736
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,490
If he really dares to come, I'll geld him!

737
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,460
Playing such a sly trick on me!

738
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,970
It's as obvious as daylight

739
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,440
that he's just out
to get something for nothing.

740
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,170
Who the hell does he think he is?

741
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,260
Even though he has a few mu of land,

742
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,440
it's barely enough to feed his family.

743
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,290
They're reaching beyond their station.

744
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,840
Dream on.

745
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,750
Look at our Xiuxiu,

746
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,440
since she was little,
everything she's eaten,

747
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,320
worn, and used has been the finest.

748
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,920
Could they possibly provide for her
like that?

749
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,360
How dare they even think of it?

750
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,030
Father is furious.

751
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,070
The matchmaker was being scolded
by Father so much

752
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,000
that she could hardly sit.

753
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,710
Serves her right. She deserves it.

754
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,110
A bunch of pot-stirrers.

755
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,150
-Xiuxiu?
-Xiuxiu.

756
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,510
-Xiuxiu.
-Xiuxiu.

757
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,590
Listen to Mother,

758
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,710
don't be angry.

759
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,800
Don't be angry.

760
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,680
Didn't your sister-in-law say

761
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,360
that your father is
cursing at her outside?

762
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,110
He'll definitely curse her away.

763
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,840
-Yeah.
-Don't be angry.

764
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,960
W-Why are you up?

765
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,600
What's wrong, Xiuxiu?

766
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,290
Here.

767
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,440
Where are you going?

768
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,110
Xiuxiu.

769
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,230
Be careful!

770
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,150
-Xiuxiu!
-Xiuxiu.

771
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,280
Where are you going?

772
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,760
Hurry, hurry,

773
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,070
get her clothes
so she doesn't catch a cold.

774
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,470
Hurry.

775
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,030
Xiuxiu!

776
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,240
I told him that you wouldn't agree.

777
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,760
Feng Er, that bastard, insisted
that I come.

778
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,000
Master Ning,

779
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,150
you've been scolding me for half an hour.

780
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,590
You should calm down now.

781
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,290
I'll go back and tell him,
and that's that.

782
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,110
Xiuxiu?

783
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,120
Our Xiuxiu is not for his family!

784
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,280
If she really can't get married
and no one wants her,

785
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,000
I'll take care of her
for the rest of my life!

786
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,900
I absolutely won't let her
marry into the Feng family!

787
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,670
Auntie,

788
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll make the decision
about this marriage myself.

789
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,110
I agree.

790
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,880
My goodness.

791
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,190
Well...

792
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,230
well, that's wonderful!

793
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,550
Done.

794
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,840
I'll go back now and tell Feng Er

795
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,590
to pick an auspicious day!

796
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,820
No need to pick an auspicious date.

797
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,400
I'll go with you today.

798
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,230
I'm not staying in this house anymore.

799
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:08,920
Xiu,

800
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,950
you're taking it out on me, aren't you?

801
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,710
Master Ning, about the dowry...

802
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,970
I don't want any dowry.

803
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,660
I don't want anything

804
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,020
from the Ning family.

805
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,720
Mother just wants to say:

806
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
don't make any decisions
in a fit of anger.

807
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,780
I, Ning Xiuxiu, have said it,

808
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,380
and I won't take it back.

809
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,440
Every word counts.

810
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,440
Xiuxiu, you can't leave!

811
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,360
Mother! Mother!

812
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,510
You can't leave!

813
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,800
Don't... don't do it...

814
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,490
Mrs. Ning...

815
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,490
Lianye, hurry up.

816
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,480
Mother.

817
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,550
Do you want me to die
in front of you today?

818
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,160
Kid, don't do that.

819
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,660
Let's go.

820
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,170
Alright, alright. Let's go.

821
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,800
Alright, alright.

822
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,540
Don't...
