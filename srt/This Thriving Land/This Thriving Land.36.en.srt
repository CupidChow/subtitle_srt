00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,280
You little brat, acting all crazy!

4
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,710
If you don't agree to my condition,

5
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,550
you can't take a grain with you.

6
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,950
I'll take every grain.

7
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,680
Fine.

8
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,750
I'll agree to your terms,

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,130
but I can only agree to half of them.

10
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,590
First, release this half-dead man.

11
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,350
As for the others' lives,

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
exchange grain for them.

13
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,430
-Second Uncle!
-Second Uncle!

14
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,400
Father!

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,750
-Second Uncle!
-Second Uncle!

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,240
Father!

17
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,630
Quickly, bring the door panel!

18
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,360
Save him! Quick!

19
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,920
Father!

20
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,579
Hang on!

21
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,430
Father!

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,150
Xuerui,

23
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,280
you must hold on,

24
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,500
You can't leave before me.

25
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,730
Xuexiang,

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,150
I'm afraid

27
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,360
I have to go first.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,890
Dying for our villagers is nothing

29
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,960
to be ashamed of.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Xuexiang,

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,970
in our next life,

32
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,280
let's

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,430
be brothers again.

34
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,090
Father!

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,620
It hurts so much.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,310
It hurts.

37
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,520
Father!

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,400
You can't leave me behind, Father!

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,760
-Kebi.
-Second Uncle.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Second Uncle.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Be...

42
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,210
a good person.

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,520
I know, Father.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,079
-Uncle.
-Father!

45
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,150
Uncle!

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,700
Father, you can't leave!

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,710
I'll listen to everything you say.

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,590
I'll do anything, Father!

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,430
Father.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
Move!

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,570
-Father!
-What are you doing?

52
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,130
Go!

53
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,970
Father...

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,329
-What are you doing?
-Father.

55
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,210
Captain,

56
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,000
what should we do with this guy?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,080
Captain Niwei,

58
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm begging you.

59
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,680
Please let him go.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,340
Let him go?

61
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,050
You even injured one of my men.

62
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,460
You're lucky you ran into me today.

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,550
The county squad
happens to be short-handed.

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,750
You'll serve the Japanese army with me.

65
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,920
Take him away.

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,510
I won't go!

67
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,950
Move it.

68
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,550
Master!

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,870
Hurry up!

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,630
Master!

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,270
Master, I won't go!

72
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,490
Feng Niwei,

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
you're nothing but a beast!

74
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,060
You're pleading for others now.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,870
The Japanese army's business is done.

76
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,750
Now,

77
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,980
it's time to settle our score.

78
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,430
I've already let you take all my grain.

79
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,380
I've done what I promised.

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,390
There's nothing more to settle with you.

81
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,000
Where's my land deed?

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,490
Where is my family's land deed?

83
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,960
I'll find it myself.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,190
My brother's death

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,200
was your doing.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,330
I won't forget this.

87
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,410
I won't forget.

88
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,540
Listen up, all of you!

89
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,630
Captain Feng said

90
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,190
if anyone reveals

91
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,260
who burned the wheat,

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,310
your miserable lives will be spared.

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,170
If you don't talk...

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,940
Then you'll get a taste

95
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,320
of what heavenly fire feels like.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
Shut your mouth!

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,830
Sir.

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,350
You all

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,480
have time.

100
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,800
Captain Feng

101
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,020
will give grain

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
and clear the way.

103
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,550
If you

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
don't confess,

105
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,310
you

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
will burn!

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,950
We Feng family are reasonable people.

108
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,800
If it's not my land deed,

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
I don't want it.

110
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,560
Give me back my land deeds.

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,220
Don't move!

112
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,530
Give me back my land deeds.

113
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,060
Give it back.

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,850
Give it back.

115
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll give it back to you.

116
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,930
I...

117
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,780
Go!

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,980
-Mother!
-Keyu!

119
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,180
Help me!

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,680
Mother!

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,270
Keyu!

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,800
Don't move!

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
Father!

124
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,350
You old bastard.

125
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,070
Keyu.

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,050
Your son is so young.

127
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,630
Father!

128
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,070
I'll let you taste

129
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,680
the feeling of father and son separating.

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Mother!

131
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,190
Don't be afraid, Keyu. Mother's here.

132
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,080
-Don't touch him!
-Don't move!

133
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,660
Keyu!

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Keyu!

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,540
Keyu!

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Put my child down! Keyu!

137
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,040
Keyu!

138
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,470
Keyu!

139
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,020
Still not planning to confess?

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,680
You really want a taste of fire?

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,890
The captain is here.

142
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,750
Captain!

143
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,150
Brother-in-law!

144
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,030
Keyu!

145
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,620
Ke...

146
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,390
Brother-in-law!

147
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,230
Hurry up!

148
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,270
Sister!

149
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,680
Hurry up!

150
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,070
Keyu!

151
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,920
Let me go!

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Not talking, huh?

153
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,760
What are you going to do?

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,830
Then I'll roast

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,550
this kid in the fire too,

156
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,159
so he won't grow up

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,730
and come back for revenge.

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,630
Keyu!

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,850
Keyu!

160
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,120
I know!

161
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,750
Niwei,

162
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,620
I know.

163
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,110
Niwei, I know who burned it!

164
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,030
Let me tell you.

165
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,650
Help me!

166
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,610
Don't be afraid, Keyu.

167
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,370
Put the child down!

168
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,250
Let me go!

169
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,870
Let me leave!

170
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,190
Save me!

171
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,650
Release him!

172
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:31,800
Don't move!

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,860
Put the knife down!

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,789
Don't move!

175
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,240
Release them! Release everyone!

176
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,150
Don't move.

177
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,539
Move again and I'll shoot! Put it down!

178
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,299
Don't move!

179
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,909
Release the people!

180
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,909
Release them!

181
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Sister, I'm scared.

182
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,350
Sister, I'm scared.

183
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,010
Sit down and shut up!

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,630
Let's go!

185
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,980
Come!

186
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,920
Sister!

187
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,830
Meiwei!

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,010
Lie down here.

189
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,250
Don't come out.

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,180
I'm your brother and you're helping him?

191
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Go!

192
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Are you okay?

193
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,440
Stop! Don't move!

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,200
Nobody move!

195
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,340
Dajiao, Xiuxiu!

196
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:58,960
Don't move!

197
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,290
Shopkeeper Chang Chun!

198
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Drop your weapon!

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,150
You're wounded, aren't you?

200
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,600
He's wounded!

201
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,030
Come on!

202
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,600
Help him quickly!

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Hurry!

204
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,200
Let's go!

205
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Quickly!

206
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,480
Xiu!

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,600
Kejin?

208
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,290
Kejin?

209
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,390
How could it be you?

210
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,550
Why couldn't it be me?

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Chang Chun and my brother

212
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
came back just in time to save us.

213
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,840
Turns out, after my brother left,

214
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,640
he joined the guerrilla forces.

215
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,670
For the past year,

216
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,400
he's been fighting the Japanese
with Chang Chun's troops

217
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
and has won many battles.

218
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,840
After my brother saved
the villagers of Ox Temple Village,

219
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,630
he left immediately

220
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,090
without even having time to visit Father.

221
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
Dajiao said

222
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,240
they needed to
take out the enemy stronghold

223
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,270
before it was too late.

224
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,870
Dajiao, Tietou, Zhuzi,

225
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,250
and all the village militia
went with them.

226
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,370
Kejin is a sharpshooter,

227
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,720
one bullet for each Japanese soldier,

228
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,440
never wasting a single shot.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,670
Did Kejin say

230
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,110
when he's coming back to see me?

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Kejin is busy.

232
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,150
He's led Brother-in-law
to fight the Japanese.

233
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,880
Don't worry.

234
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,600
Just take your medicine properly.

235
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,840
Get your strength back.

236
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,440
We'll wait together
for Kejin to return,

237
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,910
okay?

238
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,910
Alright,

239
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,270
I'll listen to you.

240
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,080
I'll take the medicine.

241
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,030
You only listen to your son.

242
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,820
Wipe your father's mouth.

243
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,110
After working all my life,

244
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm now at the point

245
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,990
where we don't even have rice
for tomorrow's meal.

246
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,400
What will we feed Kejin

247
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,280
when he comes back?

248
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,950
What's the matter?

249
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,010
It's just food for the family, isn't it?

250
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,930
I refuse to believe
we can't make ends meet.

251
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,890
I've lived through worse times than this.

252
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,840
I actually think things are fine now,

253
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,980
feeling carefree
with nothing to worry about.

254
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,770
Don't overthink things,

255
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,480
you hear me?

256
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,610
The more you worry,
the harder it is to recover.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,910
Yinzi!

258
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,600
Yinzi!

259
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,550
Grandpa's here.

260
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,950
Father!

261
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,000
Open the door.

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,750
Grandpa!

263
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,730
Father.

264
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,320
Come in quickly.

265
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,850
I came to see how he's doing.

266
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
He's much better.

267
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,410
My father's here.

268
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,510
Keyu,

269
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,660
get Grandpa a chair.

270
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,300
Gotcha.

271
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,770
This time, the injury is quite serious.

272
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,610
Father, please sit.

273
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,800
You need to rest and recover properly.

274
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,580
You picked a bad time to visit.

275
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,830
I have no grain to give you.

276
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
And in the future,

277
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,960
I won't have any grain for you either.

278
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,990
Your daughter, your grandson...

279
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,510
I can't afford to feed them anymore.

280
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,440
Why don't you take them both
back with you?

281
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,800
What are you talking about?

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,890
How can you say such things
at a time like this?

283
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,790
I didn't come here today to ask for grain.

284
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,620
I came to bring you some.

285
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,910
Keyu,

286
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,390
go to the door

287
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,280
and bring in that grain.

288
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,010
Let your father see it,

289
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,450
so he can feel at ease.

290
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,080
It's so heavy!

291
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,130
Let me help you.

292
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,790
Come.

293
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,150
This must be about 15 to 25 kilograms,
right?

294
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,360
At least that much.

295
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,450
Come on.

296
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,170
I'm telling you,

297
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,840
all these years,

298
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,340
I've been living off your charity,

299
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,390
but I've been sneaky

300
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,720
and secretly stashed away
quite a bit of grain.

301
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Plus

302
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,770
the grain we got this time.

303
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,700
Now in my family,

304
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,000
two of my daughters

305
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,800
have all gotten married,

306
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,120
so there are fewer mouths to feed.

307
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,200
We don't eat as much,

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,030
so I brought it over for you.

309
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,410
You...

310
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,200
You...

311
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,650
You...

312
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,050
You brought me grain?

313
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,760
What did I just say?

314
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,260
It's not hard
to make a meal for you and my son.

315
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,230
Great.

316
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,310
Kejin will have food when he returns.

317
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,580
Look at your father.

318
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,480
What's wrong?

319
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,140
I was wrong.

320
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,000
I was all wrong.

321
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,920
Just look at your father.

322
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,670
He's crying.

323
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,040
Cover!

324
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,760
Chang Chun and Kejin's unit

325
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,590
raided the Japanese stronghold

326
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,420
and got the food supplies back.

327
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,760
-Don't move!
-Hurry up!

328
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,840
After that,

329
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,270
apparently, they used the flanking tactic

330
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,850
and crushed the enemy's encroachment plan.

331
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,750
Then the Eighth Route Army
successfully raided

332
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,550
dozens more Japanese strongholds.

333
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,080
Hurry!

334
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,870
Go!

335
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Did you find Niwei?

336
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,200
No, we didn't.

337
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,800
Let's go.

338
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,730
Ox Temple Village
and the surrounding villages

339
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,900
were finally freed
from Japanese control.

340
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,160
But Niwei still wasn't found.

341
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,760
Since then,

342
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,650
almost every day,

343
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,740
there was good news about victories.

344
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,240
We knew the darkness was ending soon.

345
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,700
Although the Kuomintang was still

346
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,230
trying to seize territory,

347
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,500
the people's hearts weren't with them.

348
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,550
Just as Mr. Du said,

349
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,960
the Communist Party

350
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,870
wants to win this land for the people.

351
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,310
They want to let the common folk,

352
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,740
us farmers, live peaceful lives.

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
Is the front gate locked?

354
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Yes, it's locked.

355
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,370
At least you have some conscience.

356
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,710
How did you know I was here?

357
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,430
I used a trick called
"hiding in plain sight."

358
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,740
If I run to the county town now,

359
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,030
they'll definitely catch me.

360
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,630
When it gets dark,

361
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,130
go back to the county town

362
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,550
with me.

363
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,150
I'm quite the big shot in town.

364
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,790
If you stick with me,

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,630
I'll make sure you live the good life.

366
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,750
I know, Niwei.

367
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
You became a bandit in Hebei,

368
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,720
then infiltrated the anti-Japanese forces.

369
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,680
When you were about to defect
to the Japanese,

370
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,810
you were discovered and ran back here.

371
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,480
How do you know that?

372
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,859
Who told you?

373
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,740
You were drunk that day

374
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,109
and told me. You forgot?

375
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,720
You...

376
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,650
You took a bullet for that Feng Dajiao.

377
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,980
You helped an outsider.

378
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,620
You're killing me!

379
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,400
Come to town with me.

380
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,510
Let's not stay in this village anymore.

381
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,030
Niwei.

382
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,850
Take care of yourself.

383
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,550
I'll wait for you to come back.

384
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,880
Wait for me to come back?

385
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,850
What do you mean?

386
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,500
You betrayed your brother.

387
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,000
I won't forgive you even as a ghost!

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,370
You won't get the chance
to become a ghost.

389
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,970
Tie him up!

390
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,130
The Japanese farms don't exist anymore.

391
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,110
Dajiao led the villagers to plant crops,

392
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,770
half for themselves,

393
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,630
and half for
the Eighth Route Army guerrillas.

394
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,480
The land
was returned to the villagers.

395
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,400
Kejin said

396
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,720
the Shandong
Provincial Administrative Committee

397
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,200
made settlement plans for us,

398
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,400
providing us with farming tools and seeds,

399
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,220
and even brought large livestock over.

400
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,880
Father's land was returned,

401
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
but his illness got worse.

402
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,670
That day,

403
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
Father suddenly asked us to take him

404
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
to see the fields.

405
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,580
Dajiao.

406
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,310
My nose is very sensitive.

407
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,320
There's not enough manure in the fields.

408
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,530
The manure hasn't
fermented properly either.

409
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
It's bad for the roots.

410
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,760
Nothing escapes you.

411
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
All the livestock

412
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,330
was taken by the Japanese.

413
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,430
The compost

414
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,830
isn't ready yet.

415
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,660
Crops are like flowers.

416
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,000
They depend on manure to thrive.

417
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,940
The Japanese have really

418
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,610
ruined the soil these years.

419
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,690
This land can only grow
wheat and peanuts now.

420
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,950
Now that we've taken it over,

421
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,310
we must rotate the crops.

422
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,160
This way,

423
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,660
we can preserve
both the land and the harvest.

424
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,350
I understand, Father.

425
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
Look at your father.

426
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,350
He could barely speak at home,

427
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,750
but now that he's in the field,

428
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,400
his illness seems half cured.

429
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
Let's stop and rest a bit.

430
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,640
Are you alright?

431
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm great.

432
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,760
It's wonderful.

433
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,660
Everything's been planted.

434
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,600
Just think, the Communists

435
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,070
helped us plant
without asking for payment.

436
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,170
They didn't even take a bite of our food.

437
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,350
Yes,

438
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,700
when they were planting,

439
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,990
one of the leaders said

440
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,160
that no matter whose land it is,

441
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,570
they treat all of it equally.

442
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,050
They just want to be good

443
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
to us common people.

444
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
Let's go back.

445
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,270
It'll get cold when the sun sets.

446
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,530
I don't want to go back.

447
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,310
I want to look around more.

448
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,830
I still want to chat with Xiuxiu.

449
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,310
You're like a child.

450
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,590
Then I'll go back to prepare dinner.

451
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,590
I'll wait for you.

452
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,130
Xiu.

453
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Let me lean on you for a while.

454
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
I've wronged you.

455
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,270
You know,

456
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,180
you've helped me time and time again,

457
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,270
but I

458
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,620
was ungrateful,

459
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,400
getting angry with you each time.

460
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,200
Xiu.

461
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,190
I've missed you.

462
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,190
You told me about
the democratic government's policies.

463
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,410
I understand now.

464
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,370
Kejin also wrote to me saying

465
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,450
I'm someone the democratic government
wants to unite with.

466
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,210
It warms my heart.

467
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,800
Kejin also said

468
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,030
I should reduce rent
for the tenant farmers

469
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,920
and pay

470
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,090
the workers more.

471
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,960
I don't plan to do that.

472
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
I think

473
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,080
this contribution is too small.

474
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,950
If I do something,

475
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,130
I must do something big.

476
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,240
Xiu.

477
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,250
I want to donate land.

478
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,430
Donate land.

479
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,020
Here, Xiuxiu.

480
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,670
I've kept 15 mu of land for you.

481
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,050
The 15 mu next to the well
in the west of the village.

482
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
Why do you still remember that?
I don't want it.

483
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,530
It should be yours.

484
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,000
I've also kept 15 mu of land

485
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,850
for Yinzi and Keyu,

486
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,740
and 30 mu for Kejin and Chuan.

487
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,450
You just need

488
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,800
enough land to live on.

489
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,720
The remaining 600 mu,

490
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,480
Xiu,

491
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,140
please help me

492
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,480
hand it over to the democratic government.

493
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,940
Father!

494
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,070
Father,

495
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,270
Kejin is back.

496
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,830
Look.

497
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,290
Who's here?

498
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,790
Who's here?

499
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,600
Who is this?

500
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,540
Who is this?

501
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,510
Who's there?

502
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,220
Father!

503
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,480
-Who's here?
-Who's here?

504
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,640
Your son is back.

505
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,880
Kejin.

506
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,240
Father said

507
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,430
he's donating his land.

508
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,750
Really?

509
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,550
Is that true?

510
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,390
You're playing dumb here.

511
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,090
Well done, Father!

512
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,110
If the land you donate

513
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,460
is distributed to the tenant farmers,

514
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,960
Ox Temple Village

515
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,470
will truly let

516
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,330
all farmers have their own land!

517
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,390
Why are you shouting so loud?

518
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,140
I was afraid you couldn't hear me.

519
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,470
You nearly deafened me.

520
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,200
So,

521
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,860
shall we go home

522
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,060
or look around?

523
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Are we going back?

524
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,620
I'm not going back.

525
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,330
Not going back?

526
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,390
I'm not going back.

527
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,280
Not going back.

528
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,110
Xiu.

529
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,160
I want to

530
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,420
go up there.

531
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,030
Go up there?

532
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,890
To the hilltop.

533
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,560
I want to go there,

534
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,270
stand high up,

535
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,880
and see far.

536
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,510
How about I push you, Father?

537
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,420
Dajiao.

538
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,540
You push me. I don't trust him.

539
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,180
I'll hold onto you.

540
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,470
Don't worry.

541
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,300
-Let’s go!
-Okay.

542
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,720
Humpback Guo

543
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,240
has taken Susu on another delivery job?

544
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,750
It's not easy

545
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,730
to earn money in these chaotic times.

546
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,030
When he returns, Dajiao,

547
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,030
teach him how to farm properly.

548
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
And your brother.

549
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,790
Teach him well too.

550
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,850
After defeating the Japanese,

551
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,830
we'll still need to farm well, right?

552
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,910
If you take care of the land,

553
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,640
the land will take care of you.

554
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,440
Xiuxiu.

555
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,790
You and Kejin

556
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,160
must take care of Susu

557
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,600
to live a good life

558
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,550
like you and Dajiao.

559
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,790
Alright.

560
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,440
Father.

561
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,510
We'll live a good life.

562
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,190
Father passed away.

563
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,040
I know

564
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,490

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,950
was identified by scientists
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences

758
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,950
as a thousand-year-old meteorite.

759
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,070
It also became

760
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,610
a highlighted special exhibit

761
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,230
for visitors.

762
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,790
Let's look behind us.

763
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,550
That building

764
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,960
was built later to celebrate

765
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,630
the 60th anniversary
of the Communist Party

766
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,950
of China.

767
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,600
In my dreams,

768
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,560
I've lost count of how many times

769
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,450
I've stepped through this door
just like this.

770
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
Just like this,

771
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,730
walking on the bluestone-paved path
in the courtyard.

772
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,890
In my dreams,

773
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,780
I can smell the odor of cattle

774
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,640
mixed with fresh grass
that comes every afternoon.

775

I can hear my mother

778
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,110

-Xiuxiu!

779
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,350

In my dreams,

784
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,460
I see the door
of our family's granary open.

785
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,040
Father stands at the entrance
with a beaming smile.

786

Wonderful!

787
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,370

and the bins are full again.

789
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,240
