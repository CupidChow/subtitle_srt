[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,200
I accept my fate, Xiuxiu.

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,310
Yinzi, you...

5
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:48,950
You're a really nice girl.

6
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,039
What kind of future

7
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,910
will you have

8
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,640
if you marry Ning Xuexiang?

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,370
By contrast,

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,590
if you marry Tietou,

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,729
though your life won't be easy,

12
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,729
at least you'll be much happier.

13
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,590
Take me as an example.

14
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,850
I'm married to Dajiao.

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,790
We're not wealthy,

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
but he treats me well.

17
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,880
So there's still hope in my heart.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Yinzi,

19
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,240
listen to me, will you? Don't be foolish.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,910
As long as we don’t give up,

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,710
we won't be defeated.

22
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,570
Xiuxiu.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you.

24
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,880
Don't cry, my sister.
Get on the bridal sedan.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,680
Let the drums bang. May joy far extends.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,430
Don't cry, my sister.
Fill the sedan with laughter.

27
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,190
Look at your pretty shoes and headwear.

28
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,560
Don't cry, my sister.

29
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,480
Kebi,

30
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,700
let's go.

31
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Ning Xuexiang!

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,280
Stop being upset.

33
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,770
She's not precious or noble.

34
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,100
Even if you married her,

35
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,850
she'd only bring you trouble.

36
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,870
She chose to

37
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,660
marry a lousy old man.

38
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,610
What a gold digger.

39
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,910
Do you really think of her
as a virtuous maiden?

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,030
Auntie,

41
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,900
Tietou is obviously distraught.

42
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,430
Please stop nagging at him.

43
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,050
Tietou,

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,010
don't act silly again.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,940
I'm going home.

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Ning Xuexiang,

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,190
I'll chop you up.

48
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,480
Chop you up.

49
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,500
I'll burn down the entire Ning Residence.

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,890
I'll burn you into ashes, you sick animal.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,310
You sick animal,

52
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,409
this isn't over.

53
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,450
Now I understand

54
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,900
why Yinzi brought me

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,250
such nice steamed buns.

56
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,900
It took me so long to figure that out.

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,510
I'm a huge fool.

58
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,660
I'm a huge fool!

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm a huge fool!

60
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,830
I'm a huge fool!

61
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,630
You two were in a relationship for years,

62
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,270
but she just left you for a rich man
without hesitation!

63
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,910
Even this dunderhead cares
more about you than she does!

64
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,900
Leave me alone!

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,200
Her water broke. She's in labor!

66
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,120
Come help her. Come!

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,750
Now,

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,600
go find a midwife

69
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,270
and ask your aunt to come over.

70
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,070
Be quick!

71
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,630
Got it.

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
Bear with it, good girl.

73
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,980
Bear with it.

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,350
Who took your virginity?

75
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,310
Who took it?

76
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,070
Was it Tietou?

77
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,430
Was it Tietou?

78
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,570
Shame on you!

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
Shame on you!

80
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,720
Who?

81
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,010
Who did you sleep with?

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,100
Was it Tietou?

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,760
Did you have sex with him?

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,330
Did you two sleep together?

85
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,000
Where are you going?

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,820
Where?

87
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,560
Tonight, you'll have to either

88
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,370
beat me to death or set me free.

89
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Make your choice.

90
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,730
Do it!

91
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,290
Then we'll be through and even.

92
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,010
Through and even? No way!

93
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,710
Listen up,

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,350
I will never ever...

95
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,450
Keep pushing.

96
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,560
It'll be over soon. Push!

97
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,930
Make it quick. Push!

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,750
Push harder! Push!

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,390
Keep pushing!

100
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,270
The baby's coming out!

101
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,920
Push! Push some more!

102
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,270
Push harder. Push!

103
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,430
Push some more! Harder!

104
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,390
Push! Harder!

105
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,000
The baby is coming out.

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,680
Push! No screaming!

107
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,160
Push! Push!

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
It's almost done. Push!

109
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,920
Push!

110
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,160
Push again! Don't scream!

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Push some more! Harder!

112
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,250
Harder! Push again!

113
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,510
Push!

114
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,390
Push!

115
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,120
The baby's coming out. Push!

116
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,190
The baby is born!

117
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
It's born!

118
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,990
Go back in and eat something.

119
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,190
I'm heading home now.

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Silly Tiao.

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,210
Look.

122
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,950
Your baby.

123
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,470
This kid

124
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,500
looks a bit like Tietou

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,870
when he was little.

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,790
Maybe it's God's idea.

127
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,310
Silly Tiao is not my daughter-in-law.

128
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,150
But you still came help her.

129
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,000
You should be rewarded.

130
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,720
Please take the money.

131
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,270
I can't take it.

132
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,840
Just consider what I did
as a gesture of kindness.

133
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,500
But, but...

134
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,030
How else can I express my gratitude?

135
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm leaving now.

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,670
Thank you for the help.

137
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,150
No need to see me off.

138
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,670
Thank you so much.

139
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,270
Bye.

140
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,260
There, there.

141
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
What a blessed dunderhead.

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
Silly Tiao,

143
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
how capable of you. Look!

144
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,770
You just gave birth to a pretty boy.

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,620
You haven't realized it, huh?

146
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,360
What a pity.

147
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,440
This boy

148
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,320
has nothing to do with me,

149
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,570
as he's not

150
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
related to me.

151
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,830
Sister-in-law,

152
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,110
if it hadn't been for you and Xiuxiu,

153
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,070
Silly Tiao

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,950
would have given birth on the ground.

155
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,270
We only did you a small favor.

156
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
Seeing you in trouble,

157
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,680
how could we two not come to help?

158
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,270
Silly Tiao,

159
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,960
how lucky you are.

160
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,440
So many people came to help you today.

161
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,350
Tomorrow, remember to

162
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,080
bring the baby back
to your father and mother.

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,710
Don't come here again.

164
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,030
Calm down.

165
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,630
We're not sending you to your father's.

166
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,930
Don't mention her father.

167
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,730
H-Her father abuses her so often

168
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,570
that she's terrified of him.

169
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,840
There are bruises all over her body,

170
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,320
with new ones appearing every day.

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,450
But she can't stay at my place forever.

172
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,490
This baby isn't my grandson.

173
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,910
Mother,

174
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,980
she just gave birth. Don't mess with her!

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,810
Tietou,

176
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,590
come in and see the baby!

177
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,390
No!

178
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,930
It's not my son anyway.

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,170
H-Hold the baby.

180
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Hold him. Come on.

181
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,140
I'll make some egg soup.

182
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,370
Silly Tiao needs nutrition.

183
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,430
Careful.

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,790
What an adorable baby.

185
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,510
Xiu.

186
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
You must be tired

187
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,960
after all the hard work.

188
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,940
Leave her there.

189
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,550
You should get some rest.

190
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,310
I'm all good.

191
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Xiuxiu, Tietou's mother!

192
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,910
Come out here for a look!

193
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,700
Quickly, check this out!

194
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,320
Look, Xiuxiu.

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,870
Mother.

196
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,490
Who left these things here?

197
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,110
Why didn't they say anything?

198
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,360
This is bad.

199
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
The worst

200
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,120
has happened.

201
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,390
What's wrong?

202
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,600
We'll be stuck with Silly Tiao forever!

203
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,100
The man who impregnated Silly Tiao

204
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,550
must've left these things here

205
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,790
to settle the matter

206
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,010
and to shift his responsibility.

207
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,110
How do we deal with what's ahead?

208
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,840
Auntie,

209
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,910
these gifts don't seem to be

210
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,360
from only one family.

211
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,080
I bet people all believe

212
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,390
Tietou has nothing to do with the baby.

213
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,250
Since you've taken Silly Tiao in,

214
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,680
everyone sees you as role models now.

215
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,280
Xiuxiu is right.

216
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,910
This is their way

217
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,930
to show respect for you and Tietou.

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,780
They acted in good faith then.

219
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,610
But why did they do it in a covert manner?

220
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,360
The gift giver would be considered

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,810
as the baby's father
like you assumed just now.

222
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,870
People wanted to do good,
but out of fear of being suspected,

223
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,400
they dared not make a sound.

224
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,210
That makes sense.

225
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,720
On behalf of Tietou and his mother,

226
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,910
and Silly Tiao and her son,
I extend my gratitude to you!

227
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,390
Many thanks to all of you!

228
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,650
Why are you up so early?

229
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,650
I couldn't sleep,

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,690
so I thought I'd get up
and mend your socks.

231
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,030
Don't tire yourself out.

232
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,320
I can go without socks.

233
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,510
That won't do.

234
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,220
Autum is approaching.

235
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,670
The cold attacks one's feet first.

236
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,060
Socks protect your feet.

237
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,120
You can wear them in all four seasons.

238
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,550
Okay.

239
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,650
I'll wear socks.

240
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,640
How time flies.

241
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,330
Silly Tiao's son is nearly a month old.

242
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,720
Indeed.

243
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,490
Her baby cries really loud.

244
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,100
However, Silly Tiao is

245
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,420
always hanging out.

246
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,240
The baby can't get fed
when she's not found.

247
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,750
Giving birth

248
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,230
is no easy job for women.

249
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,650
It scares me just hearing about it.

250
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,140
I'd hate to put you through

251
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,570
that kind of suffering.

252
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,240
I won't be afraid
as long as you're with me.

253
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,750
Rest assured. I'll definitely be with you.

254
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,440
That's not what I mean.

255
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,710
You don't have to be with me in labor.

256
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,040
I just want you to be somewhere around.

257
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,270
Even if the sky falls,

258
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,270
I won't leave you.

259
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,450
What's that noise outside?

260
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,360
Must be refugees coming again.

261
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,270
Go home and pack your stuff. Quick!

262
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,810
Let's go home and pack up our things!

263
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,520
Why are you guys running?

264
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,440
Niu Wu, Niu Wu!

265
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,270
Why is everyone running? What happened?

266
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,240
Auntie,
there came a new group of refugees.

267
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,270
These starving people began looting
as they arrived!

268
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,630
I need to hide my chickens now.

269
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,550
Okay. Off you go!

270
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
Dajiao!

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,840
Honey!

272
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,750
Hide the chickens in the house!

273
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,330
There are refugees again!

274
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,790
This is awful.

275
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,440
Stop!

276
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,170
Stop right there!

277
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,320
Don't you know

278
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,930
to breastfeed your baby?

279
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,480
Come with me! Come!

280
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,270
There, there.

281
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,080
Come!

282
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,890
Mother!

283
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,210
The baby peed!

284
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,620
Stop her from running away!

285
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,280
Silly Tiao!

286
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,320
Feed him,

287
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,670
or I'll beat you up!

288
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,630
Silly Tiao!

289
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,560
Come here!

290
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,850
What a hungry baby!

291
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,590
Stop! I said stop!

292
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,140
Alright.

293
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,900
Don't cry.

294
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,320
Don't cry.

295
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,270
It fits well.

296
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,930
How lovely.

297
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,240
Yinzi,

298
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,510
is Master

299
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,540
treating you well?

300
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,150
Mother,

301
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
you can't stop the medication,

302
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,150
even if you feel better.

303
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,440
I brought some fabric.

304
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
You can make new clothes

305
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
for Father and my siblings.

306
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
Look.

307
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,510
Yinzi,

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,620
don't bring so much stuff home next time.

309
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
I stashed half of the supplies

310
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,780
you brought us every time.

311
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,690
When we have plenty,

312
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,070
we must prepare for
the times when we don't.

313
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,700
Mother,

314
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,870
no need to save up anything.

315
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,720
As long as there's food
in the Ning family,

316
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,520
I promise you guys won't starve.

317
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,730
This is for Father.

318
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,550
You're visiting again, Yinzi.

319
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,010
Father.

320
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,870
Hey,

321
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,470
why are you back from the fields so early?

322
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,120
I felt hungry,

323
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
so I came back for a bite.

324
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,800
I'll go back to work after I eat, okay?

325
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,270
What tasty food did you bring?

326
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,690
Here it is.

327
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,220
What's inside?

328
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,119
Steamed buns.

329
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,079
This is Mother's medicine.

330
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,960
She has recovered.
She doesn't need medicine anymore.

331
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,290
Just bring us more food.

332
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,650
This is nice.

333
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,880
Father,

334
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,109
though my marriage is

335
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,410
a guarantee for food,

336
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,880
we can't count on

337
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,359
others' charity to get by.

338
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,960
We must have our dignity.

339
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,880
Others?

340
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,400
What others?

341
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,710
It's your husband we're talking about.

342
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,580
And we are your family.

343
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,280
There is no such person as...

344
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,310
Mother, I'm leaving.

345
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,880
Yinzi,

346
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,200
why not dine with us?

347
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,880
No!

348
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,320
All you care about is food.

349
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,380
What about your own daughter?

350
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,240
What now?

351
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
She's married to Ning Xuexiang.

352
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,440
We get to be fed and clothed.

353
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
Isn't it nice?

354
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,920
You visited your parents again
this afternoon, right?

355
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
You go back there

356
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
every a few days,

357
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,850
with gifts and supplies.

358
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,830
Is my home a treasure chest
for your family?

359
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,230
I earned what I gave them.

360
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,830
Did you carry loads

361
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
or farm for me?

362
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,750
How did you earn all that?

363
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,860
Isn't the answer obvious?

364
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,960
I provide for you.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
I give you jewelry.

366
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,240
But you've never been nice to me.

367
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,350
Come here!

368
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,880
Come here now.

369
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,810
I'll give you the satisfaction tonight,

370
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,110
only if you pay me five silver dollars.

371
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,770
Your life is secured.
What do you want money for?

372
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,590
I'm sending my sister to school.

373
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,070
What?

374
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,000
Are you trading sex for money now?

375
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,920
I won't pay up.

376
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,720
Put the light out and come sleep.

377
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,130
You think you can sleep with me for free?

378
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,550
Stop it!

379
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,350
I asked you for money but you refused.

380
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,450
Now you want to sleep with me?

381
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,790
You old pervert, I'll make you suffer!

382
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,950
Please don't hurt me.

383
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,670
Pay up!

384
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,350
I will pay you.

385
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,670
Five silver dollars!

386
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,390
Okay, five.

387
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,810
Where's the money?

388
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,350
Right at your back.

389
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,170
Four coins only.

390
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,540
I need one more.

391
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,370
Just one coin short.

392
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll give it to you later.

393
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,270
The last one is yours.

394
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,550
I've had enough.

395
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,350
I'm full.

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,350
Just eat it.

397
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,590
Don't you think
I know if you're really full?

398
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,390
You won't starve under my watch.

399
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,160
However, Susu,

400
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,400
this is a difficult time for us.

401
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,770
Though there are grain reserves,

402
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,700
we can't eat the way we used to.

403
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,830
I've also told Qing

404
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,810
to cook just enough

405
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,180
to fill our stomaches.

406
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,070
Besides,

407
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,090
you can't order dishes like before.

408
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,670
Okay?

409
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm not a child anymore.

410
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,640
You've taught me a lot.

411
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
I've learned to manage our lives.

412
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,490
The refugees outside

413
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,900
would even eat rats.

414
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,950
To avoid ending up like them,

415
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,830
we must not squander anything.

416
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,900
It's not that serious yet.

417
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,130
But I'm glad you're aware of

418
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,790
the importance of frugality.

419
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,070
Eat it.

420
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,270
Xiaoqin?

421
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Xiaoqin!

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,200
Food is ready!

423
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,090
It's time to eat.

424
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,160
Xiuxiu, come and eat.

425
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,450
Coming right up!

426
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,510
Dajiao,

427
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
what is Xiuxiu doing?

428
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,000
Didn't you tell her
not to work the fields?

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,530
She can't stand being idle.

430
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,160
She insisted on
watering the red sage seedlings.

431
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,540
You two eat first.
Don't let her see your bowls.

432
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,870
Or she'll again refuse
the thicker congee prepared for her.

433
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,570
Xiuxiu.

434
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,560
You're quite far along now.

435
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,250
Don't get up and down so often.

436
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,310
Mother,

437
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,370
I'm nearly eight months pregnant now.
I'm fine.

438
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,960
You were still working the fields
on the day

439
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,090
before giving birth to Dajiao, right?

440
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,090
The red sage seedlings I planted

441
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,420
have sprouted.

442
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,650
Look how well they're growing.

443
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,160
Indeed.

444
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,720
I just wanted to water them.

445
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,000
Unlike me,

446
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,920
you were raised in a wealthy family.

447
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,440
I started farming since I was little.

448
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
I respond well

449
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,770
to tough situations.

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,510
Mother,

451
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
I'm also responding well

452
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,850
to tough situations now, aren't I?

453
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,090
Listen,

454
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,130
when you married into our family,

455
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,550
I could immediately tell

456
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,980
that you're a resilient girl.

457
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,180
I know that by heart.

458
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,090
Go eat something.

459
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,610
Give it to me.

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Careful.

461
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,640
Go and eat.

462
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,270
Be careful.

463
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,110
Come eat.

464
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,470
Have you eaten yours?

465
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Mother brought us

466
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,470
thick congee today.

467
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,750
Father and I can handle all the work.

468
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,590
Are you tired?

469
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,650
Not really.

470
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,700
Be seated. Stay put.

471
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,070
Xiuxiu!

472
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,270
Why not eat it?

473
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,070
Mother,

474
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,130
I'm not hungry.

475
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,430
You have to eat it anyway.

476
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Mother...

477
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,550
Mother,

478
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,310
how can you
save all the thick congee for me?

479
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,720
Father and Dajiao are
working hard all day.

480
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,310
They deserve better than
watery runny congee.

481
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,710
It's just not fair, is it?

482
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,570
Nothing gets past you.

483
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,700
Just don't worry and eat.

484
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,310
You and your baby need nutrition.

485
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,350
Your father is growing all this sorghum

486
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,210
especially for you and your baby.

487
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,820
We'll harvest it soon

488
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,230
and save up more food

489
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,510
to make sure you and the baby be fed.

490
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,510
You two won't go hungry.

491
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,490
You're treating me so well.

492
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,440
Silly girl,

493
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,240
you're my family.

494
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,800
How can I not treat you well?

495
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,590
-Xiuxiu!
-Eat up.

496
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,440
Xiuxiu!

497
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,320
Auntie Feng.

498
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,070
Susu.

499
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,810
Xiuxiu!

500
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,610
Xiuxiu,

501
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,160
I brought you a steamed bun.

502
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,090
It's still warm.

503
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,920
Eat it.

504
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,250
This is good for you.

505
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,760
Eat it, Xiu.

506
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,330
Come on.

507
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,640
Eat it.

508
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,210
What's wrong, Xiu?

509
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,030
Auntie Feng, what's wrong with my sister?

510
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,890
What happened?

511
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,440
What's wrong, Xiu?

512
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,610
Xiuxiu, what's going on?

513
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,690
What's up, Xiu?

514
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,640
What's the matter, Xiu?

515
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,410
What happened?

516
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,240
Dajiao!

517
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,070
Dajiao!

518
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,490
Xiuxiu, you're bleeding! How come?

519
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,690
Look!

520
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,750
Xiu,

521
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,820
you'll be fine.

522
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm taking you home.

523
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,750
You'll be fine, Xiu.

524
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,720
Old Man!

525
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,240
I think

526
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
X-Xiu is having a miscarriage.

527
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,210
Xiuxiu,

528
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,510
drink the herbal medicine

529
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,920
while it's warm.

530
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,370
I'm begging you, Xiuxiu.

531
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,360
Let me feed you, okay?

532
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,170
What can we do now, Auntie Feng?

533
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
She didn't eat enough food.

534
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
Every time,

535
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,310
she'd save a bite

536
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,700
for those around her.

537
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,610
That's why she collapsed.

538
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,760
I failed my grandson.

539
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,310
He never ate anything good.

540
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,790
My grandson...

541
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,440
Stop whining.

542
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,160
Xiuxiu is very distressed.

543
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,750
Kill that hen now.

544
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,750
I'll go boil some water.

545
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,030
Kill that hen?

546
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,360
Isn't it laying eggs?

547
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,190
What else do we have to trade for salt?

548
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,720
But Xiuxiu needs nutrition now,
doesn't she?

549
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,110
You're right.

550
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,270
She needs

551
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,160
nutrition.

552
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,320
But what's the use of that?

553
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,470
My grandson...

554
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,860
won't be brought back to life.

555
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,010
He's forever gone.

556
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,900
What was I doing during all that time?

557
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,500
I should've taken better care of you.

558
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,030
Xiuxiu, I'll be right back.

559
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,490
Son,

560
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,090
Mom and Dad don't have the luck

561
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,710
to see you grow up.

562
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,750
Hope you won't resent us for that.

563
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,700
Dajiao,

564
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
I cooked the hen for Xiuxiu.

565
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,070
Go inside and keep her company.

566
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,570
Make sure she drinks that herb medicine.

567
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,110
Dajiao,

568
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,400
listen up.

569
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,750
Maybe that baby

570
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,070
wasn't meant to be our family.

571
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,880
Tell Xiu

572
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,430
that you two are young
and you'll have children in the future.

573
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,790
Xiu,

574
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,300
how are you?

575
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Where did you...

576
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,040
bury him?

577
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,820
I buried him...

578
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,130
at the Turtle Hill.

579
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,830
Good.

580
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,920
He can rest in peace now.

581
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,830
We failed him.

582
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,790
It was my fault

583
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,810
for not taking better care of you two.

584
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,270
The fault was all mine.

585
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,770
Why didn't I cook this hen earlier?

586
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,840
The baby...

587
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,440
How unfortunate.

588
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,530
Honey,

589
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,440
don't bring that up again from today on.

590
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,350
Xiuxiu and Dajiao are more upset than us.

591
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,940
Don't make them feel worse.

592
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,110
Hurry up and cook.

593
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,230
Xiu had better cry with a full stomach.

594
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,930
Why are you crying?

595
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,560
Tell me what you need.

596
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,680
Father,

597
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,310
Xiuxiu had a miscarriage.

598
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,350
Look at

599
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,080
our comfortable lives

600
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,240
in contrast to hers in the Feng family!

601
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,400
As I said, the Feng family

602
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,970
is treating your sister

603
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,840
like a draft animal!

604
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,440
That's not true.

605
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,740
Auntie Feng said

606
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,080
Xiuxiu always skimped on her meals.

607
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,880
She's nothing but skin and bones now.

608
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,010
That's why the miscarriage happened.

609
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,760
But what can I do to help?

610
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,820
Is it your intent

611
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,050
to upset me by telling me such bad news?

612
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,590
She won't take anything I give her,

613
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,440
not even a grain of rice,

614
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,210
as if she doesn't remember who raised her.

615
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,640
I can't help.

616
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,360
She just wouldn't appreciate

617
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,090
any friendly gestures of mine.

618
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,480
Send her some food,

619
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,190
if you still think of yourself
as her father!

620
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,190
Susu!

621
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,840
Give me the keys.

622
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,400
The keys to what?

623
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,550
The granaries.

624
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,100
I'll pack some food for Xiuxiu.
Give me the keys.

625
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,160
Will she accept it?

626
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,550
Yes, if I give it to her. Alright?

627
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,080
The keys!

628
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,240
B-But it's still from the Ning family.

629
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,600
I know her well. Don't even bother!

630
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,640
Where are you going?

631
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,790
Xiu,

632
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,440
what a fat hen

633
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,790
we raised.

634
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,010
The soup made with it looks golden.

635
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,010
Get up and eat it.

636
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,440
Dajiao,

637
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,580
go have dinner.

638
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,120
Let me spend some time with Xiu.

639
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,550
Xiu,

640
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,000
this is hardly a big deal.

641
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,150
Think about the women in the village.

642
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,200
Many have been through the same thing.

643
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
Take me as an example.

644
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,820
I had a miscarriage

645
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,860
before and after Dajiao was born,
respectively.

646
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,590
That's why he's a only child.

647
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,160
It's alright.

648
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,000
You're still young.

649
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,880
You can have many children in the future.

650
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
Get up now.

651
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,490
You need to eat something.

652
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,070
Come on.

653
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,810
Let me feed you.

654
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,710
Mother,

655
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm so sorry!

656
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm sorry...

657
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,730
It was my fault.

658
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,590
What was I doing?

659
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,260
How could I let you suffer?

660
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,610
You deserved better.

661
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
What happened was my fault.

662
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,070
It was all my fault.

663
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,590
My fault!

664
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
Xiu...

665
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,940
Xiu...

666
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,880
Poor Xiu...

667
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,690
Uncle Feng!

668
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,090
-Here you are.
-Dajiao.

669
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,290
This is for my sister.

670
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,840
It'll help her recover.

671
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,650
Since Xiuxiu refuses food
from the Ning family,

672
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,710
I brought this from my parents' place.

673
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,150
Okay.

674
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:23,840
To the chicken coop.

675
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,440
Father!

676
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,949
We can't take these.

677
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,400
Why not?

678
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
My sister went in poor health

679
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,880
because you skimped on food.

680
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,780
I failed to

681
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,590
take good care of her and the baby.

682
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,610
But we must not

683
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,800
live on others' charity.

684
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,270
Which is more important to you,

685
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,130
your pride or my sister's health?

686
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,370
Xiuxiu.

687
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,320
Please don't be mad at Dajiao.

688
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,090
Just like your sister,

689
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,690
he never takes charity.

690
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,920
Xiuxiu,

691
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
I know you're in agony.

692
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,440
We just hope you

693
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,030
to get well soon.

694
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,170
You can repay us when you feel better.

695
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,820
Okay?

696
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,710
Xiuxiu...

697
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,190
Er!

698
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,760
I'm here to visit Xiuxiu.

699
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,100
Here are some eggs. Hope they'll help.

700
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,660
Thank you.

701
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,910
How is she?

702
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Not good?

703
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,960
Xiuxiu,

704
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,320
I'm not going in.

705
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,090
Take care and get well soon!

706
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,370
We're all waiting for your herb talks!

707
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,110
Dajiao,

708
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,440
put yourself together.

709
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,560
Look on the bright side.

710
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,660
As the old saying goes,

711
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,190
where there's life,

712
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
there's hope.

713
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,000
Crops

714
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,510
will grow

715
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
where there is

716
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,200
fertile land and seeds.

717
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,280
Dajiao,

718
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,790
I'm feeling much better now.

719
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,300
We'll have a place
for our son in our hearts.

720
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,230
As his parents,

721
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,720
we'll always remember him.

722
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,100
He would know that.

723
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,030
It's time to wipe away our tears.

724
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,320
Our lives must go on.

725
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,750
We have Father and Mother.

726
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,050
Then please eat something.

727
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,320
Dajiao, stop beating yourself up.

728
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,340
We have to move on at some point.

729
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,400
I know.

730
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,190
But my heart...

731
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,470
still aches for you.

732
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,230
Where is Tietou?

733
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,670
There, there.

734
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,400
There isn't food around.

735
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Let's bring him home.

736
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Is he full?

737
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,190
My goodness.

738
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,500
I was worried sick.

739
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,940
Not hearing the baby cry,

740
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,530
I thought he was taken away by a beast.

741
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,250
Auntie,

742
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,070
the baby was crying hard,

743
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,670
so Xiuxiu brought him back.

744
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,270
He got hungry.

745
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:16,770
He did.

746
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,360
Silly Tiao ran off again,

747
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,320
so Tietou and I went looking for her
to feed the baby.

748
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,800
But

749
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,760
she was nowhere to be found.

750
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,360
When I got home,

751
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,840
I didn't hear Kela cry.

752
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,280
I thought

753
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,150
Silly Tiao had come back to feed him.

754
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,680
Xiuxiu fed him rice paste and egg yolk.

755
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,870
He stopped crying when he was full.

756
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,530
What did you just call the baby?

757
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
I'm barely educated.

758
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,230
But I did think of a name for him.

759
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,230
It's "Kela."

760
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,450
Sounds good.
I believe the baby will grow well.

761
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,520
He's asleep.

762
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
He's asleep.

763
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,390
Let's get out of here.

764
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,930
Xiuxiu will look after the baby
for a while.

765
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,730
That's great.

766
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,190
I just hope she won't be tired out.

767
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,710
My mother's been busy
working the fields all day long.

768
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,230
Silly Tiao always neglects the baby.

769
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,710
I carried the baby with me the other day

770
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,670
to do farm work.

771
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,830
Babies can't be left unattended.

772
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,600
Who are you to complain about me?

773
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,760
I have chores to do,
besides looking after the baby.

774
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,550
There's too much on my plate,
don't you think?

775
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,040
Carrying that kid around...

776
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,100
What good can it do?

777
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,850
God knows who we're raising this kid for.

778
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,850
Stop saying that.

779
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,120
Can we throw away

780
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,670
a living soul?

781
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,730
No more bickering.

782
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,280
Why not let Xiuxiu take care of

783
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,110
the baby for a few days?

784
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,320
As you know,

785
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,290
she and I just...

786
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:32,770
Dajiao,

787
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,430
I can't thank you enough.

788
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,360
You do owe thanks to them.

789
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,360
How considerate of Dajiao and Xiuxiu.

790
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
One thing seems odd to me.

791
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,360
When I can't get Silly Tiao back
to breastfeed the baby,

792
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,110
I've tried giving him rice paste
like Xiuxiu did.

793
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,480
Yet he just wouldn't stop crying.

794
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,510
He never eats it.

795
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,880
But when Xiu fed him just now,

796
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,010
he ate it right away.

797
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,190
Alright.

798
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,680
Thank you and Xiuxiu.

799
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,040
We're heading home now.

800
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,590
Bye.

801
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,360
Careful, careful.

802
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,980
Where are we going?

803
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,710
Look!

804
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,920
These are...

805
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,550
red sage seedlings?

806
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,990
Over these months,

807
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,680
you've been working

808
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,320
long hours on these?

809
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,550
I saw how much

810
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,030
you suffered

811
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,640
for growing red sage.

812
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,340
I thought to myself

813
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,870
that I must do a good job

814
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,010
growing these seedlings for you.

815
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,280
When I had questions,

816
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,960
I'd ask Chang Chun.
