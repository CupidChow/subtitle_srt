[Episode 1]

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:51,009
[Spring, 1986]

4
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,950
The place under my feet

5
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,070
is Turtle Hill.

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,770
Here

7
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,290
not only has my bones and blood,

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,150
but also this heavenly stone.

9
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
My husband told me

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,030
this ox figure is
a rare stone from heaven.

11
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,920
It sits here silently,

12
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,590
guarding

13
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,560
Ox Temple Village.

14
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,280
Time flies.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
In the blink of an eye,

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,610
more than 50 years have passed.

17
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,760
But I

18
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,730
still often think of

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,050
the year that changed my life.

20
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,470
[December 8, 1926; Solar term: Major Snow]
[Ox Temple Village, Shandong]

21
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,430
It was the 4th day of winter in
the 15th year of Republic of China.

22
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,720
According to the calendar,

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,710
it was a good day.

24
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,250
I remember

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,430
the solar term that day

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,910
was Major Snow.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,980
Mother Nature really did
make it snow that day.

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,030
[Ning Residence]

29
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,280
That day

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,520
was also my wedding day.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,280
Sister-in-law, can you help me
see if it's straight?

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,250
It's straight.

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,590
It's like this hairpin was made for you.

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,050
My sister is so beautiful.

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,910
Of course.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,030
She's like a city girl.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,630
The Fei family's ancestors
must've done great deeds

38
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,000
to let Fei Wendian marry such a good wife.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,070
Xiuxiu!

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,120
Xiuxiu, are you done?

41
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,120
How is it?

42
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,000
My daughter is so pretty.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,910
Mother, everyone says I look like you
when you were young.

44
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Do I look even more like you now?

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,360
Who said that?

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,060
You're much prettier than me.

47
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,800
Just wait.

48
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,079

to pick you up in their sedan.

51
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,110
By the way, Lianye,

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,310
have you prepared
the soup balls to be eaten

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,520
before going on the sedan?

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,400
It's still early. I'll do it later.

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
Go now.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,910
Okay.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,800
Mother, let me taste it for Xiuxiu.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,470
Enough.

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,930
You gravitate toward food.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,380
It's not your wedding.

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,300
Close the door.

62
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,490
Why?

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,680

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,040
Here.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,320
This is ten silver coins.

66
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,730
It's my personal savings,
not from your father.

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,430
Although the Fei family is a rich family,

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,360
it's better to have your own money.

69
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,070
Your father didn't prepare any for you,

70
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,480
but I can't let you down.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,070

-No.
-Be good.

75
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,390
I have nowhere to spend it.

76
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,920
Alright.

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,270
Xiuxiu, just take it,

78
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,510
or else Father'll ask for it back.

79
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,190
Be good.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,310
Yes.

81
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,600
Don't let your father know.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,190
Otherwise, he'll quarrel with me again.

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,159
Thank you, Mother.

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,560
Let me test
the locks of these boxes for you.

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,870
Mother, I greased

86
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,720
all the keys again.

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,270
I've tested them. They all work.

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,480
I still have to test them.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,409
I'll feel relieved after testing.

90
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,960
This dowry lock brings good luck

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,390

this marriage

95
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,470
was delayed for three years.

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,430
I guess

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,530
that Mrs. Fei

Done.

I've tested it all for you.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Take it.

Mother,

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,690
you told me

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,680
a sister-in-law is like a mother.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,480
I know the etiquette.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,530

the Fei family

I won't disappoint you all.

133
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,070

I'm back, Madam!

135
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,770
You picked up Wendian?

136
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,870
Madam,

137
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,430
I went to the inn in the county.

138
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,750
But the people there said

139
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,240
Young Master left before dawn.

140
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,190
I asked them where he went.

141
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,590
They didn't know either.

142
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,990
Where else can he go?

143
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,080
He probably got impatient and walked back.

144
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
Did you see him on your way back?

145
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,160
No.

146
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,850
Then he took a shortcut.

147
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,990
It's snowing hard.

148
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,700
Small paths aren't walkable.

169

I'm here to sincerely give my blessings.

170

on me now?

175

N-No.

No, don't.

Don’t mind me. I mean well.

184

Cut the crap.

185
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,820
If you don't settle the debt today,

186
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,150
don't blame me
for not leaving you a way out.

the clothes on my back.

191

I had to pawn a hoe

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
to afford

193
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,750
half a box of wedding pastries.

194
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,840
But the shop doesn't sell half-boxes!

195
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,270
They sold me some crumbs.

196
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,750
How could I give them to you?

197
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,790
I just thought...

198
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,670
I'll kill you!

199
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,190
When your father was alive,

200
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,200
your family

201
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,150
didn't fare too badly.

202
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,840
Look at you now.

203
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,520
You can't even compare
with your brother Feng Er.

204
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,750
And you're trying all these tricks.

205
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,910
For the sake of my dead father,

206
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,430
please forgive me.

207
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,890
Please spare me.

208
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,840
With interest, 15 silver dollars in total.

209
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,100
Go back and prepare it.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,750
Fifteen silver dollars?

211
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,600
Who is shouting here?

212
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,790
It's the wedding day.

213
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,330
Honey,

214
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,720
the groom's family will be here soon.

215
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,300
Don't let others see this.
It's embarrassing.

216
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,010
Don't worry about this.

217
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,870
How dare he lie to me on the wedding day?

218
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,470
You know it's the wedding day?

219
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,480
You should accumulate merits
for your daughter.

220
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,200
Get up.

221
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,200
Kneel.

222
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Kneel!

223
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,820
Kuangzi, see the guest out.

224
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,780
Kuangzi, everyone who comes is a guests.

225
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,960
Make some tea.

226
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,870
Bring the wedding pastries

227
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,960
to host everyone.

228
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,150
Okay, Madam.

229
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,180
Get up.

230
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,410
Madam, my whole family

231
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,270
will never forget your kindness.

232
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,180
Go. Go.

233
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,120
Grandpa Ox,

234
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,900
thank you for blessing
Ox Temple Village.

235
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,630
Let me sweep the snow for you,

236
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,150
so that

237
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,350
you're more relaxed.

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
Great snow!

239
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
This year's wheat

240
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,720
sleeps in the snow.

241
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,510
Next year, I'll sleep with a bun.

242
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,270
Threading and flour for your face.

243
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,390
I'll eat your wedding pastries this year

244
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,550
and your red eggs next year.

245
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,000
Threading and flour for your face.

246
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,030
I can't hide it from you.

247
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
I feel

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,270
so sad inside.

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,360
I've liked Xiuxiu since childhood.

250
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,030
But she's marrying Fei Wendian now.

251
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,030
Go, go, go!

252
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
What's wrong?

253
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,100
Go away.

254
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,910
I was wondering who's fighting
for poop with my dog.

255
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,390
It’s Master Ning!

256
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,240
Why don't you wait for it to freeze?

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't you think it stinks?

258
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,890
Dung is created from grain.

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,510
Grain births dung.

260
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,830
You think it's dirty,

261
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,130
but I think you poor people
don't understand at all.

262
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,550
When you harvest more grain,

263
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
you’ll know how good this dung is.

264
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,930
Mr. Ning,

265
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,390
isn’t today your daughter’s wedding day?

266
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,320
Why did you come out to pick up dung?

267
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,600
You know today is
my daughter's wedding day.

268
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,580
But some people

269
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,570
still pretend to be ignorant

270
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,080
and pretend not to see.

271
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,670
They don't even give me wedding pastries.

272
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,850
I feel so humiliated.

273
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,870
I came out today

274
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,390
to make those forgetful people

275
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,290
remember

276
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,870
that I, Ning Xuexiang,

277
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,440
don't marry off my daughter every day.

278
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,870
You have so many sharecroppers.

279
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,050
Can you eat it all?

280
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,310
That's my business.

281
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,280
If you don't gift me,

282
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,980
you'll be in trouble.

283
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,960
You'll be in trouble!

284
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,630
I've never seen

285
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,410
a moneybag with 700 mu of land
be so petty.

286
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,810
He even came out to beg for pastries.

287
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,070
Does he really need it?

288
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,150
Won't he feel

289
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,980
ashamed?

290
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,360
He doesn't care about that.

291
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,510
He carries a dung basket
just stepping out of his door.

292
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,240
He wishes he can crawl up an ox's butt.

293
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,900
For him, shame isn't as useful

294
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
as a pile of turd.

295
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm in trouble too.

296
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,150
I pawned the hoe

297
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,840
to buy him some wedding pastries.

298
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,720
Pawned the hoe?

299
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,290
Are you not going to farm in spring?

300
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,120
I'll try to redeem it then.

301
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,780
What else?

302
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,410
Stingy.

303
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,120
Our fault for renting his land.

304
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,870
This time,

305
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,230
the village's two wealthy families
are getting married.

306
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,550
If we don't go congratulate them,

307
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,550
I don't think it'll be okay.

308
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,840
No way.

309
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,150
Just farm our own land well.

310
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,510
Besides,

311
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,700
we're not sharecroppers.

312
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,130
We don't have to be concerned about them.

313
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,920
It's not like you can go empty-handed.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,370
You'd have to buy two bags
of wedding pastries.

315
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,530
That costs money.

316
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,150
Why should we spend money?

317
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,440
What's the basis?

318
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,360
Not a cent

319
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
of my money can be spent.

320
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Remember,

321
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,840
my money

322
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,370
can only be used to buy land.

323
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,210
I'll listen to you.

324
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,850
Let's just not interact with anyone.

325
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
When Dajiao gets married,

326
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,290
don't get mad if people don't come.

327
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,840
Gets married?

328
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,440
Who knows

329
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,270
if our daughter-in-law

330
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,720
is even born yet?

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
No one

332
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,960
catches our son's eye.

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,710
What?

334
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,670
He wants to marry a fairy?

335
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,670
Making your master go to your door
to ask for gifts.

336
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,950
I bet you can't stand the embarassment.

337
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,040
You going to the Ning or Fei Residence?

338
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,680
Where are they going?

339
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,670
You don't look familiar.

340
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,390
I'm from Gourd Glen.

341
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,560
My husband's name is Zhang Guanli.

342
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,510
This is my daughter.

343
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
My boss

344
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,670
owes money

345
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,390
to Master Ning

346
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,920
and it hasn’t been paid yet.

347
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,020
Today,

348
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,380
I heard it's your daughter's wedding day.

349
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,270
My boss told me

350
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,390
to get a wagon

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,870
to deliver gifts.

352
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,320
These are wedding pastries

353
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,920
I bought for you from the city
from Huaxinzhai.

354
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
It's delicious.

355
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Thank you.

356
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,720
I've heard my husband mention

357
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Zhang Guanli's name before.

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
I forgot.

359
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
You went through trouble
on this snowy day.

360
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,870
Mrs. Li, make tea for the guests.

361
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,150
Okay.

362
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,030
No, no.

363
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,200
No need.

364
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,600
I’m not thirsty.

365
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,550
Madam.

366
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,109
I...

367
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,750
I heard that

368
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,920
Miss Xiuxiu

369
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,640
looks like you

370
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,400
when you were young.

371
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,829
She looks like a fairy.

372
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,920
We've never seen her.

373
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,880
When she heard that I'm coming here,

374
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,230
my ignorant daughter

375
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,970
insisted on seeing the fairy.

376
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,030
Do you

377
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,890
think

378
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,560
you can

379
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
let me see her first?

380
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,270
Madam.

381
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,960
Alright.

382
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,270
Mrs. Li, take them there.

383
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes, Madam.

384
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,960
Ladies, follow me.

385
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,070
Come.

386
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,920
Look.

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,380
Xiuxiu, my bangs

388
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,140
are the neatest and prettiest
when you cut them.

389
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,020
Our little crybaby is going to cry again.

390
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,940
You won't look good if you cry.

391
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Miss Xiuxiu,

392
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,960
female guests are here.

393
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,460
They want to see the bride.

394
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,640
Madam said they can see.

395
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,000
My sister is not a mirror.

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
You can't see her
just because you wanna.

397
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,590
It's fine, let them in.

398
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,400
Come in.

399
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,310
Xiuxiu,

400
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,930
put the covering on.

401
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,920
Mother has agreed. No need.

402
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,070
You must. Don't show them your face.

403
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,200
Hello, ladies.

404
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,590
If you want to see the bride,
I have to ask first

405
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,920
where you came from.

406
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,720
Chicken Ridge.

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,880
What are you doing here?

408
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,680
For this.

409
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,190
Xiuxiu!

410
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,930
Let's go.

411
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,590
Don't move.

412
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,680
Kidnapping!

413
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,070
Help! The bride has been kidnapped!

414
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
Kidnapping!

415
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,990
The bandits kidnapped her!

416
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,960
Xiuxiu has been kidnapped!

417
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,740
Over there!

418
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,480
That way!

419
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,310
Don't go!

420
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,740
Give my daughter back!

421
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,920
Madam!

422
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,240
Mother!

423
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,030
Madam!

424
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,790
Go!

425
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,640
Madam!

426
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,620
Mother, where is my sister?

427
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,000
Mother.

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hurry and go!

429
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,450
Get help!

430
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,350
Help! Help!

431
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,030
Hurry!

432
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,830
You're a girl.

433
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,790
What's the use of you chasing?

434
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,750
Kuangzi, go!

435
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,270
Get Kejin back and chase them!

436
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,920
Okay.

437
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,160
Kejin isn't here.

438
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
He didn't come back last night!

439
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,210
Mr. Er.

440
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,960
What's wrong?

441
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,500
Xiuxiu was kidnapped by the bandits!

442
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,820
Nephew, help me chase them!

443
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Go after them! Take a shortcut!

444
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,600
Stop!

445
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,550
Stop!

446
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,270
Hey, buddy.

447
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
Which hill are you from?

448
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
Put down the bride.

449
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,070
Let's talk.

450
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,110
Listen.

451
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,640
My boss

452
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,890
is Big Nose Du.

453
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,610
I'm from Chicken Ridge!

454
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,550
Your bride

455
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,400
is the quick ransom

456
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,730
that I kidnapped today.

457
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,650
We won't torture

458
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
or kill her.

459
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,830
I just want real money.

460
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,290
Five thousand silver dollars!

461
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,290
Before midnight,

462
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,080
deliver it to Chicken Ridge

463
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,850
and I can release her any time.

464
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,400
Buddy!

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,480
That's too much money.

466
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,510
How about this?

467
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,310
Return the bride first.

468
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
Her in-laws

469
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,310
will be here soon.

470
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,190
I'm the head of the village.

471
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,070
My son...

472
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,750
My only son

473
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,790
will go with you

474
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,240
in exchange for the bride.

475
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,440
Father!

476
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,920
Your son?

477
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,240
Is your son a bride?

478
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
You playing me?

479
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,240
I'm telling you,

480
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,210
that girl is in the mountains now.

481
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,510
If I don't get the ransom by midnight,

482
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm gonna

483
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
eat her up!

484
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,440
Buddy!

485
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,120
Let's go.

486
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,830
Let's go, Father.

487
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Go!

488
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,790
That must be Master.

489
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,810
What are you looking at?

490
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,280
Are you laughing at me?

491
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,310
Master, you're back.

492
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,680
Master.

493
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,400
What's up?

494
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,030
Well…

495
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,110
Master, I'll be frank.

496
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,340
Miss Xiuxiu was kidnapped by bandits.

497
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,380
Xiuxiu!

498
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Master is back!

499
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Xiuxiu!

500
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,070
Xiuxiu!

501
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,270
Xiuxiu!

502
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,770
Miser Ning

503
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,920
always has his eyes on
this land and that land.

504
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,510
How about it? Karma hit him!

505
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,270
Yeah.

506
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,400
Honey,

507
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,840
you're finally back.

508
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
What should we do?

509
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
Do something!

510
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,110
Brother.

511
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,240
Honey.

512
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,110
Xiuxiu!

513
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,270
Honey!

514
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,030
Why are you running?

515
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,750
Brother.

516
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,810
Mother, slow down.

517
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,880
Listen to me, honey!

518
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,350
Big Nose Du.

519
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,810
My Xiuxiu!

520
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,550
Honey,

521
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,270
prepare her ransom money!

522
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,110
Girls

523
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
can't spend the night in a bandits' lair.

524
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,310
No matter how innocent she is,

525
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,310
it'll be hard to explain afterward.

526
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,200
How much?

527
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,210
Five thousand.

528
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,450
Five...

529
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,620
Five thousand?

530
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,270
Where can I get that money?

531
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,680
Hurry.

532
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,750
Coming.

533
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,120
What is it?

534
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,340
Close the door.

535
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,570
Why close the door
in the middle of the day?

536
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,890
What are you doing with the money?

537
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,080
What do you think?

538
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,660
There is only one thing

539
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,270
that deserves my money.

540
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,070
To buy land?

541
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,790
Who's selling land?

542
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,400
That Xiuxiu

543
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,720
was kidnapped by bandits.

544
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,110
I have to buy land from Miser Ning.

545
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,750
Madam.

546
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
You called for me?

547
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,880
How many guests are here?

548
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,880
Two tables.

549
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,750
There should be more than 20 people.

550
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,400
Mrs. Fei!

551
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,490
Wendian hasn't come back yet?

552
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,770
It's almost the auspicious time.

553
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,190
I think you two should

554
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,560
go out to pick up the bride
at the auspicious time.

555
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,510
Take it easy

556
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,480
on the way back.

557
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,010
Make some time for Wendian.

558
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,630
We'll be relieved

559
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,910
once the bride is here.

560
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,440
Sure.

561
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
I'll get ready

562
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,790
to pick her up.

563
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,310
Pick her up.

564
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,960
Let's go.

565
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,680
Madam Fei!

566
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,110
Something happened!

567
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,110
Something happened!

568
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,310
Something happened.

569
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,240
What happened?

570
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,960
What happened, Gui Yao?

571
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,940
Something happened to Wendian?

572
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,860
Ning Xiuxiu,

573
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,680
the Ning family's daughter.

574
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,130
Are they here to pick up the bride?

575
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,860
Doesn't look like it.

576
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,010
I bet they got the message

577
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,280
and they're here to get answers.

578
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,240
Master,

579
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,500
the in-laws...

580
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,920
The in-laws are here.

581
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,240
The elders are all here.

582
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,470
Greetings.

583
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,950
I was preparing to pick up the bride

584
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,150
when I heard the news.

585
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,070
Mrs. Fei,

586
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,360
our family

587
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,610
is sorry to you.

588
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,320
Auntie, let's not talk about this.

589
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm here to help.

590
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,200
How is it now?

591
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,470
You have a solution?

592
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,200
Uncle Ning.

593
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,260
Sister-in-law, have a seat.

594
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you.

595
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,270
Auntie, here.

596
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,790
Auntie.

597
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,510
It happened in a hurry,

598
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,030
but we can't panic.

599
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
The bandits

600
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,590
chose to kidnap Xiuxiu today.

601
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,320
It must've been planned.

602
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,000
They obviously just want money.

603
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,460
Let's collect money then.

604
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,830
I have some cash.

605
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,270
Borrow some more

606
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,570
and you can definitely reach 500 dollars.

607
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,070
The most important thing now

608
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,130
is to pay the ransom

609
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,090
and save Xiuxiu.

610
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,660
I have more than
100 silver dollars at home.

611
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,270
Collecting here and there will work.

612
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,750
If it's not enough,

613
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,830
ask Chairman Chu of Qingqi Society

614
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,070
and borrow 3,000 more.

615
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,200
Borrow...

616
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,790
You think we don't have to pay them back?

617
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
Besides,

618
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,400
what if I borrowed his money

619
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,590
and

620
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,410
he wanted to add some interest

621
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,070
and asked me to pay it back immediately?

622
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,830
Or if he added other terms,

623
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,760
what should I do?

624
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,400
They outnumber us and have real guns.

625
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,460
This money is

626
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,750
a knife on my neck.

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
But the bandits

628
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,310
chose this time to kidnap her.

629
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,510
Everyone knows

630
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,350
that if a bride

631
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,110
spends the night in a bandits' lair,

632
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,880
then...

633
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,760
I understand.

634
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,790
Honey,

635
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
after midnight,

636
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,640
her in-laws won't accept her anymore.

637
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,350
My Xiuxiu has waited for three years.

638
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,030
Stop talking about midnight!

639
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,510
Didn't Xuerui say

640
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,510
Big Nose Du won't kill

641
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,590
or torture her?

642
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,550
Our daughter will be fine.

643
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Uncle,

644
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,240
it's not the time to sit and wait.

645
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,110
Whether Xiuxiu can

646
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,840
marry into the Fei family or not

647
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,140
is all up to you.

648
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,160
Of course I know.

649
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,590
She is my daughter.

650
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,350
If

651
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,350
we can't get enough money,

652
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,680
Xuexiang, go up the mountain alone

653
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,920
and pay the money we have.

654
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,960
For the rest,

655
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,070
mortgage your land deed.

656
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,000
In the future,

657
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,590
we can exchange the money
for the land deed.

658
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,670
Fourth Uncle is right.

659
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
We can also

660
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,270
bring some grain to the mountain

661
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,240
and ask Big Nose Du for peace.

662
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,840
The grain and land deed

663
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,290
shows our sincerity.

664
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,510
I have grain, too. Take them all.

665
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,930
Grain is

666
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,660
planted and harvested every year.

667
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,120
We can save it again later.

668
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,350
The most important thing now

669
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,920
is Xiuxiu's innocence.

670
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,920
The bandits want money.

671
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,810
If I mortgage the land deed

672
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,110
and give food,

673
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,720
what if they don't want it and kidnap me?

674
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,510
Then you'll have to pay
5,000 dollars twice,

675
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,510
three times.

676
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,140
I've suggested solutions.

677
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,910
I'm old and fatigued.

678
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,240
I’m leaving.

679
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,240
Fourth Uncle.

680
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,310
Grandpa.

681
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,750
[Bandits' Lair]

682
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
The bride

683
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,300
is quite pretty.

684
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,050
I want to see your boss.

685
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:38,930
What?

686
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,160
You girl

687
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,400
are quite bold.

688
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,920
You want to see Boss?

689
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,070
What is it? Tell me.

690
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
Can you let me go first?

691
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,790
I will

692
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,710
give you the money later.

693
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,550
Are you kidding me?

694
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,270
Don't be afraid.

695
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,430
If I let you go,

696
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,550
who will pay me?

697
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,590
I can give you an IOU

698
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,480
or sign a pledge.

699
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,750
Your IOU

700
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,200
is useless!

701
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,160
If your father

702
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,960
doesn't pay me today,

703
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,750
you'll be the bride of everyone here.

704
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,480
Jiu,

705
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,720
keep an eye on her!

706
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,960
Sure thing!

707
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,550
Everyone,

708
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,150
don't take advantage of her!

709
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,270
Bro,

710
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,200
this successful kidnapping

711
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,750
is all thanks to

712
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,810
Miss Ma and Miao Chi.

713
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,190
Thank you, Second Boss.

714
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,590
Thank you, Boss.

715
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,030
I don’t think you'll get

716
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,670
the ransom money.

717
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,480
Father, Mother!

718
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,920
Kejin is back.

719
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,880
I'm back!

720
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,440
Kejin!

721
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,350
You bastard!

722
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,030
Why are you running around

723
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,790
instead of guarding the home?

724
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,030
Father.

725
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,750
Did Big Nose Du do it?

726
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,510
I'll go to the Qingqi Society
to find Chairman Chu

727
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,830
and ask him to bring

728
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,680
all his men

729
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,810
and kill the bandit!

730
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Kejin,

731
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,080
don't get yourself killed.

732
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,680
Be careful, Kejin.

733
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,670
Xuexiang,

734
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,720
even if you don't like it,
I have to tell you the truth.

735
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,180
This probably won't work.

736
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,510
This isn't guarding the village.
It's attacking their lair.

737
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,310
Chairman Chu won't do anything.

738
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,850
Second Uncle is right.

739
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,030
Chairman Chu and Big Nose Du

740
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,640
have always stayed away from each other.

741
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,500
They won't break the rules for us.

742
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,480
This method won't work.

743
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,160
Honey,

744
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,000
sell the house, land, grain.

745
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,650
I won't stop you from selling anything.

746
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,840
I just want you to save Xiuxiu.

747
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,690
You useless

748
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,520
old wretch!

749
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,550
All you do is complain.

750
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,090
Why are you scolding my mother?

751
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,350
She's not wrong to care for her daughter!

752
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,140
My Xiuxiu...

753
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Alright, Mother.

754
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,640
Auntie, since Uncle thinks

755
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,310
Kejin's idea is feasible,

756
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,480
then

757
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,200
don't worry.

758
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,750
Bandits don't cause trouble

759
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,310
every day.

760
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,790
If you can overcome this

761
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,830
without spending a fortune,

762
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,070
then

763
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,830
it must be good karma
from the Ning family's ancestors.

764
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,590
Just

765
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,630
thank them later.

766
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,030
I'll leave now.

767
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,410
Take care.

768
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
It's just that

769
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,400
the days are short now.

770
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,720
It will be dark

771
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,230
in a bit.

772
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,260
I'll wait for your news at home.

773
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,410
Take care.

774
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:32,830
Master.

775
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,640
What are you doing?

776
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,310
I'm looking for Master.

777
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,790
Master is busy. Get out!

778
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Mrs. Fei!

779
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,310
Mrs. Fei!

780
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,020
Is there a solution?

781
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,140
I'm going home to wait for the news.

782
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,530
Why wait at home?

783
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,010
What are you doing here?

784
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,930
Mr. Ning.

785
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,920
Take a look.

786
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,650
I don't mean anything else.

787
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,510
Take it

788
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,310
to save your daughter.

789
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,030
Well, Mr. Ning,

790
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,590
have you

791
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,790
sold

792
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
that land

793
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,830
by the well in the west

794
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,010
of the village?

795
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,739
If not,

796
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,840
can you sell it to me?

797
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,850
See, the land

798
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,929
has spring droughts

799
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,600
and summer floods, right?

800
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,000
It's not worth much.

801
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,840
Well...

802
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Anyway, take this.

803
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,050
Use it for the emergency.

804
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,150
Have you gone mad about wanting land?

805
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,400
Buy it if you want. This is too scary.

806
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,760
Go and ask. Even three-year-old kids know

807
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
the 15 mu of land in the west
is lakebed mud.

808
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,260
There's a harvest no matter what.

809
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,639
Now you say there are spring droughts
and summer floods,

810
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,440
and you want me to give you a few mu?

811
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,960
You can't even afford

812
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,000
a corner of that land!

813
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,440
I think you broke rascals

814
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,550
are just here to

815
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,280
take advantage of me.

816
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,550
Why don't you ask around

817
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,000
who I, Ning Xuexiang, am?

818
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Get him out!

819
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,320
Hey.

820
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,810
I told you.

821
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,840
Don't ask for trouble.

822
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,940
You all go on!

823
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,800
Go on.

824
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,440
Go on.

825
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,840
Disperse.

826
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,590
Mr. Er, what's wrong?

827
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Why are your eyes red?

828
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,550
Mr. Er,

829
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,110
you were trying to take advantage

830
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,170
of something but failed, didn't you?

831
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,320
He wants to save his daughter
without selling his land.

832
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,190
Impossible!

833
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,740
Er, you can’t let him
beat you for nothing.

834
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,880
Madam.

835
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,000
Madam.

836
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,800
Why is the yard so quiet?

837
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Everyone heard

838
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,510
that Xiuxiu was kidnapped by bandits,

839
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,840
so they all nosily went to Ning Residence.

840
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,030
Is Wendian back?

841
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,550
No.

842
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,280
Good.

843
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,100
He can come back later.

844
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,030
When Wendian is back,

845
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,440
keep your mouth shut.

846
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,510
Don't let him know about Xiuxiu.

847
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,400
Got it.

848
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,810
Sister-in-law!

849
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,490
-Young Master is back.
-Sister-in-law.

850
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,320
Give it to me.

851
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,650
Thank you, Steward Liu.

852
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,040
Sister-in-law!

853
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,430
What took you so long?

854
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,030
I wanted to take a shortcut,

855
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,960
but the snow was too heavy
and I couldn't make it.

856
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,030
So I had to go back.

857
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,280
Well, haste makes no progress.

858
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,070
This new hairstyle

859
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,760
and the school's Western suit

860
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
looks so nice.

861
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,000
Sister-in-law,
can I wear this for the wedding?

862
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,110
No way.

863
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,710
The groom should wear the groom's clothes.

864
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,320
I've prepared them for you.

865
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,110
You only get married once in life.

866
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,110
Don't slack off.

867
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,670
Okay, I'll listen to you.

868
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,920
It's so festive.

869
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,630
Sister-in-law, did you manage all this?

870
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,890
Steward Liu and others did it.

871
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,160
Let's go inside.

872
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,150
What happened?

873
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,510
This Miser Ning

874
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,930
would rather lose his daughter
than his land.

875
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,280
He drove me out

876
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,760
and even hit my eye

877
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,030
with that money bag.

878
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
Let me see.

879
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,510
Go away.

880
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,170
If you went out to buy land now,

881
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,070
it's thanks to our ancestors' good karma

882
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,030
that you didn't get beaten up.

883
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,070
Tell me.

884
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,490
If something like this happened to us,

885
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,670
we'd definitely work
to rescue our daughter first.

886
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,030
I'd planned

887
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,880
to quickly buy the land.

888
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,110
I didn’t expect Miser Ning

889
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,880
wouldn't even mention it.

890
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,230
They have cash.

891
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,630
Nonsense.

892
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,510
He has 5,000 silver dollars at home

893
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,370
waiting for bandits to snatch up?

894
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,340
Then why didn't he
sell the land to raise money?

895
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,470
Anyway, it'll be good for his daughter

896
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,710
to stay with the bandits.

897
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,040
What are you talking about?

898
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,400
Something big happened.

899
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,230
The bride Xiuxiu

900
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,670
got kidnapped

901
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,630
by Chicken Ridge's bandits.

902
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,650
What are you doing?

903
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,840
He's going to watch the show.

904
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
Mole Cricket's here.

905
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,710
With Mole Cricket here,

906
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,760
the land deed will be done right.

907
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,000
Let’s see if Ning Xuexiang

908
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,330
will sell the land to redeem his daughter.

909
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,590
Xueshi is here.

910
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,880
I came as soon as I heard the news.

911
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,840
Xuexiang, sell the land now!

912
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,630
Many people in the village
came to me.

913
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,150
They had me come ask.

914
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
If you want to do it,

915
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,190
I'll find a buyer for you.

916
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:43,920
Look.

917
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,150
I've even brought over

918
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,710
the documents for writing a land deed.

919
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,440
Xiuxiu really got kidnapped by bandits?

920
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,360
Of course.

921
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,360
Xiuxiu is really done for now.

922
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,880
You bastard!

923
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,070
Are you still a Ning?

924
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,550
How could you do such an evil thing?

925
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,150
Hey,

926
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,110
what do you mean?

927
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,630
You won't sell the land?

928
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,840
You have money?

929
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,650
It's none of your business.

930
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,590
Get out!

931
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,240
You're unreasonable!

932
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,590
Wolves!

933
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,670
You are just a bunch of greedy wolves!

934
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,670
Listen, that's not the land.

935
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,230
It's my blood! My flesh!

936
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,110
My life!

937
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,990
You all want a bite at any chance.

938
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,230
A bunch of you!

939
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Dream on!

940
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,680
How can you save her
without selling the land?

941
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,510
He's still not selling the land
to save her.

942
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,670
After tonight,

943
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
his daughter will be ruined.

944
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,710
Yeah, seriously.

945
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,840
What a pity.

946
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,670
Seriously.

947
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,140
Disperse.

948
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,760
Here.

949
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,950
Put this on.

950
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,160
It looks good.

951
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,070
If it doesn't fit,

952
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,510
we have to tailor it quickly.

953
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,760
The city folks

954
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,830
like to wear

955
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,510
suits and wedding dresses now.

956
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,320
They really look nice.

957
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,580
After you get married,

958
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,440
you can have
whatever modern style you want.

959
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,400
Not today.

960
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,360
The ancestors are watching.

961
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,080
We have to follow the rules.

962
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Let me see.

963
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,240
Looks great.

964
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,150
Master. Master!

965
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,550
I heard that Eldest Young Master

966
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,320
got kicked out by Chairman Chu

967
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,220
and is going up the mountain
to save Xiuxiu himself.

968
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,660
He took his men

969
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,920
on a shortcut

970
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,600
and are already going west.

971
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh no.

972
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,030
This fool!

973
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,110
He's really on a suicide mission.

974
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,780
Father, think of a way!

975
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,780
So what if you lose your daughter?

976
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,090
You can't lose Kejin too!

977
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,800
Lianye, what are you talking about?

978
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,200
You foul-mouthed woman.

979
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,530
How have we lost Xiuxiu?

980
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,730
Mother, I'm worried.

981
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,840
I want Father to think of a solution.

982
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,920
Honey,

983
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,450
if you don't sell the land,

984
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
I'll go to the bandits' lair.

985
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,920
I'll save my daughter.

986
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,310
If I can't save her,

987
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,150
my daughter and I will die together.

988
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,150
Mother! Mother!

989
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,360
Don't be angry, Mother.

990
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,110
Mother, don't be angry.

991
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,020
What are you doing?

992
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,290
Don't be unreasonable.

993
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,400
She's my daughter too.

994
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,860
I'm just as worried as you.

995
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,920
All right.

996
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,320
I'll go back to my room

997
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,780
to get the land deed's box.

998
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,220
I'll sell the land and raise money.

999
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,600
You two must be tired.

1000
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,760
Go back now.

1001
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,950
I'm going back to my room
to get the land deed's box.

1002
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,750
Xuexiang,

1003
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,630
call me if you need anything.

1004
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,690
Sister-in-law, I'm leaving.

1005
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,320
You coward.

1006
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,650
Why don't you go in?

1007
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,190
I'm not in a hurry.

1008
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,230
I'm worried for the girl.

1009
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,320
It’s getting dark.

1010
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,230
Is Miser Ning really not going to
ransom her?

1011
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,540
She's his daughter.

1012
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,480
He's gotta ransom her no matter what.

1013
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,610
Besides, Miser Ning has 700 mu of land.

1014
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,440
Da Zong,

1015
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,070
I have a favor to ask.

1016
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,320
If no one comes

1017
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,150
and Second Boss finishes up,

1018
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,190
you gotta let me have my go.

1019
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,230
You go tell Second Boss.

1020
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,730
We’ll all go easy on you.

1021
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,230
How dare I?
