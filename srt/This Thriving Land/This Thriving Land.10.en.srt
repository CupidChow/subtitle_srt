[This Thriving Land]

2
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,910
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,870
It's not really a discussion, to be fair.

4
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,400
I want to beg you for a favor.

5
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,920
No need to beg—just say it.

6
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,560
Pacing, pacing...

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,430
You're making me dizzy. Stop it!

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,870
It's been quite a while now.

9
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,700
Dajiao, go eavesdrop—

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,030
see if they mention the land.

11
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
No, I'm not going.

12
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,280
They're sisters chatting—

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,910
what am I supposed to do there?

14
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,310
Is Miss Susu not leaving?

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,900
No, she's staying.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,640
Let them have a good chat.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,260
Mother.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,030
Let me sleep here tonight.

19
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,930
Yes, that's right.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,190
Let them chat—

21
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,430
they'll get to the land soon enough.

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,470
What's so hard about this?

23
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,240
You should've said so earlier.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,710
Perhaps Feng Er and Feng Dajiao
already have land!

25
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,170
It's not that simple.

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,710
I don't want Mrs. Fei

27
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,030
to think I'd only rent your land

28
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,190
because I'm desperate.

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,120
Xiuxiu, listen—

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,240
this is just land rental,

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,590
you're not taking it from her!

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,250
You'll still pay rent, right?

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,150
I always hear Mrs. Fei

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,520
telling that Beard Liu:

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,240
"lease the land to someone,

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,870
go write up a rental contract,

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,590
and it's done!" Simple as that.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,590
What's the difference who rents it?

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,030
No wonder Mother
used to say you were sharp!

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,590
You really are—

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,970
it's such a big deal,

42
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,700
and you made it crystal clear
in three sentences!

43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,630
Will you help me
communicate with Mrs. Fei?

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't you worry—I've got this!

45
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,680
Is it cold?

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,740
Your bed is so warm!

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,910
As soon as I sit down here,

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,000
I feel warm all over.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
I really don't want to leave now.

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Don't go, then.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,900
Stay here for a couple nights.

52
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,250
Xiu...

53
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,610
Mrs. Fei's here to take Susu home.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,020
-Xiuxiu.
-Why is she here?

55
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,250
Susu's been out all day,

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
and she still isn't back yet.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
I got worried, so I came over.

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,740
Susu. Let's go home.

59
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,070
I was thinking of staying
at Xiu's place tonight.

60
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,070
Mrs. Fei.

61
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,710
Will you let Susu stay for the night?

62
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,320
Susu,

63
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,530
let's not be so willful, okay?

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,350
Look how late it is.

65
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,310
You're still here, bothering

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,579
your sister and her husband!

67
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,440
If you wanna chat,

68
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
there'll be plenty of time later.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,900
You may come back another day.

70
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,329
Come on here.

71
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,970
I even brought your coat.

72
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,190
Mrs. Fei.

73
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,800
It's our

74
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,520
first New Year apart.

75
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,190
We just want to talk the night through—

76
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,100
I'll have her home by sunrise.

77
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,460
Please, Mrs. Fei...

78
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,080
at my sister's place—

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,110
just one night. That's all.

80
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,050
After all this time,
you still won't address me properly?

81
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,770
Who's really family here?

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,910
Get down here.

83
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,880
Come on.

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,220
Xiuxiu, I don't wanna go...

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,300
Alright then... we're heading back.

86
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,420
Take it.

87
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,240
Wind's fierce out there—
no need to see us off.

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,130
We're leaving.

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,460
Put your coat on.

90
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,300
Take care on your way.

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,100
We're off now!

92
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,300
Can't bear to part with Susu?

93
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,470
I'll fetch her back tomorrow then.

94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,880
This Mrs. Fei

95
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,090
is the sturdiest lock in the Fei family.

96
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,600
Everything—needing locking or not—

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,060
gets bolted shut under her watch.

98
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,410
Now I can't even tell...

99
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,190
Was letting Susu back to the Fei Residence

100
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,130
really the right thing to do.

101
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,720
Here, Sister-in-law.

102
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,150
What's with suddenly wanting
to drink with me?

103
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,180
Nothing special.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,730
Just wanted to share a cup.

105
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,710
Sister-in-law, a toast to you.

106
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,460
If there's something,
just say it straight.

107
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,060
No need for roundabout talk.

108
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,890
If it's something I can help with,
of course I will.

109
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,850
You saw right through me.

110
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,830
Then I'll speak plainly—

111
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,550
Feng Er wants to rent some good land
from you.

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Did Feng Er put you up to this,

113
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,250
or was it your sister?

114
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,530
Sister-in-law, you're so sharp!

115
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,490
It was my sister.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
So your sister really plans

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,380
to keep living with Feng Dajiao?

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,160
Of course!

119
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,530
My brother-in-law treats her so well now.

120
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,650
And I can see

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,410
my sister genuinely loves him.

122
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,440
They're truly happy together now!

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
That's good then.

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,810
Sister-in-law,

125
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,160
about the land...

126
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,620
I agree.

127
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,590
Really?

128
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,380
When have I ever lied to you?

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,330
Besides, it's all family land.

130
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,200
Just a matter of lifting a finger.

131
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,460
You've already promised them.

132
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,950
I won't make you lose face.

133
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,680
Thank you, Sister-in-law!

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,740
I'll toast you on my sister's behalf.

135
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
What's the deal, Feng Si?

136
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,480
I told Kuangzi to invite you for drinks

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,970
right after New Year's Eve—

138
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,290
but it took me two days to track you down!

139
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,030
Big shot now, huh?
Our drinks ain't fancy enough?

140
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,830
Oh, I—I wouldn't dare!

141
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
If you wouldn't dare,
then why are you here in my place?

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,600
Come here.

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,190
Sit!

144
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,200
Take a seat.

145
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,470
Come on.

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,460
I'll just... sit here.

147
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,890
Our fathers

148
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,830
dealt with each other
for half their lives.

149
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,120
I still remember—

150
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,790
around the New Year time,

151
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,330
the only one drinking
and talking with my father...

152
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,300
was yours.

153
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,770
What?

154
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,340
You married off both daughters,

155
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,409
and now at New Year's—

156
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,100
not even your son is home
to drink and talk with you?

157
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,750
Guess it's just us two now,

158
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,370
eating, drinking, and
shooting the breeze—

159
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,940
like my old man and yours back then.

160
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
I remember...

161
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,750
when your dad drank at our place,

162
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,060
we'd always pack him
some peanuts when he left

163
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,650
for his youngest son

164
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,540
at home.

165
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,290
Is that true?

166
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,430
Did you eat them all?

167
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,070
Did you?

168
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,790
With mother and father gone...

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,000
no one left in this world
who truly cares for me.

170
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,030
Your father—now there was a real farmer.

171
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,250
Everyone for miles knew his name.

172
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,679
Feng the Iron Pole—

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,830
strong as an ox, that man.

174
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,130
I remember when my father

175
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,840
young and hot-headed,

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
challenged yours
to a wheat-cutting contest.

177
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,270
That sun...

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,530
merciless.

179
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,400
But your father just stripped his shirt,
soaked it in water,

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,310
tied it around his head,

181
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,180
bent his back—

182
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,720
and cleared 3 mu
without a break.

183
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,290
Your father

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
was truly admirable.

185
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,890
He left you a great inheritance too.

186
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,240
Come on,

187
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,930
Feng Si.

188
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,910
Let's drink to our fathers—yours and mine.

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,220
Our families, generation after generation,

190
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,430
rooted in this same village...

191
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,400
That's the kind of bond
that weathers all storms.

192
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,640
Here you go.

193
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,540
You like this.

194
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,410
Have more!

195
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,660
All this talk of 'old bonds'...

196
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,250
yet you're still

197
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,780
hounding me over debts?

198
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,080
Eyeing my last few mus too?

199
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,720
You fool.

200
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,980
You think I covet your land?

201
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,650
A sharp mind like yours—

202
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,790
can't you see what's really happening?

203
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm doing this
for your father's sake!

204
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,900
He gave you all the good fields,

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,500
but tell me—can you even
farm or maintain them?

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,530
You mentioned that
when Dajiao was just born,

207
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,470
his feet were big as a four-year-old's?

208
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,030
He had one foot come out first at birth—

209
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,230
scared the midwife half to death!

210
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,050
But the real wonder?

211
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,000
This child could sprint

212
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,730
around the yard at eight months old.

213
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,790
Those feet grew wild—

214
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,100
I couldn't sew shoes fast enough.

215
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,090
By nine, he wore his father's size!

216
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,580
With those giant paddles,

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,200
no village kid

218
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,220
at his age could

219
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,120
outrun him.

220
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,820
Mountain climbs,
tree scaling, and river fishing.

221
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,410
he's always number 1.

222
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,790
Folks said those big feet
kept him rooted.

223
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,170
I remember—

224
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,270
back when we were kids,

225
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,820
he once raced my brother's horse!

226
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,350
I was the one who stopped it.

227
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,620
I said it was unfair.

228
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,180
So what happened next?

229
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,860
Did his feet just stop growing?

230
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,070
Stopped at 18...

231
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,230
though I swear lately
they've shrunk a tad.

232
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,550
Then tell me more about

233
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,220
those immortals.

234
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,910
Why the rush?

235
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,970
Are you so eager to learn
about Dajiao's legend?

236
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
If you're tired, we can stop for now.

237
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,150
Not at all.

238
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,340
Talking about my boy? Never tired!

239
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,270
Back when Dajiao was five,

240
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,740
it was also a winter.

241
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,030
Under Grandpa Ox, west of the village,

242
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,630
he saved a starving beggar, passed out,

243
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,430
days without food or water,

244
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,030
rags barely hanging off him,

245
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,390
face gaunt,

246
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,500
barely breathing,

247
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,270
almost a goner.

248
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,620
Kind-hearted Dajiao

249
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,800
kept running back and forth

250
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,270
from the house

251
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,070
with steamed buns and hot water,

252
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,740
eventually dragging that man back
from death's door.

253
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,070
When the man woke, he didn't thank Dajiao.

254
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,070
Just made him kneel, kowtow,
and call him master.

255
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,070
And Dajiao? He did it.

256
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,910
That man slept 7 days

257
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,860
in our woodshed,

258
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,620
in the hay pile.

259
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,430
By day, he'd take Dajiao
around everywhere.

260
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,550
Then, on the 7th day,

261
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,270
that man vanished without a word.

262
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,190
No idea where he went.

263
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,310
After that,

264
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,620
your father-in-law and I started noticing—

265
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,310
our boy had new skills.

266
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,910
He could cure a sick ox,

267
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,860
spot-on.

268
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,860
He could read the clouds
to predict weather.

269
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,610
But he picked up a strange habit too.

270
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,990
Every few days, he'd go sweep

271
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,060
around the Grandpa Ox statue,
clean it up real nice.

272
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,300
Even made offerings during festivals.

273
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,960
Folks laughed, called him crazy.

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,390
He didn't care.

275
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,880
When he was little, I asked him,

276
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,910
"Why do you do this?"

277
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,620
He told me, "My master's still here.

278
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,860
The Grandpa Ox is my master."

279
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,100
When he got older,
he stopped talking about it.

280
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,920
But I've always wondered—

281
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,880
was that an immortal showing him the way?

282
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,220
Good girl.

283
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,790
You're such a smart girl!

284
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,740
You spun it even better than I did—see?

285
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,950
I learned it all from you.

286
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,220
Not at all.

287
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,910
That's really nice.

288
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,270
Back when Dajiao was little,
he was such a good boy—

289
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,390
so dutiful, so filial,

290
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,340
and a real talent in the fields.

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,220
And now he married you.

292
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Although you're a fine lady—

293
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,790
you take to everything just right.

294
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,740
your future's brighter than sunshine.

295
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,430
You both are really calm.

296
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,390
What's going on?

297
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,390
I want Xiuxiu

298
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,340
to visit her younger sister.

299
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,030
-For what?
-For what?

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,310
For the land obviously!

301
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,150
Otherwise—you think it's for you?

302
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,000
Have you heard about it?

303
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,670
The Cao family
started surveying land for deeds.

304
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,410
I suppose, next step,

305
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,640
the big landlords will follow soon.

306
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,030
If the Fei family does the same…

307
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,130
We're done! The good lands will vanish!

308
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,070
That's why we must send Xiuxiu.

309
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,130
We've got connections—let's use it.

310
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,270
Father.

311
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,210
Didn't Susu agree just the other day?

312
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,280
Let's give her time
to discuss it with Mrs. Fei first.

313
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,910
What's the point of going now
if they haven't sorted things out yet?

314
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,390
We'll just end up a laughingstock!

315
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,860
True.

316
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,620
Be patient.

317
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,100
Look at you—eyes popping so wide!

318
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,620
Quit scaring us like that.

319
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
Xiuxiu already said

320
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,340
she'll wait for the right time.

321
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,090
It's only Day 3 of New Year—

322
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,260
let people at least
finish their celebration!

323
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,460
Your father-in-law,

324
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,290
the moment land is mentioned,

325
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,570
he goes off like a monkey's ass on fire!

326
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,710
Stop that ass saying!

327
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,100
Okay.

328
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,150
Alright.

329
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,270
My bad. It's my bad.

330
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,130
I shouldn't have undermined you—

331
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,030
this… this head of the family dignity—

332
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,620
especially in front of the youngsters.

333
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,080
Enough with the nonsense.

334
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,220
Anyway—

335
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,150
where's Dajiao?

336
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,480
Tietou called him over,

337
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,620
saying they needed to check
his 13 mu of land—

338
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,820
to decide what to plant for quick cash.

339
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,480
I‘ve seen it for years—

340
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,700
Feng Si

341
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,910
out there working odd jobs:

342
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,740
hosting weddings,
funerals, running errands...

343
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,310
No doubt,

344
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,850
you're a true man of the world,

345
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,550
all about pomp and circumstance.

346
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,550
Honestly, sticking you in a field
is a waste of talent.

347
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,190
When the family split the land,

348
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,930
you got the best plots—

349
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,220
so you'd thrive

350
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,100
with a better life.

351
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,620
But now look!

352
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,820
That worthless land

353
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,070
feels like it's…

354
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,860
like it's got you leashed, huh?

355
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,310
What a shame.

356
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,310
I used to have over 20 mu—

357
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,970
all handed to you.

358
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,670
Now I'm left with just 4 mu.

359
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,250
I've failed my father…

360
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,910
Feng Si,

361
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,980
do you still remember

362
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,670
what your father said on his deathbed?

363
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,820
Sell 5 mu to me.

364
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,700
Your father knew—

365
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,740
I honor old ties.

366
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
I'd nurture your land right:

367
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,550
rest it three years, ease it two…

368
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,390
But that's not something you could do.

369
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,700
First, you have no idea about it.

370
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,340
Second,

371
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,690
it's indeed a waste of talent.

372
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,490
You belong out there,

373
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,300
chasing quick cash—

374
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,490
the faster you earn,
the sharper you'll get.

375
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,430
Enough talk.

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,550
Do whatever you want—

377
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,910
not my problem.

378
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,450
Here. Drink.

379
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,089
Feng Si,

380
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,589
here's a thought—

381
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,060
why not hand that land to me?

382
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll tend it proper.

383
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,560
Come harvest,

384
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,980
send your wife and kids

385
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,500
to collect their share.

386
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,430
You keep hustling out there,
making fast cash.

387
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,430
Everybody wins.

388
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,260
Are we done drinking?

389
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,980
Feng Si,

390
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,320
look here—

391
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,540
this is your land deed.

392
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,760
Once the land's restored,

393
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,330
I'll return it to you.

394
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,850
You'll return it to me?

395
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,770
Not now—I can't give it yet.

396
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,630
Here's the thing:

397
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,870
when you're tired of hustling out there,

398
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
ready to retire back home,

399
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,310
that's when I'll return it.

400
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,710
If I handed it over now,

401
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,170
you'd just gamble it away—

402
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,210
and all my effort would be wasted!

403
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,150
But give me your current plot,

404
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,830
and I've done the math—

405
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,390
with what you've already signed over,

406
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,540
I can throw in extra bushels yearly.

407
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,780
That's not an issue here.

408
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,040
From then on, your family wouldn't even
need to touch a hoe.

409
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,430
I've always said—

410
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,300
I won't end up like Feng Er,

411
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,630
face buried in dirt,
obsessed with planting crops.

412
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,490
He's got a lump of soil for brains.

413
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,400
My brother,

414
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,390
you're right.

415
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,980
I've got to chase fast money.

416
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,430
Feng Si,

417
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,130
press your thumb here—
we'll each keep a copy.

418
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,260
No take-backs.

419
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,740
You'll be the first in this whole village
to live easy.

420
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,460
No take-backs.

421
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,200
No farming!

422
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,190
Chase fast money!

423
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,060
Are you giving me money right now?

424
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,260
For these 4 mu of land,

425
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,940
I'll pay top price—

426
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,780
5 silver dollars per mu.

427
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,010
Four times five makes twenty.

428
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,980
You owe me 15 dollars.

429
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,850
Press your thumb here,

430
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,580
take 5 dollars now,

431
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,490
and we're square.

432
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,910
Kuangzi.

433
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,060
It's settled.

434
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,150
Master.

435
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,990
Send him off—

436
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,430
and pack him all the peanuts.

437
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,650
Oh, and wrap up
that legless chicken too.

438
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,110
Okay.

439
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Wait for me, then.

440
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,750
My brother,

441
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,460
we get to drink till the world goes soft.

442
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,070
This is it—no more drinks
with the Feng family for me,

443
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,630
not today, not ever.

444
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,250
Have some now.

445
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,430
Back so late—

446
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,320
did you and Tietou settle on the crops?

447
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,980
Tietou was stalling…

448
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,830
I knew something was off!

449
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,540
Turns out—he can't even afford

450
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,700
this year's seeds.

451
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,790
What's more,

452
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,370
Tietou's mom owes money left and right—

453
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
asked around for credit on seeds,

454
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,830
but no one's willing to provide on credit.

455
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,260
What to do then?

456
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,890
I thought he would hit me up for money—

457
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,370
but he didn't mention a word till the end.

458
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,630
I guess

459
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,390
Tietou values you as a brother
and cares about you—

460
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,980
He's afraid borrowing money
would just make things awkward.

461
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,780
Tietou isn't that complicated—

462
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,330
he's just too proud to spit it out.

463
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,740
If only he could get seed money
without having to beg…

464
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,350
That would be really nice.

465
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,260
True.

466
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,780
Help a man work,

467
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,000
not just feed his poverty.

468
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,390
But where's this easy money
he's supposed to make?

469
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,630
If it existed,
we'd have jumped on it already.

470
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,790
Weaving reed rain cloaks?

471
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,450
Not exactly the season for it.

472
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,370
Besides,

473
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,870
that Humpback Guo won't even take

474
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,430
Tietou's mother's cloaks—

475
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,350
says they're full of splinters,

476
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,460
itch to wear.

477
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,790
Here—take a look at my weaving.

478
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,260
This rain reed rain cloak's woven tight!

479
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,790
How is it?

480
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,200
No wonder mother's been singing
your praises lately.

481
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,330
She taught me well.

482
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,350
Look at this!

483
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,150
I told you to wrap it with cloth—

484
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,260
why wouldn't you do that?

485
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,590
Wrapping cloth messes up the weave—

486
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,390
Mother says,

487
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,670
winter reeds

488
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,340
are not as pliant.

489
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,350
All beginners struggle.

490
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,390
I'll be fine with more experience.

491
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,110
Let's just stop, alright?

492
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,540
If you really must weave,
wait till after harvest.

493
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,450
I won't let your hands

494
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,270
turn into vulture claws!

495
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,140
They'll end up like vulture claws someday.

496
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,350
So be it.

497
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,670
From now on,

498
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,500
I'll handle the money hustle.

499
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,110
Worst case—

500
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,470
I'll haul goods with Humpback Guo.

501
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,930
I don't want you to suffer this grind.

502
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,060
Now you got me thinking—

503
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,180
what if we send Tietou
to haul goods with Humpback Guo?

504
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,140
That's an idea!

505
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,100
Xiu—

506
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,380
Today's Start of Spring.

507
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,820
Mother asks you
to bite of the ritual radish first.

508
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,870
Back home on the Start of Spring,

509
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,300
Mother would make me chomp radishes, too—

510
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,500
said it'd shake off spring drowsiness.

511
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,800
What's so funny?

512
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,110
Mother says

513
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,670
this spring radish is also called
Descendant Radish.

514
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,150
You eat it,

515
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,260
so she can

516
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,070
have a grandbaby sooner.

517
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,720
Now chew the radish—no more lip!

518
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,300
Oh—

519
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,260
and Father's testing the spring's breath.

520
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,700
What?

521
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,150
Move it, move it!

522
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,410

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,430
One strike—rains and winds obey!

555
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,430
One strike—rains and winds obey!

556
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,540
I remember that spring—

557
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,780
the first time in my life

558
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,780
I truly felt the testing
of spring's breath.

559
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,830
♪ Race toward the vast unknown ♪

560
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,230
The first time I sensed

561
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,670
♪ Our sweat soaking time's satchel ♪

562
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,910
the land's urgent thirst for sowing.

563
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
And I saw—

564
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,430
♪ How long a life must stretch ♪

565
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,840
how the farmers,
reading the soil's shifts,

566
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,110
♪ I measure it in golden grain ♪

567
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,190
showed their fierce,
tender care for this earth.

568
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,060
♪ Light a lantern, look back ♪

569
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,740
They listened to

570
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,780
every faint pulse of the ground,

571
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,640
and labored to nourish

572
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,830
♪ The land's rings etch
the mountains' spine ♪

573
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,060
each flicker of life in it.

574
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,000
That's when I understood:

575
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,590
♪ Holding up the undying sun ♪

576
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,300
this land

577
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,590
♪ Gifting us spring light
and wheat waves ♪

578
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,980
isn't just

579
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,190
the farmers' lifeline.

580
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,110
It's the very place

581
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,460
where they root their souls.

582
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,190
Everyone's here,

583
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,350
the New Year's celebration is done,
so let's settle rents.

584
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,280
If you missed last year's payment,

585
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,540
you lose 30% of your leased land.

586
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,060
Missed two years for last year
and the year before?

587
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,480
Half your plot's gone.

588
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,670
But if

589
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,590
you insist on keeping the land,

590
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,870
this year's rent

591
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,950
goes up by one extra bushel.

592
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,910
As everyone knows,

593
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
our Madam
is the fairest landlord

594
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,920
among neighbor villages.

595
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,720
Am I right about it?

596
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,750
Yes, that's true.

597
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,870
Now—if you understand,

598
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,830
step up and sign
the new lease.

599
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,110
Thumbprint here.

600
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,430
Come up here.

601
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,280
I'll do it.

602
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,950
Madam is here!

603
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,870
Mrs. Fei.

604
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
Tietou's mother,

605
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,200
here to talk to me again?

606
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,590
Madam, please—

607
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
have some mercy on us.

608
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,390
We paid our rent last year,

609
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,220
and this year too.

610
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,150
It's just…
when that no-good Tietou's father

611
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,110
got sick,

612
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,980
we borrowed a bit extra from you.

613
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,910
If not for those old debts—

614
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,170
Old debts, new debts—
debts all the same.

615
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,300
Your family's never paid rent in full,

616
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,800
and every year
I've rounded down for you.

617
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,460
But I can't keep swallowing losses.

618
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,140
This year—

619
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,450
you'll decide: plant or not,

620
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,220
but under my terms.

621
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,080
We surly plant.

622
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,110
I'll go talk to Tietou—
we'll find a way.

623
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,660
The land must be sown…
it must.

624
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,430
Beard Liu,

625
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,870
if Feng Er arrives, show him in.

626
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,680
Roger that.

627
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,080
Madam!

628
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,330
Hold on there, Feng Er!

629
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:47,740
Madam.

630
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,700
Madam requests your presence inside
for a conversation.

631
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,350
Sure.

632
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,340
Hold on please.

633
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,330
Since this is your first year
of leasing our land,

634
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:53,630
Yes.

635
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,700
Madam wishes

636
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,740
to clarify certain expectations.

637
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,350
By the way,

638
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,410
she'll also discuss
autumn harvest procedures in detail.

639
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,000
Thank you, Big Jowl.

640
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,150
Thanks a lot.

641
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,080
You're welcome.

642
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,170
Watch the way.

643
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Come on in.

644
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,400
Xiu, he's here.

645
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:15,970
Come in.

646
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,380
Xiuxiu, don't mess with me—

647
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,090
that Humpback Guo
swears

648
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
he'll only team up

649
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,550
with his own blood.

650
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,310
Humpback Guo was just joking—

651
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,450
all talk, no bite.

652
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,140
Look—

653
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,220
I packed you a bundle.

654
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,770
This padded jacket?

655
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,610
your brother wore it last winter,

656
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,000
but I've ripped out the old lining
and scrubbed it clean.

657
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,260
If you don't mind hand-me-downs,

658
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,460
it'll do for the road.

659
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,830
Did it actually work?

660
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,120
Great, let me try.

661
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,880
No rush.

662
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,400
Now, there are rules on the road—

663
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,330
you'll need to hear Dajiao's instructions.

664
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,820
Once he's briefed you properly,

665
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,550
go to Humpback Guo's place
and sign the contract.

666
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,310
Long as it puts cash in my hand,

667
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll follow any damn rule.

668
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,500
Xiuxiu,

669
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,990
does it fit on me?

670
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:06,900
Yes, it does.

671
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,250
Looks better on you
than it ever did on me.

672
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:23,700
Settled.

673
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,280
It's settled.

674
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,470
What's settled?

675
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,310
Mrs. Fei agreed—

676
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,740
they'll lease us the land!

677
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,980
Did she mention which plot of land?

678
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,350
She didn't specify. Just said
she'd think it over.

679
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,260
Screw the details—

680
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,740
long as we get the land!

681
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,060
Over 10 mu of land!

682
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,320
Deed will be signed in three days,
with land to be received.

683
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,500
Our daughter-in-law's a gem—

684
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,580
pretty face,

685
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,430
sharper wits.

686
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
Rarer than a firefly in winter!

687
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,300
Whose kin is she?

688
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,360
The Feng family's prize, that's who!

689
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,950
Of course.

690
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,110
We've got 18 mu now—

691
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,220
add Mrs. Fei's dozen or so,

692
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,830
we'll be sleeping right
in the fields soon.

693
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,110
Dajiao's mother!

694
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,670
Cook the meals

695
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,680
and deliver them to the field!

696
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,250
Still awake?

697
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,260
I've already slept a full round!

698
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,740
Can't sleep.

699
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Just thinking—

700
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,460
all that new land…

701
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,350
my heart's pounding like a drum!

702
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,350
No rest tonight.

703
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,950
It's a done deal—

704
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,500
no need to panic.

705
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,700
A woman's mind—

706
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,060
so many things

707
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,060
going on in my own.

708
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,870
Dajiao,

709
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,500
I've done the sums—

710
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,700
with these extra 10 mu
from Mrs. Fei,

711
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,700
if the harvest's decent,

712
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,300
we'll cover the rent

713
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,070
and have grain to spare.

714
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,110
Spare grain means profit.

715
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,220
Profit means

716
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,700
I can buy a few more fields.

717
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,550
Add those to our 18 mu now…

718
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,820
we'll top 20 mus!

719
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,500
Now, with more than 10 mu
of new land to work on,

720
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,230
I can make the most of my energy.

721
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,920
There's more land to farm now.

722
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,750
I'm worried
that it might tire you and Father.

723
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,300
Tiredness doesn't bother me.

724
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,900
Not having enough workload
is my only concern.

725
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,390
I have more than
10 mu of land in my house.

726
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,660
What wonderful news!

727
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,070
But I've thought it over.

728
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,110
No matter how hard you two men sweat,
it won't be enough.

729
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,590
We got to share a plow team,

730
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,150
using their livestock.

731
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,300
Dajiao,

732
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,950
you might need to have a talk with Zhuzi.

733
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,520
His house is close to ours,

734
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,190
and our fields are not far apart.

735
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,670
If we team up in using livestock,

736
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,430
shall the payment in money
or grain?

737
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,290
We need to agree on it beforehand.

738
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,300
I've always dreamed

739
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,540
of owning an ox.

740
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,350
With one,

741
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,330
we'd sow whenever we want to.

742
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,020
Buying an ox? Brilliant!

743
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,240
Nothing beats an ox—

744
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,850
saves labor, saves sweat, hauls goods,

745
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,510
and tills fields like a champ!

746
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,150
I'm just saying—

747
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,740
not like I've got the money.

748
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,870
My money is earmarked
for land.

749
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,020
I have no money.

750
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,150
Then tell me—

751
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,740
isn't buying land
meant for a better life?

752
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,220
How's an ox different?

753
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,380
What's the divide?

754
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,700
Here's my thinking—

755
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,110
sharing an ox with Zhuzi's family
works fine.

756
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,150
Come harvest,
we'll settle accounts…

757
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,740
That saves ourselves
the price of a whole damn ox!

758
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,350
I've heard good brothers,
dear neighbors,

759
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,260
turn to bitter enemies

760
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,190
over shared plow teams.

761
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,780
Overthink it,
and you'll drown in trouble.

762
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
With these muscles of mine,

763
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,380
would 10 mu extra be an issue?

764
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,150
Come spring, I'll break that soil!

765
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,110
With the ox,

766
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,700
the strength of yours and father's

767
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,430
can be saved for better things.

768
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,190
Wouldn't a lighter load
be sweet?

769
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,250
A lighter load? Ha!

770
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,390
Idleness and me—we're strangers.

771
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,870
Dajiao's right—

772
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,910
a real farmer can't sit idle.

773
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,440
The soil's where we belong.

774
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,390
I just don't get it—

775
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,560
what's wrong with buying an ox?

776
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,220
It'll work for you!

777
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,960
After all, men worth more than beasts.

778
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,800
Well said!

779
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,670
Men outweigh beasts!

780
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,980
Xiuxiu cares for you both,

781
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,230
and you're too deaf to hear it.

782
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,620
I think Xiuxiu is right.

783
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,940
With extra land, if not an ox,

784
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,980
what should you buy?

785
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,040
Want an ox? You buy it! I have no money.

786
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,100
Oh, I heard it—

787
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,580
your silver dollars in the cash box

788
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,110
are screaming your name with every rattle!

789
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,909
Is that so?

790
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
I wanna buy an ox.

791
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,070
I wanna buy an ox. Ox!

792
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,630
Why didn't I hear anything?

793
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,909
Enough!

794
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,179
Buy or not, that's your call.

795
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,350
I'm done— off to check the fields.

796
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Put on that hat—don't catch a chill.

797
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:41,659
Xiu,

798
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,460
I know you meant well

799
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,400
by what you said today—

800
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,980
you're striving for a better life.

801
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,040
But buying livestock…
that‘s no small decision.

802
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,949
Haven't you heard the saying?

803
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,880
"A fortune counts for nothing
if it walks on hooves."

804
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,960
One plague hits,

805
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
and the mightiest beast
drops dead—

806
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,840
there goes your silver
down the river.

807
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,800
Xiuxiu…
you're upset, aren't you?

808
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,910
No, I'm not.

809
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,290
Get some sleep.

810
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,410
Fine ox! Fine ox!

811
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,030
Step right up and see!

812
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,620
Prime four-year-old beast—

813
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,350
though its horn-tip's chipped,

814
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,430
it'll plow straight as an arrow!

815
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,230
Come take a look!

816
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,270
Zhang Hoof!
Stop your hollering—

817
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,870
how many days
have you hawked this beast?

818
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,270
Exactly!

819
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,870
Who would buy a single-horned ox?

820
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,580
True.

821
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,270
So what?

822
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,790
I'll sell my single-horned ox my way.

823
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,140
Not your business.

824
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,160
If it won't sell… I'll butcher it
for meat.

825
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,110
Got a problem?

826
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,580
Check out the single-horned ox!

827
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,140
Have a look!

828
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,800
I'll admit—it's a fine beast…

829
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,170
pity about that missing horn.

830
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,460
Exactly!

831
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,540
Every day it's unsold,

832
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,820
it guzzles good grain.

833
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,100
Slaughtering it is just a problem of time.

834
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,830
Exactly!

835
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,830
How much is this ox?

836
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,790
Ah, here!

837
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,200
Miss Xiuxiu. What sharp eyes!

838
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,650
A true judge of cattle.

839
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,500
This ox is thick fat,

840
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,660
with solid muscle.

841
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,920
There's absolutely no issue
for it to plow.

842
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,760
Seeing you're serious…

843
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,830
six silver dollars. Deal?

844
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,960
Six silver dollars?

845
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,100
Well, the difference is way too big.

846
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,870
I have only 1 silver dollar on me.

847
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,100
Only 1 silver dollar?

848
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,540
Are you kidding me...

849
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,310
But my father might
scrape together a bit more…

850
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,910
This is a great ox!

851
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,910
Miss Xiuxiu.

852
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,060
What do you think about
that single-horned ox?

853
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,520
We may go with a fair price.

854
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,500
Single-horned…

855
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,100
Doubt my father will accept.

856
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,570
Unless the price makes him swallow hard.

857
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,720
The price is right.

858
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,660
Four silver dollars!

859
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,860
Four silver dollars?

860
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,810
Four silver dollars
for this single-horned ox?

861
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,810
Face it—this ox will never sell.

862
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,850
Every day it lingers,
it devours good grain.

863
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,580
Better butcher it.

864
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,270
Do you find it expensive
at 4 silver dollars?

865
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,910
Hold on.

866
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,500
We may go with 3 silver dollars.

867
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,620
That's the lowest I can offer.

868
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,480
How about that?

869
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,960
It's a good ox. It works with no issue.

870
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,460
Alright. Let me have a look.

871
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,120
Take a look.

872
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,310
What do you think about it?

873
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,240
Although single-horned,
it shows strength at work.

874
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,280
This ox seems to have taken
a liking to me.

875
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,710
I'll take it then.

876
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,110
But you—you need to do me a favor.

877
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,140
This ox...

878
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,100
You take it to my father yourself.

879
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,540
He'll pay you the rest.

880
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,870
But what if your father refuses it?

881
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,980
Here's one silver dollar—

882
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,550
call it a deposit.

883
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,390
If my father really won't take it,

884
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,590
you keep this dollar.

885
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,660
Deal.

886
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
Then we call it a deal.

887
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,350
Yes, deal.

888
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,600
Single-horned ox.

889
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,430
Is anyone home?

890
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,660
Anyone there?

891
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,020
The ox is here.

892
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,380
Whose ox is this?

893
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,560
This household just bought it.

894
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,930
How great.

895
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,140
What ox is here?

896
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,230
Hello?

897
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,700
What ox is this?

898
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,790
It's the ox of your household.

899
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,710
Feng Er

900
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,980
rented land and even bought an ox!

901
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,830
That's great!

902
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,200
Wait, Feng Er.

903
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,100
Why is this ox missing a horn?

904
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,220
Missing a horn, but it's strong for work!

905
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,430
Exactly!

906
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,910
Why is it single-horned?

907
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,930
Hold on there.

908
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,500
Why do you bring this ox to my house?

909
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,540
Your daughter-in-law
bought this ox for your family.

910
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,790
She asked me to deliver it.

911
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,720
Said you'd inspect it and pay cash.

912
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,080
My daughter-in-law bought it?

913
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,430
And she wanted me to inspect it?

914
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,980
That's right.

915
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,510
And she wanted me to pay you?

916
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,560
No, I don't want it.

917
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,540
You may take it back.

918
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,180
I never said I would buy it. Take it away.

919
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,980
That won't do!

920
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,790
I walked over 6 to 7 li

921
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,580
just to get here!

922
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,500
Your daughter-in-law promised—

923
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,310
cash payment and a free dinner!

924
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,970
That's the only reason I came!

925
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,400
What else did my daughter-in-law say?

926
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,390
My dau—

927
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,060
where is she?

928
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,180
How could she make the decision alone?

929
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,600
Acting like the boss, huh?

930
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,040
If it's about the money,

931
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,740
go ask her for it!

932
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,100
I don't want this ox—take it back!

933
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,180
Such a great ox!

934
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,230
No, I don't want it.

935
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,460
Then that silver dollar stays with me.

936
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm outta here.

937
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,920
Wait a minute!

938
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,710
Did she give you a silver dollar?

939
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,100
Yes.

940
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,140
Who will deliver it without a deposit?

941
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,710
You think hay and water grow on trees?

942
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,310
Wait a minute. Here's the thing.

943
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,620
I don't want this ox.

944
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,950
Give us back that silver dollar.

945
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,040
Give it back!

946
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,190
No ox? No refund. I'm out.

947
00:39:59,210 --> 00:39:59,780
Father.

948
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,290
It's a great ox.

949
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,180
Great ox!

950
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,230
Wait a second!

951
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,970
Hold on!

952
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,500
This is a great ox.

953
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,020
That's true.

954
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,140
This ox is missing a horn!

955
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,310
You really think it's worth full price?

956
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,390
Are you trying to scam me?

957
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,310
Hey now, I don't like that tone.

958
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,270
If it weren't
for your daughter-in-law's kindness,

959
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,020
I wouldn't even sell this low.

960
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,610
Take it or leave it – I'm walking.

961
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,410
Hold on there.

962
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,760
Let's have a private talk.

963
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,340
How much is it?

964
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,950
I'll take it.

965
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,370
I'll take it.

966
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,450
This ox is really a great deal.

967
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,250
Do you really think it's a good ox?

968
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,270
Missing a horn, sure,

969
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,270
but this is one fine ox!

970
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,710
It's also a great deal
at 3 silver dollars.

971
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,620
I've been thinking...

972
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,370
I still want that silver dollar back.

973
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,860
How's that gonna work?

974
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,180
Father kept the ox only due to the pain

975
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,280
that dollar deposit caused his soul.

976
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,950
Probably still fuming now.

977
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,870
Or, shall I give you a silver dollar?

978
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,500
Why didn't I feel Father is mad?

979
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,230
This is her acting on her own!

980
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,710
We're talking 3 silver dollars here!

981
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,620
Nobody held a knife to your throat.

982
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,360
You opened the cash box yourself,
didn't you?

983
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,230
If I don't pay up now,

984
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,910
that silver dollar deposit

985
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,460
goes straight to their pocket!

986
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,860
Furthermore! Just look—

987
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,910
Feasting and drinking guests,
all that good food and liquor...

988
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,310
You know what that costs?

989
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,020
That's real money!

990
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,590
And she didn't even count the expenses!

991
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,870
You—quit grinning! What's so funny?

992
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,390
Seems Xiuxiu knows you best—

993
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,830
she's got you wrapped around her finger.

994
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,180
After decades
of your penny-pinching with me,

995
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,120
finally, someone's putting you
in your place!

996
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,950
What's wrong with being thrifty?

997
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,660
What's wrong with it?

998
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,730
Isn't it right?

999
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,620
As the old saying goes:

1000
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,950
"You won't be poor
from eating or drinking,

1001
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,430
but poor planning will sink you."

1002
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,910
Poor! Poor! Poor!

1003
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,200
This girl... She's getting too wild.

1004
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,540
I'll have Dajiao

1005
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,370
knock some sense into her.

1006
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,580
Where are you heading?

1007
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,310
I need to pee.

1008
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,540
I knew you couldn't hold out.

1009
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,800
A hornless ox,

1010
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,230
a squint-eyed man—

1011
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,480
these are creatures with temper!

1012
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,500
And temper?

1013
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,100
That's just personality in disguise.
