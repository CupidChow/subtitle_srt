[Episode 16]

3
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,690
Don't step on the flag!

4
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,850
Don't step on the flag!

5
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,140
Don't step on the flag!

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Brother-in-law!

7
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,120
You're already at my doorstep,

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,250
come in for some tea.

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,630
Brothers!

10
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,480
Yes!

11
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,810
Dismiss!

12
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,710
Yes.

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,710
Well,

14
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,920
how about we go back to take a look?

15
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,190
Say something.

16
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Come here.

17
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,829
We were just about to go back
looking for you.

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,530
Are you okay?

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
Why are you all staring at me?

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Why are you all staring at me?

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,370
You're all cowards.

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,150
No.

23
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,020
You didn't dare go in either, did you?

24
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,950
That's right.

25
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
You all ran away.

26
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
How could I go in there alone?

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,530
Get lost!

28
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,710
Hey, don't take it all out on me.

29
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,630
All bark and no bite.

30
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,640
That big-eyed fellow got away with it?

31
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,090
I'm just sticking my nose
where it doesn't belong.

32
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,310
Well, if it isn't Feng Er?

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,920
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,910
What?

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,970
Your old face is all

36
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,610
wrinkled up like a walnut.

37
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,020
Are you upset because you failed to
see me be humiliated?

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,480
Let me tell you,

39
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,580
for generations, my Ning family

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,730
has been the biggest homestead

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,730
in Ox Temple Village.

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,610
Even dogs lower their heads
when they see me.

43
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,840
Who dares to cause trouble

44
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,840
at my doorstep?

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,040
We Ning family

46
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,240
have stood for a hundred years.

47
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,920
No, wait.

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,630
We Ning family

49
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,310
never falls!

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,050
You really talk nonsense.

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,930
You never fall for ten thousand years?

52
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,720
You're nothing but an ancient turtle.

53
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,870
Times have changed.

54
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,270
You're like an old turtle trying to fight

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,020
while flipped on its back.

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,980
You're the flipped turtle!

57
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,680
Let me tell you, Feng Er,

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,170
even if you flip a million times,
you're no match for me.

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,120
My son is my golden shield.

60
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,370
No one can touch me.

61
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,670
Golden shield?

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
No one can touch you?

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,700
Let me tell you, with your behavior,

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,650
they might not deal with you today,

65
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,140
but sooner or later,

66
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,220
someone will teach you a lesson
you won't forget.

67
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,550
Then I'll beat you to death first!

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,430
Kuangzi,

69
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,810
bring me the stick.

70
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,840
Come on, hit me.

71
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,710
Killing someone means
you'll pay with your life.

72
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,260
I'm having such bad luck today,

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,510
the worst luck ever.

74
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,630
I should've checked the calendar
before going out.

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,310
I was just trying to be nice,

76
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,360
checking if they were beating you.

77
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
So I can stop them and help you.

78
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,090
But as soon as you saw me,

79
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,780
you spat all over my face.

80
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,000
Feng Er.

81
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,320
If you really had good intentions,

82
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,070
I'd reward you with a drink.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,950
Come.

84
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,190
I won't drink that. It's horse piss.

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,390
Are you drinking or not?

86
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

87
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,330
You think I want to drink with you?

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,909
Even if I need to drink with Feng Si,

89
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,310
I'll never want to drink with you
in my life.

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,500
If you won't accept the easy way,
you'll take the hard way.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,850
Kuangzi, bring the stick.

92
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,170
No, no, Master!

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Just scold him a bit and be done with it.

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
He's still your in-law, isn't he?

95
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,830
-I don't have such in-law!
-Who is his in-law?

96
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,160
I don't acknowledge it.

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, I do.

98
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,590
But it's impossible.

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,320
Kuangzi, close the door.

100
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,870
Brother.

101
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,720
Brother.

102
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,300
You all go ahead.

103
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,120
Brother.

104
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,220
Stop laughing, I need to talk to you.

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,820
What is it?

106
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,190
Soldiers trained for days are used
in a moment of need.

107
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,950
Father hasn't even shown up yet,
and I've scared them all away.

108
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,480
Brother,

109
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,630
I don't think what you did today
was right.

110
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,690
What wasn't right?

111
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,430
I don't want Father to fight against
the Farmers' Association.

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,040
Brother,

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,920
you're well educated

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
and you've been out in the world.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,390
By helping Father this way,

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,310
you're not really helping him,

117
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,770
but you're actually hurting him.

118
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,270
How am I hurting him?

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
It hasn't come to that far yet.

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,000
The Farmers' Association
won't gain power that quickly.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,330
Sister, let me tell you,

122
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,090
the land is Father's life.

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,160
As his son,

124
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,000
I should help him whenever I can.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,750
Don't worry,

126
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,600
it won't come to that.

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
If it does, your brother will be here,

128
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,120
and no one can touch our Ning family.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,600
Brother...

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Go back first!

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,310
I'll handle this matter.

132
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,630
Brother!

133
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,560
No one can touch our Ning family.

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,310
Go back!

135
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,100
I know you're embroidering that flag
to buy time.

136
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,680
What I find strange is

137
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,720
how my brother got the news.

138
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,560
He ran to the gate early in the morning
to shield father from trouble.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,159
Who told him about it?

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,950
Didn't you ask me

141
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,460
to persuade Tietou
to leave Mrs. Fei alone?

142
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,690
I saw how worried you've been these days,

143
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,100
so I went to Brother first,

144
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
asked him to talk some sense
into your father,

145
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,140
and then I went to find Tietou.

146
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,310
But I never expected that Tietou

147
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,700
did agree not to bother Mrs. Fei,

148
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,480
but then immediately
wanted to go after your father

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
that very night.

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,270
So I thought

151
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,430
I had already

152
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,700
spoken to Brother,

153
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,070
and he would surely persuade Father.

154
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,680
But it seems Brother

155
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,790
misunderstood what I meant.

156
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,850
Aren't you afraid that
if Tietou finds out,

157
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,510
he'll be angry with you again?

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,350
What's there to be afraid of?

159
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

160
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,200
I asked Brother to persuade Father
not to clash with Tietou.

161
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
Even if he saw me doing it,

162
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
I'd still say the same thing.

163
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,630
Dajiao.

164
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,720
Thank you.

165
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,240
Why are you thanking me again?

166
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,850
You seem to understand what I'm thinking.

167
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,340
I don't even need to say anything,

168
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,760
and you just did it for me.

169
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,720
It feels like drinking a cold bowl

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,650
of water on the hottest summer day.

171
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,320
I just have to thank you.

172
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,490
Isn't it only natural that
I understand what you're thinking?

173
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,200
In my heart, we're one and the same.

174
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,550
So you don't need to tell me all this.

175
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,200
What are you all doing here?

176
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,060
That's enough.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,320
Why are you causing trouble at my house?

178
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
How does this have anything to do with me?

179
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,360
Get out!

180
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,810
We're here for you, Feng Tietou.

181
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,940
It's all your fault!

182
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,330
You dragged my husband

183
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,090
to that damn farmers' meeting.

184
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,440
My landlord heard I was going against him,

185
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,320
so he took back all our land!

186
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,030
I'd already planted the seeds,

187
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,030
and those seeds

188
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,550
were bought with high-interest loans!

189
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,530
What's this all about?

190
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,940
What are you trying to do?

191
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Here's your stupid badge.

192
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,020
I give it back to you!

193
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,970
You even kicked Baisui.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,090
His lower back is still bruised!

195
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,770
If you won't let us live in peace,

196
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,740
you won't have peace either.

197
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,310
I'll eat here and live here!

198
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,490
Nonsense!

199
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,630
Who are you cursing at?

200
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,790
Did my Tietou kidnap your husband?

201
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,810
Did he force him to join
the Farmers' Association?

202
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,810
They came of their own free will!

203
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,550
Get out of here!

204
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,720
Out!

205
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
Now you're denying it?

206
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
Stop making trouble.

207
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,730
That's enough!

208
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,000
Make her come out!

209
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,620
Alright,

210
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,120
are you women going crazy?

211
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Someone, come control them!

212
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,550
Give back our land!

213
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,280
Where is him?

214
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,200
Fei Baisui?

215
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,510
Fei Baisui?

216
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,080
Has Fei Baisui arrived?

217
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,610
-He’s not here.
-Give me back my land!

218
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,740
Give me back my land!

219
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,930
Whose wives are these?

220
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,360
Are there any men here?
Talk some sense into them.

221
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,490
Tietou is just trying to help everyone.
What's all this fuss about?

222
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,890
Let's go.
If they won't let us live a good life,

223
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,080
no one will have a good life.

224
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't run away! Don't!

225
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,470
Tietou, help me catch them!

226
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,020
That's all the grain we have left at home.

227
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,790
-And our land!
-We don't have any either.

228
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,510
You're all bandits, female bandits!

229
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,740
Alright, everyone disperse!

230
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,800
Go home, all of you.

231
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,680
What's there to see?

232
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,290
Give me back my land!

233
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,530
Everyone, disperse!

234
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,640
What's your plan now?

235
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,840
I never thought
it would turn out like this.

236
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,500
All that trouble for nothing.

237
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,730
I'm about to burst from frustration.

238
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,520
If this continues,

239
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,730
how will I ever get permanent tenancy?

240
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,480
Brother.

241
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,400
Does this mean I can't marry Yinzi?

242
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,150
No way.

243
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,450
I won't accept this.

244
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,270
I'm going to fight him.

245
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,730
Who are you going to fight?

246
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Ning Kejin?

247
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,840
Or those wealthy Masters
in the village?

248
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,840
You can bang your head against my wall,

249
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,700
but try that with someone else's.

250
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,400
Brother.

251
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,230
Stop giving me a hard time
at a moment like this.

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,120
I must get permanent tenancy.

253
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
For money to marry Yinzi,

254
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
I have to at least try.

255
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,670
I'm going to confront that old widow.

256
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,020
Have you lost your mind?

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,930
Such a chaos, who would go with you?

258
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,560
Then what should I do, Brother?

259
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Now you remember to call me Brother.

260
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
Will you listen to what I say?

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,030
Yes.

262
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,450
I'll take you to someone

263
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,150
who can definitely help you.

264
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,030
Who?

265
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,780
Fei Wendian.

266
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,150
He's helped organize
Farmers' Associations before.

267
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,820
You should ask for his advice.

268
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
I won't go.

269
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,480
He's just a rich man's Young Master,

270
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,390
a beardless scholar,

271
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,360
what would he know?

272
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,160
I refuse to go.

273
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,230
Then go see Mr. Bai.

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,290
Didn't he bring you into
the Farmers' Association?

275
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,000
Mr. Bai is just a teacher.

276
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,360
I know who to find.

277
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,240
Brother,

278
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,870
I'll take you to meet an official.

279
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,960
He gave lectures at our
Farmers' Association's

280
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,840
study group.

281
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,420
The highest-ranking official.

282
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,440
Let's go, Brother,

283
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,110
right now.

284
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,040
Let's go.

285
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,550
I know who to find.

286
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,150
Father.

287
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,920
We've won the first round

288
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,840
against those peasants.

289
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,460
I can guarantee

290
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,760
these poor peasants

291
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,840
won't dare to bother you again.

292
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,190
Thanks to Dajiao
who came to tell me beforehand,

293
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,660
asking me to talk some sense into you,

294
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
saying Xiu was worried sick at home.

295
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
I knew he came to warn us.

296
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
Father,

297
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,290
it shows that my sister

298
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,470
still cares about you in her heart.

299
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
Your sister

300
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,130
meant to send you back to persuade me.

301
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,010
Thank you, Father.

302
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,210
Enough talk.

303
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,800
You did nothing wrong.

304
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,630
I was just thinking that

305
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,750
our days of drinking together in peace

306
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,150
won't last much longer.

307
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,510
How is that possible, Father?

308
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,200
Worst case,
I can go back to the Qingqi Society

309
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,060
and ask their leader for more men.

310
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,120
That trick of yours

311
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,750
will only work once.

312
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
I thank you for this time.

313
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,180
I'll figure out my own solutions
from now on.

314
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
What happened to Pan Xiaogui

315
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,550
can't happen again on me.

316
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,550
Call all of them here.

317
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,910
Don't leave any family out.

318
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,080
Madam.

319
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,360
What are you all planning to do?

320
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,080
Madam asked to assemble all the tenants.

321
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,450
Provide permanent tenancy or

322
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
reduce their rent and interest

323
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,420
accordingly.

324
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,650
Sister-in-law,

325
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,530
have you made up your mind?

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,340
How did you come to this decision?

327
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,960
I haven't figured it all out,

328
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,790
but I do know

329
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,810
I can't just watch you get arrested

330
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,780
and paraded through the streets
with a demon face painted on.

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,550
I won't go forward today.

332
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,110
Beard Liu,

333
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,030
you go with the Young Master

334
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,080
and make note of

335
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,770
what each family wants.

336
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
We'll figure it out when you return.

337
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,160
Madam.

338
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,410
Sister-in-law, don't worry,

339
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,610
I'll definitely handle this well.

340
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Don't push! Everyone, give some space!

341
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Listen to me!

342
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,600
Our Young Master said

343
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,190
no family will be left out.

344
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,970
Every household will be taken care of.

345
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,500
This is from the Fei family.

346
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,870
Do you want rent and interest reduction
or permanent tenancy?

347
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,650
I want permanent tenancy.

348
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,010
Sure.

349
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,230
Mark him down for permanent tenancy.

350
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Next.

351
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,000
My family also wants permanent tenancy.

352
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,370
Permanent tenancy, good.

353
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,550
Note it down, permanent tenancy.

354
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,060
-Me, permanent tenancy.
-Sister-in-law, really permanent tenancy?

355
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,140
My chest hurts, I'm going back first.

356
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
I didn't manage

357
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,390
this family properly.

358
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,200
Young Master.

359
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,070
Tietou's Mother.

360
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,130
Is this rent and interest reduction
or permanent tenancy real?

361
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,260
Of course it's real.

362
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,440
Young Mistress has always been good to us.

363
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,230
If we can have permanent tenancy,

364
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,430
we'd like that too.

365
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,140
No problem.

366
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,750
Tietou's family, permanent tenancy.

367
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,520
Thank you, Young Master.

368
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,240
Next.

369
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Me too!

370
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,470
Everyone will get it!

371
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't worry, everyone.

372
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,000
Take it easy.

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,400
What would you like?

374
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
One at a time, please.

375
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,380
The high official I mentioned is in here.

376
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,730
I've been to this place before.

377
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,750
You have?

378
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,200
You've been here and met the official?

379
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,200
This official

380
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,030
was very nice to me,

381
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,370
and even gave me lessons.

382
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,880
In a moment, follow my lead.

383
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,240
Don't say anything inappropriate.

384
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,370
Don't embarrass me.

385
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,480
Director.

386
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,810
Remember me?

387
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,640
Tietou.

388
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,720
Mr. Du.

389
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
Dajiao,

390
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,810
why are you here?

391
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,370
Are you recovered from your injury?

392
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,170
I'm fine.

393
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,870
That's great.

394
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Father.

395
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,050
Father.

396
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,240
Why are you running?

397
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,010
Why aren't you staying home

398
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,640
to take care of your pregnancy?

399
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,270
Father,

400
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,030
I need to talk to you about something.

401
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,030
Come,

402
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,850
let's go inside.

403
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,830
The wind is strong here,

404
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,410
take it easy.

405
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,320
Hurry up.

406
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,750
Take this money.

407
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,410
If you have morning sickness,

408
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,100
buy yourself something nice.

409
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,900
Your Mother is gone,
so I'll take care of you.

410
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
There's millet in here

411
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and autumn dates.

412
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,230
Ask Mrs. Fei to make you
some date porridge after you get back.

413
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,670
When are you due?

414
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,350
Father,

415
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,120
I don't take these things

416
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,940
or this money.

417
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,550
I came back to tell you

418
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,000
to quickly grant permanent tenancy
to all the tenants.

419
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,830
Mrs. Fei

420
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,270
is already at our front gate

421
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,640
granting permanent tenancy to the farmers.

422
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,200
On my way back, I heard that

423
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
Tietou went to the county

424
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,200
to consult with people from
the Farmers' Association.

425
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,790
Who knows

426
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,400
what they'll do to you then.

427
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,430
Where's your land deed box?

428
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,480
Is it inside the house?

429
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll help you sort through them,

430
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,570
and finds out who gets permanent tenancy
and who gets reductions.

431
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,010
That's what Mrs. Fei did.

432
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,350
Did Mrs. Fei

433
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,640
send you to spy on me?

434
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,360
You even dare to ask for my land deed box?

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,640
You've got some nerve!

436
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,310
Even your brother wouldn't dare

437
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,640
to speak to me like this.

438
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,440
Take your things and go back
to the Fei family immediately.

439
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,510
You tell Mrs. Fei,

440
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,640
it's not Fai family's turn

441
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,680
to teach me what to do!

442
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,350
You!

443
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,230
You just don't understand
when someone's trying to help you.

444
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,350
My sister ignores you now,

445
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,510
my brother has no time for you,

446
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,160
and you won't even listen to me?

447
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,680
Aren't you afraid of
being caught and punished in public?

448
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,460
People will throw cow dung at you
during the parade,

449
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,990
and no one can help you then.

450
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,240
Kuangzi!

451
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,070
Take her things
and escort her out immediately.

452
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,130
I don't need you scaring me like this.

453
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,160
Go!

454
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,700
Fine, I'm leaving!

455
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,830
I'd be a fool to care about you anymore.

456
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,500
I don't even want that stuff.

457
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,380
Kuangzi, go after her! Go after her!

458
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,290
Take the things, take them!

459
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,250
She's pregnant.

460
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,750
How dare you touch my land deed box!

461
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,310
How dare you touch my land deed box!

462
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,240
How dare you touch my land deed box!

463
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,200
Everyone deserves to eat their fill!

464
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone deserves to eat their fill!

465
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,810
All power to the Farmers' Association!

466
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,380
I don't need you to tell me.

467
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,540
I've already seen the public parade.

468
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,850
Susu.

469
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,200
Susu.

470
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,650
Did you just...

471
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,110
Steward Liu and I were

472
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,640
registering the tenant farmers,

473
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,170
so I couldn't attend to you.

474
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,000
Wendian.

475
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Miss Susu.

476
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,590
Miss Susu.

477
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,000
The Master insists you take this back.

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
I don't want it.

479
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,960
Miss Susu,

480
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,320
don't make things difficult for Kuangzi.

481
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,370
Kuangzi,

482
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,220
just take these things to my house first.

483
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,950
All right, thank you, Sir.

484
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,850
Thank you, Sir.

485
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,070
Wendian,

486
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,760
I heard what you said earlier.

487
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,590
I'm just worried about my father.

488
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,610
So I went back to persuade him
to grant permanent tenancy.

489
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,880
I'm afraid he'll be arrested
and paraded through the streets,

490
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,210
but he wouldn't listen,

491
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,830
and he drove me out.

492
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,590
Wendian,

493
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,300
is this situation really
as serious as you say?

494
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,030
Susu,

495
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,290
wipe those tears from your face first.

496
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,080
Let's not talk about this now.

497
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,680
Didn't you say you wanted to fly a kite?

498
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,920
Let me take you to fly a kite.

499
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,510
Really?

500
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,070
Really.

501
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,510
Susu,

502
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,160
this way.

503
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,880
Wendian, the kite is really flying!

504
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,840
It's flying higher than the birds.

505
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,720
It's stable now.

506
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,350
Here.

507
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,590
You try it.

508
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Can I?

509
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,470
Yes.

510
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,610
Hold steady.

511
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't shake it.

512
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Steady now.

513
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,860
Keep it steady.

514
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,220
It seems even flying kites
can't cheer Susu up anymore.

515
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,590
I still remember when I was little,

516
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,160
my father took me and Xiuxiu to fly kites.

517
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,930
We were so happy then.

518
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,480
But now whenever I think about my father,
I get upset.

519
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,530
I'm really afraid he'll end up with

520
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,640
the same fate as Pan Xiaogui.

521
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
I'm worried sick.

522
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,640
Susu,

523
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,200
Pan Xiaogui got what he deserved.

524
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,570
Your father is different from him.

525
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,390
The Farmers' Association was established

526
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,360
not to create conflict with
landlords or the wealthy,

527
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
but to help those peasants

528
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,510
have a better life.

529
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't worry.

530
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,400
You have my baby now.

531
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,480
Your father is my father too,

532
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,220
and I'll definitely try to persuade him.

533
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,920
You just need to take care of yourself.

534
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,220
Just be happy every day

535
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
and leave everything else

536
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,400
to me.

537
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,480
Sister-in-law.

538
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,960
Qing told me

539
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,620
you haven't eaten all day.

540
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,000
I tried to make some porridge
in the kitchen.

541
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,430
Please try some.

542
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,570
I can't eat anything.

543
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,330
Sister-in-law.

544
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,400
I know

545
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,500
it's really difficult for you
to take this step.

546
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,790
But...

547
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,050
Don't lecture me.

548
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,980
Your praise now

549
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,080
hurts more than criticism.

550
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,880
Where's Susu?

551
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,960
Did you find her?

552
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,000
I met her on the road.

553
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,400
She was crying.

554
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,710
So I brought her back.

555
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,160
Why is she crying again?

556
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,960
She's still pregnant.

557
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,400
Who upset her this time?

558
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,550
Susu saw us reducing rent
and interest for tenants,

559
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,200
and she got worried.

560
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
She went home to persuade her father,

561
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,960
but he yelled at her and kicked her out.

562
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,790
He accused her of being sent by you

563
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,720
to spy on him.

564
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,370
I'm already one step ahead of him,

565
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,530
what secrets would I need to discover?

566
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,310
A dog biting a good man.

567
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,480
Tell Susu,

568
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,190
I'll settle this score for her
sooner or later.

569
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,240
Sister-in-law.

570
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,030
Don't worry about this matter.

571
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,880
I should go talk to Master Ning too.

572
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Stop right there.

573
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,350
We haven't settled our own affairs yet,

574
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,030
why meddle in others' business?

575
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,630
Don't go.

576
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,970
He thinks
he can get away with it this time.

577
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,750
Even if he really manages to escape,

578
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,880
I won't stand for it.

579
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
You're saying

580
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,160
that just this piece of paper

581
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
with these few black characters

582
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,490
will make Ning Xuexiang

583
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,000
listen to us?

584
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,570
Didn't Mr. Du say

585
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,900
this document at the crucial moment

586
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,550
is as powerful as

587
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,900
the armed forces of
the Farmers' Association?

588
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,820
It intimidates

589
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,310
those wealthy old landowners

590
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,930
who disrespect the Farmers' Association.

591
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,690
If it really doesn't work,

592
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,350
he'll come personally.

593
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,680
But I think

594
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,560
he's so busy now
that he can't even eat a proper meal.

595
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,360
So let's not trouble Brother Du.

596
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,720
Brother Du?

597
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
You're so familiar with him,

598
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,310
talking like he's your actual brother.

599
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm supposed to be

600
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,480
the head of
our village Farmers' Association,

601
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,080
but when Director Du saw you,

602
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,000
it was like I didn't even exist.

603
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,370
He even held your hand tightly
and called you brother.

604
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,450
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Director Du?

605
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,450
Why did you keep this secret from me?

606
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,550
You've been away.

607
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,270
Since you returned, you were
busy with the association matters.

608
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,830
When would I have had the chance

609
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,370
to tell you I saved Brother Du's life?

610
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,630
Stop with the "Brother Du" this and that.

611
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,620
It's getting on my nerves.

612
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,990
Even if you saved his life twice,

613
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,130
he's still the leader of
the Farmers' Association.

614
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,040
From now on,

615
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,540
you should call him Director too.

616
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,030
Fine.

617
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,450
Don't think that just because you're

618
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,710
Director Du's savior,

619
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,310
you can show off

620
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,720
in front of me.

621
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,030
Don't worry,

622
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,550
as long as you need me,

623
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,410
I'll always stay by your side.

624
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,750
You're still my brother after all.

625
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,750
Business is business.

626
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,750
I haven't called you that
for nothing all these years.

627
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,880
Madam,

628
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,420
the cart is loaded,

629
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,090
let's go?

630
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,800
Go.

631
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,440
You go ahead, I'll follow.

632
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,450
You can sit in the cart.

633
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,920
It's not far. I'll walk.

634
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,960
I want the peasants in Ox Temple Village

635
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
to see

636
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
what I'll accomplish today.

637
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,000
All right then.

638
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,650
Let's go.

639
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,310
Everyone, be quiet please.

640
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,720
Well, our Master has given his orders.

641
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,960
Today, if you have anything to say,

642
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,720
speak up now.

643
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,470
Permanent tenancy or

644
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,200
reduction in interest and rent,

645
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,830
we'll all do as you ask.

646
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,720
Land agent will be here soon.

647
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,350
Alright?

648
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,080
How can you call him land agent?

649
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,120
You must call him Third Uncle Ning.

650
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,880
Yes, Master.

651
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,090
Third Uncle Ning will be here shortly.

652
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,510
Today we'll have everyone sign

653
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,160
these land lease documents.

654
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,490
Everyone, please be patient.

655
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,950
Just wait a little longer.

656
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,690
Xiu, you're back.

657
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,050
I was looking for you.
Where have you been?

658
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,110
Is Dajiao back yet?

659
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,880
No, not yet.

660
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,480
What's...

661
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,830
What's going on here?

662
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,000
No idea. There's a crowd of people.

663
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,200
They've put up a table by the door.

664
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,740
I have no idea what they're doing.

665
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,330
What? Why is everyone gathered here?

666
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Director Tietou.

667
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,800
Come.

668
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,440
Take the seat of honor, Director Tietou.

669
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,200
Come.

670
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,350
You arrived just in time.

671
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,730
Come.

672
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Sit down.

673
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,650
Just watch me
reduce the rent and interest today.

674
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,610
We'll write up the deed directly.

675
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,240
What are you doing? Take a look.

676
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,370
I really don't know.

677
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,100
Sit down.

678
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,510
I'll write the deed myself.

679
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,550
Master.

680
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,470
I'm starting now.

681
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,680
Well,

682
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,110
all tenants,

683
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
who brought your land deeds?

684
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,030
-Anyone with the land deed?
-Yes, I do.

685
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,760
Anyone else?

686
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,290
I do.

687
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,070
I brought mine too.

688
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,070
Li Laosan,

689
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,950
come here.

690
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,880
Do you want

691
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,520
permanent tenancy

692
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,200
or reduced rent and interest?

693
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,750
Master, you truly are a good Master.

694
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,820
I'm here for permanent tenancy.

695
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,950
Permanent tenancy.

696
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,350
Master.

697
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,680
Are we still waiting for Third Uncle?

698
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,230
Yes.

699
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,380
Ning Xueshi's reputation

700
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,750
stretches across the village.

701
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I specially invited him today
to write the documents.

702
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,210
Perhaps only he knows how to write them.

703
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,000
Brother, you're right.

704
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm here.

705
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,000
This matter,

706
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,110
I'm afraid only I can handle it.

707
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,730
For hundreds of years,

708
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
this kind of thing

709
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,490
has rarely been seen.

710
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,400
Wait a moment, we'll start right away.

711
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,610
There's a procedure to follow.

712
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,750
Hurry up.

713
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,760
Li Laosan.

714
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,340
Don't just stand there, hurry up.

715
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,590
Third Uncle.

716
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,590
Li Laosan wants permanent tenancy.

717
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,160
Ning, Ning Youtong.

718
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,970
Coming.

719
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Next.

720
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,950
Fei Liangcai.

721
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,440
Here.

722
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,510
Permanent tenancy?

723
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,110
Permanent tenancy.

724
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,640
Line up.

725
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,790
Kuangzi,

726
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,030
how could you forget about me?

727
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,670
Did you bring your land deed?

728
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,610
No, I didn't.

729
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,730
Tenants who haven't completed the process,

730
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,280
remember to bring your land deeds.

731
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,390
Starting tomorrow,

732
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,010
Master'll go through each of your case.

733
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,670
We'll continue the process.

734
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,240
We haven't forgotten you, Glutton Fei

735
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Master has over 700 mu of land.

736
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,790
If we process yours, we can't do others.

737
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,400
Today we're only processing some of it.

738
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,590
We'll continue tomorrow,
and your turn will come soon.

739
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,350
When exactly is "soon"?

740
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
I'll come to your field

741
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,300
and find you when it's time.

742
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,100
That's great!

743
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,830
Everyone,
don't forget to bring your land deeds.

744
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,550
Let's wrap up for today.

745
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,280
Alright.

746
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,570
We can handle everything.

747
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,440
Right?

748
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,790
Nephew,

749
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,790
how does it look? Are you satisfied?

750
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,790
Good.

751
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,410
This is just the beginning,

752
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,830
I'll take it slow.

753
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,400
I almost forgot.

754
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,270
I still have something important to do.

755
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,640
Wait!

756
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,590
Come.

757
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,530
Wait, there's one more thing.

758
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,270
Well,

759
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,200
this is the 15 mu of land

760
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,680
by the well in the west of our village,

761
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,960
belonging to Feng Dajiao's family.

762
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,050
The Feng family knows

763
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,920
this was Miss Xiuxiu's dowry

764
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,040
that wasn't taken.

765
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,620
Today the Feng family should take it.

766
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,400
Take it.

767
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,450
Take it.

768
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
Come.

769
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,130
My in-law,

770
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,640
No.

771
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,200
you're so wise.

772
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,620
You've chosen a good day.

773
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,190
Father, we can't take it.

774
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,340
Why not?

775
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,440
We can't take it.

776
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,030
It's a dowry gift.

777
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,960
A dowry.

778
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,720
We can't take it.

779
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,850
We can't take it, let's go.

780
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,170
No, no, no.
Let’s go.

781
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,030
Hold on there.

782
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,270
Xiu.

783
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,750
Xiu.

784
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,510
Xiuxiu.

785
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,290
All my good intentions are wasted!

786
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,870
What bad luck!

787
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
Terrible misfortune!

788
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,880
The land is gone.

789
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
It's like a cooked duck

790
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,960
that flew away.

791
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,070
A jinx has entered our home!

792
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,700
We won't end well!

793
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,720
Let me be clear from the start.

794
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,199
In this house,

795
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,440
it's either her or me.

796
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,840
Dajiao was the one who stopped you,

797
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,630
why do you blame Xiuxiu?

798
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
You think I'm stupid?

799
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,590
Dajiao listens to her.

800
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,940
Like a magpie with a long tail.

801
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,159
He married a wife and forgot his mother.

802
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,000
Dajiao.

803
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,550
I still don't understand

804
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,070
why Ning Xuexiang suddenly agreed.

805
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,480
I find it strange too.

806
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,260
Brother Du gave Tietou an official notice

807
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,580
with a red seal.

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,030
It said that whoever doesn't work with
the Farmers' Association,

809
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,430
the association would take over directly.

810
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,840
Before the letter was even shown,

811
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,000
your father gave in.

812
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,470
I thought you had persuaded him.

813
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,400
I did want my brother to talk to father.

814
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,150
My brother hasn't been around.

815
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,880
It wasn't me.

816
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,510
Then someone else
might have convinced him.

817
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,310
Second Uncle?

818
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,410
Fourth Grandpa?

819
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,690
It could be anyone.

820
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,540
Forcing me to hide away.

821
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,630
Your act is over?

822
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Father, please don't laugh like that,

823
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,660
it gives me the creeps.

824
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,400
What are you trying to do? Tell me.

825
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Master, they've arrived.

826
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,180
Let them in.

827
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,630
Master,

828
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,490
here's the permanent tenancy land deed
you just gave us.

829
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,780
We're returning it to you.

830
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
These are the original ones.

831
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,900
I've kept them all for you.

832
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,070
Keep them safe.

833
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,610
Thank you, Master.

834
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,480
I accept your kindness,

835
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
and you accept mine.

836
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,430
This way,
we will all have a stable life.

837
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,740
Your three households

838
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,630
have been tenants of my family
for three generations.

839
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,740
We've taken good care of you
all these years.

840
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,920
That's why you've become

841
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,120
the largest tenants of the Ning family.

842
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,840
Yes, indeed.

843
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,090
Yes, indeed.

844
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,310
Unlike Li Junyi,

845
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,140
I won't take the land away out of fear
you'd cause trouble.

846
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,810
Keep doing what you've been doing.

847
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,490
Everything stays the same.

848
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,220
But there's one thing.

849
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,920
This matter

850
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,760
is only between us.

851
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,510
If anyone finds out,

852
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,280
you can't farm Ning's land,

853
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,340
you can't rent others either,

854
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,800
and it'll be

855
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,350
just one word from me.

856
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,140
I can't afford to mess with
my own food supply.

857
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,000
We understand.

858
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,150
I promise these lips

859
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,360
will be sealed tight.

860
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,480
Everyone.

861
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,970
Let's head back for today.

862
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,350
Master needs to rest.

863
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,510
Master.

864
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,000
Father.

865
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Will it work?

866
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,910
Tietou.

867
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Mother.

868
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,710
Quick, look at this.

869
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,140
I'm exhausted.

870
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,590
Our land lease document.

871
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,090
Permanent tenancy!

872
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,630
This is

873
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,150
the first document of Mrs. Fei's family.

874
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,670
From now on,

875
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,140
we can keep farming this land

876
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,480
until the day I die.

877
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,190
I...

878
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,710
I won't have to worry about

879
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,840
that old widow taking my land anymore.

880
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,960
Yes, that's right.

881
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,450
I won't have to work as a laborer anymore.

882
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm gonna
put all my strength into this land.

883
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,620
I refuse to believe I can't rise up.

884
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,920
I've got permanent tenancy now!

885
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,670
Thank heavens!

886
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,350
I've got permanent tenancy now!

887
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,480
Father.

888
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,480
I've got permanent tenancy now!

889
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,550
No way.

890
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,760
Yinzi.

891
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,550
I need to rest.

892
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,690
I'm too exhausted.

893
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,500
Alright.

894
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,960
Father, take a break.

895
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,800
Father.

896
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,720
Xiuxiu.

897
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Food's here.

898
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,670
About time.

899
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,230
I'm starving to death.

900
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,150
Yinzi.

901
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,760
Yinzi, come here.

902
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Come eat now.

903
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
It's fine, Mother.

904
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,170
I'm not hungry yet.

905
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,320
Why is it porridge again?

906
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,880
Working all day like this,

907
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,550
I can't keep going on this.

908
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,670
I'd love to make steamed buns,

909
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,130
but we need grain for that.

910
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,280
If it weren't for the
wild vegetables Yinzi gathered,

911
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,740
I couldn't even make this.

912
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,410
Can you eat this?

913
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,880
-Yes, we can.
-Yes, we can.

914
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,030
Yinzi, stop planting and come eat.

915
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm not hungry, I won't eat.

916
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,250
You can't go without eating every day.

917
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,480
You always say you're not hungry.

918
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
What you save

919
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,710
isn't even enough to fill your father's

920
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,760
big belly.

921
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,890
Is my sister really not hungry?

922
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,100
My sister doesn't have the heart to eat.

923
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,760
Your sister doesn't eat much.

924
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,750
She cares about her family.

925
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,490
Someday in the future,

926
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,000
when she finds a good family to marry,

927
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
she'll have plenty of good food.

928
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,480
Dajiao, dinner's ready.

929
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,110
Father, dinner's ready.

930
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,840
Dajiao.

931
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,510
Tell your wife,

932
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,110
I have eyes.

933
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,330
I can see the food on the table.

934
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,660
Tell her to stop pretending to

935
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,250
care about me and this family.

936
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,180
Father.

937
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,630
What do you mean?

938
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,580
How am I pretending?

939
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,910
Let's go eat in our room.

940
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,870
Don't pull me.

941
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,560
Whenever there's trouble,
you try to smooth things over.

942
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,400
You always tell me
things will get better in a few days,

943
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,130
but how will things get better?

944
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,970
Let's just clear things up today.

945
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,870
What's wrong?

946
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,450
Why aren't you eating?

947
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,070
I want to ask Father today,

948
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,620
how am I pretending to care about you?

949
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,840
Since I married into this family,

950
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,590
you two have always been kind to me.

951
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,270
And I've always shown you both
great respect.
