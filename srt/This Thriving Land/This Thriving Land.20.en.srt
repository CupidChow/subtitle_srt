00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,509
The bandits are attacking us!

4
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,509
-The bandits are attacking us!
-The bandits are attacking us!

5
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,710
Everyone!

6
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,350
The bandits are attacking us!

7
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,920
Gather at the entrance
and defend our village!

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Hurry! Hurry!

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Hide yourselves! Hide yourselves!

10
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,479
The bandits are attacking us!

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,150
The bandits are attacking us!

12
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,759
Quick, hide!

13
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,070
Hide yourselves! Hide yourselves!

14
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,840
The bandits are attacking! Hurry up!

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,310
The bandits are coming!

16
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,680
Defend the entrance!

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,660
Hide quickly!

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
Kuangzi! Kuangzi! Kuangzi!

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,030
I'm here!

20
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,289
What's happening?

21
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,020
The gongs are sounding. What's happening?

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,720
Master, you probably didn't catch it
because you were resting.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
Bandits have surrounded the village.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,960
Young Master is asking all men
15 years old and above

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
to gather at the west entrance.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,710
Master,

27
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,750
please take care of yourself.

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,350
They say these bandits were

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,430
brought here by Feng Si.

30
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,430
I'll be going now.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,910
Feng Si?

32
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,890
They've come for revenge.

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Mr. Ning!

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,310
Mr. Ning, have you heard?

35
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,280
The bandits have surrounded our village.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
What should we do?

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,240
Should we run away first?

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,380
Run? Nonsense!

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
If you run, the whole village

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,540
and your family assets

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,200
will be seized by the bandits.

42
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,079
Once they have a taste,
they'll keep coming back for more.

43
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,430
Our village has
over 1,000 people altogether.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,490
I don't believe we can't handle them.

45
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,290
I'm going to the entrance too.

46
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,230
You hurry back and get ready.

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,710
And call on
the two wealthy families nearby.

48
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,480
Now is the time

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,340
to contribute food and manpower.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,010
Alright!

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,520
I must not let my Xiuxiu

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,730
be taken by these damned bandits again.

53
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,070
Get Feng Si up there!

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Tell the bandits to withdraw

55
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,280
or I'll kill you first!

56
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,650
Move!

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,840
Go!

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,250
You have no idea how close
you are to death, do you?

59
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,990
Do you think the bandits are
this easily scared?

60
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,650
You'd better go back and check on

61
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,850
those surnamed Ning,

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
especially

63
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,700
that girl who escaped from
the bandits' lair.

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,640
The Second Boss came for revenge,

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,970
and your sister will be his first victim.

66
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,329
How dare you!

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Feng Si.

68
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,370
Are you even from Ox Temple Village?

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,420
Half of this village has the surname Feng,

70
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
and they're all your relatives!

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,820
How could you bring the bandits back
to slaughter the village?

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,550
Now you talk about being relatives.

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
But who has ever treated me like family
or even as a person?

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,700
They chased and cursed me
with burning sticks.

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,480
My son stole a few pieces of
their dried sweet potato

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
and got beaten for it.

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Especially your father,

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,060
who cheated my family out of our land,

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
leaving us no way to survive.

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,650
Kejin, beat him!

81
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,060
Beat him to death!

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
If you won't let me live,

83
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,470
none of you will live either!

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,270
Miser Ning,

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,159
just you wait.

86
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,190
Just you wait!

87
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,770
Get him!

88
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,800
Come! Tie him up

89
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,930
and hang him there!

90
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,120
Get up!

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,860
Go!

92
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,560
Bring his wife and children

93
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
over here

94
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,490
and let them see

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,130
the fate of those who
bring harm our villagers.

96
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,270
Ning Xuexiang!

97
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,510
Hang him up!

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,210
Second Boss.

99
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,830
Something doesn't feel right.

100
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,240
Second Boss!

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,190
Second Boss!

102
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,600
Charge in now

103
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,430
and wipe out everyone surnamed Ning!

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
We can't wait for the signal anymore.

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
What should we do?

106
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,630
Should we go back?

107
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,600
Nonsense!

108
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,830
Our two brothers are in their hands,

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,430
and yet you want to turn back?

110
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
We'll have to charge in regardless.

111
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Our weapons aren't just for show.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,270
We just have to get one of them
and the rest will probably flee.

113
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,240
I want to tear you into pieces!

114
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,270
Kejin.

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,620
-Fei Wu!
-Let go!

116
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,159
Just surrender!

117
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,420
You mustn't hurt yourself and your child.

118
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,600
The child belongs to the Feng family.

119
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,830
The child belongs to the Feng family!

120
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,710
I'm begging you!

121
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,950
Please just surrender!

122
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,230
Put their whole family

123
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,070
in a cage downstairs!

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,480
Yes!

125
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,360
Please surrender!

126
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,040
Just surrender!

127
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,690
Move!

128
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,120
Kejin.

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,850
All of your uncles and I

130
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
have discussed it.

131
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,120
We have money if needed,

132
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
and we'll provide manpower if required.

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,950
Soldiers trained for days are used
in a moment of need.

134
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
Father, don't worry.

135
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,190
I'll fight these bandits to the death!

136
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,070
I will protect our Ox Temple Village!

137
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,750
Kejin!

138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,870
Kejin!

139
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,720
All the men in the village have assembled

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,340
and awaiting your orders!

141
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,190
Kejin!

142
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,500
You're our commander in this fight
against the bandits.

143
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,620
Whatever you say,

144
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,600
that's what we'll do!

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
We'll fight them to the death

146
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,630
and defend our Ox Temple Village!

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,750
Protect Ox Temple Village!

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,510
Protect Ox Temple Village!

149
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,270
Protect Ox Temple Village!

150
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,210
Protect Ox Temple Village!

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,990
Protect Ox Temple Village!

152
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,350
Hang up another one for me.

153
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,110
Second Boss!

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,570
We've been caught!

155
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
They've tortured us!

156
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,350
-He hung someone up again.
-It’s Jiu.

157
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,530
Second Boss!

158
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,390
The people in the village

159
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
wants me to tell you

160
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,360
to retreat!

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,580
If you all retreat,

162
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,750
they promised to let me go!

163
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,650
Father!

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,530
Brothers,

165
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,159
can we just leave like this?

166
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,830
-No way!
-No way!

167
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,030
If we leave like this,

168
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,900
our reputation

169
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,460
will be torn to shreds by
those Ox Temple villagers!

170
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,850
Tell the guys below

171
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,270
to spread out and hide.

172
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,430
The wider the area, the better.

173
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,030
So they can't figure out
how many of us are here.

174
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,630
Yes.

175
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,390
Mengzi.

176
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,190
Yes?

177
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,530
Take two men

178
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,400
to the neighboring village

179
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,630
and grab some hostages for me.

180
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,230
Remember,

181
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,380
they must be relatives of
the Ox Temple villagers.

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,510
Go now.

183
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,310
What do we need those people for?

184
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,570
This earthen fortress

185
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,610
is most afraid of having its walls dug up.

186
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,210
So, we'll send people to dig.

187
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Follow me to talk.

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,090
Bandits have surrounded the village?

189
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,390
Second Boss!

190
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,910
People of Ox Temple Village,

191
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,910
listen to me!

192
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,470
Your grandpa Hu San is back again!

193
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,070
Kejin,

194
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,200
the bandits are shouting demands below.

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,150
I'm not deaf!

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
The last time...

197
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,030
I kidnapped your bride

198
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,030
but that little girl escaped.

199
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,120
Never once had a woman

200
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,250
walked out of Chicken Ridge a virgin.

201
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,950
She was the first one!

202
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,030
That's a shame I'll never live down!

203
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,670
This incident

204
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,600
has made my brothers

205
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,030
a laughing stock

206
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,830
and looked down upon.

207
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,080
Ning Kejin!

208
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,840
You listen to me!

209
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,660
Open the village gate

210
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,690
and have Miss Xiuxiu
greet me at the entrance.

211
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,330
All women, young and old, come out

212
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,210
and entertain my brothers.

213
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,690
If they're satisfied,

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
perhaps we'll

215
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,530
spare your village.

216
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,000
Hu San!

217
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,920
The man hanging up there

218
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,750
has already told me

219
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,300
how many horses

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
and men you have.

221
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,910
Let me tell you this.

222
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,340
No one

223
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,000
can break into our Ox Temple Village

224
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,360
as long as I, Ning Kejin,
am standing here!

225
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,750
Our entrance is iron-clad.

226
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,870
Don't even think about getting in!

227
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,560
Tell them!

228
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,440
Whoever comes, we'll kill!

229
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,930
Come together, and we'll kill you all!

230
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Fight to the death!

231
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Fight to the death!

232
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,550
What are you up to?

233
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
I need to hide our money.

234
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,020
Go away!

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,100
At a time like this,

236
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,300
you might as well hide it in the rafters.

237
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,030
Xiuxiu.

238
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,390
Hurry to Li Junyi's house

239
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,280
and hide in that big sweet potato cellar.

240
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Why are you carrying a knife?

241
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,690
I'm carrying it for protection.

242
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,910
Xiuxiu, I'm worried about Mrs. Fei.

244
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,670
I need to go back and check on her.
You go ahead first.

245
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,550
Be careful!

246
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,150
Mother,

247
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,110
where's Father?

248
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,650
Don't bother. We'll leave without him.

249
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,030
-Father!
-Mother of Tietou!

250
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,380
Let's bring Tietou's mother with us.

251
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,590
Let's go.

252
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,520
Thank you, Master.

253
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,580
Don't mention it.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,630
Quick, help them.

255
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,160
Hurry up.

256
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,120
Yinzi.

257
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,850
Mr. Li.

258
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,550
Hurry.

259
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,000
Mr. Li.

260
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,580
Get your mother safe.

261
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,060
Mother.

262
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,790
Careful, careful.

263
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,720
Sorry for the trouble.

264
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,790
It's fine, come in.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,720
Auntie.

266
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,790
Master Li.

267
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,510
My son has gone to the fortress.

268
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,360
We have nowhere else to hide.

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,870
It's hard times. Come in, come in.

270
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm not even your tenant.

271
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
Thank you so much.

272
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,630
No need to be polite.
Look at the situation we're in.

273
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,270
Come in, please.

274
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,270
Alright, thank you.

275
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,600
Good.

276
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,330
There's food inside.
Take some for the children.

277
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,200
Mr. Li.

278
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,950
Mr. Li.

279
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,490
Hurry.

280
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,090
Mother, go inside quickly.

281
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,360
Get in, quick.

282
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,770
Alright.

283
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,770
Quick, come in.

284
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,030
Mr. Li, you are getting on in years.

285
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,720
Please go inside too. I'll keep watch.

286
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm fine.

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,540
Go on, hurry.

288
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,200
Alright.

289
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,630
Let's go.

290
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,120
-Hurry inside.
-Okay.

291
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,200
Xiu!

292
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,980
Father! Come inside quickly.

293
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,130
No, you should go in.

294
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,820
I'm heading to the fortress entrance now.

295
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,090
I just came to tell you and your mother.

296
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,150
Go hide, alright?

297
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,440
Go hide!

298
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Be careful!

299
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Xiuxiu, why aren't you coming in yet?

300
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,150
Mother.

301
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,890
I need to go pick up Susu and Mrs. Fei.

302
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,170
I'll be back soon.

303
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,830
Then hurry up and come back quickly.

304
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,840
I'll keep an eye on things here.

305
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,980
Sister-in-law!

306
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,390
Susu.

307
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,190
Susu, why are you back?

308
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,210
I've come to take you with me.

309
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,320
I'll take you to Li Junyi's

310
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
sweet potato cellar to hide.

311
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,590
I thought you'd abandoned me.

312
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,400
How could I abandon you, Sister-in-law?

313
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,360
Sister-in-law, we need to
hide these away too.

314
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,830
It's cumbersome to take it with us.

315
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,030
Where should we hide them?

316
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,890
Hide them here!

317
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,940
S-Susu!

318
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,430
Don't be scared, Sister-in-law. I'm here.

319
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,150
Who is it?

320
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,400
It's me, Susu.

321
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,360
It's me, Xiuxiu. Open the door quickly!

322
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,000
Xiuxiu?

323
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,040
Sister-in-law,

324
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,050
my sister has come for us.

325
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,850
I'll open the door. Don't worry.

326
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,610
Yes.

327
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,710
X-Xiuxiu...

328
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,240
Be careful, Sister-in-law.

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,790
Hurry!

330
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,620
Susu, where's your sister?

331
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,900
She was just behind us.

332
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,340
She brought us

333
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,600
and Humpback Guo's wife here.

334
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,550
She needs to come quickly.

335
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,870
She's pregnant!

336
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,670
Auntie Feng, don't worry.

337
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,600
I'll go find her.

338
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,750
Auntie.

339
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,990
Auntie, let me go.

340
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm more agile than you.

341
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
I'll go protect Xiuxiu.

342
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,120
Then hurry up and go.

343
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,080
You all go inside first.

344
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,630
Let's go.

345
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,650
Hurry.

346
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,960
Take it easy.

347
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,260
Hurry up and go!

348
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,910
Auntie, close the door.

349
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,400
Alright.

350
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,460
Hurry up!

351
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,400
The bandits will break in soon!

352
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,240
I need more people over here.

353
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,530
Quick!

354
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,870
Xiuxiu!

355
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,910
Xiuxiu!

356
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,870
Xiuxiu!

357
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,280
Auntie Dajiao sent me to protect you.

358
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,530
Hurry!

359
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,660
She's worried sick.

360
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,560
Young Master!

361
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,600
Young Master!

362
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,270
Kejin!

363
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,020
What can we do?

364
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
What can we do?

365
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,150
Fei Wu.

366
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,770
Have them patrol the perimeter wall

367
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,070
to prevent any lone bandits from
sneaking in for an ambush.

368
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,870
-Okay.
-Okay.

369
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,790
Let's go.

370
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,850
Kejin.

371
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,080
What should I do?

372
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,130
Can you handle a gun?

373
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
I've shot rabbits before.

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,560
Give him a gun.

375
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,720
However you shot those rabbits,

376
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,920
that's how you'll shoot those bandits.

377
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,920
You scoundrels, I'll get you all!

378
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,310
What's going on?

379
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,370
What's happening?

380
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,190
Commander Kejin.

381
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,550
Let me speak to

382
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,710
this scoundrel.

383
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,710
Let's try and get him to

384
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,160
negotiate

385
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
with the bandits.

386
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,870
Second Boss!

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,270
Second Boss!

388
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,510
Second Boss!

389
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,030
Second Boss!

390
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,270
Second Boss!

391
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,940
You little brat.

392
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
You little brat!

393
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,640
I told you not to stick with the bandits,

394
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,000
but you wouldn't listen.

395
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,550
And now?

396
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,910
Karma's coming back for you, right?

397
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,900
Come, stack the stones over here.

398
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,870
Feng Si.

399
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,270
Take my advice.

400
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Just surrender

401
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,300
and say something conciliatory.

402
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,320
Saving your life is what matters.

403
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Save your life!

404
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,000
You know in our Feng family,

405
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,090
odd-numbered sons are ill-fated

406
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,750
while even-numbered sons enjoy good fate.

407
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,080
Our first and third brothers have passed.

408
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,790
It's just the two of us left.

409
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,810
If something happens to you,

410
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,110
how will I face our ancestors?

411
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,550
What's so hard about admitting
you were wrong?

412
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,470
I'll also talk to Xiuxiu

413
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,820
and ask her brother to let you off.

414
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
We'll cut all ties with those bandits.

415
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,320
Er.

416
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
Er.

417
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,670
Open the iron gates for me,

418
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,840
so I can quickly escape
with the women and children.

419
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,960
Even if I apologize to Ning Kejin now,

420
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,700
he won't let me off either.

421
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,950
You brat!

422
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
You want to drag us down with you?

423
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,440
Er!

424
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,160
Er!

425
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,820
Er!

426
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,360
Everyone move faster! Hurry!

427
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,770
Second Boss!

428
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
Go, go, go!

429
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,630
Second Boss!

430
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,750
Second Boss.

431
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,440
Keep up! Keep up!

432
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Look,

433
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,480
are these people enough?

434
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,540
All of them are related to
Ox Temple Village in some way.

435
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,859
Get them to squat.

436
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,569
Everyone squat down!

437
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,839
-Don't move!
-Squat down!

438
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,640
Hurry up!

439
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,110
The elderly and children stay here,

440
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,030
the rest of you,

441
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,760
take your farm tools

442
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,350
and dig around the fortress.

443
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,830
Didn't you hear? Move it! Get going!

444
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,240
Quick!

445
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,000
Get up!

446
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,000
Faster!

447
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,160
Get up!

448
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,580
Faster!

449
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,680
Hurry up.

450
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,720
Move it!

451
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,760
Move forward, or I'll shoot you!

452
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,920
Something's wrong.

453
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,590
Keep moving!

454
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,320
Something seems to have happened
in our village.

455
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,160
Don't go any further.

456
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,750
Get moving! Hurry up!

457
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,240
Let me tell you!

458
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,470
All these guns are pointed at you!

459
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,470
If you don't move,

460
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,170
we'll shoot all of you dead!

461
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,200
Bandits have surrounded the village.

462
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,880
Let's run!

463
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,320
Where are you running to?

464
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,980
I've seen what happens when
bandits surround a village.

465
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,110
Once they get in, nothing will be left.

466
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,030
What about our families?

467
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,400
Are we abandoning everyone in the village?

468
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,240
How can we help?

469
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
We're unarmed

470
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,830
and we've an old donkey over there.

471
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,680
What can we do?

472
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,740
Isn't Ning Kejin's militia there?

473
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,540
It's not our place to interfere.

474
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,110
Let's go! Quick!

475
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,570
Hurry up!

476
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,850
Hurry!

477
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
People inside the fortress,

478
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,170
please tell my brother,

479
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Pan Sanjin,

480
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
that I had no choice.

481
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,250
I was forced to come here

482
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,840
to dig at your fortress.

483
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,590
Brother!

484
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,590
Brother!

485
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,750
I'm here!

486
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm guarding the fortress.

487
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,460
Don't help the bandits dig, you hear me?

488
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,350
But your nephew Niuhai

489
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,810
has been captured by the bandits.

490
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,980
I-I didn't dare refuse.

491
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,000
Sixth Uncle, it's me, Qingcao.

492
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,180
They forced me to come dig up your fortress.

493
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,140
Cao!

494
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,350
You mustn't dig!

495
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,870
You were married off from my family.

496
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,260
I was the one who arranged it for you!

497
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,720
Our dear relatives on the outside!

498
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,880
The bandits are afraid to come themselves,

499
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,280
that's why they sent you.

500
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,610
Just pretend to dig.

501
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,740
You can probably get away with it.

502
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,380
That's right.

503
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,780
Those inside are our relatives too, right?

504
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,210
We can't actually dig for real.

505
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,520
Fei Wu.

506
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,420
They can't keep up the pretense for long.

507
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,750
Tell our men,

508
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,830
anyone with a gun

509
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,830
should get up on here on the fortress.

510
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,770
For those without guns,

511
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,030
the farming households

512
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,630
who may have hunting rifles at home

513
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,780
should also bring them all here.

514
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,410
Alright, Kejin.

515
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,140
Go, quickly!

516
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,110
Kejin, there's a bandit
who's passed out below.

517
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,270
Drag him up here.

518
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,170
Hang him up.

519
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,920
When we come back...

520
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,930
I promise

521
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,860
your things wouldn't be lost.

522
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,860
Hurry and leave before it's dark.

523
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,960
Will you be okay?

524
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,180
Repeat what I just told you.

525
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,270
Just go to the county and find
that farmers' association guy named...

526
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,570
Du Chunlin, Director Du.

527
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,170
Tell him bandits have surrounded
our village,

528
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,570
and ask him to quickly find a solution.

529
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,030
Right, the donkey is fast.

530
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,770
You'll be there in less than two hours,

531
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,500
Hurry and go.

532
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,590
Don't confront them head-on!

533
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,200
Wait until I get back.

534
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,110
Fine, get going

535
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,110
and stop nagging.

536
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,950
Second Boss, they've strung up Da Zong.

537
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,050
He seems to have stopped breathing.

538
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,590
So this is them going up against me, huh?

539
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,840
Tell them to dig faster!

540
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,140
Knock down the fortress and push inwards!

541
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,600
We'll rush in then. Hurry!

542
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,600
Dig faster!

543
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,690
Did you hear that?

544
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,050
If you don't dig,
we'll shoot you to death!

545
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,540
Set up a pot and
boil some water immediately.

546
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,740
Tie those straw ropes and soak it in oil.

547
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,710
Bring them all up here soon.

548
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,930
It's our defense if they set up ladders
and attack the fortress.

549
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,310
Yes, Kejin.

550
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,810
Go quickly.

551
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,380
Yes.

552
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,590
The bandits are attacking!

553
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,070
Yinzi, be careful!

554
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,880
Set up the pots quickly!

555
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,200
Set up a few more of them.

556
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,830
Got it!

557
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
Bandits! Get inside, quick!

558
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,450
Xiuxiu!

559
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,830
Xiuxiu!

560
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,110
Xiuxiu!

561
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,200
Why is everyone here?

562
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,590
We're not hiding anymore.

563
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,160
We're here to help you.

564
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Xiuxiu, I'm not hiding either.

565
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,960
Come quick!

566
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,270
Little one, why are you here too?

567
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm here to help fight the bandits.

568
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,560
You all go over there

569
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,440
and set up the pots.

570
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,830
Alright,

571
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,920
Be careful!

572
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,240
Why don't I see our Tietou?

573
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,400
Could he still be on the fields of
Sesame Gully

574
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,260
and hasn't come back?

575
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,340
Auntie, isn't it better if he's not here?

576
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,540
At least he could hide when he sees this.

577
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
That's true.

578
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,720
Father.

579
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,590
Yes?

580
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,170
How confident are you in holding the fort?

581
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,850
Absolutely confident.

582
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,590
Those three guys all said the same thing.

583
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,570
There are only a few dozen men
in the forest.

584
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,970
I'll go get you some wine.

585
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,560
When the fighting starts,
some alcohol will give you courage.

586
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,230
Kejin.

587
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,690
Take good care of your sister.

588
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't let her...

589
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,060
Father.

590
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,460
You heard it just now, didn't you?

591
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,920
My sister wasn't violated by the bandits.

592
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,130
Second Boss.

593
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,900
Your strategy is really good.

594
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,590
Second Boss, your plan is brilliant.

595
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,880
It seems like they're digging,
but nothing's coming loose.

596
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,680
They're just pretending to dig.

597
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,190
Either you dig or you die!

598
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,720
If you want to live, start digging now!

599
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,270
Father!

600
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,240
Father!

601
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,800
You dare try to fool me?

602
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,590
Father!

603
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,960
My dear villagers,

604
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,350
if we don't dig, we'll die!

605
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,700
We'd better dig for real.

606
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,120
We have to dig for real, okay?

607
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Come on, dig!

608
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,470
Let's dig for real.

609
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,490
Kejin!

610
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,200
We can't let them dig anymore.

611
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,600
If they continue digging,
we won't be able to stop the horses.

612
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,730
Everyone!

613
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,160
Everyone!

614
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,200
Let's hurry and get the stones,
boiling water

615
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
and straw ropes

616
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,720
up the fortress.

617
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,110
The bandits are about to
attack our fortress,

618
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,160
so move faster!

619
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,110
Hurry!

620
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,550
Villagers!

621
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,200
I beg you, please stop digging!

622
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,750
I'm begging you!

623
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,110
Go quickly, go!

624
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,510
Please, I'm begging you!

625
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,980
Please, I beg you!

626
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,850
Let's go!

627
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,770
Let's go! We'll stop digging.

628
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,070
Brother!

629
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,030
Brother!

630
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,640
Stop digging, I'm begging you!

631
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,200
We can't!

632
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
My wife and children are being held
by the bandits.

633
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
I beg you, please stop digging!

634
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
Stop it!

635
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,510
I'm begging you!

636
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,720
Brothers!

637
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,220
Attack them!

638
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,540
Aim at the top!

639
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,080
Second Boss.

640
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,490
We don't know what's going on in there,

641
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,940
but they know our tactics inside out.

642
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,710
What if

643
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,640
we send someone back

644
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,110
to get Boss to help us?

645
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,230
Boss had no idea we had left,

646
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,640
and I don't want him to know either.

647
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Can we break into Ox Temple Village?

648
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,550
Why wouldn't we?

649
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,000
When you followed me to
raid other villages,

650
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,690
didn't we just fire a few shots

651
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,030
and they all ran away?

652
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,540
This time it's all because of Feng Si.

653
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,660
What on earth are you afraid of!

654
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,440
Other villages

655
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,370
don't have such a strong fortress.

656
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,160
Enough!

657
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,790
Stop shooting!

658
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,220
Save your bullets.

659
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,590
Ning Kejin.

660
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
Let me tell you.

661
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,850
Our Boss is already bringing

662
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,960
all our men from the mountain here.

663
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,000
If you're smart,

664
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,610
open the gate for me right now!

665
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,310
This is your last chance.

666
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,730
Who are you trying to fool?

667
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,270
You're just out of bullets, aren't you?

668
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,880
Are you okay, Kejin?

669
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
If Big Nose Du brings his men,

670
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
what should we do?

671
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,070
Let them come.

672
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
We'll wipe them all out.

673
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,510
Brothers!

674
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
One group

675
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,680
take the hostages and attack the gate.

676
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
Another group

677
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
bring firewood

678
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,220
and burn down the gate!

679
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,330
Hurry up! Hurry!

680
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,900
Move it!

681
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,000
Get moving,

682
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,310
or we'll shoot you all!

683
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,460
Move along! Move! Faster!

684
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,680
Hurry!

685
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,920
Second Uncle!

686
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,520
It's me!

687
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,270
San Tuozi!

688
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,230
I've been taken hostage by the bandits.

689
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,460
Tell the militia

690
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,750
don't shoot.

691
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,440
Don't ever shoot!

692
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,750
Third Brother, Sister-in-law,

693
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,550
are you on the inside?

694
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,090
I'm Dengxin's mother!

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Keep moving forward!

696
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,070
My uncle is down there too.

697
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,070
I really can't bring myself to do it.

698
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,190
Kejin.

699
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,120
Kejin.

700
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,400
I just saw

701
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,310
that those injured down there

702
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,400
are all our relatives.

703
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,350
I saw that too,

704
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,030
but what do you want me to do?

705
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,490
We can't let those bandits
into the village.

706
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,100
Father!

707
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,270
Hu San!

708
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Second Uncle!

709
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,670
Kejin, don't move! I'll jump if you do.

710
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,400
Hu San.

711
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,030
I'm the village head of Ox Temple Village,

712
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,750
and I've come to speak with you.

713
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,790
Speak!

714
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,000
Finally, someone sensible has
come forward.

715
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,270
Go ahead, speak!

716
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,270
Can I exchange myself

717
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,350
for those hostages,

718
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,200
and then

719
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,730
we can discuss your terms for withdrawal?

720
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,000
Fine.

721
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,450
We can discuss.

722
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,210
But I won't accept

723
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
you coming over.

724
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,640
We want that hostage
we captured the last time.

725
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,160
Get that young woman whom our brothers
didn't get to violate

726
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,270
to come and talk with me.

727
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,790
Yes!

728
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,860
I need to ask her

729
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,830
how she injured my brother

730
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,810
and how she managed to escape from

731
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,700
our heavily guarded stronghold.

732
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,130
Send her

733
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,120
to come talk to me.

734
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,910
If we reach an agreement,

735
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,240
maybe I'll spare your village.

736
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,950
Yes!

737
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,590
Did you hear that?

738
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,240
My Xiu.

739
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,950
Brothers who aren't afraid to die,

740
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,480
follow me out of the village

741
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,980
and kill these bandits!

742
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
-Father!
-Kejin!

743
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,360
Kejin, they have hostages!

744
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,630
Be careful!

745
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,590
Xiuxiu!

746
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,520
Where are you going, Xiuxiu?

747
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,570
Shoot them!

748
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,960
Save them! Quick!

749
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,790
Quick! Let's save them!

750
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
Hurry!

751
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,290
Xiuxiu!

752
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,510
Be careful!

753
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,310
Brothers!

754
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,250
Get the explosives ready.

755
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,790
Blow them up!

756
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,950
Do it!

757
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,550
Brother!

758
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,980
Fire!

759
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,240
Shoot them!

760
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,960
Where's my gun?

761
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,750
Give me my gun!
I'll fight him to the death!

762
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,540
Go!

763
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,510
Give me my gun!

764
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,960
Get inside quickly, hurry!

765
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,640
Xiuxiu!

766
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,960
Liu San!

767
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,790
Come quick, help him!

768
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,170
Take him inside!

769
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,820
Give me my gun!

770
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,000
Go!

771
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,790
Hurry inside the compound
and close the gate!

772
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,510
Get inside and shut the gate!

773
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,090
Close the gate now!

774
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,530
Let's go, Kejin!

775
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,790
Don't close the gate!
There are still people outside!

776
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,550
Hurry, Xiuxiu is still outside!

777
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,880
Has anyone seen Xiuxiu?

778
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,180
Did anyone see Xiuxiu?

779
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,430
Auntie, I didn't protect Xiuxiu.

780
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,850
Xiuxiu is now locked outside the fortress.

781
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,540
-Xiuxiu!
-Xiuxiu!

782
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,110
Xiuxiu!

783
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,770
-Xiuxiu!
-Xiuxiu!

784
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,680
-Xiuxiu!
-Xiuxiu!

785
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,310
Are you okay?

786
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,270
Hu San!

787
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,410
Stop shooting!

788
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,830
-Careful!
-Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

789
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,830
-Kejin!
-There are some who haven't made it in!

790
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,350
-Come back!
-Open the gate!

791
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,750
Kejin, let's hide first.

792
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,620
Bring me everyone. Quickly!

793
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,160
Hurry!

794
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,750
Grab that one in the middle!

795
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,400
Hurry!

796
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,310
Move it!

797
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,400
Move! Move!

798
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:20,950
Quick!

799
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,560
Get down!

800
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,640
Quickly, get down!

801
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,740
Don't cry anymore.

802
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,270
Ning Kejin!

803
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,920
Weren't you going to chase me?

804
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,380
Come on, shoot!

805
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,510
Fight me!

806
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,410
I'll play this game to the end.

807
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,590
Open the fortress' gate for me now.

808
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,590
If you don't open the gate...

809
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,850
you will get one corpse

810
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,400
every hour.

811
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,850
Let go! Give her to me!

812
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,960
Let go!

813
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,000
Let go!

814
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,850
Listen carefully.

815
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,200
I don't have time to waste with you.

816
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,330
I'll count to three.

817
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,110
If you don't open the gate,
I'll shoot her dead!

818
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,590
One!

819
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,360
Hu San!

820
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
Two!

821
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,760
Three!

822
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,110
I have something to say!

823
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,020
Xiu!

824
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,679
Get down! Don't stick out! It's dangerous!

825
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,630
My lady.

826
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,000
We meet again.

827
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,210
Go ahead, speak.

828
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,630
Even heaven is on my side.

829
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,870
I'm telling you.

830
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,030
P-Please spare everyone.

831
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,670
You're telling me

832
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,230
to let them go?

833
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,960
Fine.

834
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,370
Then tell me...

835
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,080
Why should I let them go?

836
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,110
I heard...

837
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,080
I heard what you told Second Uncle.

838
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,560
That if I speak with you,

839
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,360
you won't enter the village

840
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,020
and won't harm the villagers.

841
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,840
I'll agree to anything.

842
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,000
Let everyone go.

843
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,280
Fine.

844
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,300
You're really something,

845
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,030
You're a brave woman.

846
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Did you hear that?

847
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,440
She's risking herself

848
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,710
to negotiate with me for your sake.

849
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,400
What if I don't agree?

850
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,710
Kejin.

851
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
-Father.
-Kejin.

852
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,740
Father.

853
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,510
I brought you some wine.

854
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,970
Father。

855
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,640
Xiu ran out and
got surrounded by the bandits.

856
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,440
Xiu!

857
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,280
What did I tell you?

858
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,960
I told you to watch over your sister
and not let her go out.

859
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,590
How did you let her get away?

860
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,070
Xiuxiu! Xiu!

861
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,070
Father! Father!

862
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,440
-Xiu!
Come on.

863
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,110
In front of everyone,

864
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,620
call out to the bandits

865
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
and tell them to release Xiuxiu.

866
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,510
Xiuxiu is carrying

867
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,910
the heir of our Feng family in her belly.

868
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,590
Hurry up!

869
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,350
Second Boss.

870
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I'm begging you,

871
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,110
Charge in!

872
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,480
Sleep with all the Ning family’s women!

873
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,280
Tear Ning Xuexiang into pieces!

874
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
Go to hell!

875
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,410
Mr. Feng!

876
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,630
Spare his miserable life.

877
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,510
Buzz off!

878
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,310
Don't beg him!

879
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,120
Feng Si.

880
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,070
If you won't save Xiuxiu, I will.

881
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:36,980
Father!

882
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,690
Feng Si.

883
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,000
Feng Si!

884
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,610
Father!

885
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,350
Stop them quickly!

886
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,580
Don't let them leave.

887
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,770
You know who my brother is

888
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,930
and who my father is.

889
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,990
Otherwise, I'll die right here.

890
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,480
And you'll get nothing.

891
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,590
Put that knife down.

892
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,780
As long as you agree

893
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,020
to come back to Chicken Ridge with me,

894
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
I'll let them go.

895
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,360
You know that place well,

896
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,740
don't you?

897
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,670
Let the villagers go!

898
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,230
Xiuxiu, don't!

899
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,200
Release them.

900
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,000
Go! Scram!

901
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,030
Hurry up!

902
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,980
Move!

903
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,280
Hurry!

904
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,120
Move quickly, go!

905
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,800
Go!

906
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,550
Hurry!

907
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,670
I kept my word, didn't I?

908
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,000
Come, follow me back.

909
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,320
Don't move!

910
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,860
Take her away.

911
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,820
Move!

912
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,160
Nobody moves!

913
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,060
Don't move!

914
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,590
Dajiao!

915
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,480
Don't move! Don't move!

916
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,680
If anyone moves, I'll stab him to death.

917
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,050
Don't you move!

918
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,390
Brother.

919
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,760
It's Dajiao.

920
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,610
I don't think we have any grudges
between us.

921
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,510
State your name.

922
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,710
I'm a butcher,

923
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,670
and I know this knife

924
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,490
is just half an inch away
from your windpipe.

925
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,760
Take your pick.

926
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,320
Should I stab your heart directly...

927
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,880
-or take your windpipe instead?
-No, no, no.

928
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,760
No, please don't.

929
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,490
I won't pick.

930
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,360
Good man,

931
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,440
just tell me what you want, alright?

932
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,190
Let my wife go.

933
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,750
Let my wife go!

934
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,540
Release her!

935
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,190
Second Boss!

936
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,790
Let her go!

937
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,760
Let her go!

938
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,280
Release her!

939
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,410
Xiu, hurry up and go.

940
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,860
What about you?

941
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Go quickly!

942
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,280
If you don't leave, I can't either.

943
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,840
Go!

944
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,090
Quick, open the gate!

945
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,450
Open the gate!

946
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,110
Master!

947
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,670
Xiuxiu!

948
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,110
Quick!

949
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,900
Come in quickly!

950
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,740
Hurry!

951
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,920
Get inside quickly!

952
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,280
Quick,

953
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,680
get in!

954
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,440
Feng Si!

955
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,760
Go!

956
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,650
Er...

957
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,590
Hurry!

958
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,990
He's my Feng Si!

959
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,490
Er... I'm sorry.

960
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,150
close the gate quickly!

961
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,840
Are you alright?

962
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,360
Hurry up!

963
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,890
Let's go!

964
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,750
Move it!

965
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,100
I understand now.

966
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,250
You're her husband, right?

967
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,190
Yes.

968
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,880
Remember this.

969
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,050
My name is Feng Dajiao,

970
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm Xiuxiu's man.

971
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,560
Before I came along, you all bullied her.

972
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,960
But now I'm here,

973
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,320
and none of you will bully her anymore.

974
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,980
Tell your people to back off.

975
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,510
Back off!

976
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,150
Back off!

977
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,690
Step back!

978
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,750
Everyone back off!

979
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,600
Hurry up, you hear me?

980
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,490
Quickly!

981
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,090
Back off now!

982
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,200
Back off!

983
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,370
Brother.

984
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,550
Do you think...

985
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,360
I'm scared of you?

986
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,320
If you really make a move,

987
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,990
do you really think

988
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,900
you'll actually survive?

989
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,470
I dared to jump out

990
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,190
because I've everything figured out.

991
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,970
You think I'm afraid of you?

992
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Let me tell you.

993
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,880
I've already sent someone to get
the farmers' association's militia.

994
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,140
If you don't leave now,

995
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,930
we might just raid
your entire Chicken Ridge.

996
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,600
Step back!

997
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,150
Back off!

998
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,080
Back off, back off now!

999
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,300
Dajiao!

1000
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,800
Listen to Uncle Si.

1001
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,650
Put down the knife.

1002
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,910
Uncle Si is here.

1003
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
Why is he grabbing a gun?

1004
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,630
Uncle Si!

1005
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,730
Get lost!

1006
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
Brothers, attack!

1007
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,880
Shoot them now!

1008
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,190
Charge!

1009
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,380
Charge!

1010
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,030
My reinforcements are here!

1011
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,320
Brothers!

1012
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,550
Let's go out and beat them up!

1013
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,070
Get them!

1014
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,960
Get them!

1015
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,070
Charge!

1016
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,230
Charge!

1017
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,190
Charge!

1018
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,970
Kill the bandits!

1019
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,450
Kill them!
