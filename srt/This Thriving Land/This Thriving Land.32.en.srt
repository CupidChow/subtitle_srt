[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,920
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,370
I think those Japanese
have scared you witless.

4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,590
You gave them

5
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,660
over 600 mu of land for their farm.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,550
Why can't you stand up just once?

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,240
Over 600 mu!

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,150
I can't stand watching you
serve them like a lackey.

9
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,229
It's infuriating.

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Why bring that up?

11
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,430
You think I wanted to?

12
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,070
It was a task Administrator Liu gave me.

13
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,120
He said if I do it well,
our family will be safe.

14
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,370
How could I refuse?

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Besides,

16
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,960
why do you think I'm doing this?

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,250
Isn't it so we get more grain

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,800
out of the fields,

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,460
so you

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,910
and our son

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,520
won't starve?

22
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm doing it for your family.

23
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,260
All right, Father.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,280
In this family, besides me, the one

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
who cares most for you is Mom.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
Nonsense.

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,880
Such a smooth talker.

28
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,770
So smart.

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,850
Susu,

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,520
I'm going to cook.

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,960
Sister-in-law,

32
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,680
let's eat mixed grain flour today.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,740
Save the good rice,

34
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,610
in case Wendian comes back.

35
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,930
Let's save it for him.

36
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,990
Let's save it.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
Give me a bit more.

38
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,010
Alright.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
Eggs for salt.

40
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,180
Eggs for salt.

41
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,490
Eggs for salt.

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,410
You even have peanut oil?

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,710
The Japanese took all the peanuts.

44
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
What oil?

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,970
Then why are you carrying that oil jar?

46
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,450
I was hoping
to trade the salt for some oil.

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,079
Here,

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
get me some fine salt.

49
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
Ms. Susu,

50
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,200
there's only coarse salt left.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,010
That's fine.

52
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,960
I'll take some.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,500
Is your sister-in-law feeling better?

54
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,870
What can we do if she isn't?

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,000
Life goes on anyway.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,980
My sister-in-law told me

57
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,780
to thank you when I saw you,

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,560
for letting us know
when you first came back.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,620
Otherwise, we'd still be in the dark.

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,680
Anyone would have done the same thing.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,430
What happened to your hand?

62
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,630
Why so many blisters?

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,680
It's nothing,

64
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,000
just from chopping firewood.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,910
Your hands
aren't meant for chopping firewood.

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
What else can I do?

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,490
Qing and Beard Liu are gone.

68
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,560
How can we eat if no one cooks?

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,250
Does it hurt?

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,440
It's fine.

71
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,080
I'll just wrap it up later.

72
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I'll be going now.

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,390
These days,

74
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,160
everyone's having a hard time.

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,120
Who is it?

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,950
It's me,

77
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,040
Guo Guiyao.

78
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,860
Why are you here again?

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,800
If I didn't come,

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,530
would you still have firewood?

81
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
Guiyao,

82
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,360
thanks. Let me get you some money.

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,820
No need.

84
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,940
Gathering some firewood
is no trouble for me.

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,130
I don't want your money.

86
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,800
Besides,

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,510
you and Susu
were my good customers before.

88
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,160
I run an honest business,

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,870
but I did make money from you.

90
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,750
I've always kept that in my heart.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,390
There are only you two women left
in this family now.

92
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,310
Don't be polite with me in the future.

93
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,240
Just let me know if you need anything.

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,840
All right.

95
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,250
Then let me wrap up
some sweet potato slices for you.

96
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,110
Freshly steamed. Take them home.

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,530
Then I won't be polite.

98
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,450
I won't need to cook tonight.

99
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

100
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,390
Oh, right.

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Apply this on your hands.

102
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,740
Don't get them wet.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Guo Guiyao,

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,600
how come I never realized
you're such a good-hearted man?

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,210
You've been judging me too narrowly.

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,010
I've always been good-hearted.

107
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,270
When those Japanese finally leave,

108
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,130
I'll still be your good customer.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,430
Alright.

110
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,560
This isn't my intention,

111
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,490
but it feels good to hear that.

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,940
Let me help you.

113
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,130
Alright, alright.

114
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,490
Give those hands a rest.

115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,390
Father! Mother!

116
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,230
What is it?

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
Two people
are coming up the mountain road.

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,890
Who are they?

119
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,390
They don't look like Japanese

120
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,520
or puppet soldiers.

121
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,210
They look unfamiliar.

122
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,950
Xiu,

123
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,130
you go back first.

124
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,270
Aunties,

125
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,820
come with me.

126
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,310
Okay.

127
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:35,870
Dajiao.

128
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,450
You stay here. I'll go.

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go.

130
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,830
Be careful.

131
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,200
Come on.

132
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,810
Give me a hand.

133
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,270
Tietou!

134
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,200
It's Chang Chun!

135
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,310
Dajiao!

136
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,240
Chang Chun!

137
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,480
Chang Chun!

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,160
Dajiao!

139
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,190
It's you guys.

140
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,120
Jia, you're here too?

141
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Dajiao.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,750
Chang Chun,

143
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,750
you must be exhausted from the journey.

144
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,750
Really exhausting.

145
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,560
Have some water.

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,620
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

147
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,190
Shopkeeper Chang Chun,

148
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,120
why haven't you come by for so long?

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,660
I haven't been here for so long

150
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,240
because I

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,820
joined the Eighth Route Army,

152
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,150
fighting the Japanese.

153
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,810
The Eighth Route Army?

154
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,630
What about your pharmacy?

155
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,110
That's exactly why I'm here.

156
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,800
From now on,
if there's anything important,

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
go to Changchun Pharmacy in the county.

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,630
Our comrades are there.

159
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,830
It's a contact point?

160
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,240
Yes.

161
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,720
Usually, Jia is there too.

162
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,590
Jia,

163
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,270
why didn't Fei Wendian

164
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,560
come back together?

165
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,050
Yes.

166
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,430
What's wrong?

167
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,240
Dajiao,

168
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,720
Xiuxiu...

169
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,000
Fei...

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
Mr. Fei Wendian...

171
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,750
is dead.

172
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,910
Not long ago,

173
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,970
over 30,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers

174
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,900
launched a sweep against our base.

175
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,150
Mr. Fei

176
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,750
led our squad

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,860
and defeated several enemy units

178
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,850
during this counter-sweep.

179
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,220
But during the retreat,

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,830
they encountered enemy reinforcements.

181
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,120
Mr. Fei was wounded in his arms and legs.

182
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,490
On the way to the rear hospital,

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,470
their medical team

184
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,000
was hit by an enemy airstrike.

185
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,960
According to messages from our comrades
in the mountains,

186
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,820
the wounded...

187
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,390
the wounded and the medics

188
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,270
all died.

189
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,790
We searched,

190
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,630
but only found

191
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,120
this backpack he always carried,

192
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
this notebook,

193
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,030
a pen,

194
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,480
and this letter.

195
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,770
[To Mrs. Fei, My Sister-in-law]

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,040
Dear Sister-in-law, Susu,

197
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,430
hello.

198
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm writing this letter to you
from the mountains.

199
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,070
I went in the mountains with our unit.

200
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,270
This afternoon we fought a skirmish
against the Japanese

201
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,510
and drove them out of the valley.

202
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,790
After a short rest here,

203
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,430
we will continue to press the attack

204
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,200
and reclaim our lost land.

205
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,080
I don't know

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,180
when this letter will reach you,

207
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,830
but today, for some reason,

208
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,330
I especially want to talk to you.

209
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,800
Sister-in-law,

210
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,470
now I live with death every day,

211
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,230
yet I feel no fear.

212
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,990
On the contrary,

213
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,150
my heart grows more peaceful each day.

214
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,170
It is my faith and conviction that tell me

215
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,600
I am doing the right thing each day.

216
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,910
Although I am ready

217
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,210
to spill all my blood

218
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,860
on the battlefield at any moment,

219
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,140
I'm not sad.

220
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,770
Instead, I feel truly happy.

221
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,880
Sister-in-law,

222
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,180
don't mind me talking about
death and sacrifice.

223
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,110
I know you value my life

224
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,940
even more than I do.

225
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,870
Sister-in-law,

226
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,740
I just want to tell you

227
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,470
that in reflecting on life,

228
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,070
my heart is full of deep respect for you.

229
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,520
A sister-in-law is like a mother.

230
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,320
The memories of growing up in your care

231
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
are especially vivid

232
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,770
during these days of fierce fighting.

233
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,840
It makes me feel guilty
for the little filial piety

234
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,200
and companionship I've given you.

235
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,120
Wendian, don't cry.

236
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,990
Wendian, go to sleep.

237
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,920
Sister-in-law,

238
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
let me share a thought with you.

239
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,240
When we win this war,

240
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,220
I will take you out of the Fei family.

241
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,050
Wendian,

242
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,080
when you get to school,

243
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,410
listen to your teacher.

244
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,700
When you come back,

245
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,930
I'll make your favorite Yishui rice cake.

246
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,130
I want to take you out
of Ox Temple Village

247
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,750
to see how our country and our world

248
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,390
are slowly becoming a better place.

249
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,810
Madam, you should go back.

250
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,570
If all this comes true,

251
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,420
it will be my greatest act
of filial devotion to you in my life.

252
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,510
My dear sister-in-law,

253
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,510
as for the Fei family lands

254
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,440
and our large house

255
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,760
that you've faithfully guarded for me,

256
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
you know what?

257
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,870
Those were never what I wanted.

258
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,780
Yet they've become your burden,

259
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
tying you down for most of your life.

260
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,930
Sister-in-law,

261
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,670
I sincerely hope you won't

262
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,440
be burdened
by these material things anymore.

263
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,640
When the day of victory comes,

264
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,900
I believe you will gladly
join me in giving

265
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,920
our land and house to those

266
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,000
who need it more than we do.

267
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,880
I'll leave this family

268
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,870
in your care.

269
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,770
[No animals were harmed
in the making of this film]

270
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,380
Skinny,

271
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,610
my old donkey.

272
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,600
I got you some medicine for wounds.

273
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,960
We barely used it a few times.

274
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,850
How could you just leave me?

275
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,860
You carried me through so many roads

276
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,540
without fuss over food or drink.

277
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,100
Why today, of all days,

278
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,470
did you leave me alone?

279
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm burying you today.

280
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,450
Who will bury me in the future?

281
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,080
You're my only family.

282
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,740
Everyone told me to eat you,

283
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,870
but how could I?

284
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,650
I'd rather die

285
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,200
than eat you.

286
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
Bye.

287
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Susu,

288
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,800
last time you told me

289
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,480
you'd wait for me to go home.

290
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,800
You know what?

291
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,120
Since that day,

292
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,670
I've dreamed several times

293
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,280
of returning home.

294
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,870
I've never longed or yearned for home

295
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,270
like this before.

296
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,550
Susu,

297
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,280
what are you doing here?

298
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,680
Fei Wendian is gone.

299
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,900
Gone where?

300
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,200
In this life,

301
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,830
he'll never come back.

302
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,900
He...

303
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,100
Fei Wendian...

304
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,020
is dead.

305
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,000
Wendian has sacrificed himself.

306
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,780
This news

307
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,770
completely crushed
Susu's newly rising hope

308
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,790
for the days ahead.

309
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,210
My heart aches.

310
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,790
I wish I could hold Susu in my arms

311
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,440
like when she was a child.

312
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,550
But my little sister

313
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
is already an adult now.

314
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,830
She didn't even come to me
crying like before.

315
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,910
She silently accepted everything.

316
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,190
That makes me feel even more

317
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,750
that it is I,

318
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,510
and this fate,

319
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,920
that have failed her.

320
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,160
Chang Chun also brought us
the long-awaited news

321
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,940
about Mr. Du.

322
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,790
He's leading the guerrillas
fighting against the Japanese.

323
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,620
Dajiao told me to tell Mrs. Fei and Susu

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,150
that Mr. Du will surely avenge Wendian

325
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,360
by killing more Japanese.

326
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,250
Sister-in-law.

327
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Why did you come back?

328
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,930
Wendian is gone.

329
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,590
You should leave too.

330
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,200
Sister-in-law,

331
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,349
Wendian is gone.

332
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,089
I'll stay with you.

333
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,140
I don't need your company.

334
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,079
Seeing you just reminds me of Wendian.

335
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,560
You failed Wendian,

336
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,790
failed me,

337
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,839
and failed the Fei family.

338
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,200
If you had kept the child you lost before,

339
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,210
the little one
would be running around the yard,

340
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,010
and Wendian wouldn't have left.

341
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,690
Just go.

342
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,770
The Fei family doesn't want you anymore.

343
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,230
Take your things.

344
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,680
Sister-in-law.

345
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,960
Go!

346
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,450
You sent Jia and Chang Chun off?

347
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,950
Tietou and I

348
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
sent them to the back mountain path.

349
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,350
This time, Shopkeeper Chang Chun

350
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,440
left a task for Tietou and me:

351
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,110
gather all the trustworthy men

352
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,590
in the village

353
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,810
and coordinate with their armed team.

354
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,130
They'll come back at any time

355
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,790
to fight the Japanese with us,

356
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
eliminate

357
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,400
the traitors and puppet soldiers,

358
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,530
and avenge Wendian.

359
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,730
I'm just worried about Susu now.

360
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,960
Let's go check on them tomorrow.

361
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,130
Tomorrow I'll bring all these

362
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,360
peeled snacks to her.

363
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,440
Susu.

364
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,440
Susu?

365
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,990
Why are you back?

366
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,000
Fei Wendian...

367
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,920
is dead.

368
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,610
Mrs. Fei drove me out.

369
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,240
Wendian is dead?

370
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,640
What happened, Daughter?

371
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,590
Don't ask now.

372
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Susu's forehead is burning like charcoal.

373
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,130
Bring a basin of cold water, Kuangzi.

374
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,690
Do you think we should call the doctor?

375
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,000
Susu,

376
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,680
drink some water, alright?

377
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,140
You have a fever right now.

378
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,400
Alright?

379
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,070
Wendian.

380
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,370
Wendian.

381
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,000
Have you come back?

382
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,350
Where are you?

383
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,200
You said you wouldn't go back
to the ancestral hall

384
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
or kneel in there.

385
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,840
Where are you?

386
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
Have you come back?

387
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Wendian.

388
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,070
I'm out here.

389
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,210
Come out too

390
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
and see me.

391
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,160
Wendian.

392
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,650
I regret it.

393
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,350
I regret letting you study

394
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,360
and attend that modern school.

395
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,740
I shouldn't have made you

396
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,070
bring honor to the family.

397
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,100
If things had been different,

398
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,270
maybe at least

399
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,510
you wouldn't have died.

400
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,240
Wendian.

401
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,030
Wendian.

402
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,850
Where is Susu?

403
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,160
Susu is gone.

404
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Wendian is gone too.

405
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,790
They're all gone.

406
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,030
All gone.

407
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,400
Wendian.

408
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,000
Please come back.

409
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,270
Wendian!

410
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,240
You're up so early?

411
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,390
Why didn't you rest a bit longer?

412
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,300
I've slept enough.

413
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,400
You're much better now.

414
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,730
It's not so hot anymore.

415
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
I made you some chicken soup.

416
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,420
Drink it while it's hot.

417
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,850
I can't drink it.

418
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,940
Let me.

419
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,210
For making you take care of me.

421
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,350
No need to be so polite between us.

422
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,560
I was just feeling lonely
with no one to chat with.

423
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,270
Now that you're here, I'm so happy.

424
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,440
Once I'm better,

425
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,350
I can help you with anything.

426
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,030
I don't need a servant girl.

427
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,590
You just

428
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,960
stay home and take it easy.

429
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,060
As soon as you arrived,
I told your sister.

430
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,470
If you ever feel bored,

431
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,720
go find your sister to chat.

432
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,880
Susu,

433
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,610
everyone has hard times.

434
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,200
They'll pass eventually.

435
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,550
Now that you're home,

436
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,550
just be happy.

437
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,710
Yes.

438
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm home now.

439
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,510
I should be happy.

440
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
I can't let my family worry about me.

441
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Time

442
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,130
really flies.

443
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,750
In the blink of an eye,

444
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,350
I'm already in my thirties.

445
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,480
Well, look at me.

446
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,260
I even have gray hair now.

447
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,960
It'll be fine.

448
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,340
We have a blackboard now.

449
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,900
It'll make our classes much easier.

450
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,160
It was made exactly as Xiuxiu suggested.

451
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,000
I painted it with smelly ink three times.

452
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,090
-Thank you, Xiuxiu.
-Thank you, Xiuxiu.

453
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,220
It smells terrible.

454
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,810
No need for thanks.

455
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,420
I'm just happy you all could come.

456
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,010
Let's continue with our lesson.

457
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,010
Alright.

458
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
The three words I taught you yesterday—

459
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,440
people, mouth, foot—

460
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,380
do you still remember them?

461
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

462
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,210
Write them down and let me see.

463
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,000
People.

464
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:21,880
Father.

465
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,870
Why did you come back
instead of keeping watch?

466
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,200
He said he is Feng Niwei.

467
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,750
Uncle Meiwei talks about him every day.

468
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,790
Niwei?

469
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,140
You're Niwei?

470
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,910
Dajiao.

471
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,550
It's me.

472
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,920
Xiuxiu.

473
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,770
Second Auntie.

474
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,350
It's me.

475
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,750
Little Niwei is back.

476
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,780
It really is you.

477
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,310
Where have you been all these years?

478
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,640
You didn't even send a word.

479
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
It's a long story.

480
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,890
Meiwei,

481
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,510
come over here.

482
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,640
Go.

483
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,910
You brat.

484
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,990
You've grown so much.

485
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,400
Niwei.

486
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,070
Niwei.

487
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Where have you been all these years?

488
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,710
Why didn't you come back?

489
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,040
I dream about you every night.

490
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,990
You're finally back.

491
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,080
Why are you crying?

492
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,830
Like a little girl.

493
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,160
Niwei,

494
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,260
you eat.

495
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,940
It's thick.

496
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,060
Mixed grain flour?

497
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,200
My stomach's been ruined
from hunger all these years.

498
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,900
I can't go number two if I eat this.

499
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,490
Do you eat this every day?

500
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,510
We're lucky
to have anything to eat at all.

501
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,270
Our land

502
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,110
has all been turned into Japanese farms.

503
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,060
The good grain

504
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,970
has all been taken by the Japanese.

505
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,900
We can only get this mixed grain flour
periodically.

506
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,730
And even this isn't enough.

507
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,640
Meiwei,

508
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,200
go

509
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,360
get my satchel.

510
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,750
Here.

511
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,030
Dajiao.

512
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,110
This is

513
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,910
roasted chicken from Desheng Restaurant.

514
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,760
Pastries.

515
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,760
I brought these for the elders.

516
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,270
Second Auntie, try some.

517
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,110
Eat slowly.

518
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,910
Don't.

519
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,500
What a shame.

520
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,080
My mother and Second Uncle

521
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,270
won't get to enjoy these.

522
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,680
Here.

523
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,440
Xiuxiu.

524
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,750
You guys are eating?

525
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,590
Susu, you're here.

526
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,790
Come on, sit. Eat.

527
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,790
Xiuxiu, I've already eaten.

528
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,920
You sit. You eat.

529
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,940
Are we having a guest?

530
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,530
Not a guest. He's family.

531
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,990
This is my cousin.

532
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,920
You probably don't remember him.

533
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,410
He's Meiwei's brother, Niwei.

534
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,010
Remember?

535
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,100
Niwei? I remember.

536
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,150
I can still see the child
he used to be in his face.

537
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,920
I remember he ran away
when the bandits surrounded the village.

538
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,310
Meiwei has been so happy
since he came back.

539
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,510
Susu, have you eaten?

540
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,130
If not, eat a bit here.

541
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,070
Auntie Feng, I've eaten.

542
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,980
You keep eating.

543
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,770
Miss Susu.

544
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,490
Roasted chicken.

545
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,200
Try some.

546
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,200
I know

547
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
the Ning family doesn't lack this.

548
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,350
But I brought this back specifically.

549
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,600
It's a little gift from the heart.
Have a taste.

550
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,880
I've already eaten. You guys eat.

551
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,610
I just came to chat with Xiuxiu.

552
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,710
You eat.

553
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,640
Yinzi told me you went home.

554
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,270
You go ahead and eat first, Xiuxiu.

555
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,730
We can talk about me later.

556
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,580
I was just going to ask you.

557
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,270
Where have you been these years?

558
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,200
What did you do?

559
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,340
Did you have enough to eat?

560
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,410
Dajiao,

561
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,480
how could I have enough to eat?

562
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,100
I'm lucky I didn't starve to death.

563
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,580
Especially those first few years
after I left.

564
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,980
There were times
I went days without a meal,

565
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
eating roots or tree bark,

566
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,200
just drinking water

567
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,430
to fill my stomach.

568
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,350
Niwei,

569
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,240
then why didn't you come back?

570
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,300
Do you think I dare?

571
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,320
Didn't you hear just now?

572
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,720
Miss Susu said

573
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,460
we're a bandit's children.

574
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,810
Everyone wants us dead.

575
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,620
I know about this.

576
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,510
My sister and the villagers petitioned

577
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,160
for your mother and brother.

578
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,020
Xiuxiu said that crimes
shouldn't extend to family members,

579
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,280
so the villagers
stopped blaming your mother and brother.

580
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,610
Stopped blaming them?

581
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,090
Easy for you to say.

582
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,510
Then...

583
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,650
how did my mother starve to death?

584
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,780
Niwei,

585
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,270
Let me tell you.

586
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,750
What you said is too much.

587
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,550
Your mother really didn't know
how to survive.

588
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,930
During the famine,

589
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,720
which family had any food?

590
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,270
I saved some rations and sent them to her,

591
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,360
thinking they would sustain her
and your brother for half a month.

592
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,640
I didn't expect her

593
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,970
to cook them all in one meal.

594
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,160
In the following days,

595
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
she lay starving on her bed,

596
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,930
and that's how she died.

597
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,500
What were you doing back then?

598
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,510
Meiwei!

599
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,270
What are you doing?

600
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,020
What's wrong, Niwei?

601
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,670
He was just a child back then.

602
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,000
He managed to survive
by finding food on his own.

603
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,660
That was already incredible.

604
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,520
Let's eat.

605
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,890
Let's not talk about the past now.

606
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,880
Niwei,

607
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,730
I have a proper name now.

608
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,350
Xiuxiu gave it to me.
My name is Feng Zicheng.

609
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,910
Xiuxiu said that in our generation,

610
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,540
the middle character of our names is "Zi,"

611
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,670
which means "word."

612
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,670
Dajiao is called Feng Ziyong,
I'm Feng Zicheng,

613
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,330
and you should be Feng Ziming.

614
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,680
What do you think, Niwei?

615
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Nice name, right?

616
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,510
Feng Ziming?

617
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,050
I can't use that name.

618
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,290
I think Feng Niwei is just fine.

619
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,820
That's the name my parents gave me.

620
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,360
How can anyone just change their name
as they please?

621
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,270
How can you talk like that?

622
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,880
Let's eat.

623
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,440
Niwei,

624
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,590
you've been out there for over ten years.

625
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,320
How can you not tell right from wrong?

626
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,630
Your mother died,

627
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,190
and after Xiuxiu and Dajiao
brought your brother back,

628
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,660
they never let him go hungry

629
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,720
and never stopped taking care of him.

630
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,310
Everyone in the village has seen it.

631
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,510
They even taught him to read and write.

632
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,750
What's wrong with giving him a name?

633
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,960
Xiuxiu and Dajiao

634
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,800
cared for Meiwei

635
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,330
even more than for Jiaming.

636
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,670
Not to mention giving him a name,

637
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,030
if it weren't for the fact
they're of the same generation,

638
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,510
you could almost say
they're his adoptive parents.

639
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,070
Susu.

640
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,550
Now that his brother came back,

641
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,720
he can mention it.

642
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,960
If he didn't,

643
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,320
he'd think it's something you two
are just supposed to do.

644
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,620
Since Xiuxiu married my brother,

645
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,610
she's part of the Feng family.

646
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,550
Dajiao is my brother,

647
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,200
so he's Meiwei's brother.

648
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,160
A big brother taking care of

649
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,220
his younger brother is only natural.

650
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,660
But let's be honest,

651
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,920
whether it's really only natural

652
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,350
isn't something you, Ms. Ning,

653
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,720
should be commenting on here.

654
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,110
Feng Niwei, you're really ungrateful.

655
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,140
The only people who could put food
on your table

656
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,410
when you came back were Xiuxiu and Dajiao.

657
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,400
When your father led the bandits
to surround the village,

658
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,130
if it weren't for my brother,
my sister, and her husband,

659
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,160
everyone in this village would have grass

660
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,830
growing on their graves by now.

661
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,890
Alright, alright.

662
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,990
Susu,

663
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,200
it's been so many years.

664
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,790
Let's not bring it up anymore.

665
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,720
It's good that Niwei has returned.

666
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,490
I didn't want to bring it up.

667
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,680
I just couldn't stand him
being so ungrateful.

668
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,180
-Raising Meiwei alone is already exhausting.
-Susu.

669
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,120
Don't make his brother
rely on you as well.

670
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,790
Didn't you want to chat with me
in my room?

671
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,050
Come on, let's go talk.

672
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,970
Who said I'm going to rely on them?

673
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,590
Now that I'm back,

674
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,770
taking care of my younger brother
is my responsibility.

675
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,350
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

676
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,410
That would be best.

677
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,070
Meiwei, have you eaten enough?

678
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,720
If you're full,

679
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,310
take me to see our parents' graves.

680
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,440
We'll move tonight.

681
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,400
Dajiao,

682
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,390
I'm going to visit my parents.

683
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,830
You think you're so right?

684
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,590
Let's go!

685
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,200
Susu,

686
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,570
Niwei

687
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,080
has finally come back.

688
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,450
You shouldn't be like this.

689
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,920
It's not your fault.

690
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,110
Susu was right.

691
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
She said that

692
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,190
for the good of our family.

693
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,910
Her words might be blunt,
but they made sense.

694
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,700
Your sister and her husband

695
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,880
are such goody-two-shoes.

696
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,700
If you hadn't said it, who would have?

697
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Auntie Feng, you know what's right.

698
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,590
Susu,

699
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,860
you should know when to stop. Say no more.

700
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,930
Here, take it.

701
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,870
Everyone, take a break.

702
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,920
Have some water.

703
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,350
There's one more.

704
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,030
Take it.

705
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,080
We really thank you

706
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,510
for helping us brothers.

707
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,650
If we had to do all this ourselves,

708
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,160
we wouldn't be finished
even by the August Festival.

709
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,890
Dajiao, come, have some water.

710
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,400
I'll remember

711
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,700
this kindness in my heart.

712
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Here, Tietou.

713
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,310
Zhuzi, come have some water.

714
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,830
Okay.

715
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,240
In the future, I'll repay everyone

716
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,510
in our village.

717
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,040
I can't

718
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,470
work on the roof anymore.

719
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,680
My leg is injured and useless now.

720
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,920
This time I came back

721
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,240
just to take good care of my mother.

722
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,000
But my mother had little fortune in life

723
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,400
and has passed away.

724
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,910
So I think
I'll take good care of my brother.

725
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,770
The two of us will work hard

726
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
and get our family

727
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,250
back on its feet.

728
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,440
Niwei,

729
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,080
tell us about the time

730
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
you fought the Japanese.

731
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,880
Yes, tell us about it.

732
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,130
Yeah, tell us.

733
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,560
There's nothing much to tell.

734
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,960
To be honest,

735
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,870
I didn't really fight many Japanese—

736
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,600
they mostly beat me up instead.

737
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Come on, tell us. We all want to hear.

738
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,030
I just followed

739
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,760
the North China People's

740
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,280
Anti-Japanese Army

741
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,120
and fought alongside them.

742
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,340
On the battlefield,

743
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,790
a shell

744
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,449
exploded right under my feet

745
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,699
and threw me into the air.

746
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,510
At that moment, I thought

747
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,159
my life was over.

748
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
But somehow, I survived.

749
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,130
In the end, in our platoon,

750
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
I was the only one left alive.

751
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:05,760
Come on.

752
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,630
I basically

753
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,430
crawled out from among the dead.

754
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,210
Enough.

755
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,500
I won't talk about it anymore.

756
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,630
Those Japanese.

757
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,620
Once I recover,

758
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,690
I'll go back to fight them.

759
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,970
Yes. Fight them!

760
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,100
Go find your father.

761
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,110
Father,

762
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,670
Uncle Tietou, Uncle Niwei,

763
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,630
my mother brought you some food.

764
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,030
Thank you, Jiayin.

765
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,820
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

766
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,920
Mother,

767
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
did Uncle Niwei fight the Japanese?

768
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't know.

769
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,590
Here.

770
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,960
Let me see what food we have.

771
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,800
-Cornbread buns.
-Vegetable-stuffed cornbread buns.

772
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,400
Tietou, put that down first.

773
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,040
Wait a moment.

774
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,950
Wait a moment.

775
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,030
Hold on.

776
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,560
Why can't I eat?

777
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,710
Niwei.

778
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,580
See?

779
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,290
He's here.

780
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,010
What took you so long?

781
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,190
As soon as I got up this morning,

782
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,320
I sent him to the county

783
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
to get some good food for everyone to eat.

784
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,450
I can't let everyone work for nothing.

785
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,860
What are you waiting for?

786
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,260
Hurry,

787
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,750
share it with everyone.

788
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,360
Food's ready!

789
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Roast chicken?

790
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,600
Why bother with this? Come on.

791
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
It's been so long
since I had roast chicken.

792
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,050
I could smell it from afar.

793
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,650
Come on.

794
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,960
Xiuxiu,

795
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,220
Second Auntie.

796
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,540
Why are you back?

797
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,340
Is the house ready?

798
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,000
Almost.

799
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,700
I came to get my bedding and my brother's.

800
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
You're moving out today?

801
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,520
My brother said

802
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
we've troubled you all these years.

803
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,590
It's time to let you rest.

804
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,340
We're family. Don't say that.

805
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,910
I'll go get the beddings.

806
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Why is he being so polite?

807
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,430
He's found someone to rely on now.

808
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Meiwei.

809
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,190
Xiuxiu.

810
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,100
Let me tell you something.

811
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,040
Our family has enough food for you.

812
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,280
If you don't get used to living there,

813
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,740
you can come back anytime.

814
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,880
Xiuxiu,

815
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,530
Second Auntie.

816
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,180
Thank you for raising me all these years.

817
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,080
I, Feng Meiwei, am bowing to you.

818
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,140
I'll come back to visit you often.

819
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,810
I'm leaving now.

820
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,360
Don't be sad.

821
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,600
A child that isn't your own

822
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,890
can't be kept forever.

823
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,840
Look at Niwei.

824
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,640
I didn't want to keep him.

825
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,920
Mother,

826
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,180
you also think something's off with Niwei?

827
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,190
You can tell what a man will be like
from his childhood.

828
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,920
Look at Niwei's eyes.

829
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,630
They're just like your Uncle Si's,

830
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,190
darting around.

831
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,510
He can't be tamed.

832
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,650
It's hopeless.

833
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,280
Dajiao.

834
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,470
Don't you think Niwei
seems a bit strange today?

835
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,590
How so?

836
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,240
When he was talking about
fighting the Japanese,

837
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,510
he was quite enthusiastic,

838
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,320
but when it came to the crucial part,
he stopped talking.

839
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,670
And he doesn't let anyone ask

840
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,800
how he escaped back.

841
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,230
Didn't he say?

842
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,280
He got injured fighting the Japanese

843
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,710
and came back because he was homesick.

844
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,840
Where is he wounded?

845
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,170
Have you seen the wound?

846
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,590
Besides,

847
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,760
the army has discipline.

848
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,670
They wouldn't just let you leave
because you're wounded.

849
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,070
Unless he was a deserter.

850
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,770
He's not a bandit, is he?

851
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,160
Don't talk nonsense.

852
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,790
After the Japanese came,
there were no bandits left.

853
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,110
They either joined the Eighth Route Army
to fight the Japanese

854
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,550
or became traitors.

855
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,840
If he had really become a traitor,

856
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,370
he wouldn't have come back.

857
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,690
Didn't he say?

858
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,000
The place he fought the Japanese
is far away,

859
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,880
in Hebei.

860
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,550
Xiu,

861
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,640
I'm telling you.

862
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,360
Niwei has finally come back.

863
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,590
We're their family.

864
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,630
We must help him.

865
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,550
Anyway,

866
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
I think he's acting pretty strange.

867
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,290
I'm going to fetch some water.

868
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,750
Xiu.

869
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,800
Who is it?

870
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,230
Dajiao!

871
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
I'm back.

872
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,000
Kejin!

873
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,280
You must have suffered a lot.

874
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,880
I thought I'd never see you again.

875
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,360
Come.

876
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,590
This is your uncle.

877
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,070
Say hello to him.

878
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:52,970
Quickly.

879
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,250
Say it.

880
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,010
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello, Uncle.

881
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Good kids.

882
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,150
This is Jiaying.

883
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,880
Jiaying.

884
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,210
This is Jiaming.

885
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,960
Jiaming.

886
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,960
Auntie.

887
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,150
How's my father?

888
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,210
I want to see him.

889
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,800
Dajiao.

890
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
What makes a home?

891
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,060
A home needs people.

892
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,180
Now that your brother is back,
you finally have a home.

893
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,710
You won't have to crawl around
in someone else's house anymore.

894
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Are you happy

895
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,070
now?

896
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,760
I'm talking to you.

897
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,670
Are you deaf?

898
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,710
Niwei,

899
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,030
I've been at Dajiao's for so many years,

900
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,230
and I never felt like
I was crawling or humbling myself.

901
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,290
That's my home too.

902
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,370
As Xiuxiu said,

903
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,370
I can go back

904
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
whenever I want.

905
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,400
Go back right now then.

906
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,280
Get out.

907
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,590
I don't need your company.

908
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,760
If you want to be a spineless weakling,

909
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,730
I won't stop you.

910
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,200
Niwei,

911
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,070
whether it's Dajiao,

912
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,000
Xiuxiu,

913
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,800
Tietou, Zhuzi,

914
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,880
or other neighbors,
they've all treated me well.

915
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Nonsense!

916
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,160
Back at the gate,

917
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,130
I shouted at the top of my lungs,

918
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,510
"Let my father go! Let my father go!"

919
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,880
Did he let our father go then?

920
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,190
Have you forgotten all this?

921
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,570
Time to sleep.

922
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,260
Father's here.

923
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,880
Jiaming,

924
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,960
come.

925
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,230
Father!

926
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm back!

927
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,360
Ning Kejin,

928
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,110
I thought I would never see you again.

929
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,670
Father!

930
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:35,880
Father.

931
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,800
Your hair has turned all white.

932
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,010
What...

933
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,590
happened to you?

934
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,310
Nothing.

935
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,670
It's just a small injury.

936
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,070
Where have you been?

937
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,280
Kejin,

938
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,710
I missed you so much.

939
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,800
Susu.

940
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,030
Kejin,

941
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,200
have you been fighting the Japanese
all this time?

942
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,550
Who's this?

943
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,990
This is your younger brother,

944
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,670
Keyu.
