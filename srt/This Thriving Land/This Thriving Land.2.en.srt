00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,930
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,580
Let me iron
the groom's outfit for you again.

4
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,100
Sister-in-law.

5
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,789
Does our Fei family's ancestral rule

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,430
say that no guests are allowed in

7
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,890
before the bride arrives?

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,290
There's no such rule.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Then why hasn't a single person
shown up yet?

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,260
The auspicious time for the wedding
was determined at the Goddess Temple.

11
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,520
It's still early.

12
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,320
The tradition of waiting for the bride

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,870
means just staying put at home

14
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,660
and waiting for her to arrive.

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,660
No need to rush.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,400
Let's go.

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,840
Madam.

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,890
Go burn the incense first.

19
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,840
Any news from the Ning Residence?

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,870
I heard from the villagers that

21
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,329
Master Ning scolded
that Mole Cricket away.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,910
In a bit, go over to the Ning Residence

23
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,910
and deliver the betrothal gift list
we prepared

24
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,000
three years ago to him.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Tell him

26
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,590
I want a definite answer.

27
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,670
No more questions.

28
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,210
Go.

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,710
Father. Mother.

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,860
Dear ancestors.

31
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,110
The fact that I, Wendian, was able to
grow up and get educated,

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,110
and that the Fei family
is what it is today,

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,310
is all thanks to my sister-in-law's
care and management.

34
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,560
I'm about to get married
and establish a new family.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Please, ancestors, bless my sister-in-law

36
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,020
and our whole family with a good life.

37
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll definitely honor my sister-in-law

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,720
and treat her like my own mother.

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,500
[Memorial Tablets of the Ancestors
of the Fei Family]

40
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,240
Master.

41
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,120
Steward Liu of the Fei family
wants to see you.

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,430
Master Ning.

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
Our Madam

44
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,279
asked me to give this to you.

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,260
What did Mrs. Fei say?

46
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,510
She said

47
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,200
she wants a definite answer from you
as soon as possible.

48
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,159
What's her intention in giving me
the betrothal gift list

49
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,220
at a time like this?

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,960
Does she want the betrothal gifts back?

51
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,310
Go back and tell Mrs. Fei

52
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,230
that I promise

53
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,270
to send

54
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:51,320
my pure and spotless daughter
to the Fei family before midnight.

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,290
He really said that?

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
Yes.

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
All right. You may leave now.

58
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,200
You and Qing must keep a close eye
on Young Master.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,930
Don't let him go out, okay?

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,630
Yes.

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,310
Before midnight,

62
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
send his pure and spotless daughter

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,400
to the Fei family.

64
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,070
Before midnight,

65
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,620
send his pure and spotless...

66
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,200
Father, it's getting dark.

67
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,240
Why haven't you picked out
the land deed yet?

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,870
Mrs. Fei, you are so cruel,

69
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,720
trying to pull the rug out from us

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
at this critical moment.

71
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,120
Honey, what are you talking about?

72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,380
Why haven't you gone to sell the land yet?

73
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,710
Stop making a fuss!

74
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm trying to figure out a way, aren't I?

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,560
Get out. Get out.

76
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,430
-Father!
-Get out, you all!

77
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,560
-What are you doing, Father?
-Get out!

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,660
Widow Fei, you are so cruel.

79
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,040
The 50 mu of land in the betrothal gifts

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,900
is the best in the entire village.

81
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,160
It connects my family's
eastern and western plots,

82
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,190
like the lifeline of our land.

83
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,700
I've been growing it for three years,

84
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,440
pouring my heart and soul into every inch.

85
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,240
And now you say you want to take it back?

86
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,310
Mrs. Fei,

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,900
you're trying to rip my heart out.

88
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,159
Mrs. Fei,

89
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,840
you're trying to rip my heart out!

90
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,120
Rip my heart out...

91
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,920
Is anyone there?

92
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,310
Is anyone there?

93
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,560
Is anyone...

94
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,780
Why are you yelling?

95
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,590
I'm thirsty. I want some water.

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,290
Thirst won't kill you.

97
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,050
Wait!

98
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,159
Get me a bowl of water,

99
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,760
and you can have the hairpin I'm wearing.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,640
Even if I don't get you water,

101
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,550
I can still have your hairpin.

102
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,120
Aren't you worried

103
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,120
I'll tell your boss?

104
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,330
Wait here.

105
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,730
Qing, Steward Liu!

106
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,310
Young Master.

107
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,550
Young Master.

108
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,690
It's so late.

109
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,510
Why hasn't a single guest shown up?

110
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,240
And the wedding procession.

111
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,160
Still no news?

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,920
The wedding procession...

113
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,130
Did something happen over there?

114
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,720
Is it related to Xiuxiu?

115
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,160
Well...

116
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,309
I'll go see Xiuxiu.

117
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,030
Young Master! Young Master!

118
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
You can't go out, Young Master!

119
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,440
What do you want!

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,789
Listen to me, Young Master!

121
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,929
Please, rest assured.

122
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,140
The Ning family said

123
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,750
they'd definitely send the bride back
before midnight.

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,750
Before midnight?

125
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,910
Why before midnight?

126
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,150
Tell me.

127
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,600
Tell me! Why is it before midnight?

128
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,290
I could tell something was off

129
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,670
with you two and my sister-in-law
the moment I came back.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,120
Looks like something bad really happened.

131
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,910
I need to go see Xiuxiu.

132
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,750
Young Master, you can't go!

133
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,870
Let me go to the Ning Residence!
I need to see Xiuxiu!

134
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,870
Young Master, it's dark and
the road is slippery. You can't go!

135
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,510
Wendian!

136
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,270
Sister-in-law,

137
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
are you hiding something from me?

138
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,480
Sister-in-law!

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Yes.

140
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,630
Xiuxiu

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,550
was kidnapped.

142
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,340
Kidnapped?

143
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,630
Who did it?

144
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,410
Big Nose Du from Chicken Ridge.

145
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,670
Young Master, Young Master!
Don't do that!

146
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,510
Don't stop me!

147
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,990
This knife of mine doesn't play around.

148
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,000
Step aside!

149
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,320
Madam, Young Master is...

150
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Wendian!

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,170
Sister-in-law!

152
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,990
You really shouldn't have hid this
from me!

153
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,790
Young... Young Master!

154
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,550
Madam.

155
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,950
Still no news from down the mountain.

156
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,820
San.

157
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,440
I think this deal's going to be a loss.

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,670
Brother.

159
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,860
I don't think so. She's a bride after all.

160
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,980
They'll need to

161
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,840
have her back eventually, right?

162
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,270
If that's the case,

163
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,980
I'll give the Ning family a gift

164
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,390
and warn that Miser Ning.

165
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,270
Put your matters aside for a bit.

166
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,400
Tonight,

167
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm receiving an important guest.

168
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
Don't embarrass me.

169
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,360
Brother, I won't.

170
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,260
Boss.

171
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,050
Second Boss.

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,730
Someone's coming up the mountain
with a weapon!

173
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,420
With a weapon?

174
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,260
I'd like to see

175
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,530
who has the nerve to do that.

176
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,370
Let's go!

177
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,080
San.

178
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,100
Leave yourself a way out.

179
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,280
You may meet again in the future.

180
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,570
Don't make it fatal.

181
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,390
Brother.

182
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,180
I'll listen to you.

183
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,830
My men!

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,430
Bring all the horses out!

185
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,170
Hurry up!

186
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,930
Yes!

187
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,270
Since someone has come up our mountain

188
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,320
uninvited,

189
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,410
let's grab our weapons

190
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,830
and make sure they don't leave here alive!

191
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,720
Hurry up!

192
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
Kill them all!

193
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,730
Hurry up!

194
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,290
Let's go!

195
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,890
Let's go!

196
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,850
Hurry up!

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,790
Come on!

198
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,620
Guo?

199
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,850
Meat?

200
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,510
Try some.

201
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,690
It's so good.

202
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,110
How thoughtful of you!

203
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,870
Come on, sit.

204
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,550
I'll pour you a bowl of wine.

205
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll pass.

206
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,620
I heard that Second Boss
kidnapped someone for quick money.

207
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,980
Quick money? More like slow money.

208
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,370
Where did Second Boss abduct her from?

209
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,980
She's the eldest daughter of Ning Xuexiang
from the Ox Temple Village.

210
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll go take a look.

211
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,280
Don't look. Your soul will be drawn away.

212
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,630
All the more reason for me to go see!

213
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
So pleasing.

214
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,720
Boss, your guests are here.

215
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,620
Alright.

216
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,560
Let's go out to welcome them.

217
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,200
Alright.

218
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,870
How many of them?

219
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,600
Four.

220
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,580
When Hu San comes back,

221
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,970
tell him to come over to meet the guests.

222
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,700
Got it, Boss.

223
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,060
Wendian.

224
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,870
Why are you here?

225
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,210
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,360
I know you feel anxious.

227
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
I'm worried too,

228
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
but...

229
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,960
But you are a scholar.

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
You haven't even been in a fight
since you were a kid.

231
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
So what?

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
I need to save Xiuxiu.

233
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,070
Those bandits use real weapons.

234
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,550
Xiuxiu's second uncle went to save her

235
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,750
but was driven back by a hail of bullets.

236
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,600
And those bandits have made it clear

237
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,840
that they only want ransom, not her.

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,480
As long as the ransom is delivered,

239
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,960
they'll send her back.

240
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,670
They won't kill her.

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,510
How about this, Sister-in-law?

242
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,750
Since Xiuxiu is alone
in the bandits' lair now,

243
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,000
she must be scared.

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Take me there,

245
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,030
and I'll keep her company.

246
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,550
I don't know where the bandits' lair is.

247
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,600
Do you know?

248
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,960
Xiuxiu's great-uncle, second uncle,

249
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,630
and a host of other elders are all there,

250
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,430
trying to figure something out.

251
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,900
Beard Liu also brought news back,

252
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,790
saying your father-in-law said it himself

253
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,440
that he'd send the bride to our house

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,960
before midnight, right?

255
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,030
Yes, Young Master.

256
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,120
Master Ning said that himself.

257
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,390
Don't lie to me.

258
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,670
Why would I lie to you, Young Master?

259
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,040
Let's go home.

260
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,460
Listen to me.

261
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
I won't harm you.

262
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm so useless.

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,630
Let's go back.

264
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,480
Let's go.

265
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,650
That deadbeat father of yours!

266
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,370
I think he won't cry
until he sees the coffin.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Alright then.

268
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,350
I'll cut off one of your ears
and send it to him,

269
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,410
to celebrate his daughter's wedding.

270
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,670
What are you doing?
If you dare to hurt me,

271
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,530
I...

272
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,080
I'll bash my head here and die!

273
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
If I die,

274
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,400
you won't have a good explanation either.

275
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
What,

276
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,650
are you trying to play tough with me?

277
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,110
Come on. Go kill yourself.

278
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Come on.

279
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,260
My brother, Ning Kejin,
is the head of the Qingqi Society.

280
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,880
He'll definitely come to save me.

281
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,740
My father will, too!

282
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,660
Enough!

283
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,670
Still talking about
that worthless brother of yours?

284
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,920
Let me tell you.

285
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,770
I've beaten him down the mountain.

286
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,480
What a pity.

287
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,770
This pretty little face...

288
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,670
Don't! Let go!

289
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,250
My father will definitely come to save me!

290
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,710
Second Boss! Second Boss!

291
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,680
What?

292
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,120
Boss wants you to go meet the guests now.

293
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,920
Just a moment!

294
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,390
Second Master! Second Master!

295
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,270
What are you doing!

296
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,370
Second Boss, we can't break the rules
of the underworld.

297
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,230
Otherwise, it'll be hard to explain things
to Boss.

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,820
Keep a close eye on her.

299
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,080
You're quite something, you damn woman.

300
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,340
Trying to smash the bowl and cut the rope?

301
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,350
Let's see if you can cut it now.

302
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Behave yourself!

303
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,880
My brother is back!

304
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Do you want to die?

305
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,349
I was driven back by gunfire

306
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,160
before I even got to see Xiuxiu!

307
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,970
Father, why are you holding the land deed?

308
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,359
You want to use the land deed
to ransom my sister, right?

309
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,430
Mother, Father finally came to his senses!

310
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,800
There's no time to exchange it for money.

311
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,270
Kejin...

312
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,400
Father... Father's going to use
the land deed

313
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,530
to ransom my sister.

314
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,150
Father, how about this?

315
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,610
Father and son should fight together.

316
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,680
I'll go with you.

317
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,880
You'll take all the land deeds we have

318
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,310
and ransom my sister from Big Nose Du.

319
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,040
And when he opens the door
to greet you, I'll...

320
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,640
Why did you hit him?

321
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,380
Kejin.

322
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,080
Son.

323
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,730
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,270
Trying to lay a hand on the land deeds?

325
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm not dead yet.

326
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,710
What's this all about?

327
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,930
I've told you long ago

328
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,240
since you were kids

329
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,830
that no one is allowed to touch
the land deeds. No one!

330
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,230
If you won't save Xiuxiu,

331
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,530
Son, let's go save her.

332
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,240
Let's go.

333
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,720
What are you doing?

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,110
Give it to me!

335
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,720
What are you doing?

336
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,350
Mother!

337
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,600
Mother!

338
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,680
Mother!

339
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
W-What are you doing?

340
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,980
Why did you push my mother?

341
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,550
What are you getting all worked up for?

342
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,550
Instead of helping me settle things,

343
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,740
you just keep causing trouble!

344
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,350
Get lost!

345
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,700
Mother hit her head!

346
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,830
She's bleeding!

347
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,090
You're pressuring me, and so is Mrs. Fei.

348
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,110
Are you all trying to suck the marrow
from my bones and drain my blood?

349
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,160
Darling.

350
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,010
Here.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,270
I was impulsive just now.

352
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,830
Mother.

353
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,540
I know you want to save Xiuxiu.

354
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,750
Of course we need to save her,

355
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,550
but we can't tear the Ning family apart

356
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,510
just to save Xiuxiu.

357
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,930
Kejin, what are you waiting for?

358
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,930
Go find a doctor for your mother.

359
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,290
Mother. Mother.

360
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,030
Father.

361
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,730
I'm begging you.

362
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,550
Please save Xiuxiu.

363
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,830
I don't want the family business
you left for me.

364
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,090
I just want you
to save my sister, Xiuxiu.

365
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,070
Nonsense.

366
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,270
Our ancestors passed it down
generation after generation,

367
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,000
and I've worked so hard
to build our family fortune.

368
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,260
Do you think it's something
you can discard just like that?

369
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Let me ask you.

370
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,120
Can you come up with any good idea
without tearing the family apart?

371
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,510
I can't think of it now.

372
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,450
But Father, I know

373
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,760
I don't want any family business.

374
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,560
I just want you to save my sister!

375
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,880
Let me ask you.

376
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
Why did you take people up the mountain
without consulting me?

377
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,600
You even got in a fight with the bandits,

378
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,200
risking your life.

379
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,720
Do you think it'll still work

380
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
if we take the land deeds
to the bandits now?

381
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Do you think those bandits will trust us?

382
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,030
Your sister would only suffer more
after you did that.

383
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
You mean

384
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,950
I made things even harder for my sister?

385
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,450
What use do you think those bandits have
for land deeds?

386
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,910
Do you think
they'd dare openly sell the land

387
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,720
or send people to farm it?

388
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,880
They dare not.

389
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,240
You are the eldest son of the Ning family.

390
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,100
Don't just come up with bad ideas
which will cost our family

391
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,420
like your mother and Susu.

392
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,060
Just get through tonight,
and it'll be alright.

393
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,400
Beauty.

394
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,030
I asked you if you wanted water just now,
but you declined.

395
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,860
Was it because
you want to have some wine with me?

396
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,720
What do you want?

397
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,350
I'll feed you with my lips.

398
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,200
What are you doing? Go away!

399
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,870
Who are you?

400
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,460
I'm your boss's guest.

401
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,760
Guest?

402
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,370
Guests should stay in the lobby.

403
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,830
What are you doing out here?

404
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,350
I'm looking for the toilet.

405
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,510
There are toilets everywhere,
aren't there?

406
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,240
Wait...

407
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,650
Keep quiet!

408
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,570
I'll kill you if you make any noise.

409
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,480
Where is the girl you kidnapped?

410
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,770
In... In the woodshed.

411
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,880
Keep quiet.

412
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,890
Go away!

413
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Someone!

414
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,620
Let go of me! Someone!

415
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,090
It's me.

416
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,480
When we were kids, my mother worked
as a cook for your family.

417
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,890
They were like sisters,

418
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,570
and I was like a brother to you.

419
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,940
Do you remember me now?

420
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,960
Second Brother Guo?

421
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,340
It's really you!

422
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,520
Yeah, it's me. Why did they kidnap you?

423
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,400
If you don't save me,

424
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,800
I'll die here.

425
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,640
Alright, listen to me.

426
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,420
There're guests here tonight.

427
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,270
Maybe you can take the chance
to escape.

428
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,200
But this red outfit of yours is
too conspicuous.

429
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
Put on Jiu's clothes.

430
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,300
After you go out,
the stable will be on your right.

431
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,510
There are fewer people there.

432
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,240
Also,

433
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,590
Sis,

434
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,940
for the sake of
my mother's and my own life,

435
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
make sure you don't tell anyone

436
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,650
that I released you.

437
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,080
You must keep it a secret.

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Come on, let's take off his clothes.

439
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,110
Here.

440
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
Here. Have some tea.

441
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,110
We're relatives by blood.

442
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,300
There's no need for such formalities.

443
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,940
The fact that
you let me visit your stronghold

444
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,770
shows you haven't forgotten me.

445
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,800
Of course.

446
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,880
When we were kids,
we practiced martial arts together,

447
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
and I often took
the master's stick for you.

448
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,880
Here, have some tea.

449
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,940
Try this wild tea from Chicken Ridge.

450
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,830
Hurry up and go.

451
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,070
Don't hurt him!

452
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,930
Don't hurt him.

453
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,130
-Dajiao! Dajiao.
-Xiu.

454
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,010
Why are you here?

455
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,660
Xiuxiu, I'll take you home.

456
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,310
We just held

457
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,680
a farmers' representative meeting
in Changqing.

458
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,160
Our Party specially sent me

459
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,420
to various places in Shandong

460
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,640
to organize and establish

461
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,680
farmers' associations
and farmers' self-defense armies.

462
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,740
When I received the mission,
you were the first person I thought of.

463
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,390
Du.

464
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,940
I want you to lead your team
out of the mountain

465
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,070
to form a farmers' self-defense army.

466
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,720
As for what happened in the past,

467
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,580
we'll let bygones be bygones.

468
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Du.

469
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,750
I think I've heard the line
"let bygones be bygones"

470
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
that your man here said
in operas before.

471
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,440
Well, of course,

472
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,700
things like this still happen nowadays.

473
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,880
But things like

474
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,940
turned foes and burned bridges

475
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,680
can also be seen in operas.

476
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,030
Brother, why don't I understand

477
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,560
what this mister just said?

478
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,500
Is that some kind of bird talk?

479
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,310
What's this ridiculous association

480
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,570
or self-defense army?

481
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
Watch your mouth!

482
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,440
What's wrong?

483
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,830
I always talk like this.

484
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,340
Ridiculous association.

485
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,480
What, are you going to slash me
with a knife?

486
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,140
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

487
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,270
Young man.

488
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,160
You're here to ask our boss for a favor.

489
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
If you want to invite Boss out
to handle matters,

490
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
you must kowtow three times.

491
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,400
Come on.

492
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,530
Kneel before me first.

493
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,240
Let me see your true intentions.

494
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,390
That's going too far!

495
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,740
Put it down! Put it down!

496
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,460
Ge, put the gun down!

497
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,590
Put the gun down!

498
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,200
Ge.

499
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,540
That's not how you're supposed to talk.

500
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,910
Du.

501
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,900
We're just here to tell you about this.

502
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,650
As for whether you want to
proceed with it,

503
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,200
we can discuss it later.

504
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm hungry.

505
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,560
I've been waiting for you guys
for a long time.

506
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,540
Let's go

507
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,290
have a drink.

508
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,750
We'll have to pass.

509
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,690
We still have to go to the next town.

510
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Let me carry you on my back.

511
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,590
I'm okay.

512
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,920
-I'm okay.
-Come up.

513
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,320
Hurry.

514
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,750
Dajiao.

515
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,850
Take a rest.

516
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,490
It's okay. I can take it.

517
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,550
Take a rest.

518
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,960
Take a break.

519
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,750
Okay.

520
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,680
Dajiao.

521
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,180
You saved my life.

522
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't want to be some lifesaver.

523
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,180
Let's just hurry back.

524
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,930
Are you really the only one...

525
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,440
Are you the only one who came to save me?

526
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,100
So my father really wouldn't sell the land
to ransom me?

527
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,140
I just came as soon as possible

528
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,760
after I heard you were kidnapped.

529
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't know
whether your father sold the land or not.

530
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,750
Don't think too much.

531
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,500
You'll know everything when we get back.

532
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,510
Let's go.

533
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,120
Or they'll catch up soon.

534
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,450
Does Du have something to say to me?

535
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,120
Dismount.

536
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,150
Mr. Du, Boss wants you back.

537
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,410
Attack!

538
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,620
There's a cliff down there.

539
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,280
They'll fall to their deaths.

540
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,160
Brother!

541
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,550
Check it out.

542
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,070
These three iron beasts

543
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,830
are real treasures.

544
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,550
Their firepower is fierce.

545
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,910
No matter the distance,

546
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,040
every shot is a kill!

547
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,560
Brother.

548
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,510
This is what really touches a man's heart!

549
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,310
San.

550
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,650
When will you learn

551
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,270
to consult with me

552
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,240
before you do anything!

553
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Are you darn crazy?

554
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,550
Du Chunlin is the youngest son
of the Du family.

555
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,680
He has two older brothers,

556
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,280
both government officials!

557
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,290
He's the treasure of Master's family,

558
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,150
and you killed him just like that?

559
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,640
Brother...

560
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,160
He's the brother I grew up with,

561
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,810
barefoot and sharing the same bed
since childhood!

562
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,480
Brother...

563
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,190
You...

564
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,830
Today, I have to...

565
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,680
Brother!

566
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,720
Brother, please don't! Brother!

567
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,310
Brother! Brother!

568
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,750
Brother!

569
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,500
I was wrong, Brother.

570
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,750
Please don't, Brother!

571
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,280
It was because I was worried

572
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,480
you'd risk the lives of our men.

573
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,900
I was worried they'd betray us.

574
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,650
T-That's why I did it, Brother!

575
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,000
I was wrong!

576
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,120
No going down the mountain
for a whole month!

577
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,500
Brother, don't worry.

578
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,690
At that time...

579
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Get lost!

580
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,480
I shot covertly.

581
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,750
No one would know!

582
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,410
Sister-in-law.

583
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,380
Any news, Sister-in-law?

584
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,960
Sister-in-law.

585
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,720
I brought you some food.

586
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,240
You need to eat well to have energy.

587
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,110
Getting married is pretty exhausting.

588
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,040
Sister-in-law.

589
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,680
My mind's in turmoil.
I can't eat right now.

590
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,990
I want to go to the Ning Residence.

591
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,030
Once Xiuxiu comes back,

592
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,890
I'll bring her home immediately.

593
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,440
Sister-in-law.

594
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,640
I beg...

595
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,920
I'll go with you

596
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,550
and ask them for an explanation.

597
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,400
Get me a horse!

598
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
Hurry up and gather our men!

599
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,440
Second Boss.

600
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,920
Go!

601
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,830
Second Boss!

602
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,790
Listen to me.

603
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,190
Your quick-money kidnap won't work.

604
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,150
I guess she's already home by now.

605
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,160
You keep standing in my way,

606
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,290
and now she's run away!

607
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,590
Tell me what I should do!

608
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,350
Second Boss.

609
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,970
Boss also said you were not allowed

610
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,230
to leave the mountain for a month, right?

611
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,590
But she ran away—

612
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,350
that's 5,000 silver dollars lost!

613
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,790
Madam.

614
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,940
We're here.

615
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,260
Sister-in-law.

616
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
Is Xiuxiu back?

617
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,480
Xiuxiu!

618
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,280
Young Master.

619
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,240
Wendian.

620
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,710
It's inauspicious to see the bride
before the wedding.

621
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,510
Besides,

622
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,970
these are all relatives here.

623
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,110
Don't make a fool of yourself.

624
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,290
We have to follow the rules.

625
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,530
I understand your concerns. Listen to me.

626
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,030
I'll go and check on her for you.

627
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,590
Qing.

628
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,970
Take care of Young Master.

629
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,450
Okay.

630
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,590
Mrs. Fei.

631
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,590
It's not midnight yet.

632
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,850
Why are you here again?

633
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,050
You're truly impatient.

634
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,340
Wendian couldn't rest easy.

635
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,270
Today is his wedding day.

636
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,640
I can't let him suffer.

637
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,110
I promised you

638
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,510
I'd send my pure and spotless daughter

639
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,470
to the Fei Residence before midnight.

640
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,950
Xiuxiu is really back.

641
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,310
Xiuxiu...

642
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,180
Young Master.

643
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,500
Young Master. Just wait for a bit.

644
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,270
Mrs. Fei, think it carefully

645
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,910
whether you want the bride or not

646
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,670
before you lift the curtain.

647
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,010
As long as she's pure and spotless,

648
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
she can be Wendian's wife.

649
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

650
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,440
Wendian.

651
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,480
Sister-in-law.

652
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,030
Hurry up.

653
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,080
Let's go back

654
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,590
and prepare for the wedding procession.

655
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,230
Sister-in-law, is Xiuxiu back?

656
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,960
Didn't you hear it just now?

657
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,790
Qing.

658
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,200
After you bring us home later,

659
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,160
take a shortcut

660
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,060
to go invite the master of ceremonies,
Ning Xueshi.

661
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,450
Invite all the relatives and neighbors

662
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,240
along the way

663
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,060
and tell them

664
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,610
the bride has been delivered to our house
before midnight.

665
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,050
Got it.

666
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,480
Great, Xiuxiu is really back.

667
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,940
Wendian, let's go home.

668
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,250
Wash your face

669
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,310
and get changed into the groom's outfit.

670
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,480
Let's get ready for the wedding

671
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,940
and receiving the guests.

672
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,930
Sister-in-law, Xiuxiu is really back.

673
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,910
You have to listen to me now.

674
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,620
I promise

675
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,030
you'll have

676
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,760
a grand and honorable wedding,

677
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,000
proudly bringing

678
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
the Fei family's new bride home.

679
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,000
Sister-in-law.

680
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,510
I'll do as you say.

681
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,270
Let's go.

682
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,590
Let's go, Young Master.

683
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,590
Xiuxiu is back.

684
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,010
Be careful.

685
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,670
Beard Liu! Beard Liu!

686
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,550
Coming, Madam.

687
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,200
Quickly send someone to guard the door

688
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,070
and get ready to welcome the bride
and carry in the dowry.

689
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,960
No problem.

690
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,000
Sister-in-law.

691
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,830
What can I do?

692
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,510
Hurry up and get changed,
and tie the bridal bouquet.

693
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:55,750
Let's go.

694
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,350
Okay.

695
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,510
Congratulations.

696
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,550
Thanks. Thanks.

697
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,240
The bride is so beautiful.

698
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,920
Good luck.

699
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,160
Thanks. Thanks.

700
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
Come on in. Come on in.

701
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,670
Third Uncle.

702
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,800
Third Uncle.

703
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,770
What took you so long?

704
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,710
Thanks. Thanks.

705
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,190
You're welcome.

706
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,790
Come on in.

707
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,330
How do I look?

708
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,949
Let's go.

709
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,840
Your clothes are still wrinkled.

710
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,100
Better now?

711
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,440
Wendian.

712
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,920
This wedding hasn't come easy.

713
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,550
Soon you'll have to
perform the wedding ceremony,

714
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,530
the bride must enter the bridal chamber
to receive blessings,

715
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,190
and you'll have to entertain the guests.

716
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,870
None of these can be skipped.

717
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,800
I understand, Sister-in-law.

718
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,070
I'm not finished yet.

719
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,440
I just want you to know

720
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,110
that whatever I arrange

721
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,440
is for your own good.

722
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,710
You have to complete this wedding

723
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,630
with me.

724
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,590
So,

725
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,880
just do as I say, okay?

726
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,840
Sister-in-law,

727
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,320
why do you keep repeating these words?

728
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,010
I understand. Xiuxiu is back,

729
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
and this is our survival
after the calamity.

730
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,070
I will make sure the wedding

731
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,930
is decent, grand, and honorable.

732
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
Do as I say.

733
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,950
Do I look good?

734
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,340
Very handsome.

735
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,330
Young Mistress has arrived!

736
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,350
Sister-in-law, you're here.

737
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,090
It's late at night,
so let's skip the instruments.

738
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,530
Mrs. Fei.

739
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,290
Our Ning family has delivered
the bride here

740
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,930
before midnight.

741
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,320
Thank you for your hard work,
Young Master Kebi.

742
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,480
Please go in for a drink.

743
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,640
I won't attend the banquet.

744
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,440
Uncle is still waiting for me
to go back and report.

745
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
Sorry for the trouble.

746
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,740
Thank you, Madam!

747
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,450
Congratulations!

748
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Thanks.

749
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,670
Hurry up.

750
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,280
Here comes the bride!

751
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,470
Here comes the bride!

752
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,870
Here comes the bride!

753
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Bride.

754
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,170
Please get off.

755
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,800
Bride.

756
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
We're home.

757
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,570
Please get off.

758
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,550
Come on.

759
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,780
Cross the threshold.

760
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
Step over the fire basin,

761
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,500
ward off evil and dispel demons.

762
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,440
Scatter the bran.

763
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,430
Bran scattered means

764
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,590
abundant descendants.

765
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,960
Scatter the bran this year,

766
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,280
and you'll have a son next year.

767
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,040
Now, step over the doorstep.

768
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,880
The auspicious time has come!

769
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,800
Hold the wedding ribbon tight!

770
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,840
Congratulations!

771
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,870
Groom and bride,
take your places for the wedding ceremony.

772
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,040
Hooray!

773
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,760
First, kowtow to Heaven and Earth,

774
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,900
and to all the gods and spirits.

775
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,450
First kowtow.

776
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,090
Second kowtow.

777
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,820
Third kowtow.

778
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Rise.

779
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,600
Second, kowtow to the broom's parents

780
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,840
in thanks for their nurturing.

781
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,380
Since the parents are absent,

782
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,320
kowtow to your sister-in-law!

783
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,070
Alright!

784
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,710
No, no.

785
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,030
This won't do, Uncle Xueshi.

786
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,510
No, no, no.

787
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,310
You've maintained your purity
and upheld the proper way,

788
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,770
caring for your own integrity—

789
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,500
truly a person of great virtue.

790
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,260
You arranged the marriage
on behalf of your late ancestors,

791
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,130
ensuring the Fei family's lineage
continues.

792
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,030
You're truly a meritorious figure
of the Fei family.

793
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,070
You should be honored with this rite
to commend your virtue.

794
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,920
You deserve their respectful bow.

795
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,070
Please sit.

796
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,030
Mrs. Fei, you deserve this.

797
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,110
Please sit.

798
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,030
Kneel!

799
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,190
Xiuxiu. Xiuxiu.

800
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,570
First Kowtow.

801
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,750
Second Kowtow.

802
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,840
Third Kowtow.

803
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,000
Serve tea!

804
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,940
Take it. It's my gift for you.

805
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,750
Rise.

806
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,560
Bride and groom, bow to each other.

807
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,400
First bow.

808
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,590
Second bow.

809
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Third bow.

810
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,530
The ceremony is completed!

811
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,390
Great!

812
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,760
May the newlyweds be blessed with
endless happiness.

813
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,890
May you soon have children
and enjoy health and harmony.

814
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,640
Now, enter the bridal chamber!

815
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,960
Great!

816
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,170
Enter the bridal chamber.

817
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,980
Great!

818
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,590
This way, please.

819
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,190
Be careful. Careful.

820
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,170
Don't push.

821
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,910
Wendian.

822
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,390
With so many people watching,

823
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,110
the bride must be shy.

824
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,070
Look at the bride yourself later.

825
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,330
You all must have waited long.

826
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,790
Let's start the banquet.

827
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,840
Steward Liu, go get the banquet started.

828
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,550
Great!

829
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,840
Time for the banquet!

830
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,510
Time for the wedding wine!

831
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,150
Wendian.

832
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,070
Those who've come to congratulate you
so late at night

833
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,080
are all our benefactors.

834
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,440
You must entertain them well.

835
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,030
Yes.

836
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,230
Qing.

837
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,700
Take Young Master to greet the guests.

838
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,440
Got it. Young Master.

839
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,170
Sister-in-law, wait a moment.

840
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,320
Xiuxiu.

841
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,090
You must be tired.

842
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,400
Have a good rest.

843
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,030
I'll come back to you later.

844
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,510
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

845
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,920
I will make sure everyone's entertained.

846
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,670
Okay.

847
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,320
Qing, let's go.

848
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,630
Young Master.

849
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,440
Go. Go.

850
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,270
Watch the door.

851
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,210
Got it.

852
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,470
Susu, is that you?

853
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,840
Mrs. Fei.

854
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,110
How did you know it was me?

855
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Mrs. Fei.

856
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,510
I...

857
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,670
I didn't mean to lie to you and Wendian.

858
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,870
Are you hungry?

859
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm starving.

860
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,030
Take off your cloak.

861
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,530
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

862
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,900
Come on, eat.

863
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,790
I can eat all these?

864
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,880
They're all prepared for you. Eat up.

865
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,410
Mrs. Fei, you're so nice.

866
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,760
Susu,

867
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,670
what's this really about?

868
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,670
My father said
once I got on the bridal sedan,

869
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,360
he'd have time to save my sister.

870
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,550
When my sister comes back,

871
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,670
he'll take me away.

872
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,190
Mrs. Fei,

873
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,480
you won't blame me, will you?

874
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,870
I didn't mean to lie to you.

875
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,470
I'm doing this for my sister.

876
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,550
I know.

877
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,120
Susu, you're a good girl.

878
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,880
By doing this,
you did not only help your sister,

879
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,280
but also all of us.

880
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,840
I won't blame you.

881
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,610
Just stay here with peace of mind.

882
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,110
If you feel sleepy after eating,

883
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,240
you can sleep first.

884
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,660
But remember one thing.

885
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,140
Don't let anyone

886
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,190
know who you are,

887
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,440
including Wendian.

888
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,880
If anyone else finds out,

889
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,840
you won't be able to help your sister.
Understand?
