[This Thriving Land]

2
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,910
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,870
The second toast.

4
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,289
I'm downing it.

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,120
You drink as you please.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,450
It's a toast of respect.

7
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm here to steal your man.

8
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,150
Why do you respect me?

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm toasting you for being upfront,

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,570
for coming straight at me for him,

11
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,510
instead of sneaking around,

12
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,390
trying to seduce Dajiao behind my back,

13
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,390
and leaving me humiliated.

14
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,370
It's more like a duel in ancient times,

15
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
and you gave me

16
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,070
a heads-up about your first move.

17
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:17,800
Wait.

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,640
What do you mean?

19
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,400
You think you can outdo me
with just three bowls of wine?

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,020
This drinking contest

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
was my idea.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,300
After three toasts to you,

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,960
we'll drink however you want.

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,500
The third toast is a toast of admiration.

25
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,079
To be honest,

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,880
after we met,

27
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,370
the better I got to know you,

28
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,120
the more I saw the good in you.

29
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,630
There's a boldness in you—you say things

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,460
and do things I wouldn't dare.

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,680
In my eyes,

32
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,010
you're living so freely.

33
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,680
Me?

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,740
I'm living freely?

35
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,510
You love and hate without fear.

36
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,600
You own what you do,

37
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,770
and you came all the way here alone

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,030
just to say what you had to say

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
and grab what you wanted.

40
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,750
I've never seen a woman

41
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,190
live as freely as you do.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
In all my life,

43
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,079
no one's ever praised me like this.

44
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,920
Alright.

45
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,800
For that alone,

46
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,070
I'm downing it.

47
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,829
Every word I said

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,360
came from my heart.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,190
I'm being nothing but honest.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,079
Besides, what I admire in you

51
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,110
goes far beyond that.

52
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,870
You are

53
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,540
well-traveled.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,400
You can sing songs. You're kind,

55
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,240
and you're beautiful.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,310
If I were a man,

57
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,310
I'd fall for you.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,420
You're really flattering me.

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,960
If I really were that good,

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,019
why didn't Dajiao fall for me?

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,070
If…

62
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,630
you had met Dajiao before me,

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,320
maybe he would've been attracted to you

64
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,030
and held you in his heart.

65
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,690
But you came later.

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,830
Not only did I meet him before you,

67
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,990
but I'm also the one

68
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,740
he risked his life to save twice
from the bandits.

69
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Twice?

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
The first time,

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
when the bandits took me,

72
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,750
I waited for my father to ransom me

73
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,720
and for the man I was about to marry
to come rescue me.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,770
But the one who showed up

75
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,040
was Dajiao,

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,970
a man I'd barely spoken 10 words to.

77
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,190
I married into the Feng family in anger.

78
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,270
Dajiao understood my feelings.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,360
He hung a curtain on the bed between us

80
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,310
to protect what was left of my pride.

81
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,100
He just quietly stayed by my side,

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,020
trying to give me the best of everything.

83
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,180
If he hadn't truly cared for me,

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,750
what man

85
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,640
would have hidden his feelings
behind a mere piece of cloth?

86
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,270
He just quietly stayed by my side,

87
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,750
giving me time.

88
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,990
I saw his deep affection for me.

89
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,300
And then the second time,

90
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,580
he saved me again from the bandits.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,440
Everyone in the village—myself included—

92
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,790
thought I was doomed,

93
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,870
that it was my fate

94
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,800
to end up in the bandits' hands.

95
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,750
In that brief moment,

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,920
I thought of 10,000 ways to end my life.

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
But right at that moment,

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,300
Dajiao appeared behind the bandit Hu San

99
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,660
out of nowhere,

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
holding a knife to Hu San's throat.

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,690
It was his courage

102
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,730
that saved everyone in the village.

103
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,310
He went from a stranger

104
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,950
I'd barely spoken 10 words to,

105
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,920
from someone I had to thank

106
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,270
and respect,

107
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,450
to the light of my life—

108
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,560
the man

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,910
I can't live without—

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
my man.

111
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,600
No matter if the life ahead

112
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,560
is bitter or sweet,

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,680
we're family
and are bound together for life,

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
never to part.

115
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,830
Lulu,

116
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,160
a person's heart

117
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,860
is only so big.

118
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,270
Can it hold another person?

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,260
Xiuxiu, you know what?

120
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,950
Before you said all this,

121
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,870
you had always been

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,880
a mystery to me.

123
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
After I came here,

124
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,310
every move I'd carefully planned

125
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,250
fell apart because of you.

126
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,909
Remember when we first met?

127
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,000
In the field.

128
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,030
With your sharp eyes,

129
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,390
you saw right through

130
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,720
my feelings for Dajiao.

131
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,070
Any other woman

132
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,430
would've cried, screamed,

133
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,430
and made a scene.

134
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,630
But you?

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,010
You were so polite to me.

136
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,830
For a while, I even doubted

137
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,630
if you'd really seen through me.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
So I pushed further.

139
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,230
I went straight to your home

140
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,390
and called Dajiao's parents my godparents.

141
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,310
But inside, I was uneasy.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
For a moment, I even thought,

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,190
"Fine,

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,710
maybe this is it.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,860
I'll just stay with my godparents

146
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
and watch Dajiao.

147
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,549
Wouldn't that be a good enough life?"

148
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
I just like Dajiao so much.

149
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,380
I bought fake herb seedlings,

150
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,950
but you didn't drive me away
in front of everyone.

151
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
That's when I knew

152
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,530
I hadn't been wrong all along.

153
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,390
You knew I was here for Dajiao.

154
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,150
Whether as a person

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,490
or as a wife,

156
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,250
I fall far short of you.

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,510
I knew this drinking match

158
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,640
wasn't that simple.

159
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,630
I thought of 1,000 lines
to argue with you.

160
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,530
But after hearing the stories

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,450
between you and Dajiao,

162
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,980
I don't know
how to argue with you anymore.

163
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,220
Stop drinking.

164
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,110
You've drunk a lot.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,130
For the sake of your child with Dajiao,

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
drink no more.

167
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,600
If things weren't like this,

168
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,550
I would

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,210
take an oath with you

170
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,600
like men do

171
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
and be your lifelong sister.

172
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,360
But fate didn't give me Dajiao,

173
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,540
so I can't be sisters with you either.

174
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,000
I've always secretly envied
your good fortune.

175
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,960
But now I see,

176
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,690
your good fortune

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,520
was earned bit by bit through struggle.

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,800
I've lost,

179
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,410
and I accept it.

180
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,510
Since you've put it that way,

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,750
I must make a drink

182
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
to your sincerity.

183
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,360
If you don't mind drinking

184
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
the wine from a poor farmer's house,

185
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,780
you can drink mine,

186
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,650
and I'll drink yours.

187
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,710
Cheers.

188
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,730
This is just water!

189
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,460
My wine is fake,

190
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,100
but every word I've said

191
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,040
is true.

192
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,840
Easy, easy.

193
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
I can lose everything,

194
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,480
but not

195
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
my Dajiao.

196
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,270
Of course.

197
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,730
I should've known better.

198
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,880
How could you possibly let me have Dajiao?

199
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You're impossible to figure out—

200
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,480
so interesting

201
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,690
and so lovable.

202
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,240
I've always believed one thing.

203
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,600
Since heaven

204
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,290
gave me Dajiao,

205
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,200
it'll surely send you someone too.

206
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,600
He's already on his way to you,

207
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,410
running day and night.

208
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,240
When he really shows up,

209
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,760
I'll beat him up first.

210
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
Why?

211
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,670
I'll ask him,

212
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,860
"What took you so long?"

213
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,650
So you're really going to Qingdao?

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm going to find Xiaohu.

215
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,860
I prepared some food for you

216
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,070
to eat on the way.

217
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,030
Thanks.

218
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,120
Don't get involved in gambling anymore.

219
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,890
It's not a decent way to make a living.

220
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,750
The money never sat right with me.

221
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,570
I've figured it all out.

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
I'll start a small business,

223
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,320
stay with my brother, find him a wife,

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,850
and help him raise a family.

225
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
What about yourself?

226
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,200
Xiuxiu said

227
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,330
if Heaven gave her Dajiao,

228
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,280
it'll give me a good man too.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
I'll just wait and see

230
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,120
if she's right this time.

231
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,630
Let's go.

232
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,740
Why didn't you go see Lulu off?

233
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,730
Why would I?

234
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,890
I never gave her any hope.

235
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,650
Now that she's leaving,
why string her along?

236
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,510
Lulu isn't a bad person.

237
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,200
I know.

238
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
That's why I can't give her any hope.

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,470
What are you getting at?

240
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,530
So I'm a bad person?

241
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,320
Of course not.

242
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,390
You're my shining hero.

243
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
What's wrong, Xiuxiu?

244
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,310
Did I do something wrong?

245
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,330
I'm being honest with you.

246
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,790
I'm so lucky

247
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,330
to have met someone as amazing as you.

248
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll treat you really well from now on,

249
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,300
so no one else

250
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,770
gets the chance to steal you away.

251
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,270
Xiuxiu,

252
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,790
my heart

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,890
has no room for anyone else.

254
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,880
There's only enough room for you.

255
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,210
For my entire life,

256
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,170
I'll only be good to you,

257
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,670
never make you angry or sad,

258
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,080
and keep you happy every day.

259
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,710
Our life will only get better from now on.

260
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,510
We'll be happy every day.

261
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,780
You got better.

262
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,000
You can sit up and eat now.

263
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,630
Good, eat more.

264
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,370
Yinzi,

265
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,140
you borrowed money

266
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,750
from Master Ning

267
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
to buy this medicine?

268
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,040
I didn't go to Ning Xuexiang for help.

269
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,790
It's the same batch of herbs.

270
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,960
I can get a bit more decoction out of it.

271
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,190
That won't do!

272
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,080
Yinzi,

273
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,360
if your mother doesn't get fresh medicine,

274
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,890
her illness will get worse.

275
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
Yinzi, stop fanning.

276
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,440
Go borrow some money for medicine
from Master Ning.

277
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Borrow, borrow, that's all you say.

278
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,340
After we borrow money,

279
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,040
what do we pay it back with?

280
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
After the autumn harvest,
with grain of course.

281
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
Father, stop fooling yourself.

282
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,990
The grain and money you borrowed

283
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,050
from Ning Xuexiang

284
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,770
will take us years to repay.

285
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,870
Why worry so much?

286
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,440
I never think that far.

287
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,740
He used to refuse to lend us anything.

288
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
Every time I went, I got told off.

289
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,820
Every time I went, I got told off.

290
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
Now, not only does he lend,

291
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,290
but he also offers dried sweet potatoes.

292
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,290
And you dare borrow from him
without a second thought?

293
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,050
I don't dare.

294
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm scared we'll never pay it back.

295
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,720
Can you stop obsessing

296
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
over dried sweet potatoes?

297
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Then what do we do?

298
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,510
We're a big family with no extra grain.

299
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,030
It's the hardest season of the year,

300
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,360
and your mother's sick.

301
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
You think I like borrowing from him?

302
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,030
All you care about is saving face.

303
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,660
Then don't borrow a thing.

304
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,589
Let your siblings starve.

305
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,890
Let your mother

306
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,210
wait for death,

307
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,990
and let me starve too!

308
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,920
It's all my fault.

309
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
It's all my fault.

310
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,970
I'm a burden to this family.

311
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,170
It's my fault.

312
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,110
Mother.

313
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,620
Mother,

314
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,110
don't worry.

315
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,940
Everything will be fine.

316
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yinzi.

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960
Everything will be fine.

318
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,120
Don't worry.

319
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,570
We'll thin the seedlings tomorrow.
Go to sleep now.

320
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,120
We're going to have a new family member.

321
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,060
I'm going to be a grandfather.

322
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,160
That'll cost a fair bit.

323
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,270
I did the math.

324
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,100
Planting herbs really does

325
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,850
pay better than growing crops.

326
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
If they sell well this year,

327
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,070
we'll have Xiuxiu plant more next year.

328
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,550
My goodness, our daughter-in-law

329
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,740
has always got her nose in that herb book,

330
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,780
reading, writing, and sketching.

331
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,450
Once she figures it all out,

332
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,350
we'll use our main field

333
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,290
to grow herbs too.

334
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,720
Look at you.

335
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,680
You were the one
who opposed it at every turn,

336
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,590
and now you're the one
saving up to grow herbs.

337
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,790
One can never be so sure about anything.

338
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,160
Go to sleep.

339
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Sleep? How can I?

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm the head of this family.

341
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,900
I've got to plan for everything.

342
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,420
Eating and drinking won't make you poor,

343
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,620
but poor planning will leave you broke.

344
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,120
You short-sighted woman.

345
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,270
We'll thin the seedlings tomorrow.

346
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,880
Father's happy at last,

347
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,630
and Lulu is out of our hair.

348
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,110
I think

349
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
good days are coming.

350
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,650
I think these are already the good days.

351
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,410
Good days

352
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,490
are just ordinary days

353
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,250
spent with the one you love most

354
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,690
and trust most.

355
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,450
Who dug up the seedlings?

356
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,930
Slow down.

357
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,270
What?

358
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,030
Who did this?

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,920
Who did this?

360
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,110
Xiuxiu!

361
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,510
What's going on?

362
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,750
I want to know that too.

363
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,700
This...

364
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,570
Did you offend someone?

365
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,570
This whole thing was your idea.

366
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,220
They're after you. They're after you!

367
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,310
I want to know what happened too!

368
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,770
Father,

369
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,220
you can't blame me
every time something happens.

370
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,650
I'm just as upset as you.

371
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,070
This has nothing to do with me!

372
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,000
Shut up!

373
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,510
Isn't it obvious?

374
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,240
You brought this on us.

375
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,020
I told you—

376
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,600
a good field like this

377
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,440
should be used to grow crops,

378
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,720
not this nonsense!

379
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,060
It's not right!

380
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
Look at this!

381
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,950
This is retribution!

382
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,400
Retribution…

383
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,000
Father.

384
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,830
Honey.

385
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,380
Father!

386
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,030
Father!

387
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,030
Father, what's wrong with you?

388
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,750
What happened?

389
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,160
Honey.

390
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Dajiao, don't waste time here.

391
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,020
Go get a doctor!

392
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,610
Second Uncle.

393
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,310
Don't delay.

394
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,570
Give me a hand, come on.

395
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,400
What's going on?

396
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,270
Second Uncle.

397
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,270
Say something, Honey.

398
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,310
What's going on?

399
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,990
What's wrong with him?

400
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,750
Check on him.

401
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,230
Honey.

402
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,710
Honey.

403
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,750
Slow down.

404
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,590
Honey.

405
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,100
Say something, Honey.

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,830
Honey.

407
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,640
What?

408
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,680
You asked to talk to me
and made me come out.

409
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,020
If you weren't pregnant,

410
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,010
I wouldn't have bothered with you.

411
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,390
Let's go inside. The wind is picking up.

412
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,110
Come on, let's go inside.

413
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,960
You're so stubborn.

414
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,310
Look at you.

415
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,240
If not for yourself,

416
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,750
at least think about the baby
in your belly.

417
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,970
Stop making trouble, will you?

418
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,750
Just answer me one thing.

419
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,310
Was it you who dug up my seedlings?

420
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,840
Was it you?

421
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,550
Yes, it was me.

422
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,520
I did it.

423
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,310
So what?

424
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,790
Tell me why.

425
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Why?

426
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,470
If you want to know why,
come inside with me.

427
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,240
Tell me here and now.

428
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,970
Have you ever heard the story?

429
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,160
A family once

430
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
planted red sage,

431
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,650
over 100 mu of it.

432
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,430
That family was no other family

433
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,160
but our Ning family.

434
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
Your great-great-grandfather

435
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
made a fortune on red sage.

436
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
100 mu of land became 300.

437
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
But later,

438
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,440
on his deathbed,

439
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,620
he established a family rule:

440
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
from that day forward,

441
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,240
the Ning family

442
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
must grow only crops

443
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,070
in our land,

444
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,390
never herbs,

445
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,010
especially not red sage.

446
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,830
Your great-grandfather and grandfather
kowtowed and swore an oath

447
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,830
before he finally closed his eyes.

448
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,440
That plant is cursed.
The Ning family must never touch it.

449
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,810
Those red roots are a symbol of bloodshed.

450
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,400
That's why they burned it all later.

451
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,990
No.

452
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,130
I don't believe you.

453
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,730
If nothing happened,

454
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,310
why did they burn
hundreds of mu of the herb?

455
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,750
Xiu,

456
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,950
I don't want to talk about this.

457
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,230
I dug up your seedlings

458
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,310
because I want you

459
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,200
to give up growing red sage.

460
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,130
My father told me

461
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,640
the same story.

462
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,560
But what exactly happened?

463
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,960
Back then, there was a pest plague.

464
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,130
It was a strange pest,

465
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,720
unlike anything we'd ever seen before.

466
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,320
It only ate the herb's roots.

467
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,920
By the time they noticed it,

468
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,590
the roots had already been

469
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,270
chewed to shreds by the pests.

470
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,700
It was strange.

471
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,530
As you know, the root is the most
valuable part of red sage.

472
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,310
They had no choice

473
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,400
but to burn it all.

474
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,630
Your great-great-grandfather
didn't plant any crops

475
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,350
on his 300 mu of land.

476
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,900
He bet everything on red sage.

477
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,340
He also borrowed money

478
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,580
for seeds,

479
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,570
seedlings, and workers.

480
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,820
He couldn't take the blow

481
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,800
and passed away.

482
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,910
He consulted a fortune teller
at that time,

483
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,680
who said this herb was cursed

484
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,970
and defied the will of heaven.

485
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,960
That's why

486
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,190
heaven made this disaster happen.

487
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,010
I don't buy that nonsense.

488
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,310
Even if there was
a pest plague back then,

489
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,030
there had to be another cause.

490
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
I'll plant it anyway.

491
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,130
Even if a plague happens,

492
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,790
I'll bear the consequences myself.

493
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,550
It's not even on his land.

494
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,800
What right does he have to meddle?

495
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,490
If you ask me,

496
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,240
before you plant it,

497
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,080
you'll need to get past your father first.

498
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,990
Otherwise,
he'll dig up your seedlings again.

499
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,050
Why?

500
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,840
Because of the family rule.

501
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,270
The Ning family's land

502
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,070
was earned through blood,
sweat, and tears.

503
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,880
That plague
in your great-great-grandfather's time

504
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,030
left the family completely bankrupt.

505
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,580
After that,

506
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,330
in the Ning family,

507
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,430
both your grandfather and father

508
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,130
valued the land more than their own lives.

509
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,390
I understand

510
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,670
your father's concerns.

511
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,000
Xiuxiu,

512
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
he didn't dig up your seedlings.

513
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,590
He dug up his own fears.

514
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,110
He's afraid you'll repeat
your ancestor's mistake.

515
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,200
You get it now?

516
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,780
My father says that herb brings bad luck,

517
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,360
but I don't believe it.

518
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
I'll plant it anyway.

519
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,850
I think

520
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,210
if I replant before the seedlings

521
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
are completely dead,

522
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,020
maybe it'll make Father feel better.

523
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,400
Xiu,

524
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,550
I know

525
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,550
you're anxious,

526
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
but think about it.

527
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,610
Father has been uneasy
about growing herbs from the beginning.

528
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,000
Just when he agreed,

529
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,250
your father pulled this stunt.

530
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,770
What we need most right now

531
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,200
is to appease both our fathers.

532
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,230
How?

533
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,680
By not planting herbs this year.

534
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,200
Even if you replant the seedlings,

535
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,690
can you guarantee
your father won't dig them up again?

536
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,520
Let's just

537
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,870
grow crops for now.

538
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,550
That way, both our fathers can rest easy.

539
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,960
If you still want to plant it,

540
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,400
we'll talk to Father again
next year, okay?

541
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,590
Alright.

542
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,350
I understand.

543
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,810
I won't plant it this year.

544
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,140
I'll go cook.

545
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,270
Fei Yinzi.

546
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,440
I came to you eight times,
and you still ignored me.

547
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,380
You're…

548
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,890
You're just stringing me along.

549
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,450
I won't talk to you anymore!

550
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,630
I have land.

551
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
I have land with permanent tenancy!

552
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,440
I'll wait…

553
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,490
for the autumn harvest.

554
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,940
After the harvest,

555
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
I'll marry someone better than you!

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,070
Yinzi, why won't you talk to me?

557
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,150
What did I do wrong?

558
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,880
Just wait.

559
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,680
After the harvest, I'll marry you.

560
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Just wait until after the harvest.

561
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,550
Just wait.

562
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,640
Wait for me.

563
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,550
Go away.

564
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,180
Go play somewhere else.

565
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,250
Tietou, braid my hair.

566
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,020
Tietou, braid my hair.

567
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,790
Yinzi won't let me chase you off,

568
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,440
so I won't.

569
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,270
Tietou, braid my hair.

570
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,970
Tietou, braid my hair.

571
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,720
Leave after I finish braiding.

572
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,080
Don't disturb my sleep.

573
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,800
I want to wear a flower.

574
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,580
Come on.

575
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,650
Give it to me.

576
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,180
I look pretty with flowers.

577
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,850
Don't you usually buy medicine
in the village?

578
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,250
Why go all the way to town?

579
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,880
She's so heavy with child now.

580
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,490
Why wear herself out?

581
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,970
We're going to Chang Chun's pharmacy.

582
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,750
He gave us the seeds.

583
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
With the seedlings dug up,

584
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,540
I need to talk to him

585
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,710
and pay whatever compensation is needed.

586
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,640
Don't worry.

587
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,030
I'll take good care of her.

588
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,590
Mother,

589
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,820
we'll be back soon.

590
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,310
Look after Father while we're gone.

591
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,900
He's gotten better.

592
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,880
I'm just worried about you.

593
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,680
You must be careful.

594
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll definitely take good care
of your grandchild

595
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,670
and myself.

596
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,720
-Okay.
-We're leaving.

597
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,110
Go back in.

598
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,880
Okay. Be careful.

599
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,070
[Tonghhe Street]

600
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,780
Dajiao.

601
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,730
This seems to be the place.

602
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,710
Haven't we been here before?

603
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,210
Yeah. Last time

604
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,770
we ran into Chang Chun here.

605
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,200
Changming.

606
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,310
Dajiao, Xiuxiu,

607
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,700
what brings you here?

608
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,120
He's actually sleeping here.

609
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,350
Feng Tietou, I've got you now.

610
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,590
You can't escape.

611
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,240
Get up!

612
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,910
Tell me, was it you?

613
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,550
What? What did I do?

614
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,590
Look at her belly!

615
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,550
Tell me, was it you?

616
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,270
Was it you?

617
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,400
Silly Tiao,

618
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,520
tell Mother,

619
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,990
who got you pregnant?

620
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,860
Did Tietou sleep with you?

621
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,680
It wasn't me!

622
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,140
I had nothing to do with it!

623
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,920
Tietou, braid my hair.

624
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,000
See?

625
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Did you hear that?

626
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,200
Would a mentally impaired girl lie?

627
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,330
How dare you deny it?

628
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,690
Don't make things up!

629
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,790
S-Silly Tiao, don't talk nonsense!

630
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,750
Look. Look at him.

631
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,210
He says we're making it up
and won't admit it.

632
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,510
Don't run! Don't run!

633
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,030
Stop!

634
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,670
Don't run!

635
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,120
Don't let him escape! Stop him!

636
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,750
Stop him!

637
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,150
Catch him!

638
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,590
I never thought

639
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,310
you'd really take over

640
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,530
this pharmacy.

641
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,480
The old shopkeeper,

642
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,720
who's now my father-in-law,

643
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,900
gave me some money.

644
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,990
I saved some over the years too.

645
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,310
As luck would have it,

646
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,830
the shop was up for sale,

647
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
so I bought it.

648
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,930
You know, we met each other

649
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,350
thanks to this pharmacy.

650
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,210
It's great you opened a pharmacy in town.

651
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,760
Now we can come to you with questions,

652
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,790
and it'll be easier when you come
to buy herbs from us.

653
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,520
Yes, indeed.

654
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,310
If I weren't so busy here,

655
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,540
I'd have brought herb seeds to you myself.

656
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,420
Chang Chun,

657
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,180
we've come today to apologize to you.

658
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,310
The seeds you gave us—

659
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,410
we planted them,

660
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,920
and they sprouted,

661
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,810
but unfortunately,

662
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,830
my father-in-law dug them all up.

663
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,720
So we came today

664
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,240
to ask how much we owe you.

665
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,640
After all, you paid for those seeds.

666
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,350
You're being too polite with me.

667
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,750
Besides,

668
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,350
it was your first time planting it.

669
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,150
Problems are perfectly normal.

670
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,270
It's really our fault this time.

671
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,090
Dajiao wanted to come days ago.

672
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,830
Dajiao, you really don't need to pay me.

673
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,790
I'll just consider this
as an experiment for you.

674
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,070
No, no, absolutely not.

675
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,550
That's not proper.

676
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,000
If you won't let us pay you,

677
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,150
how can we come to you
when we want to plant herbs again?

678
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,510
Feel free to come to me.

679
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,130
I'll send you seeds
whenever you want to plant.

680
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,590
Or do you prefer seedlings?

681
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,920
That would be such an imposition.

682
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,070
Not at all.

683
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,989
Also,

684
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,110
the plague I mentioned when I came in,

685
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,610
the one that caused
my great-great-grandfather huge loss—

686
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,610
what kind of pest was it?

687
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,170
When you just mentioned it,

688
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,170
I remembered.

689
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,699
It's a kind of disease,
not a kind of pest.

690
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,639
It's a type of white fungus.

691
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,360
The infection starts at the roots.

692
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,670
You can't see it on the leaves at first.

693
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,469
That's right.

694
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,440
My second uncle said the same thing.

695
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,150
Growing red sage is hard.

696
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,690
Ventilation, drainage, and so on.

697
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,170
Come on,

698
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,230
let's go to the back

699
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,489
and talk more about it.

700
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,280
Changming.

701
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,110
Keep an eye on the counter.

702
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,630
Okay.

703
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,360
Let's go.

704
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,550
Feng Tietou!

705
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,230
Feng Tietou!

706
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,550
Get your ass out here!

707
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,150
Feng Tietou, get out here!

708
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,600
Feng Tietou!

709
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,360
Tietou, come out!

710
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,380
Put her there.

711
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,210
Feng Tietou, get your ass out here!

712
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,050
Feng Tietou!

713
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,380
Feng Tietou!

714
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,120
What's going on?

715
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,770
Get out!

716
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,140
Feng Tietou, come out!

717
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,570
Look what he's done!

718
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,410
Look what your son has done!

719
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
He knocked Silly Tiao up!

720
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,710
What are you doing?

721
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,530
That's impossible!

722
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,790
Why are you at my house?

723
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,480
Why are you here?

724
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,930
I told you it wasn't me!

725
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,320
Take her away!

726
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,230
Take her away!

727
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,820
What are you doing?

728
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,230
Take her away!

729
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,030
Put her down! What are you doing?

730
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,360
Still denying it, huh?

731
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,960
He hit me!

732
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,820
It doesn't matter if you admit it!

733
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,580
From today on, Silly Tiao and her child

734
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,190
will stay right here.

735
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,270
Villagers, look.

736
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,600
Tietou did something horrible
and won't admit it!

737
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,520
Please give Silly Tiao justice.

738
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,730
Just now in the hut,

739
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,590
she told me herself

740
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,530
that she slept with Feng Tietou

741
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,510
and then got pregnant.

742
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,360
From today on,

743
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,150
Silly Tiao is Feng Tietou's wife!

744
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,000
Silly Tiao.

745
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,420
Tietou.

746
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,020
Come here!

747
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,400
Listen to me.

748
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,820
From now on,

749
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,690
you'll live at this place.

750
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,100
You're the daughter-in-law of this family!

751
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,960
You'll eat here

752
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,890
and sleep here,

753
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,370
understand?

754
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,150
Go home.

755
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,850
Shut the hell up!

756
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,760
Say that again,

757
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,570
and I'll beat you to death!

758
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,280
Let me say something.

759
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,650
Why put a girl with intellectual
disabilities through all this?

760
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,320
She doesn't

761
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,150
even know what she ate this morning.

762
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,710
How can she explain anything?

763
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,460
Mrs. Feng,

764
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,730
that's easy for you to say.

765
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,830
Silly Tiao may be mentally impaired,

766
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,840
but she knows who got her pregnant!

767
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,810
Silly Tiao,

768
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,920
tell everyone here,

769
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
whose child

770
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
are you carrying?

771
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,860
Come on.

772
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,620
Silly Tiao.

773
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,320
Say it.

774
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,960
Tietou.

775
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,400
You heard that?

776
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
Did you hear that?

777
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,910
Be honest!

778
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,910
Tell them honestly if I ever touched you.

779
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,390
Tietou, braid my hair.

780
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,140
It's not about braiding hair!

781
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,220
She just said, "Tietou, braid my hair."

782
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,150
Auntie, speak up for me.

783
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,030
I didn't do anything!

784
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,630
I don't know what's going on!

785
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
What's the point of arguing with them?

786
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,160
The girl stays. We're leaving.

787
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,600
No, no. You can't leave.

788
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,320
I didn't even ask for a dowry.
That's already a favor to you.

789
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,000
Go, go.

790
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,440
Stop!

791
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,180
Go, go.

792
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,400
I didn't even ask for a dowry.

793
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Stop looking!

794
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,960
Come here.

795
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,280
Let me braid your hair.

796
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,340
Let me braid your hair.

797
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,820
Oh my God, who'd have expected
something like this to happen?

798
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,820
Have you heard?

799
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,240
What?

800
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,560
Silly Tiao is pregnant.

801
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,110
What? Pregnant?

802
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,560
Wait.

803
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,060
Who's pregnant?

804
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,110
Silly Tiao is pregnant.

805
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,110
Tietou slept with her.

806
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,320
Tietou?

807
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,980
You don't know about that?

808
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,040
He looked like a good guy
but actually slept with that poor girl.

809
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,880
Unbelievable.

810
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,710
Tietou got Silly Tiao pregnant?

811
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,190
That's right, isn't it, Han?

812
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Is it true?

813
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,390
Yes. Just ask around.

814
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,580
Silly Tiao is here now.

815
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,070
What a mess!

816
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,290
Listen carefully.

817
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm leaving her here!

818
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,230
Feng Tietou!

819
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,360
Stop there!

820
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,580
If you dare leave Silly Tiao here today,

821
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,870
I'll beat her to death.

822
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,100
Both she and the baby
will be gone for good!

823
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,600
Her mother and I will end our lives too!

824
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,880
We'll throw ourselves into the Shu River!

825
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,280
Even in death,
we'll haunt you for revenge.

826
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,050
I might as well be dead.

827
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,930
Feng Tietou,

828
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,590
I'm beating her right now!

829
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,030
If you don't admit it,

830
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,630
none of us will survive!

831
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,190
We'll all die together.

832
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,050
Tietou.

833
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,280
Tietou, braid my hair.

834
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,590
Tietou, braid my hair.

835
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,400
Tietou, braid my hair.

836
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,750
Braid my hair

837
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,070
for me.

838
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,170
Yinzi.

839
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,700
I'm in pain.

840
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,900
I know,

841
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,090
I know, Mother.

842
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,650
Mother,

843
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,570
hold on a little longer.

844
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,970
Father went with the girls
to get medicine.

845
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,570
Hold on.

846
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,480
How did it go?

847
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,320
The pharmacy said no more credit.

848
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,660
It was the owner's order.

849
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,680
He said he won't give us credit anymore

850
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
because we owe him too much already.

851
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,760
It's alright.

852
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,960
Don't worry.

853
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,910
If he won't give us credit, so be it.

854
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,170
I'll ask Tietou to figure something out.

855
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,830
People in the village are saying

856
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,710
that Tietou and Silly Tiao...

857
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,440
What?

858
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,050
They're saying

859
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,810
Tietou knocked Silly Tiao up.

860
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,590
You're such a young girl.

861
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,280
How could you say something so vulgar?

862
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,800
Mother,

863
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I trust Tietou.

864
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,710
Don't listen to that.

865
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,790
How did it go, Father?

866
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Did you get the medicine?

867
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,030
Good grief,

868
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,730
Ning Xuexiang is

869
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,670
such a fickle miser.

870
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,190
A few days ago, he'd lend us anything

871
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,800
and even offered prescriptions.

872
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,630
But today, not only did he refuse,

873
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,440
he also said that our family

874
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,000
owes him—rent and silver—

875
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,320
do you know how much?

876
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,920
12 silver dollars!

877
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,420
It's all my fault.

878
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,940
I don't want to live anymore.

879
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,880
Mother,

880
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,230
don't worry.

881
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,710
I still have ways.

882
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,930
I'll think of something.

883
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,550
I will.

884
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,030
I will.

885
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,690
We were only gone for a day,

886
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,140
and all this happened?

887
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
Did you ask Silly Tiao

888
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
who did it?

889
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,590
Ask her? How?

890
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,460
With the way she is,

891
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:32,710
the moment I ask,

892
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,570
all she says is I braided her hair.

893
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,120
I don't dare get near her.

894
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,140
Silly Tiao.

895
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Silly Tiao.

896
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,590
Tell me,

897
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,030
who hurt you?

898
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,020
Talk to me.

899
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,320
Bride.

900
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,400
Talk to me.

901
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,400
I want buns.

902
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,460
I want buns.

903
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,270
Okay, you can have buns.

904
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,190
Tell me who hurt you,

905
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,530
and I'll give you buns, okay?

906
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,940
I want buns.

907
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,050
What bun? We don't have any buns.

908
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,770
If you want one, go back to your own home.

909
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,040
Please leave. I'm begging you.

910
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,800
Can't you just go home?

911
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,440
Auntie.

912
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,290
You…

913
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,780
Auntie.

914
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,590
Auntie, don't yell at her.

915
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,190
Yelling won't solve anything.

916
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,000
What did I do

917
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,150
to deserve all this?

918
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
How am I supposed to live with this?

919
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,320
Calm down.

920
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,400
Go back inside.

921
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,110
Look at her.

922
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,970
Go back inside.

923
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,920
Xiuxiu.

924
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:40,970
Dajiao.

925
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,580
You two believe me, don't you?

926
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,630
What's the use of us believing you?

927
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,830
What matters is figuring out the truth.

928
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,800
Tietou, braid my hair.

929
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,320
Stay away from me.

930
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Stay away from me.

931
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,960
Dajiao, Dajiao.

932
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,550
Silly Tiao.

933
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,320
Silly Tiao.

934
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,960
Stop it. Stop it.

935
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,630
Buns. Buns. Buns.

936
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,840
Buns.

937
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,110
I'll go get one for you.

938
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,030
