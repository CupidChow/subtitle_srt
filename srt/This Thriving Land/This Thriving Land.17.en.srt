00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,140
Let's go inside to eat.

4
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,090
Don't pull me.

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,870
Whenever there's trouble,
you try to smooth things over.

6
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,680
You always tell me
things will get better in a few days,

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,410
but how will things get better?

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,259
Let's just clear things up today.

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,150
What's wrong?

10
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,690
Why aren't you eating?

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,360
I want to ask Father today,

12
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,880
how am I pretending to care about you?

13
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,120
Since I married into this family,

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,930
you two have always been kind to me.

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,890
And I've always shown you both
great respect.

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
I never overstepped my bounds,

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,970
and I never talked back.

18
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,510
Things a daughter-in-law shouldn't do,

19
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,040
I haven't done a single one.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,590
If you need me to,

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,550
I can serve tea in the morning
and greet you in the evening.

22
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,880
I can certainly do that.

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,700
Everyone in this yard

24
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,030
is my closest family.

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,790
I just want to ask Father,

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,300
how am I pretending to care about you?

27
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,079
Xiu, you're right.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,810
We'll eat later,

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,570
let's go rest in the room first.

30
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,800
Don't take it to heart.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
He's just speaking out of anger.

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,590
Who's speaking out of anger?

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm telling the truth.

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,190
Isn't this as obvious as lice
on a monk's head?

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,520
It's plain as day!

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Think back to when

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,840
she married into our family,

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
she kept saying that

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,520
she wanted to be the wife
of a farming family,

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,670
live a good life,
and we're all one family.

41
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,500
Look at what she has done.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,480
Does this look like the way
a family should act?

43
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,030
Forget everything else,

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,140
what about the dowry?

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,579
Still nothing!

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,570
She doesn't ask her father
for those 15 mu of land.

47
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,860
Finally, Mrs. Fei

48
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,470
took back Tietou's land.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,950
And what happened?

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,280
She blocked us from farming it!

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,180
Her father,

52
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,630
in front of the entire village,

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,190
handed the land deed to me.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,630
And she wouldn't let me take it!

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,120
What are you trying to do?

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,240
She keeps saying
she's holding a grudge against her father.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,960
Fine then,

58
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,079
go settle your score with your father!

59
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,750
Why drag us into it?

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,520
Are we a cushion for you?

61
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,700
Our Dajiao

62
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,510
is such a fine young man.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,270
He could marry a proper young lady

64
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,670
and easily get three or five mu of land.

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,630
Hell no,

66
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,730
you make us suffer along with you,

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,100
that's not right!

68
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,870
Father,

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,880
could you please say a bit less?

70
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,360
What do you mean?

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
You little brat!

72
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,910
You're like a long-tailed magpie,

73
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,750
marrying a wife and forgetting the mother!

74
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,390
Your parents got you a wife

75
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,040
so you could live a good life.

76
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,570
We never asked you to team up with her

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
to upset your father and mother!

78
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,040
Try this in someone else's home.

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,600
If a daughter-in-law dared
act this way,

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,530
the son'd have already slapped her

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
in her face!

82
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,110
Father,

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,890
that's not right of you.

84
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,260
What kind of elder

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,190
encourages his son to hit his wife?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,070
I think it's wrong for you
to talk about Xiuxiu like that.

87
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,960
She's already having such a hard time.

88
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,220
She has no family left,

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,340
and she came to us for shelter.

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,750
Why can't we help her

91
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,830
hold her head high?

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,159
We are her family now!

93
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,450
She's indeed holding her head high now,

94
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,650
but where am I supposed to vent my anger?

95
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,430
Are you trying to make your father
die of anger?

96
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,750
Since spring,

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,520
I've been planting in the fields
with single-horned ox every day,

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,760
working from dawn till dusk, my son.

99
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,380
But it was all for nothing!

100
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,410
She claims
she doesn't get along with her father,

101
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,430
but she ran off to send him a message.

102
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,650
They're the real family,

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
all in the same boat.

104
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,550
Listen to me, you little brat,

105
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,360
you tell her,

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,070
she can stay if she behaves properly,

107
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,400
but if she keeps this up,

108
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,940
I won't recognize her
as my daughter-in-law anymore.

109
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,140
Take the food inside.

110
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,070
What should we do?

111
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,480
Well, you...

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,830
You...

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,670
You and Xiuxiu'll eat first.

114
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,940
You go talk to Xiuxiu,

115
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,360
and I'll try to reason with your father.

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,680
That stubborn old man.

117
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,850
Go quickly.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Mother said

119
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,140
even if the sky falls,
we must never miss a meal.

120
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Mother was right.

121
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,600
Let's eat.

122
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,290
Father...

123
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,860
I don't want to talk about it anymore,

124
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,790
let's eat first.

125
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,480
Look,

126
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,900
all this is mine!

127
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,060
These are all mine for permanent tenancy!

128
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,460
Look at

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
all these.

130
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,960
Over there, Yinzi.

131
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:37,970
Come here.

132
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,030
What are you doing?

133
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,450
Yinzi.

134
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,300
Yinzi.

135
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,610
Yinzi, smell this.

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,870
Smell what? It's just soil,
why should I smell it?

137
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,070
This isn't just soil,

138
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
this is my land,

139
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,310
which was plowed deeply three times
by Uncle Feng Er.

140
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,370
How fragrant it is!

141
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,840
What I smell isn't soil,

142
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,590
it's the aroma of white flour dumplings,

143
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,390
the fragrance of fruit kernels,

144
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,830
and the sweet smell of sorghum wine!

145
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,750
Yinzi,

146
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,220
let me show you two treasures.

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,820
These are real treasures.

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,720
Others

149
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,580
only have this one,

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,790
not this one.

151
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,510
So their permanent tenancy

152
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,570
isn't guaranteed.

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,280
I,

154
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,950
only I, Feng Tietou,

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,350
have both.

156
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,550
With this one and this one,

157
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,250
we won't fear anything in the future.

158
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,310
Yinzi,

159
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,650
we have nothing to fear anymore.

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,159
This is what I earned as a laborer.

161
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,720
I will

162
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,990
save this to buy some good seeds.

163
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,580
And this,

164
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,620
here,

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,600
take this,

166
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,890
take it.

167
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,830
Buy some food for your younger siblings

168
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,360
to satisfy their cravings.

169
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll go buy seeds tomorrow.

170
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,310
What's wrong?

171
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,830
I need to dig some wild vegetables.

172
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,360
My whole family is waiting for me
to feed them.

173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
Yinzi!

174
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,800
Yinzi!

175
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,600
Here is my promise.

176
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,390
Just wait to live a good life with me!

177
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,670
Spring sowing, and autumn reaping.
What a good yield.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,030
Sister, wait for me to marry you!

179
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,870
What's wrong with you?

180
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,320
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,670
Didn't we agree

182
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,590
that I'd wait at the field

183
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,790
and you'd come give me
permanent tenancy afterward?

184
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,870
I've been waiting for two days
and you never showed up,

185
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,470
so I had to come find you myself.

186
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,470
Glutton Fei,

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
we always get along well.

188
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,180
That's right.

189
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,640
Let me tell you something.

190
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,860
You need to look at your own situation.

191
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,380
What permanent tenancy are you asking for?

192
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,330
If I were you,

193
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,960
I'd just farm honestly,

194
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,630
live a good life and stop causing trouble.

195
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,750
What do you mean?

196
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,230
What's wrong with me?

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,040
Old Li got permanent tenancy,

198
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,110
why can't I?

199
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,960
You won't listen, will you?

200
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,910
I'll go talk to the Master myself.

201
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,390
I'll speak to him myself.

202
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,630
What are you doing?

203
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,670
Don't block me!

204
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
Why won't you listen?

205
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,490
Master isn't seeing anyone.

206
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,270
No visitors?

207
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Then I'll sit here and not leave.

208
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm not leaving.

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,700
You just won't listen?

210
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,080
They all got permanent tenancy,
why can't I?

211
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
I'll just leave you here.

212
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm just going to sit right here.

213
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,120
Father.

214
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,510
Dajiao,

215
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,640
meal's ready.

216
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll go back to eat.

217
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,640
Father.

218
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,360
Father.

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,930
How long are we going to keep fighting
as a family?

220
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,520
Come.

221
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,960
Xiu.

222
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,670
After Father scolded you,

223
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,330
you've barely spoken all day.

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,660
Are you holding a grudge against him?

225
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,880
Just eat while it's hot.

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,380
Let me turn over the field.

227
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,370
You're done eating?

228
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,910
Tell me what's going on.
I'm dying to know.

229
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,380
It's not what you think.

230
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm not being spiteful with Father.

231
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,390
I feel like

232
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,240
Father was actually right
about everything,

233
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,600
and I had no comeback.

234
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,360
I shouldn't have put my problems

235
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,670
on your shoulders

236
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,520
and made you carry them with me.

237
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,020
About Ning Xuexiang
not selling land to redeem me,

238
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,040
I am indeed angry about it,

239
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,560
and I've had a falling out with him.

240
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,370
But this isn't your fault,

241
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
and it has nothing to do with you.

242
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,240
Yet I still dragged you into
bearing it with me.

243
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,440
In our Father's words,

244
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
you all helped me

245
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,750
hold my head up.

246
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,330
But now Father

247
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,790
can't hold his head up.

248
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,440
Now I'm thinking

249
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,360
how to help father

250
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
hold his head up again.

251
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,130
I've been thinking about it a lot.

252
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,050
Father said
I was pretending to care about him,

253
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,780
and he was right about that too.

254
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,140
I thought about it.

255
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
In this family,

256
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,530
I'm the one who does the least work

257
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
but demands the most.

258
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
When I think about it,

259
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,120
I've been so foolish.

260
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,630
I've only ever wanted to have

261
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,430
a happy and smooth life with you.

262
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,690
But it seems like

263
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm always standing on high ground,

264
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,290
waiting for you,

265
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,800
and waiting Father to come up to me.

266
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,730
I can't keep being like this anymore.

267
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,790
As for the fight with Father,

268
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,700
I've got to sort it out properly.

269
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,240
It said that a harmonious family prospers.

270
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,720
If I'm always causing arguments,

271
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,800
how can we live peacefully?

272
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,200
Why are you

273
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,840
looking at me like that?

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,390
My dear,

275
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,910
how are you

276
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,790
so different from everyone else?

277
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,070
I'll tell your words to Father right away.

278
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,450
Dajiao,

279
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,480
they say
whoever tied the knot must untie it.

280
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,270
I

281
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
tied this knot.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
So I need to untie it bit by bit.

283
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,870
Master.

284
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,310
What?

285
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,080
Didn't Kuangzi tell you
I'm too busy to see you?

286
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,610
Why are you not leaving yet?

287
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,050
Are you planning to live on us?

288
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
M-Master.

289
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
You promised me

290
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,200
to give me

291
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,760
permanent tenancy.

292
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,750
At Dajiao's front gate,

293
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,480
you told me to wait at home.

294
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,290
You didn't come for me,

295
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,890
so I had to come here myself.

296
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,740
What a terrible memory I have.

297
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,360
You want permanent tenancy?

298
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

299
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
I just remembered

300
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,770
there was such a matter.

301
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,550
Then p-please grant me
permanent tenancy now,

302
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,880
which won't be too late.

303
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm currently settling accounts.

304
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,170
It's perfect timing to

305
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,000
settle your matter and your debts

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,160
all at once.

307
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,030
Glutton Fei.

308
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,640
You've rented 3 mu of land from me

309
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,910
for three consecutive years.

310
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,670
You can't even pay the full rent.

311
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,080
Every year, you have a terrible harvest.

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,170
Before New Year,
you borrowed grain from me again.

313
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,590
And when your wife fell ill,

314
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,870
you borrowed money from me too.

315
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,790
The grain I lend you every year,

316
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,190
plus the dried sweet potatoes,
and the money for medication,

317
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,190
if they were all converted to grain,

318
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,150
they would fill a huge granary.

319
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,970
Instead of thinking of how to pay me back,

320
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
you're causing trouble like others,

321
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
demanding permanent tenancy from me?

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,750
No, Master.

323
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,200
Those permanent tenants,

324
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,980
did, did they

325
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,710
all clear their debts with you?

326
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,460
You've got that right,
but actually they didn't.

327
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,920
Well...

328
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,340
But you're different.

329
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,450
You eat a lot but work little.

330
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,380
If I give you permanent tenancy,

331
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,740
I'm afraid you'll let my land go to waste.

332
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I don't trust you.

333
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,600
You're bullying me.

334
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
I am indeed bullying you.

335
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,550
So what?

336
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,400
It's you who are too useless.

337
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,590
Kuangzi, see him out.

338
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,120
Get him out.

339
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,670
What did I say?

340
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,050
I have given you plenty of trouble.

341
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,780
We've run out of grain at home.

342
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,390
Lend me 6 kilograms of

343
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,950
d-dried sweet potatoes.

344
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,830
Who's really bullying whom here?

345
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,790
You can't repay your debts,

346
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,000
yet you still want
permanent tenancy from me.

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
Who's really the bully here?

348
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,410
Get out of my sight!

349
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,650
Go!

350
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,290
Why don't you even listen to my words?

351
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,620
You're acting like I'm trying to hurt you.

352
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,050
With that brain of his,

353
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
how dare him confront me?

354
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,290
Mother, slow down!

355
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,170
Sir, Madam, please spare some food.

356
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,109
Take pity on us,

357
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,550
please give us something to eat.

358
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,680
Have mercy on us.

359
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,640
Just a little food, please.

360
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,560
Thank you, Madam!

361
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,310
Thank you, Madam!

362
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,200
Just leave fast.

363
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,790
Thank you!

364
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,430
Quick, call those two back.

365
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,510
That is Tietou's family,
we can't beg there.

366
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,050
We can't embarrass your sister.

367
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,700
Hurry, pull them back!

368
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,380
Please have mercy on us.

369
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,030
Who did I think it was?

370
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,400
Get up.

371
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,030
What?

372
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,270
That Glutton Fei

373
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,200
has licked your pot clean again?

374
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,550
This won't do.

375
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,400
You're begging at the wrong door.

376
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,310
Get up quickly.

377
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,300
How could we have any surplus?

378
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
Even if we did,
that vixen would have taken it all.

379
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,110
That fool of mine,

380
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,640
he's been sneaking things out constantly.

381
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
I keep telling him,

382
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,530
that's a bottomless pit.

383
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,200
That's a poverty hole

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,920
that no amount of food can fill.

385
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,580
But that fool of mine just won't listen.

386
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,590
Why are you glaring at me?

387
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,380
Am I wrong?

388
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,140
Everyone in the neighborhood knows

389
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,050
my Tietou was bewitched by that vixen.

390
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,400
He's lost his mind,

391
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
stealing things from home every other day

392
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,270
to fill that bottomless hole.

393
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,920
Who are you calling a vixen?

394
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,030
You're the vixen!

395
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,550
I've never even seen your grain!

396
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,310
Did you all hear that?

397
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Yinzi's Mother,

398
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,410
do you have any conscience?

399
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,920
After eating so much of our food.

400
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,470
Now both young and old

401
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,120
are denying it, aren't you?

402
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Auntie Tietou.

403
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,750
Your Tietou has been good to us,

404
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,790
and we won't forget that.

405
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,000
She is too young,

406
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,440
and doesn't know how to speak properly.

407
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Please don't take that seriously.

408
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,640
At least you acknowledge that

409
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,510
my Tietou has helped your family.

410
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,250
If you truly appreciate his kindness,

411
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,720
then hurry and find someone

412
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,400
for your Yinzi to marry,

413
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,620
and stop her from seducing my son.

414
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Our Tietou

415
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,140
is now a leader
in the Farmers' Association,

416
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,620
and our family has
permanent tenancy.

417
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,980
No matter how good
our future life will be,

418
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,550
we can't bear the burden
of your poor family.

419
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,440
Are you trying to make my Tietou

420
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,270
a sucker

421
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,310
or a fool?

422
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,590
Keep dreaming!

423
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,240
Mother!

424
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,130
Mother, wake up!

425
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,630
Madams, please!

426
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,320
Help me find my sister.

427
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,660
Go find my sister!

428
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,200
My sister went to dig for wild vegetables
in the west of the village.

429
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,940
Don't worry,
we'll find your sister right away.

430
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,210
She's trying to make a scene
at my doorstep.

431
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,200
All the neighbors have been watching.

432
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,350
This has nothing to do with me.

433
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,570
I didn't even touch you with one finger.

434
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,630
Oh my!

435
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,420
Stop talking. She's passed out.

436
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,850
Hurry, lift her up!

437
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,510
Take her to my room.

438
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,310
If she died in my yard,

439
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,740
wouldn't that be unfair to me?

440
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,950
Take her to my room. Let's go.

441
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,750
Mother!

442
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,520
Auntie, wake up! Auntie!

443
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,200
Mother!

444
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,070
Hurry!

445
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,960
Mother!

446
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,030
Mother!

447
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,030
Drink it up.

448
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,460
This is brown sugar water. Drink more.

449
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,390
Feeling better?

450
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,640
Much better.

451
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,790
Drink up.

452
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,400
Mother!

453
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,350
Yinzi is back.

454
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,030
Sister.

455
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,600
Sister.

456
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,250
Mother.

457
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,640
What's going on here?

458
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,200
Tietou's Mother called you a vixen,

459
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,950
and Mother fainted from anger.

460
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,310
Good thing she didn't die at my doorstep,

461
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,680
if she had died,

462
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,330
how would I clear my name?

463
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,270
Neighbors,

464
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,850
you all witnessed it.

465
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,130
-When she passed by my door…
-I’m fine.

466
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,720
she was still breathing.

467
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,250
What are you trying to do?

468
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,070
What do you want?

469
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,590
You tell me what I want to do.

470
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,270
I want to

471
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,810
find a red-hot poker

472
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,240
to stab that vicious mouth of yours!

473
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Yinzi, stop, Yinzi!

474
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,310
Ning Xiuxiu, look how fierce she is!

475
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,790
You listen to me.

476
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,160
I'll have my Tietou

477
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,690
farm our 13 mu of land properly.

478
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,130
Stop talking.

479
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,130
We'll harvest plenty in autumn.

480
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,960
By the end of the year,
I'll have the matchmaker

481
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,830
find a girl
from a good family for my Tietou.

482
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't worry.

483
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,350
Next year,
he'll bring her home as his bride.

484
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,900
Stop talking.

485
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,010
You should give up this idea,

486
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,610
stop thinking about my son.

487
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,660
My Tietou will never marry you.

488
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,590
Shut your mouth!

489
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,880
You!

490
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,270
Mother.

491
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Since such a scene has been made,

492
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,680
I might as well speak clearly

493
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
in front of everyone.

494
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,660
I, Feng Tietou,

495
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
will marry Yinzi and no one else!

496
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,240
No one can control my affairs,

497
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,460
not even my Mother!

498
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:26,920
You...

499
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,970
You damn boy! You're so disobedient!

500
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,300
You're so disobedient!

501
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,200
Feng Tietou!

502
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Let me tell you.

503
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,000
You'd better give up this idea.

504
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't be such a fool!

505
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,080
You and your mother can rest assured.

506
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,630
I don't want to marry you at all!

507
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,280
Yinzi.

508
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,600
All right, stop saying angry words.

509
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,160
Everyone knows about us.

510
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,150
Don't pull me!

511
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,710
Tietou!

512
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,450
Slap me.

513
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,830
Go ahead and slap me.

514
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,900
Then we'll both feel better.

515
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,550
Come on.

516
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,630
Slap me.

517
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,480
Slap me.

518
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,160
Slap me!

519
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,360
Just slap me!

520
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,080
It's all your fault!

521
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,710
You've made us all lose face!

522
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,170
It's better if she doesn't marry
into our family!

523
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,490
It's all right. It's all right.

524
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,420
It's all right.

525
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,230
Mother.

526
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,530
Let's go home.

527
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,710
Go home and rest.

528
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,080
Thank you.

529
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,200
Let her have some rest.

530
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,720
You're so kind.

531
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,030
Thank you. Thank you.

532
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,400
Here, take this to eat.

533
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,800
Take it home to eat.

534
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,640
Thanks. Thanks.

535
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,000
You're really kind.

536
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,060
Take it home to eat.

537
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,210
You're so kind.

538
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,070
Let's all disperse.

539
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,720
Go home. Take your time.

540
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,120
It's over. Let's go home.

541
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,920
You ungrateful brat!

542
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,310
For that vixen,

543
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,550
you want to split from me, don't you?

544
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,350
Fine! Go ahead, just go!

545
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,280
If you leave, don't ever come back!

546
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,770
You get sleepy whenever you read.

547
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,750
It's so weird.

548
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,270
When I read by myself,

549
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,000
I can't absorb anything at all.

550
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,000
But if you read to me,

551
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,550
I can remember everything.

552
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,420
You want me to read for you?

553
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,310
Just read this for me.

554
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,270
I don't understand this either.

555
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,070
This one?

556
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,240
They both picked up their chopsticks
at the same time,

557
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,900
pointing at the rim of the bowl.

558
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
They smiled sweetly,

559
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,770
eyes locked on each other.

560
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,030
My dear.

561
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,560
Please.

562
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,930
Please you. Eat first.

563
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,040
My dear.

564
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,070
Oh, no.

565
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,880
Please you. Eat first.

566
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,010
What are you saying?

567
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,350
I don't understand a word.

568
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,510
What are you talking about?

569
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,110
Do you mean these sentences?

570
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,530
These sentences

571
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,390
are in English.

572
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,650
It's the language of the British.

573
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,310
In America, Britain,

574
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,680
and several other Western countries,

575
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,110
people all speak this language.

576
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,680
Besides,

577
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,380
English and French

578
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,160
are the current universal languages
of the world.

579
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,350
Then tell me,

580
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
what does it mean?

581
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,710
What does it mean? Explain it to me.

582
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,000
My dear

583
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,110
means loved...

584
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,070
What does it mean?

585
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,640
Well...

586
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Young Master.

587
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,670
Madam wants to see you.

588
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Okay.

589
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,660
You look at this first.

590
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,680
Wendian

591
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,160
can actually speak a foreign language.

592
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,240
Sister-in-law.

593
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,530
How are you feeling?

594
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,980
Should I fetch a doctor for you?

595
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,510
Those people with permanent tenancy

596
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,040
and rent and interest reductions,

597
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,170
have they completed

598
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,590
their contract changes?

599
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,120
All done.

600
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Steward Liu and I did the registration

601
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,330
and changed the contract for them.

602
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,000
Sister-in-law.

603
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,930
I haven't had the chance
to properly thank you.

604
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,590
Thank me for what?

605
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,350
On whose behalf?

606
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,510
For being the first to agree
to permanent tenancy?

607
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,040
For letting you give away
our family fortune?

608
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,030
I don't even know

609
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,090
how to explain this to our ancestors.

610
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,220
The rules have remained unchanged
for all these years.

611
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,450
Why do they have to change
when it's my turn?

612
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,790
You should know that
when we face our ancestors,

613
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,990
I'll be the one who gets blamed, not you.

614
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,040
Sister-in-law.

615
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,440
What's done is done.

616
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,100
Don't worry too much about it.

617
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,230
Besides,

618
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,580
in the future families like ours

619
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,870
will face many more changes like this.

620
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,640
You don't need to worry

621
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
about explaining this to our ancestors.

622
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,270
Because our ancestors

623
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,730
have long turned to dust
and no longer exist.

624
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,700
How dare you!

625
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,580
Go and kneel down by yourself!

626
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,270
Your words dishonor the ancestors.

627
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,200
Fine. Sister-in-law, I'll kneel.

628
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,280
But I need to go out first

629
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,400
to see how happy our tenants are now.

630
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,130
I'll kneel when I get back.

631
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,830
All you care about is their happiness.

632
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,310
What about me and the ancestors?

633
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,520
We sent you to get modern education

634
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,960
and this is what we get?

635
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,990
Wendian.

636
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,720
Where are you going?

637
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm going out for a walk.

638
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,590
I want to ask you

639
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,990
what the foreign language actually means.

640
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,000
Susu.

641
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,900
Would you like to come with me?

642
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,070
For a walk?

643
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,750
Yes.

644
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,770
I'll explain it to you as we walk.

645
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,810
Sure, let's go.

646
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,750
It's kind of you to think that way.

647
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,110
That's why people say

648
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,270
an educated daughter-in-law

649
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,590
is simply different.

650
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,030
In another family,

651
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,330
there might have been a big fight by now.

652
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,830
I know your Father.

653
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,750
He talks tough,

654
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,370
but has a good heart.

655
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,510
In a few days, when he calms down,
everything will be fine.

656
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,810
Your idea of making money and buying land
to please your Father,

657
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,510
you shouldn't think that way.

658
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,840
Look at the world today.

659
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,730
Not to mention a woman like you.

660
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,890
Even strong men find it hard

661
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,270
to make a living.

662
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,270
Mother.

663
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,310
Actually,

664
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,350
when I talked about making money
and buying land,

665
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,680
it was not just to please Father.

666
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,980
I was just thinking, do farmers

667
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,970
have to rely on the little grain
from the fields?

668
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,020
If I really could earn some money,

669
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,550
I wouldn't let Father
live such a frugal life anymore.

670
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,710
Life as a farmer is truly tough,

671
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,700
but it's secure and stable.

672
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
Everyone wants money,

673
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,940
but it's not so easy to earn.

674
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,550
When I was little,

675
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,070
they said that generations ago,

676
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,790
there was a family,

677
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,070
who stopped growing grain on their land

678
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,350
and started growing salvia miltiorrhiza.

679
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,810
That's a kind of medicine.

680
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,900
They earned so much

681
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
that the family

682
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,750
didn't have to worry about money
for generations.

683
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,920
But this angered the heavens.

684
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,270
And a huge fire

685
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,400
burned everything
they had bought and earned to ashes.

686
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,830
This story tells us

687
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,200
that land meant for growing grain
shouldn't be used for other purposes.

688
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,830
Focus on farming. We're farmers.

689
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,790
What else would we do?

690
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,900
That's enough.

691
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,640
I can handle this myself.

692
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,450
Go on with your work.

693
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,380
I need to go feed the chickens.

694
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,420
Go ahead.

695
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,920
Tietou.

696
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,850
Are you busy?

697
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,350
What are you busy with?

698
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,720
This land is mine
under permanent tenancy.

699
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,580
I'll stay right here guarding it.

700
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,160
I'll sleep here night after night,

701
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,030
until the autumn harvest,

702
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,570
until all the grains are stored.

703
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,470
Then I sell them all
and find myself a wife.

704
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,400
I didn't ask about all that nonsense.

705
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
I just want to know

706
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,460
if you're still the head
of the Farmers' Association.

707
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,960
You tell me.

708
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,270
Yes?

709
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,900
That makes things easier then.

710
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
Ning Xuexiang refuses to give me
permanent tenancy.

711
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,090
Are you going to handle this or not?

712
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,040
Refuses to give you permanent tenancy?

713
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,190
I remember he said

714
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,810
he personally went to your home
to handle it?

715
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,830
He did say that,

716
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,560
but he

717
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
changed his mind.

718
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,370
He just changed his mind for no reason?

719
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,110
He said I owe him too much.

720
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,620
He doesn't trust me,

721
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,360
so he refuses to give me
permanent tenancy.

722
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,280
Well, there you go.

723
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,650
If that's what he said,

724
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,550
what can I do about it?

725
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,350
What's the point of coming to me?

726
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,680
When you first established
the Farmers' Association,

727
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,480
you said you'd be the backbone
for farmers like me.

728
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,440
Just do

729
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,830
what needs to be done.

730
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,000
You know that, huh?

731
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,880
Fine, fine. I'll handle it.

732
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,350
But I'm very busy
with Association matters lately.

733
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,440
Wait until I'm free.

734
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,240
Then I'll go ask about it for you.

735
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,350
If I wait until you're free,

736
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,890
I'll starve to death.

737
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,500
Wait until you're free? Really?

738
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,240
Mr. Fei!

739
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,830
If I have permanent tenancy,

740
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,660
isn't that the same as you getting it?

741
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,190
Didn't Yinzi tell you that?

742
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,310
You're still thinking
about my daughter Yinzi?

743
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,410
Coming!

744
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,400
Coming!

745
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,150
Glutton Fei.

746
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,500
Are you here for food?

747
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,070
I'm not here for food.

748
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,680
I'm looking for your Young Master.

749
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,550
He isn't here.

750
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Tell me what you need.

751
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,520
And I'll let him know when he returns.

752
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,350
He really isn't here?

753
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,070
Really not.

754
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,980
Qing?

755
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Who's there?

756
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,680
It's

757
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,440
Glutton Fei. He says he's here
to see the Young Master.

758
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Ask him to come in.

759
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,840
Well then.

760
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,510
Come in.

761
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,250
This way.

762
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,320
This way.

763
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,770
-Mr. Fei.
-Madam.

764
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,610
Wendian isn't at home.

765
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,310
Please tell me what brings you here.

766
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,030
I-I-I...

767
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,840
I do have a small matter.

768
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,720
It's about the Farmers' Association

769
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,270
and

770
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
Ning Xuexiang

771
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,530
and permanent tenancy.

772
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,160
Permanent tenancy?

773
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,700
That piece of land you mentioned
won't work.

774
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,370
It's surrounded by woods, right?

775
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,920
No sunlight gets through.

776
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,070
Besides,

777
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,400
the ground is full of tree roots.

778
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,480
They absorb all the water and nutrients.

779
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,540
It's impossible to grow crops there.

780
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,120
Then we'll grow something
that doesn't need much sunlight.

781
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,350
Stop getting ideas.

782
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,590
Just focus on

783
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,550
taking care of our own land.

784
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,920
Clearing new land isn't easy.

785
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,640
If it were that simple,

786
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,800
we'd have more than just 18 mu of land.

787
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
We'd have 280 mu by now.

788
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,090
I don't believe it.

789
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,590
Ox Temple Village is so big.

790
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,080
There must be some land we can clear.

791
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,210
You're so stubborn.

792
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,440
If it were possible,
wouldn't I have found it already?

793
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
Don't you believe me?

794
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,910
I don't buy it.

795
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,640
I'll find a piece of land,

796
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,070
even if I have to go farther away.

797
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,840
Father. Dajiao. Time to eat.

798
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,020
Come on.

799
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,320
I'll eat inside.

800
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,130
Father!

801
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,880
Father!

802
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,010
Father.

803
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,910
If I can

804
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,310
earn money to buy land for you,

805
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,350
will you talk to me?

806
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,790
You earn money to buy land?

807
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,530
What do you mean?

808
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,510
Did your father and brother allow you
to do business?

809
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,570
You're finally willing to talk to me.

810
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,700
I won't talk about things
that aren't certain yet.

811
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,620
Father.

812
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,070
Earning money doesn't necessarily depend
on the Ning family.

813
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,270
My money-making plan

814
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,310
came from Mother's idea.

815
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,920
Yes, it was my idea.

816
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,790
Just don't know if it'll work out.

817
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,400
Mother.

818
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,390
Before we get any money,

819
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,950
I won't say anything yet.

820
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,810
Father.

821
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,540
Let's eat.

822
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,550
Aren't you going to eat inside?

823
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,240
You're really annoying.

824
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,770
Do you believe I'll hit you?

825
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,870
Alright. Father.

826
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,950
Come on.

827
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,460
What are you and Mother up to?

828
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,980
I said I won't say.

829
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,210
Let's eat first.

830
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,150
Let's eat.

831
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,480
Fine, let's eat.

832
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
Let's eat, Father.

833
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
Ning Xuexiang

834
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,679
refuses to give me permanent tenancy.

835
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,080
I went to see Tietou,

836
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,360
that head of the Farmers' Association,

837
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,920
but he won't help me either.

838
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,760
So I thought of the Young Master.

839
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,670
He is experienced and knowledgeable.

840
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,840
And now he's even a teacher.

841
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,400
He knows about the Farmers' Association.

842
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,150
I just want him to help me seek justice.

843
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,760
Mr. Fei.

844
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,239
I understand everything you've said.

845
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,440
But about seeking justice,

846
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,639
it's not appropriate for Wendian to go.

847
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,550
Mr. Ning is Wendian’s father-in-law.

848
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,969
How could a son-in-law
criticize his father-in-law?

849
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:50,030
Wouldn’t that make you lose face
even if you’re in the right?

850
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,400
This…

851
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,030
Well…

852
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,370
I do have an idea.

853
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,560
Please, go on.

854
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,670
I think you could go to the households

855
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,360
Mr. Ning granted permanent tenancy to.

856
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,190
See how they speak

857
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,150
and act with Mr. Ning.

858
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,870
Then you follow and learn.

859
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,490
In less than three days,
you’ll figure out the way.

860
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,820
Maybe you could have the chance
to be the permanent tenancy.

861
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,670
Would…

862
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,210
would that work?

863
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,940
I don’t know if it will work.

864
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,620
But isn’t it true
there’s no other way now?

865
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,150
Why don’t you…

866
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,280
Try it.

867
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,760
Then I’ll…

868
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,760
I’ll do as you said.

869
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,800
Thank you.

870
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,360
Qing,

871
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,180
pack five jin of millet

872
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,510
for Mr. Fei to take.

873
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,530
Madam, I can’t accept this.

874
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,400
I-I didn’t come for food.

875
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
I just wanted him to get me justice.

876
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,810
You don’t need to be polite to me.

877
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,680
Even though you’re not my tenant,

878
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,540
isn’t it true that one family name
can’t be written in two different ways?

879
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:50,950
Yes.

880
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,570
Even if we live far apart,

881
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,330
we’re still somewhat related.

882
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,510
Whatever I can help with, I will.

883
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,230
Thank you, Madam.

884
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,230
Thank you, Madam.

885
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,780
I’ll definitely do as you said.

886
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,710
Then I’ll take my leave.

887
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,880
I…

888
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,000
It’s not proper, you see...

889
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,130
Take it; it’s from Madam.

890
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,330
Go, I’ll walk you out.

891
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,040
Alright.

892
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,970
Tie it up.

893
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
Dajiao.

894
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,840
Xiuxiu.

895
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,110
It’s me.

896
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,880
My son, Tietou is angry with me.

897
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
He built a shed at the field’s edge.

898
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,500
No matter what, he refuses to come home.

899
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,640
If he doesn’t return,

900
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,440
my family will fall apart.

901
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,710
I beg you, please help me persuade him.

902
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,800
Get him back quickly, will you?

903
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,660
That Tietou…

904
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,760
Tietou.

905
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,550
Tietou.

906
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,320
Tietou!

907
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,400
Dajiao.

908
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,110
It’s so late, why are you two here?

909
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,770
Be Careful.

910
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,890
If your mother hadn’t cried and begged,

911
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,950
we wouldn’t have known you moved out.

912
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,440
Tietou.

913
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,890
To be fair,

914
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,430
this shed you built is quite sturdy.

915
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,390
Not bad, not bad.

916
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,140
Right, Dajiao.

917
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,980
Let me tell you, this beam—

918
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,590
I hauled it down
the mountain all by myself.

919
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,790
Big and small beams, I used over thirty.

920
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,630
We came to persuade him.

921
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,010
Why are you praising him?

922
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,730
Right, right.

923
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,510
Don’t try to persuade me.

924
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,320
No one should.

925
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,580
I’ll stay here guarding my land.

926
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,440
When harvest comes and I earn money,

927
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,070
I’ll marry Yinzi honorably.

928
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,590
By then, my mother will have to accept it.

929
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,070
Whether she wants to or not.

930
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,590
Fine.

931
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,110
Then stay here.

932
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,230
Let’s see how you sleep in the July rains.

933
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,310
Dajiao, come here.

934
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,520
Look.

935
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,890
I plan to cover this with reed grass.

936
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,030
No matter how heavy
the rain, it won’t pool.

937
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,590
You see?

938
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,990
And look here—

939
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,960
the floor,

940
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,550
I built it raised off the ground.

941
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,920
It’s this high, see?

942
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,480
On top, I laid dry grass, soft and warm.

943
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
Why would I fear rain?

944
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,630
Tietou.

945
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,920
If you ask me,

946
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,320
your farming skills are average,

947
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,880
but this shed is really well made.

948
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,660
If you have time, build one for me too.

949
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,080
What,

950
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,730
you’re planning to
fight with Xiuxiu?

951
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,500
Just go home.

952
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,120
Don’t try to persuade me.

953
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,760
You’ll just have to wait

954
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,620
till I bring Yinzi home.

955
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,510
Hey, Glutton Fei.

956
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,800
You’ve followed me for days now.

957
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,530
Can’t you let me eat a good meal?

958
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,110
I didn’t even spare food for my kids,

959
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,280
saved it for the workers,

960
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,210
and you let someone snatch it away.

961
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,150
Everyone thinks we
got permanent tenancy now,

962
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,190
and life is easy.

963
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,330
But isn’t it just for show?

964
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,710
For people to see.

965
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,750
For people to see?

966
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,920
You say...

967
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,650
Ning Xuexiang’s permanent tenancy is fake?

968
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,330
What I just said

969
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,810
was exactly what Li Laosan’s wife told me.

970
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,960
I went to find Ning Youcai’s eldest son.

971
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,800
He

972
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,110
is an honest man,

973
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,410
just does farm work.

974
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,650
He told me

975
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,150
his parents never mentioned

976
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,320
their land being under permanent tenancy.

977
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,580
And those households,

978
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,900
not only were the contracts fake,

979
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
they even got benefits from him.

980
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,850
I have little land,

981
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
and he won’t even give me
that little benefit.

982
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,920
You…

983
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,760
Mr. Fei.

984
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,460
I know everything you’ve said.

985
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,590
If I said I’ll help, then I surely will.

986
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,840
Go back and wait for news.

987
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,760
Alright.

988
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,710
Madam…

989
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,180
the millet…

990
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,840
millet…

991
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,000
I…

992
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,370
I’ll see you out.

993
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:53,770
Go.

994
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,680
That millet…

995
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,150
She’s in good health.

996
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,780
Yes, she is very well.

997
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,230
At this time,

998
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,150
I reckon

999
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,160
they’re sprouting by now.

1000
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,280
I must carefully tell them apart.

1001
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,440
Mother.

1002
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,760
You said that the salvia...

1003
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,860
the bigger it is, the better it works.

1004
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,760
If we dig up seedlings,

1005
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,190
could we plant them
in our own field?

1006
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,520
When they grow big,
we could sell for more.

1007
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,060
Don’t speak nonsense.

1008
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,760
And besides, we don’t have land.

1009
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,190
Even if we did, we can’t plant that.

1010
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,670
Didn’t I tell you that old story?

1011
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,000
That was a disaster, a serious one.

1012
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,630
I only heard it as a child.

1013
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,280
If I didn’t mention it,
I’d have forgotten.

1014
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,710
Tietou.

1015
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,840
Busy?

1016
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,030
My madam is here.

1017
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,250
You…

1018
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,630
looking for me?

1019
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,510
I came to check my land.

1020
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,710
Since granting permanent tenancy,
I haven’t seen it.

1021
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,400
This land Feng Er plowed deep

1022
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,630
really is different.

1023
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,760
The seedlings sprout faster than others.

1024
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,220
Deep plowing is one thing.

1025
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,530
But my sweat drops here,

1026
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,600
I won’t let a single weed grow.

1027
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,950
How could it not be good?

1028
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,230
Yes, I know.

1029
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,090
After all, since it’s permanent tenancy,
if you don’t manage it well,

1030
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,700
I won’t accept it.

1031
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,110
And this land,

1032
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,770
I still have to take it back.

1033
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,670
Because after all, it’s mine.

1034
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,940
Even if we go to the county magistrate,

1035
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,170
I have the reason.

1036
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,960
Madam,

1037
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,670
what do you mean?

1038
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,650
What are you really saying?

1039
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,090
There’s something…

1040
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,940
I don’t know if you,
the head of the Farmers' Association,

1041
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,820
know.

1042
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,660
What thing?

1043
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,160
I heard

1044
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,010
Ning Xuexiang’s permanent tenancy is fake.

1045
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,670
Fake?

1046
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,550
Impossible.

1047
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,710
Right before my eyes,

1048
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,550
the land agent wrote
the permanent tenancy contract.

1049
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,680
I watched it myself.

1050
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,910
No rumor without cause.

1051
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,550
Whether true or false,

1052
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,800
as the Farmers' Association head,

1053
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
you should look into it.

1054
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,400
Because if his permanent tenancy is fake,

1055
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,280
then us with true permanent tenancy,

1056
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
there’s no need to continue either.

1057
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,940
Don’t you think so?

1058
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,360
Mother.

1059
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,870
These seedlings really can be sold?

1060
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,030
These small ones won’t do.

1061
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Look at this root.

1062
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,710
Two or three years old.

1063
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,840
That’s worth money.

1064
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,740
What are you doing?

1065
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,630
Who...

1066
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,160
who are you trying to fight?

1067
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,690
Not your concern.
I’m here for Ning Xiuxiu.

1068
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,320
You know

1069
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,840
why I’m here, right?

1070
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,400
What do you want?

1071
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,860
I’ll call Dajiao to deal with you.

1072
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,070
I’m not afraid of anyone.

1073
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,730
I just want to ask Ning Xiuxiu.

1074
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,730
Your father,

1075
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,110
that fake permanent tenancy
of Old Landlord Ning’s,

1076
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,190
was that your idea?

1077
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,210
Fake permanent tenancy?

1078
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,610
What permanent tenancy?

1079
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,600
What do you mean?

1080
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,290
Still pretending, are you?

1081
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,840
Are you blind?

1082
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,760
Can’t you see she just found out?

1083
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,590
Tietou.

1084
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,760
What’s going on? Tell me.

1085
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,590
Doctor Li, this way.

1086
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,510
Alright, alright.

1087
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,310
Young Master.

1088
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,440
Doctor Li, thank goodness you’re here.

1089
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
What’s wrong, Young Master?

1090
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,140
Please come in.

1091
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,120
Young Mistress was reading in her room.

1092
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,080
When she stood up,
she found blood on the stool.

1093
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,190
Please check on her quickly.

1094
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,150
Alright, alright.
