[This Thriving Land]

2
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,900
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,400
But all the good land
has already been rented.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Renting land is not easy.

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,479
But Susu said

6
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
she might be able to rent a nice plot.

7
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,480
Once we rent the land,

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
Father and I will plant a mu of sesame

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,530
and make sesame oil for you.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,550
Look at you.

11
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,520
Nothing's even in motion yet.

12
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Susu can definitely help with this.

13
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,910
I know this one.

14
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,630
Mandarin ducks playing in water.

15
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,560
So beautiful.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,490
Father, Mother.

17
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,290
Let's eat.

18
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,050
What?

19
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,950
Is there dust on my face again?

20
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,290
No.

21
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,610
Dajiao told us

22
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,560
that you want to

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
rent more good land from Mrs. Fei

24
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,450
for the family.

25
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,370
Your father's been grinning ear to ear.

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,450
Not just grinning.

27
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,270
You can barely see my eyes too.

28
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,950
Xiuxiu, you're really thoughtful.

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,770
Susu is your sister.

30
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,210
If they go to Mrs. Fei together,

31
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,060
how could she not show respect?

32
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,800
Once she shows respect,
she'll give us good land.

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,400
How about this?

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,640
Make two pancakes

35
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,010
so she can eat well and visit her.

36
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,170
Mother.

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,610
I did mention it.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,010
But...

39
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,640
This can't be rushed.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
I have to find the right chance.

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,100
You're sisters. Why do you need a chance?

42
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,680
Don't blame me for overthinking.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,520
Anyone would think twice about this.

44
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
I'm afraid that Mrs. Fei might think

45
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,010
I'm going to collect debts.

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
What debt?

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,380
Does she owe you money?

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,930
Then that's fine!

49
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,450
This...

50
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,960
Let me think about it.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
No, no, no.

52
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,840
After New Year, we have to plow the land.

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,890
T-T-Then...

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,700
H-H-How long will you take?

55
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,770
Listen to Xiuxiu.

56
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,970
Let's eat first.

57
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,930
Let's eat.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,519
Here you go.

59
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,760
After changing the salt,

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,290
don't leave in a hurry.

61
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,220
See what new things I brought back?

62
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,220
What is this?

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,440
Matches.

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,970
What is this?

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,050
A foreign nail.

66
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,680
What?

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,440
What is this?

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
A celluloid comb.

69
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,760
It's very smooth.

70
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,930
Where is this foreign mirror from?

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,200
Why is it so beautiful?

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,650
It's clear and bright.

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,730
It's like a pool of water.

74
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,440
Who is this? So fair.

75
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,440
This is much better than

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
the bronze mirror

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,140
your grandmas gave you as dowry, right?

78
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,400
Take a look, everyone.

79
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,650
Come on!

80
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,440
Take a look!

81
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,290
Let me tell you.

82
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,290
The Northern Expedition Army
will be here soon.

83
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,000
They'll beat the warlords to a pulp.

84
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,420
What does this mean?

85
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,360
It means

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,490
it's hard to say if I can still get goods

87
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,490
in the future!

88
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,320
Next time, even if you want to buy,
you might not be able to.

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,980
The war is going on every year.

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,610
Nothing new, right?

91
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
It's different this time.

93
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,880
The Northern Expedition Army

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,000
will take down Zhang Zongchang this time.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,170
Zhang Zongchang claims to have
200,000 troops.

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,320
We don't know who will win or lose.

97
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,240
What's going on?

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,530
Did you all get it?

99
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,000
Why are you discussing this?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
What I'm trying to say is that

101
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,970
you should

102
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,730
stock up while you can.

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,610
Take a look.

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,800
What's there to stock up?

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,050
Come on, take a look.

106
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,850
Humpback Guo!

107
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,170
Did you change

108
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,700
the millet from Huangcaopo

109
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,050
that I asked for?

110
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,200
I forgot.

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,240
You want a beating?

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Is that possible?

113
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,530
I'd never forget yours.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,140
You came to the right person to buy this.

115
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,200
If you went to someone else,

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
they might trick you

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,050
with millet from other places.

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,770
Hurry, feed King Kong here.

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,440
He'll win

120
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,780
first place for you!

121
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,410
I hope your words come true.

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,120
What?

123
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,560
Second Uncle told you not to fight quail,

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,970
but you're still doing it secretly,
aren't you?

125
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,530
Scoundrel.

126
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,970
I'll tell Second Uncle
and he'll skin you alive!

127
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,880
Miss Susu, my dear Miss Susu.

128
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,140
Please show mercy. Don't tell my father.

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,730
Miss Xiuxiu!

130
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,850
Give it to me.

131
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,910
Ning Kebi!

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
You bastard!

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,050
Put it on my account!

134
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,050
I won't spare you!

135
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,090
Miss Susu.

136
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,800
Doing some New Year shopping?

137
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
Humpback Guo, let me tell you.

138
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm sharp with numbers.

139
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't try to cheat me.

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
How could I? Take a look.

141
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:36,970
Look.

142
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,240
See my foreign sunglasses?

143
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,170
I forgot which country they're from.

144
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,010
When you wear them, the sky turns dark.

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,650
This mirror looks nice.

146
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,930
But they don't look good on you.

147
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,659
As long as they look good on you.

148
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,000
I suddenly remembered something.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,930
I brought you a letter

150
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,390
from the freight station.

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,530
It should be from Mr. Fei.

152
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,610
I forgot to bring it with me.

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,320
How about this?

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,450
I'll sell a bit more.

155
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,290
Come to my place and get it later.

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,490
Let me help you.

157
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I can do it myself.

158
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,560
Old Man.

159
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,240
Buy some matches.

160
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,300
Don't let

161
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,520
our delicate daughter-in-law suffer.

162
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,170
Don't forget to take the letter.

163
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,650
Okay.

164
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,970
See you.

165
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,210
Humpback Guo.

166
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,170
Where did you go this time?

167
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,610
A five-day round trip.

168
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,730
That's fast.

169
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,930
Seven days, a seven-day round trip.

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,650
I wore leather shoes.

171
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,200
My feet hurt so much.

172
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,300
And my old donkey lost weight too.

173
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,880
He suffered a lot with me.

174
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,610
All so I could bring everyone

175
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,320
these

176
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,970
New Year goods, right?

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,290
Food, clothes and necessities.

178
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,800
Pick whatever you want.

179
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,240
Don't rush to sell the goods.

180
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,090
Tell us.

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,610
Tell us about the outside.

182
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,870
This time, I went to the seaside for salt
and New Year goods.

183
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,050
The traders

184
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,490
and fishermen there

185
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,930
are all saying that
the Northern Expedition Army

186
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,240
is unstoppable.

187
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,610
They've taken everything

188
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,140
south of the Yangtze River.

189
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,700
Tell me.

190
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,800
What's so good about
the Northern Expedition Army?

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,120
They're just new rulers.
It's the same as before.

192
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,929
Even if they take down the country,

193
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,409
it has nothing to do with us peasants.

194
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,010
That's right.

195
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,080
The Northern Expedition Army

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,679
is fighting against foreigners

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,289
and those warlords
who collude with foreigners.

198
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,890
Wu Peifu surrendered.

199
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,320
Sun Chuanfang too.

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,170
Only Dogmeat General
and Marshal Zhang are left.

201
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,290
Even if they defeat them,

202
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,140
then...

203
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,600
What's in it for me?

204
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,930
Legend has it that

205
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,980
all the land taxes and military levies

206
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,220
from recent years

207
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,770
will be waived.

208
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,770
Really?

209
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,530
That'd be great!

210
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
I also heard that

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,060
the Northern Expedition Army targets
local tyrants and evil gentry.

212
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,740
What gentry?

213
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,770
You're confused, right?

214
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,370
Never heard the term, have you?

215
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,440
Local tyrants and evil gentry.

216
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,020
Those rich old landlords with hundreds

217
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,900
or even thousands of mu of land.

218
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,910
Those rich old men who

219
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,390
treat poor farmers badly!

220
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,340
They'll get what's coming to them.

221
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,130
When are they coming?

222
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,290
Tell them to come quickly!

223
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,320
Miss Susu!

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,130
Susu, come.

225
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,930
Come in.

226
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,800
I thought you weren't coming
to get the letter.

227
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,720
Have you seen this sea creature before?

228
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,680
Sea creatures? I've eaten them before.

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
Every New Year,

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,960
my brother would put crabs
in the hotpot for freshness.

231
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
That's different.

232
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
I'll use this end for you.

233
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,250
Like this.

234
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,840
Dip it.

235
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,010
This is a sea mushroom from the ocean.

236
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,770
Here, open your mouth.

237
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,720
Is it edible?

238
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,250
It's very fresh.

239
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,930
It's edible?

240
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,770
Hurry up.

241
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,050
One bite.

242
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,930
All in.

243
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,840
All in.

244
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,800
Why's it still moving in my mouth?

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
Of course it is.

246
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
This is a live

247
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,930
eight-legged snake from the ocean.

248
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,170
Look!

249
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,940
You bastard, Humpback Guo!

250
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,600
It's a bit big.

251
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,730
This is a snake?

252
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Stop looking. It's disgusting!

253
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,890
It's so fresh.

254
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,280
Humpback Guo is so annoying!

255
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Miss Susu!

256
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,930
What?

257
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't you think you forgot something?

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,590
I forgot that I came for the letter.

259
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,200
All because of your stupid snake!

260
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
It's my bad.

261
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,200
Have you

262
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,250
seen this?

263
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,040
Chocolate.

264
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,340
Foreign candy.

265
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,960
In the foreign language, it's called

266
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,750
chocolate.

267
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,020
Foreign candy?

268
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,070
It's not alive, is it?

269
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,740
No.

270
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,960
It's alive! Alive!

271
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,530
Ugh!

272
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,500
Try it. It's delicious.

273
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,090
I didn't bring money today.

274
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,010
It's a gift.

275
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,380
At least you've got some conscience.

276
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,960
Sister-in-law.

277
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,130
I've received the letter.

278
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,560
I understand everything.

279
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
Forgive me for leaving
without saying goodbye.

280
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,650
Sister-in-law,

281
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,890
I'm afraid this year

282
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,440
I won't be able to come home
for the New Year like before.

283
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,170
What?

284
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,010
Not coming back for New Year?

285
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,720
Why?

286
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,810
I don't know.

287
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,580
Hurry, read on.

288
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,560
School is busy.

289
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,530
Besides my studies,

290
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,480
I started a course in new poetry writing.

291
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,170
The students are enthusiastic.

292
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,960
I've also become the editor-in-chief

293
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,760
of the school's new poetry club.

294
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Besides these,

295
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,480
my teacher Zhang Chuan

296
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,560
has also arranged internships for us.

297
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,320
We have to go to nearby villages

298
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,110
and live and eat with the farmers.

299
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,950
What kind of work is this?

300
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,600
Going to farmers' homes

301
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,410
to do what?

302
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,890
Sister-in-law.

303
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,960
I feel like I'm changing.

304
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I've found the direction I want to pursue.

305
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,520
I want to be a new master of this era

306
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,050
and continue to control my own fate.

307
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,820
Sister-in-law,

308
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,090
it's almost New Year.

309
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,410
Do you think we should

310
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,820
give some grain to the tenants?

311
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,750
They face so many heavy taxes

312
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,770
and still have to pay rent.

313
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,550
Too many of them are barely getting by.

314
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,080
Giving them some grain
would surely be good.

315
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,680
Of course.

316
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,960
When have I not prepared that for them?

317
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,050
You have no idea

318
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,250
how many households in Ox Temple Village

319
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,770
are waiting for my fried twists

320
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,430
and New Year's Eve dumplings.

321
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,380
Otherwise,

322
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,970
what am I doing here?

323
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,330
Keep reading.

324
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,460
That's all.

325
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,050
That's all?

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,940
There's one last line.

327
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,550
Your foolish younger brother, Wendian.

328
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,080
No.

329
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,130
No mention of you?

330
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,290
Why would he mention me?

331
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,490
I don't know him well.

332
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,840
Sister-in-law, Wendian said in the letter

333
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,600
that he wants to be
a new master of the era.

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
What does he mean?

335
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,360
He's not coming back to be master?

336
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,620
[To Mrs. Fei]

337
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,690
How is that possible?

338
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
If he's not master here,

339
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,370
where can he be master?

340
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,410
It's fine.

341
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,820
The things at school

342
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,440
are just a novelty for him.

343
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,530
Don't worry. Even if he doesn't come back,

344
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,350
we'll still have a proper New Year.

345
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,680
Okay.

346
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,930
Beard Liu!

347
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,560
Coming, Madam.

348
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,410
Young Master sent a letter.

349
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,410
He said he won't come back
for New Year this year.

350
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,740
But we still need to have
a proper New Year.

351
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,010
Get the firecrackers ready.

352
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,890
Prepare more.

353
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,600
Young Mistress joined the family this year

354
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,170
so the firecrackers
must be louder than before.

355
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,440
Yes, Madam.

356
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,320
That's right.

357
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
We'll have a proper New Year.

358
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,680
What are you eating?

359
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,410
Spit it out! Quick!

360
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:41,890
I won't.

361
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,410
Why's your mouth black?

362
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,080
I bought this foreign candy
from Humpback Guo.

363
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,680
What foreign candy?

364
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,290
Do you want some, Sister-in-law?

365
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,930
I don't want it!

366
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,370
It's so black!

367
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,110
It's sweet, with a touch of bitterness.

368
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,040
It's delicious.

369
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,680
This Humpback Guo
is always stirring up trouble.

370
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,170
Uncle!

371
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,170
What treasure are you holding?

372
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,290
It looks like you're about to offer

373
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,290
peaches of immortality
to the Queen Mother of Heaven.

374
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,090
Matches.

375
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,930
What?

376
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,600
Matches!

377
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,320
-You scared me.
-Dajiao!

378
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,370
Your father bought matches!

379
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,650
Father!

380
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,480
You don't have to braid kindling
to light the stove anymore.

381
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,650
Since when are you willing to
splurge on matches?

382
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,370
It's not for your father.

383
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,530
It's for Xiuxiu.

384
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Xiuxiu struggles to get the fire going.

385
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,930
With the matches, it'll be easier.

386
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,290
Thank you, Father!

387
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,530
Xiu, you're amazing.

388
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,770
You were able to get his Second Uncle

389
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,890
to spend money on this foreign thing.

390
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,350
You're really something.

391
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,330
Try it, Xiuxiu.

392
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,780
Mother, you try it first.

393
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,170
I've never done this before,
I wouldn't know how.

394
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,930
You try it.

395
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,600
Try it.

396
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Try it.

397
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,620
Try it.

398
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,580
It's good to have money.

399
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,670
Look how convenient it is.

400
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,050
Indeed.

401
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,010
Can you get some matches for me next time?

402
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,010
These matches are far easier than
having to blow to light the fire.

403
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,250
Alright. Once we get a flame going,

404
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,860
I'll ask Dajiao to bring some to you.

405
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Come on, let's try it.

406
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,930
Let's go in and try.

407
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,650
Let's go. Here.

408
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,840
Let's have a look.

409
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm happy.

410
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,750
Xiuxiu has a place for me
in her heart.

411
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,790
I have a home now.

412
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,130
I'll work with all my strength

413
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,060
for Xiuxiu...

414
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
no, for my parents

415
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,930
and Xiuxiu.
I'll store up more grain for them.

416
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,530
With food,

417
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,720
our days
will become brighter and brighter.

418
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,330
Old pal,

419
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,350
I'm telling you.

420
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,530
I think

421
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,100
Xiuxiu's staying.

422
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,090
When the time comes,

423
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,170
I'll find you a wife too,

424
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,770
to accompany you.

425
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,840
Now that I've burnt paper for you,

426
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,800
I should go back.

427
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,230
I'll go back to accompany Xiuxiu.

428
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,830
I'll bring Xiuxiu with me
to visit you next time.

429
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Bye.

430
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,890
You rascal!

431
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,820
Mother, you're really hitting me?

432
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,080
Stop right there!

433
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,770
Brother! Brother!

434
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,840
I'll kill you!

435
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,720
What now?

436
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,530
Bastard!

437
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,650
Auntie! Auntie! Auntie!

438
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,050
Don't!

439
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,560
Don't stop me!

440
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,050
Don't kill him.

441
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,410
Don't stop me!

442
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,740
He's your son! Your son!

443
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,840
Calm down.

444
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
That little brat.

445
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,720
He's always siding with outsiders.

446
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,760
Every few days,

447
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,190
he's sneaking grain over to Glutton Fei.

448
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,410
Doesn't he care

449
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,089
if his own mother starves?

450
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,569
Auntie,

451
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,569
a bite or two won't starve you.

452
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,450
Next year,

453
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,609
let Tietou

454
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,849
put some real effort into your 13 mu

455
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,220
and get a good harvest.

456
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,280
After the fall, let him marry Yinzi.

457
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,099
Everyone knows that Yinzi

458
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
is handy in both house and field.

459
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,810
She wants to marry into our family?

460
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,810
Dream on.

461
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Tietou will go his whole life unmarried

462
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
before I let him have her.

463
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,780
Auntie,

464
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,530
don't speak so absolutely.

465
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,130
Leave a way out for Tietou.

466
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,960
I will speak absolutely.

467
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,350
I will not leave him a way out.

468
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,070
I can't let him marry

469
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,760
Glutton Fei's daughter.

470
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,480
Didn't you hear that

471
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,020
Glutton Fei is getting his retribution?

472
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,410
A bottomless stomach he can't fill.

473
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,480
In the next life,

474
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
he'll still be starving.

475
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,280
He's done for.

476
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,090
Auntie,

477
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,890
you have to think clearly

478
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,130
about this.

479
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,540
Tietou and Yinzi
have been close since childhood.

480
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,740
Everyone knows that.

481
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,920
Once she's married, she's yours.

482
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
If Glutton Fei keeps lazing around,

483
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,480
that's on him.

484
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,340
Forget about retribution.
Don't worry about that.

485
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,810
You say that now.

486
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,760
If Yinzi marries over,

487
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,610
and her whole family
comes to freeload off me,

488
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,350
do you think I can stand it?

489
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,760
If that's the case,

490
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,260
you can come to my house.

491
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,840
Xiuxiu and I will take care of you.

492
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
Don't go back. Piss them off.

493
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,720
Come on. Let's go home.

494
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,520
That little brat.

495
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,890
If he's got the nerve, don't come back.

496
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,990
What crops are there left to pick?

497
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
By autumn,

498
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,930
who knows how many times
people have already gone over the fields.

499
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,130
All winter long,
people and livestock picked it over.

500
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,650
Even what's buried underground

501
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,810
would have been hauled into burrows

502
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,610
by wild hares and big field rats.

503
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,240
If my siblings weren't starving,

504
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,900
I wouldn't be out here
letting you make fun of me.

505
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm not making fun of you, Yinzi.

506
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,000
I feel bad
you're wasting your effort here.

507
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,850
Stop picking.

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,480
Later,

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,810
I'll dig out a few rats' nests for you.

510
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,210
You'll get more than from scrounging here.

511
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,280
Y-Y-You, look.

512
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,570
Look.

513
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,870
Use it sparingly.

514
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,400
It's enough for three days.

515
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,210
I can't have you
always sneaking grain from home.

516
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,790
Your mother will scold you
if she finds out.

517
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,320
What's a couple scoldings?

518
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,850
Besides, how strong can my mother be?

519
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,720
When she hits me
it's like scratching an itch.

520
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,610
I'm used to it.

521
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,170
Did your mother chase after you
and hit you again?

522
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,520
Let me see.

523
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,040
My mother can't catch up with me.

524
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,610
Let me see. Where is it?

525
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,510
Is it here?

526
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,650
Is it here?

527
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,900
Why? Are you afraid of being seen?

528
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,370
Yinzi.

529
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,520
Do your father know

530
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,980
the cornmeal you bring back is from me?

531
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,520
He doesn't care who it's from.

532
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,520
The moment he sees food, he just grins.

533
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,720
He doesn't say a word
until the bowl's licked clean,

534
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,980
so he won't miss a bite.

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,370
Then my filial piety is going to waste.

536
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,650
My mother knows it's from you.

537
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,990
Yinzi, as you know,

538
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,280
that 13 mu of land
my family owns is fertile.

539
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,130
In past years

540
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,650
most of the harvest went to paying debts.

541
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,930
When spring comes,
I'll put my back into it.

542
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm sure I can send you
betrothal gifts in autumn

543
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,130
and marry you.

544
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,570
You think I care?

545
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,220
Come on.

546
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,570
Let me carry you. Up!

547
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,570
No.

548
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,150
Come up. Just like when we were kids.
Hurry.

549
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,790
No.

550
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,260
I can walk by myself.

551
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,960
Come.

552
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,220
Tietou!

553
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,650
You are my wife!

554
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm dizzy!

555
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,650
My good wife!

556
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,980
Stop spinning, Tietou!

557
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,610
Where is he?

558
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,280
Feng Si.

559
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,960
Feng Si?

560
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,280
Master.

561
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,480
No one is here.

562
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,470
It's New Year soon.

563
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,830
Are they all out celebrating?

564
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,930
No way.

565
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,460
He must be in the house.

566
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,620
Keep knocking.

567
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
Feng Si!

568
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,930
Feng Si!

569
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
Looks like no one's here.

570
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,480
If they've hidden themselves
in this mountain hollow,

571
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,080
we really can't do anything.

572
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,130
I don't believe it.

573
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Let me do it.

574
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,410
Feng Si.

575
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,990
Be good, little rabbit.

576
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,930
Open the door.

577
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,200
Hurry and open. I'm coming in.

578
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,130
Feng Si!

579
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,650
It's New Year's Eve.

580
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,650
Do you have dumplings in your house?

581
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,480
I-I-I want dumplings!

582
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,960
Feng Si, are you making them?

583
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,390
Are you making them
while beating your kids?

584
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,560
No dumplings at home on New Year's Eve.

585
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,240
Are you his real father or not?

586
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,120
Don't play games with me.

587
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,850
Even your father was no match for me. You?

588
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,560
Let me tell you.

589
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Debts must be repaid.

590
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,820
Fifteen silver dollars in total.

591
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,520
If you can't pay me back, Feng Si,

592
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I won't force you.

593
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,170
Just hand over

594
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,390
your 4 mu to me.

595
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,280
Come here.

596
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,200
Feng Si, let me tell you.

597
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
If you don't come out, I won't leave.

598
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,850
I'll just sit here.

599
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,330
You either pay me back

600
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,810
or sell the land.

601
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,660
Matchmaker.

602
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,750
You haven't eaten?

603
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,680
No. You two off visiting?

604
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,920
How's the courtyard?

605
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,950
Don't even ask.

606
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,460
That Ning Xuexiang...

607
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,720
What?

608
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,370
Dajiao.

609
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,480
Ning Xuexiang is here
to collect debts again.

610
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
Same thing every year.

611
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,610
Feng Si is going to have
another terrible New Year's!

612
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,600
Dajiao, you're leaving?

613
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,110
Wait for me here.

614
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,440
Feng Si.

615
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,180
Still no movement, huh?

616
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,650
It's not easy

617
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,250
to come here and collect debts.

618
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm wearing

619
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,460
the big fur coat
from the North Gate today.

620
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,450
We'll see who can outlast who.

621
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Auntie Si!

622
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm Xiuxiu.

623
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,170
I'm here to see you.

624
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,720
Xiu.

625
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,230
There's no one in the yard either.

626
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,440
It doesn't look like New Year's at all.

627
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,330
Auntie Si!

628
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,190
My mother always says,

629
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
us farmers look forward New Year the most.

630
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,720
Once a year,

631
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,870
we need a lucky, united celebration.

632
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,610
My mother also told me

633
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,040
creditors who spare their debtors
during the New Year's

634
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
would be blessed with good fortune
in the coming year.

635
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,200
Your mother said so much to you.

636
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,130
You only remember these two lines?

637
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,570
Your mother also told you

638
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,930
to take care of me

639
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,240
till my passing.

640
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,440
Didn't you hear that?

641
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,720
I'll... I'll do it.

642
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,850
M-M-Miss Xiuxiu.

643
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,180
W-W-What are you doing?

644
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,910
M-M-Master, look.

645
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,570
Master, I'm leaving.

646
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,170
You...

647
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm leaving.

648
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,730
Auntie Si!

649
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm leaving!

650
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,100
It's New Year's.

651
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,930
Eat something nice.

652
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,120
Don't move!

653
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,880
Don't move.

654
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Let me tell you.

655
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,370
That Xiuxiu is better than Er.

656
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,890
She has more of a conscience than Er.

657
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,000
It's too high.

658
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,170
Lower it.

659
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,570
Madam.

660
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,090
I'm back.

661
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,750
Hello, Young Mistress.
Why are you sitting here?

662
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,960
Did you deliver the gifts to the tenants?

663
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,810
Yes, not a single one left out.

664
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,720
Don't worry.

665
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,480
They all said a bunch of thanks to you.

666
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,570
Hurry up and help Qing.

667
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,200
We'll have New Year's Eve dinner
when it's done.

668
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,920
Okay.

669
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,200
You're the Young Mistress
of the Fei family after all.

670
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,330
Why are you sitting here on New Year's?

671
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,370
Sister-in-law.

672
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,680
I miss home.

673
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,960
Every year around this time,
my sister cuts paper window flowers

674
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,370
and puts them on

675
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,950
every window in our house.

676
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,810
You want to cut window flowers?

677
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,240
We've got plenty of red paper.

678
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,130
You can cut whatever you want.

679
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,410
But Susu,

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,890
you have to know that

681
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,240
this is your home now.

682
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,330
Think about it.

683
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,050
Did your mother marry into
the Ning family?

684
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,650
Your sister has married into
the Feng family.

685
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,050
And you've married here.

686
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,000
When it comes down to it, for us women

687
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,890
our husband's home is our home for life.

688
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,570
When Wendian comes back,

689
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,200
when you have children,

690
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,660
you won't think about
those things anymore.

691
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,810
Let's go.

692
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,940
Come inside with me.

693
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,330
I had Xiaoqin

694
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,330
prepare plenty of snacks for you.

695
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,000
Your basket is full.

696
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,170
Tell me if you need anything else.

697
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,810
Here.

698
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,890
Although it's not very delicious,

699
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,720
there are still a couple of dishes.

700
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,330
Look.

701
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,960
There are fried peanuts, boiled peanuts,
fried crispy beans,

702
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,680
and cornmeal-steamed slices of pork.

703
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
How is this not good food?

704
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,300
There's even meat.

705
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,650
And the dumplings.

706
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,930
Don't they have meat stuffing too?

707
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
You asked me

708
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,200
to spend New Year's Eve here.

709
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,200
To be honest,

710
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,130
Tietou and I

711
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,600
didn't know what we'll be eating
for New Year's Eve.

712
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,530
I'll cook dumplings for you later.

713
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,550
Tietou, Dajiao, come.

714
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,680
Let's toast to our three parents.

715
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,890
I wish you good health,

716
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,090
more blessings and fortune.

717
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,520
Fortune!

718
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,810
Come!

719
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,280
Yes.

720
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,930
Father!

721
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,610
Good.

722
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,200
Better and better.

723
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
More fortune in the new year!

724
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,850
These literate toasts
really do sound better.

725
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,770
Your mother is right.

726
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,200
You do know how to live life

727
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,610
in style.

728
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,930
When did my mother tell you that?

729
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,200
In my dream.

730
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:49,850
Eat.

731
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,650
Where are you going?

732
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,780
I have something to do.

733
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,820
Why did he leave?

734
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,680
Let him be.

735
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,090
Let's eat!

736
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,610
Eat!

737
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,370
Come on.

738
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,370
Hurry up and eat.

739
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,280
Hurry up.

740
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,720
No, just one bite.

741
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,680
I want to eat it! I want it.

742
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,130
I want one!

743
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,650
Don't grab!

744
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,890
Don't grab!

745
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,850
Don't move.

746
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,440
Don't move.

747
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,960
If you draw the short straw,
you get a small bite.

748
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,850
If you draw the long straw,

749
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,240
you get a big bite.

750
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,810
Okay, exciting! Okay.

751
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,810
Let's begin.

752
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,670
I-I-I'll draw.

753
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,480
Let the children...

754
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,570
Do it, Father.

755
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,170
Let me try my luck.

756
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,700
Then Father'll draw first.

757
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,850
Short!

758
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,930
Look. It must be long.

759
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,810
Short! Short!

760
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,650
You've chosen?

761
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,720
Yes.

762
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,810
Long, long.

763
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,680
Short.

764
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,720
Short. Short. Short.

765
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
Short!

766
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,130
Take a small bite.

767
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,850
A small bite. I'll break it.

768
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,170
Father!

769
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,040
Father, you cheated!

770
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,850
Father is cheating!

771
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,170
Father, you cheated!

772
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,280
You cheated!

773
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:55,930
Mother.

774
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,330
Here's to you.

775
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,190
Good son.

776
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,040
Well.

777
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,200
Well,

778
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,520
this spring,

779
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,290
I'll plant the fields well.

780
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,110
let's not the debts first.

781
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
After autumn,

782
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,800
help me bring Yinzi home.

783
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,280
Why haven't you given up yet?

784
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,860
What a stubborn young man!

785
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,960
As long as I'm alive,

786
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,650
I won't let you marry Yinzi.

787
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,930
That's a family that will

788
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,610
drag you down to your grave.

789
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,650
You don't know?

790
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm marrying Yin Zi,

791
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,650
not her whole family.

792
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,310
If you marry her,
you'll marry her whole family!

793
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,040
You'll have to carry all their problems.

794
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
I won't let you suffer like this.

795
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
Susu!

796
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,850
Susu!

797
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,810
Susu!

798
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:49,960
Susu!

799
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,560
Uncle Feng Er.

800
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Did I scare you?

801
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,220
Your sister misses you.

802
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,230
Come to my house anytime.

803
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,130
Uncle Feng Er, take some.

804
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,370
Take them back to my sister.

805
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,480
No, it's not appropriate.

806
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,170
It's fine.

807
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,960
It's not appropriate.

808
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,960
Put them in your clothes.

809
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,490
Take them back to my sister.

810
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,090
Thank you, Susu.

811
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,950
Happy New Year.

812
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,620
Over there.

813
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,340
I'm wrong.

814
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,720
I don't want to be alone either.

815
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,410
No one's coming back

816
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,960
on New Year's Eve.

817
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,180
Have you all lost your father?

818
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,930
I've raised them for nothing.

819
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,320
In the future,

820
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,370
don't think you'll even get

821
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,200
half a mu from me.

822
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,720
What about Kejin?

823
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,960
Where is your precious son?

824
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,930
He said he's hiding from
the Qingqi Society

825
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,300
and accompanied his wife
back to her maiden home.

826
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,890
He doesn't care

827
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,170
how his father

828
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
spends New Year's Eve.

829
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

830
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,570
My conscience is clear.

831
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,720
You eat well, drink well,

832
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,190
dress well every day.

833
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,110
I never made you touch a plow

834
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,200
or a hoe, did I?

835
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,730
Five thousand silver dollars.

836
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,650
How much land must be sold

837
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,170
to make that up?

838
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
It's too late.

839
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Besides,

840
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,130
those bandits destroyed your life.

841
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,120
How could you put all the blame on me?

842
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,520
I have to fight these ungrateful brats

843
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,370
to the end.

844
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,449
Let's see who's the real father is.

845
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,409
Kuangzi!

846
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,690
My wife.

847
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,960
Kuangzi stole my wine again.

848
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
He's drunk.

849
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,460
[Memorial tablet of the late Madam Guo
of the Ning family]

850
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,410
I miss you.

851
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,890
What should I do?

852
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Are you drunk?

853
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,410
No.

854
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm just sleepy.

855
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,580
If I'm not sleeping,
you don't sleep either.

856
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,410
We must keep the brazier burning hot,

857
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,560
and guard it for the New Year.

858
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,080
Okay.

859
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
I won't sleep either.

860
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,220
I'll keep you company.

861
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,610
I want to ask you a question.

862
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,720
You have to tell me the truth.

863
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,040
Go ahead.

864
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,120
I never lie to you.

865
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,290
When we were eating, you told me

866
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,440
my mother said I was someone

867
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,250
who could live life in style.

868
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,730
How did you know that?

869
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,810
Only my mother ever said that to me.

870
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,700
But I don't remember you

871
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
ever meeting her.

872
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,650
I've wanted to

873
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,520
tell you this long ago.

874
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,330
You went to rob?

875
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,520
Watch your mouth.

876
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,490
It's New Year. Say something auspicious.

877
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,480
The Fei family gave me this.

878
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,730
Do you want some?

879
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,080
She treated you?

880
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,480
I don't believe it.

881
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,210
Tomorrow, I'm taking Xiuxiu and Dajiao

882
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,470
to the Goddess Temple to pray for a child.

883
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,890
I won't chatter with you.

884
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,120
Go to bed soon.

885
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,640
Xiu.

886
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,550
Before, you were just someone

887
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,370
in a painting to me.

888
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,600
Now that you're by my side,

889
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,080
I think

890
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,850
you are a thousand times better

891
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,650
than the person in the painting.

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,120
I swore to

893
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,600
your mother that

894
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,560
in this life,

895
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,730
I would treat you well.

896
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,370
If you trust me,

897
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,000
then stay.

898
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,330
In this life,

899
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,160
see for yourself

900
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,370
how I treat you.

901
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,340
Okay?

902
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,230
Just the firewood popping.

903
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,900
It's okay.

904
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,730
Father and Mother are watching.
I'm not cold.

905
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,480
Cover up.

906
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,120
Cover up. Catching a cold would be bad.

907
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,730
Get on.

908
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,850
Father, we're leaving!

909
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,480
Go play.

910
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,350
Sister. Brother-in-law.

911
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,960
Uncle and Auntie.

912
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,880
Su Su is here to wish you
a Happy New Year.

913
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,950
-Happy New Year.
-What a kid.

914
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,310
Look at you.

915
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,320
Sister.

916
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,930
Susu is here to see you.

917
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,930
Didn't you say,

918
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,290
even though Mother is gone,

919
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,960
we're still just like when we were little?

920
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,120
That's why I'm the first to give you
a New Year's greeting.

921
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,520
I also want you
to tie a red ribbon in my hair.

922
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,090
Let me tie it for you.

923
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,730
How about

924
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,330
we don't go today?

925
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's go inside and chat.

926
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,040
Where are you going?

927
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,960
Mother said

928
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,000
she'll take us to the temple fair.

929
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,250
I'm taking your sister and brother-in-law
to pray for a child.

930
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,080
They say Goddess Mountain
is very effective.

931
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,730
Mother.

932
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,250
Go, Sister.

933
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,290
I want to go too.

934
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,350
You know I love going to temple fairs.

935
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,940
Mother.

936
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,920
Let's take Susu with us then.

937
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,330
Let's go.

938
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,510
Uncle Feng Er.

939
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:46,840
Here.

940
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,000
-Happy New Year.
-Good child.

941
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,730
Get on.

942
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,410
What?

943
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,400
Don't forget.

944
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,550
Ask for the land.

945
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,220
Stop nagging. We're leaving!

946
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:57,960
Bye, Father!

947
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,690
Bye, Father!

948
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,790
Madam said

949
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,930
we can't accept anything.

950
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,520
Madam said

951
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,730
we can't accept anything.

952
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,560
Thank you.

953
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,370
Don't push.

954
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,850
We can't accept. Don't push.

955
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,480
Madam said we can't take anything.

956
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
Madam said

957
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,060
we won't accept anything
from any household.

958
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,620
Thank you, everyone.

959
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,530
Just take it.

960
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,640
You didn't take anything either.

961
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,160
I didn't take anything.

962
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,290
Thank you.

963
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,440
Madam is here.

964
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,600
Happy New Year.

965
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,960
Everyone is here.

966
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm happy

967
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,330
you came to wish me a Happy New Year.

968
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,730
But I can't accept these.

969
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,340
We sent food to every household
before New Year.

970
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,360
That's been our Fei family tradition

971
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,840
for many years.

972
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,500
It's also so everyone

973
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,890
can have a good New Year.

974
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,890
So you can take

975
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,330
all these things back.

976
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,720
Let the elderly and children
have more food this New Year.

977
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,790
Mrs. Fei,

978
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,060
you really are a living Bodhisattva.

979
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,550
We will never forget

980
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,350
your kindness to us.

981
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Then I'll wish you a Happy New Year.

982
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,540
May Mrs. Fei's family
soon have a child to carry on the incense.

983
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,210
This is good!

984
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,710
Yes, carry on the incense!

985
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,000
I'll wish you all a Happy New Year too.

986
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,060
May you harvest more grain next year.

987
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,160
Thank you, Madam!

988
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,120
Go on, go on.

989
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,360
Thank you, Madam.

990
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,640
Go back.

991
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,400
Carry on the incense.

992
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,030
-Thank you, Madam.
-Okay.

993
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,410
Sister, take this for me.

994
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,080
Can't you eat it when we get back?

995
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
If you eat now,
you'll get wind in your stomach.

996
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,000
No, I can't wait until we get back.

997
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,250
Miss Susu is so real.

998
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,010
What do you mean?

999
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,930
I'm real.

1000
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,580
And the rest of you aren't?

1001
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,540
My mother is praising you.

1002
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,370
She's saying you have a good personality.

1003
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,530
You love to talk and laugh.

1004
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:51,970
Yes.

1005
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:57,850
Sister.

1006
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,810
I feel like that Feng Dajiao's family

1007
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,160
seems to have nothing.

1008
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,890
But after looking around,

1009
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,740
they also don't lack anything.

1010
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

1011
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,210
Here, I peeled peanuts for you.

1012
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,540
Sister.

1013
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,040
Have you and Feng Dajiao done that?

1014
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:14,850
What?

1015
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,020
That...

1016
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,320
You kid, talking nonsense.

1017
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:21,440
Don't ask.

1018
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,080
I'm not a child anymore.

1019
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,770
I'm not young anymore.

1020
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,040
Besides,

1021
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,290
I...

1022
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,480
Today I saw that

1023
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,630
Feng Dajiao is really good to you.

1024
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,210
When he ate that sweet potato,

1025
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,160
he gave you the inside
and only ate the skin.

1026
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,290
He only ate the skin.

1027
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,040
I was a little jealous.

1028
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,730
I was lucky and bumped into Dajiao.

1029
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:44,600
Here.

1030
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,690
Why am I not that lucky?

1031
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,080
Fei Wendian said

1032
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,810
I've sacrificed for marriage.

1033
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,930
Doesn't sacrifice mean death?

1034
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,730
He said all three of us are sacrifices.

1035
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,560
But I see you and Feng Dajiao

1036
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,850
living such a good life.

1037
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,850
He's wrong.

1038
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,250
Life is whatever you make it.

1039
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,000
What sacrifice?

1040
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,610
Don't listen to him.

1041
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,460
Let's not talk about this.

1042
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,180
I want to discuss something with you.

1043
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,810
Go ahead.
