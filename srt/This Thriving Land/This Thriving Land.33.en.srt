[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,280
You left when he was only one month old.

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,280
Hey kid,

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,350
this is your brother.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
He used to hold you when you were a baby.

7
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
You've grown so much.

8
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,790
How did you end up like this?

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
Our troops

10
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,840
were caught in a Japanese raid.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,630
The Japanese caught me.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,990
I barely made it out with a few brothers
during the chaos

13
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,590
and almost starved to death.

14
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,470
Fortunately,

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,940
we ran into the Eighth Route Army.

16
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,000
They rescued us and even gave us money.

17
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,890
That's how I made it back, Father.

18
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,750
Kejin.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
What about Chuan and Lianye?

20
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,520
Chuan

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,160
joined

22
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,150
the China Youth Corps.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,980
He enlisted in the New Fourth Army
in northern Jiangsu

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,840
and is fighting the Japanese now.

25
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,800
Lianye also went to her uncle's place
in northern Jiangsu,

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,730
hoping to be closer to Chuan.

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,520
The three of us

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,060
haven't seen each other for three years.

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,630
Kejin,

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,870
take me with you.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,710
I want to fight the Japanese

32
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,460
alongside my nephew Chuan too.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
You little rascal,

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,740
at least
you've got the family relations straight.

35
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,520
Uncle,

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,090
take me with you too.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,710
And me, I want to go too.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Alright.

39
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,190
Let your uncle talk with Grandpa.

40
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,120
Take your younger uncle to Grandma's room.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,900
Go.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,850
Don't tell anyone
that your uncle has returned.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,870
Come on, Uncle.

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,730
Close the door.

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,280
Kejin,

46
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,579
how long did it take you to get back?

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,060
Almost a month.

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,160
During the day, I had to hide

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,620
from the Japanese and puppet troops,

50
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,810
so I could only travel at night.

51
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,050
Father.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,740
Our troops were being chased and attacked
by the Japanese.

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,280
We had to hide everywhere.

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,520
It was sheer misery.

55
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,310
I've made up my mind.

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,760
Once my wounds heal,

57
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll join the guerrilla fighters.

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,640
I want to join the Communist Party

59
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,500
and fight the Japanese with them.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,910
Kejin,

61
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,940
here's what I think.

62
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,870
I won't stop you
from fighting the Japanese,

63
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,520
but you need to fully recover first

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
before going back.

65
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,850
I see that Xiuxiu's place

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
is quite cramped.

67
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,640
It's not convenient to stay here.

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,690
Why don't you come home with me?

69
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,570
Yinzi can cook some good food

70
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,800
to help you recover.

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,770
Let's go.

72
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's go.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,020
Father.

74
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,970
Father.

75
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,000
You're getting old.

76
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,950
I can't go back and be a burden to you.

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,310
Times are tough now,

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,710
and nobody can know I'm back.

79
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,720
I'll stay here with Xiu.

80
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,310
If anything happens,
I can discuss it with Dajiao.

81
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,750
He's safe at my place.

82
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't worry.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,590
Keyu, remember

84
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,360
to ask your mother to kill the old hen

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,090
and make chicken soup for Kejin
so he can recover.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
My mother raises that hen

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,860
for eggs, which we can trade for salt.

88
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,750
Look at that poverty mindset
from your grandpa's family!

89
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
We're not short of money to buy salt.

90
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,120
Don't you want to hear Kejin's stories
about fighting the Japanese?

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,570
He needs to get better first

92
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,190
before he can tell you all about them.

93
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,720
Alright.

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
You've got such stamina, Father.

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Kejin was already asleep,
but you still didn't want to leave.

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
I missed him.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
You can't understand parenthood
until you have kids.

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,070
Once you raise your own, you'll get it.

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,070
I think I'll be a parent in my next life.

100
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,070
Uncle Xuexiang!

101
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,670
Going to collect manure?

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
What manure?
Do you see any manure baskets?

103
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,110
Then you must be going

104
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,800
to tend your own fields.

105
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,160
You really are strong and healthy.

106
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,160
Feng Niwei,

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,310
Feng Si's son who ran away, has returned.

108
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,000
I,

109
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,050
Niwei,

110
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,790
have grown up

111
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,160
and come back.

112
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,830
I was planning

113
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,360
to bring some gifts

114
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,710
and visit you in the next few days.

115
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,040
What a coincidence running into you here.

116
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,120
Niwei.

117
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,510
I heard you're back.

118
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,510
Good.

119
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,000
It's too late today.

120
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,790
Tomorrow,

121
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,600
I'll have Kuangzi open the door for you.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,190
Uncle.

123
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,950
Uncle.

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
With your kind invitation,

125
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,950
I'll definitely come visit you tomorrow.

126
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,680
But you know,

127
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,040
a chance meeting
is better than a planned one.

128
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,870
Since we're here,

129
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,560
why don't we chat for a bit?

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Let's talk.

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,430
Alright.

132
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,070
Let's talk.

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,970
Uncle Xuexiang.

134
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,880
This time I'm back,
and I don't plan on leaving again.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll stay with my brother

136
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,430
and farm the land
to make a living in the village.

137
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,040
That sounds good.

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,610
I was wondering

139
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,480
if you could return the things

140
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,910
you took from our family.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,200
When did I ever take anything
from your family?

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,730
Busy people are forgetful.

143
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,190
Years ago,

144
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,640
you cheated my grandpa

145
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,330
and my father

146
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,070
out of 20 mu of land. Have you forgotten?

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,560
My brother and I are dirt poor now.

148
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,720
I want to find a wife for my brother,

149
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
but what can we offer?

150
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,070
Your poverty has nothing to do with me.

151
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
If you come begging at my door

152
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,040
and say something nice,

153
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,370
I might give you a couple of steamed buns.

154
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,830
I'm not your father or mother.

155
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,700
Why should I give you any land?

156
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,010
I'm not asking you to give me land.

157
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,560
I'm asking you

158
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
to return the land
you took from my family.

159
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,530
I don't want the seven mu
you tricked my grandpa out of.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,560
But the land you swindled
from my father...

161
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,190
You must give it back to us.

162
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,800
Keyu,

163
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,600
ask Kuangzi to open the door.

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,310
Kuangzi!

165
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,100
Which eye of yours saw me
cheat your father out of his land?

166
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,659
Kuangzi!

167
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,750
Your father begged me

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to buy it from him.

169
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,580
I paid for it,

170
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
and I have the land deed to prove it.

171
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,890
Your father put his own fingerprint on it.

172
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,910
You haven't forgotten

173
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,600
the trick you used

174
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,770
to take land from my family, have you?

175
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,560
On New Year's Eve,

176
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,630
you came to our doorstep,

177
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,200
demanding our land
just because we couldn't give you money.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,260
That I certainly haven't forgotten.

179
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,980
Feng Niwei.

180
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,930
How about this?

181
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,920
Go home first.

182
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,270
This matter can't be settled
with just a few words.

183
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,030
We'll find a trusted middleman later

184
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,910
and sit down to talk things over.

185
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,440
Alright?

186
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,820
A middleman?

187
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,390
Everyone knows

188
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,270
your Ning family runs this village.

189
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,320
Would you look for a middleman
when you do things like that?

190
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,550
Who are you trying to fool?

191
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,150
Don't be so hostile when you speak.

192
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,720
My father said he paid money for the land.

193
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,650
Your father begged my father to buy it,

194
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,240
but now you come demanding it
with empty words.

195
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,150
That's not reasonable, is it?

196
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't you dare bully my father!

197
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,790
My brother fought against the Japanese.
He—

198
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,670
Don't try to dodge your debt

199
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,770
just because of
the Japanese commotion outside.

200
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,000
My father has the deed,

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,780
and you're falsely accusing him
without any evidence.

202
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,310
When my brother returns,
he won't let you off.

203
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,030
Even if Ning Kejin
were standing right in front of me,

204
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,560
I wouldn't be afraid of him.

205
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,890
It's perfectly justified for me
to claim my family's land.

206
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm trying to settle this calmly.

207
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,280
Don't reject the easy way
and force me to do it the hard way.

208
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,030
Let me tell you something too.

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,270
Your family's land

210
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,120
was taken by the Japanese long ago.

211
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,140
If you want the land,
go ask the Japanese for it.

212
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,510
The land you gave to the Japanese

213
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,350
wasn't my family's land at all.

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,070
I'll ask you one last time:

215
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,750
Will you return my family's land or not?

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
Return what? You...

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,030
Give what? Return what?

218
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,260
Feng Niwei, don't go too far!

219
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,150
My father said he paid money
for that land.

220
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,120
If you really want it,

221
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,180
you can buy it back for 100 yuan per mu.

222
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:29,870
I...

223
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,120
Get lost!

224
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,580
Go as far away as possible!

225
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,260
What are you doing?

226
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,030
Why are you still so reckless
even though you've grown up?

227
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,840
Go away.

228
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,240
Ning Susu,

229
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,720
how dare you push me!

230
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,330
I'll remember this.

231
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,130
I'll remember everything.

232
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,720
Xiuxiu.

233
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
Xiuxiu.

234
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,120
Xiuxiu.

235
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,220
Xiuxiu.

236
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,390
Susu, why are you here?

237
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,240
Father asked me
to bring some food for Kejin.

238
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,690
This chicken soup was made by Yinzi.

239
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,030
Have Kejin drink it while it's hot.

240
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,150
And these red dates and other ingredients

241
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,030
are for making porridge for Kejin.

242
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,090
How is Kejin doing?

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,840
He just took his medicine
and went to sleep.

244
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,440
Alright, then I won't go in.

245
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,020
Oh, Xiuxiu.

246
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
We ran into Feng Niwei last night

247
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,870
while Father and I were heading home.

248
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,160
He reeked of alcohol

249
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,390
and demanded
that Father return the land to him.

250
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,120
Neither Father nor I spoke kindly to him.

251
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,840
That man looks like trouble.

252
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,960
Keep a close eye on Kejin.

253
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,240
We can't let Feng Niwei find out
he's here.

254
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,150
Dajiao and I

255
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,210
will move Kejin to the side room soon.

256
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,030
We'll be close by,
so it'll be easier to look after him.

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,630
Dajiao and I will keep watch.

258
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Come here.

259
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,320
Who's there?

260
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,960
Scream!

261
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,640
Go ahead and scream!

262
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,080
Sharp-tongued woman!

263
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm taking you hostage

264
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,540
to trade with your father
for my family's land deed.

265
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,720
Let go!

266
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,950
Let go of me!

267
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,910
This is between the Ning family and me.

268
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,840
Stay out of it!

269
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
Let her go!

270
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,660
Get lost!

271
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,080
Susu,

272
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,200
are you alright?

273
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,610
-Are you alright?
-Humpback Guo.

274
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,590
Humpback Guo!

275
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,050
Feng Niwei!

276
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,060
Go! Get help!

277
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,830
You're calling for help?

278
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,510
Go ahead and ask for help!

279
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,200
Humpback Guo!

280
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,550
Niwei, you little bastard!

281
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,470
Humpback Guo!

282
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
Humpback Guo!

283
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,150
Where is he?

284
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,950
Humpback Guo!

285
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,500
How did it end up like this?

286
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,510
Humpback Guo!

287
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,440
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

288
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,910
Hurry up!

289
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,440
Hurry up!

290
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,890
Hurry up!

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,550
Hurry up!

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,530
Hurry up!

293
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,910
Faster!

294
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,240
How is he?

295
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,630
Xiuxiu.

296
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,720
Xiuxiu.

297
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,970
Humpback Guo

298
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,340
was nearly beaten to death by Feng Niwei.

299
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,770
He was beaten severely.

300
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,630
He almost died from a pneumothorax.

301
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,270
I gave him an acupuncture treatment

302
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,600
and saved him from the jaws of death.

303
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,550
His internal organs
don't have any fatal damage.

304
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,790
Look at his leg.

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Quickly find someone
to put a splint on it.

306
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
That's not my area of expertise.

307
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,630
He could be bedridden for 30 to 50 days.

308
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Thank you so much.

309
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,550
Zhuzi,

310
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,790
go to town

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,670
and find an orthopedist for him.

312
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,650
No need to go to town.

313
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,630
There's one in Guo Village.

314
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,630
I'll go right now.

315
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,860
Thank you, Doctor.

316
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,270
Thank you so much.

317
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,080
No worries.

318
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,560
Dajiao and Tietou

319
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,990
have already gone after Niwei
with a group.

320
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,370
Xiuxiu,

321
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,590
Humpback Guo got hurt because of me.

322
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,630
Taking care of him

323
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,030
will make me feel better.

324
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,970
Who's there?

325
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm Ning Kejin!

326
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,440
You're the one I came to kill!

327
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll get my revenge for my father,
Feng Si, today!

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,910
I didn't kill your father!

329
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,030
Save your breath.

330
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,160
You're crazy!

331
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,069
You've lost your mind!

332
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,130
This is my brother.

333
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,400
Since you've been taking care of
my brother,

334
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,000
you can go.

335
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,030
I'm going to kill him today,

336
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,920
then kill your father to avenge mine.

337
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,680
If you want to kill him,
you'll have to kill me first.

338
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm not afraid of you.

339
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,040
I gave you a chance, but you refused,

340
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,830
so this is on you.

341
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,110
Today I'll finish both of you in one go.

342
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,360
Niwei!

343
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,390
Meiwei!

344
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,900
You're helping outsiders?

345
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,800
Niwei, run.

346
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,310
Why should I run?

347
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,080
I won't let you kill them!

348
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,030
Let go of me!

349
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,750
Help me today,

350
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,560
and we can kill them both.

351
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,110
We'll use their blood
to honor our parents' graves.

352
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,680
Xiu, give me the stick.

353
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll beat him to death right now.

354
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,110
Run!

355
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,950
Kejin!

356
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,370
Kejin!

357
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,770
It's nothing serious.

358
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,820
Just rest well.

359
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Make sure

360
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,510
you don't stretch that wound.

361
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,180
Thank you.

362
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Don't mention it.

363
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,470
Kela and Jiaming are guarding the door.

364
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,400
Bang the gong if anything happens.

365
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,190
Dajiao and Tietou have returned too,

366
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,030
so don't worry.

367
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,550
Kejin,

368
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,590
I've looked everywhere

369
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,820
but couldn't find Niwei.

370
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,430
When we find him,

371
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,310
I'll definitely teach him a lesson.

372
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,310
How's your wound?

373
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,550
It's fine.

374
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,360
On the battlefield,
this would barely count as a scratch.

375
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,590
Xiu,

376
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,440
Dajiao,

377
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,520
I can't stay here anymore.

378
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,750
Staying here
would only bring trouble to you.

379
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm almost healed now,

380
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,270
and I miss Lianye

381
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,680
and Chuan.

382
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,030
I need to find Chuan

383
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,730
and fight the Japanese with him.

384
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,730
I just can't bear to part with Father.

385
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,430
You must take good care of him.

386
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:26,990
Father.

387
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,420
This is far enough.

388
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,100
Take good care of yourself

389
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,750
and wait for me to return.

390
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Kejin's leaving.

391
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,680
His wounds haven't fully healed yet.

392
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I know

393
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,590
he doesn't want to burden us,

394
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,240
and he wants to find his son quickly.

395
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,110
Dajiao says

396
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,610
Kejin has a burning desire

397
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
to fight the Japanese.

398
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,920
He wants to give his all
on the battlefield.

399
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,980
Go home!

400
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,790
Mother,

401
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,690
will Uncle come back again?

402
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,790
Uncle

403
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
will definitely come back again.

404
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,250
After seeing Kejin off,

405
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,640
I secretly shed tears.

406
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Who knows when we'll meet again
after this farewell?

407
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,950
You're adding too much.

408
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,070
Do you need my help?

409
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,710
No need, I can manage.

410
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,800
Take it easy.

411
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,310
Meiwei.

412
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,160
Meiwei.

413
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,640
Feng Zicheng.

414
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,720
Xiuxiu.

415
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,660
You haven't been home for so many days.

416
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,990
I brought you some food.

417
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,330
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

418
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,630
Dajiao has fixed our house,

419
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,150
so I can live at home now.

420
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,890
Can you manage watching the house

421
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,010
all by yourself?

422
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,150
What about your meals?

423
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,640
Xiuxiu,

424
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,840
my brother has wronged you all.

425
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,590
Your brother is your brother,

426
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,510
and you are you.

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,660
Everyone in the village knows

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,880
you're a good kid.

429
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,850
Promise me

430
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,550
you'll come back tomorrow
for your reading lesson, okay?

431
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,670
Okay, Xiuxiu.

432
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,640
I understand everything you said.

433
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,110
I'll definitely go to the lesson
in a few days.

434
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,770
Come home when you're hungry.

435
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,830
Xiuxiu,

436
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,350
I can take care of myself.

437
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,080
Don't worry.

438
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,830
What's wrong?

439
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm wondering

440
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,070
when my wounds will heal.

441
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,620
Why are you in such a hurry?

442
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
You saved my life.

443
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,310
You're my lifesaver.

444
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,810
I'll make sure you're well taken care of
before I leave.

445
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,680
Then I don't want to get better yet.

446
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,210
What kind of nonsense is that?

447
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,050
Let me wipe it for you.

448
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,080
Why are you staring at me?

449
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,680
Susu.

450
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,470
You're so beautiful.

451
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,960
Nonsense.

452
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,040
Close your eyes.

453
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,930
Close them.

454
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,960
I like you.

455
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,310
Susu,

456
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm just a porter.

457
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,070
I've seen all kinds of people in my life,

458
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,730
but you're the only one I like.

459
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,230
Because you're pure,

460
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,920
different from others.

461
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,400
Be with me.

462
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,160
I want

463
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,370
to take care of you for a lifetime.

464
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,960
What are you talking about?

465
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,420
Susu, these past few days,

466
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,350
I've been thinking of you before dawn.

467
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,280
Before you came,

468
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,050
my heart was in my throat.

469
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Now that you're here,

470
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,400
it's racing through my head.

471
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,880
If you don't mind me—

472
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,350
if you don't find me unpleasant—

473
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,380
please let me take care of you.

474
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,070
I won't let you walk alone at night.

475
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,130
Wherever you go, I'll be by your side.

476
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,390
I won't let anyone bully you.

477
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
And I'll never let you

478
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
face anything alone.

479
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,360
If there ever comes a day

480
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,320
when the Japanese bully us
right under our noses—

481
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,370
whether they want to kill or slash—

482
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,640
I'll be the one standing in front of you.

483
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,350
Humpback Guo.

484
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,620
My heart's all in turmoil.

485
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
I... I don't...

486
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,110
Trust me.

487
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,430
I'll do everything to make you happy.

488
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,680
You've really mistaken me
for someone else.

489
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,960
I haven't mistaken you.

490
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,350
You're Wendian's teacher.

491
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,270
How could you not know where he went?

492
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,720
I really don't know.

493
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,510
Wendian.

494
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,030
-Wendian.
-There's something wrong with Mrs. Fei.

495
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,140
-It looks...
-Wendian.

496
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,870
-She kept asking me.
-Wendian.

497
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,270
You're not Wendian.

498
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,720
Are you with Wendian?

499
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,030
School's been over for a while now.

500
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,680
Why hasn't he come home?

501
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,640
I've already prepared dinner.

502
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,400
I don't know.

503
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,510
How could you not know?

504
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,110
Sister-in-law, what's wrong?

505
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,590
Have you seen Wendian?

506
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,440
School's been out for a while.

507
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,880
I've been waiting here for ages

508
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
but haven't seen him.

509
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
Did he take a different path?

510
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
He took a different path.

511
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,720
Sister-in-law.

512
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,680
Wait for me!

513
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,740
Sister-in-law,

514
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,750
let's go home.

515
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Go home?

516
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,860
Wendian hasn't come back yet.

517
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,200
Susu is gone too.

518
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,470
Sister-in-law,

519
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,590
Susu is back.

520
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,030
I'll take care of you.

521
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,890
Let's go home.

522
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,690
Susu.

523
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,550
Susu.

524
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,680
Sister-in-law, I'll go check.

525
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,750
It's me.

526
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,160
How is she?

527
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,920
She still doesn't recognize me.

528
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,450
How did she end up like this?

529
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,030
Here's some millet.

530
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,750
Cook some porridge for your sister-in-law.

531
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,280
Mrs. Fei.

532
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,310
Sister-in-law,

533
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,170
Humpback Guo brought us firewood

534
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,400
and some millet too.

535
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,130
Shall I make you some porridge?

536
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,870
Yes, make some. Wendian loves porridge.

537
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,650
Sister-in-law,

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,110
do you still remember Humpback Guo?

539
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,070
Of course I do.

540
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,070
Guo Guiyao.

541
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,730
You still remember me.

542
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,760
You were Wendian's classmate.

543
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,270
Thanks for bringing the firewood.

544
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,170
Thank you.

545
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,770
I'll go get you some money.

546
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,510
No need, Mrs. Fei.

547
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,110
What are we going to do?

548
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,490
How will she manage all alone?

549
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,790
That's why

550
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,730
I need to come back
and look after her for a while.

551
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,590
I'll help you.

552
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,450
I can take care of the firewood.

553
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,670
Or...

554
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,270
after we get married,

555
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,880
we can take care of her together

556
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
and see her through her old age.

557
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,790
Why are you saying this
in Fei Residence?

558
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,530
You'd better leave now.

559
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,530
Go.

560
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,550
You're pretty sharp, huh?

561
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,640
Oh dear!

562
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,990
What are you trying to do
at the front door?

563
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,880
I've missed you so much.

564
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,790
It's worse when you're at the Fei family
than at the Ning family.

565
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,000
All I needed was to tell Yinzi,

566
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,590
and you could've come out for a bit.

567
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,390
Look at me now.

568
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,840
I've been practicing cat calls
outside all night.

569
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,560
My voice is hoarse now.

570
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,030
Stop meowing. What are you doing?

571
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,560
Let's go.

572
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,770
Where are we going?

573
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,160
To my house.

574
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,880
I'll send you back later.

575
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,510
Hurry up.

576
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm not going.

577
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,170
I don't want

578
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,830
to sneak to your house anymore.

579
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,030
If people in the village find out,

580
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,290
what would they think?

581
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,160
You taking care of me

582
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
is out in the open.

583
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,240
Everyone in the village knows about it.

584
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,360
Why can't you come over now?

585
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,640
You're fully recovered now,

586
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,970
so why should I still go?

587
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,390
You should have said so earlier.

588
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,510
My leg doesn't feel fully healed yet.

589
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,440
Nonsense.

590
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,550
Ouch!

591
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,720
Does it really hurt?

592
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,810
It really hurts.

593
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,930
I need to rest a bit.

594
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,530
You're so annoying!

595
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,040
Don't chase me away.

596
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,070
Or maybe

597
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,760
you could let me go in and rest a bit.

598
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,720
No way,

599
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,030
this is the Fei family's house.

600
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,630
We can't do that kind of thing

601
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,400
here.

602
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,040
What are you talking about?

603
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,360
If it makes you happy,

604
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,740
we can sleep on the ground

605
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,000
and use the sky as our cover.

606
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,070
We can be together

607
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,410
anytime.

608
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,530
Stop talking nonsense.

609
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,720
Just go.

610
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,950
Seeing you once is enough.

611
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,430
It's getting pretty cold at night now.

612
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,510
Your wound has just healed.

613
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,850
Don't catch a cold again.

614
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,090
I'm dressed warmly.

615
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Listen.

616
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
If I leave,

617
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,160
who will take care of my sister-in-law?

618
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,420
I'm worried about her.

619
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,400
Susu.

620
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,880
Actually,

621
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,170
I need to talk to you about something.

622
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,890
What's the matter?

623
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,430
It's cold.

624
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,240
I was thinking about

625
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,160
going on a trading trip.

626
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,920
No way!

627
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,270
It's a war zone—

628
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,310
It's a war zone out there.

629
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,970
What if you run into

630
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,930
Japanese soldiers

631
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,880
or puppet troops?

632
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,790
Hold on, hear me out first.

633
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,720
I've realized

634
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,410
I'm a bit short on money at the moment.

635
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,750
How can I propose without anything?

636
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,310
It's not that I'm afraid of your father.

637
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,270
Well, maybe a little.

638
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,030
But I really have nothing of value
to offer.

639
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,050
Why would your father entrust
such a wonderful daughter

640
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,110
to someone like me?

641
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,290
Don't worry about him.

642
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,290
That won't do.

643
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,170
I can't just marry you
without proper arrangements.

644
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,290
Aside from proposing,

645
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,270
I'll also prepare a house

646
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,830
and all the necessary things

647
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,310
for our marriage.

648
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,830
I want you to have a grand wedding

649
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,270
when you marry me.

650
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,590
No.

651
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,940
You can't go.

652
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,020
I'll be back soon. I won't go far.

653
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,580
I've already packed my things

654
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,930
for the trip.

655
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,680
I just wanted

656
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,700
to see you one more time

657
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,640
before leaving at dawn.

658
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,700
What's wrong?

659
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,300
Why the rush?

660
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,680
I was thinking of leaving early
and coming back soon.

661
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Do you agree?

662
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,710
I promise you

663
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,970
I'll come back soon.

664
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,510
My sister-in-law should be awake by now.

665
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,640
She hasn't been sleeping well lately.

666
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,350
You'd better go in then.

667
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,150
I'm going now.

668
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,200
Humpback Guo.

669
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
You'd better come back soon.

670
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,900
Susu.

671
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,210
Susu.

672
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,230
Susu.

673
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,690
Sister-in-law,

674
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,139
I'm coming right away!

675
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,880
Is Wendian back?

676
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,000
Susu.

677
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm coming, Sister-in-law.

678
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,580
What's wrong? You look pale.

679
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,670
Xiuxiu,

680
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,790
I need to tell you something.

681
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,760
What is it?

682
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,219
Humpback Guo and I are in a relationship,

683
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,230
and I think I'm pregnant.

684
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,710
I haven't had my period
for over two months,

685
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,910
and I've been feeling nauseous lately.

686
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,500
Come on.

687
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,280
Get up.

688
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,200
Sit down.

689
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,670
Really?

690
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm glad to hear that.

691
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,590
Susu,

692
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
you must eat properly now.

693
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,110
Take good care of yourself.

694
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,910
Eat more—make sure you're full.

695
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,230
What did Humpback Guo say about this?

696
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,000
I only found out after he left.

697
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Where did he go?

698
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,760
He said he wanted to earn more money
before proposing to Father,

699
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,050
so he had to go on another trading trip.

700
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,290
So he's planning to propose, huh?

701
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,760
Xiuxiu.

702
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,070
Can I

703
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,840
really keep this child?

704
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,510
Why not?

705
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,590
Tell me,

706
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,230
have you

707
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,100
set your mind on Humpback Guo?

708
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,000
I have.

709
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,030
He can stay with me, care for me,

710
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,760
and be my companion for life.

711
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,220
That makes me feel secure.

712
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,080
Looking back over all these years,

713
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
the one I feel most guilty about

714
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,070
is you.

715
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Back then,

716
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,320
I married into the Feng family
out of spite,

717
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,150
but Dajiao has been truly good to me.

718
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,510
Now I have

719
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,440
Jiaying and Jiaming,

720
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,040
and I feel content.

721
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,150
Look at you, silly girl,

722
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,150
waiting and waiting all these years.

723
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,230
Yet Wendian...

724
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,400
Now,

725
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,010
finally, you have someone
who cares for you.

726
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,640
You must take good care of yourself

727
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,670
while waiting for him
to come back and propose.

728
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,540
This land is like your parents.

729
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,560
You greet it three times a day.

730
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,100
The way you treat your parents

731
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,950
is how you should treat the land.

732
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,720
Don't think the land

733
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,150
just sits silently on the slope.

734
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,030
It senses your intentions

735
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,670
and will reward you

736
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,910
with a good harvest.

737
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,960
Keyu,

738
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,810
you're slacking off again.

739
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
If you don't want to learn,
you don't have to come anymore.

740
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
It's not like I want to be here.

741
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,760
My father made me come.

742
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,470
Since you're already here,
why don't you learn properly?

743
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,240
I won't be a farmer anyway,

744
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,090
so why should I learn to till the land?

745
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,880
Ning Keyu, listen up.

746
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,270
You are who you were born to be.

747
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,820
Since you were born

748
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,330
in Ox Temple,

749
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
into a farming family,

750
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,030
you can't be lazy
or ignorant about farming,

751
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,760
understand?

752
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,630
Right now,
you still have your father's land.

753
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,430
You've never gone hungry,

754
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,360
never lacked anything.

755
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
But what if one day that land is gone?

756
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,080
What if there's no food or drink?

757
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,850
You'll need to know
how to get food from the soil.

758
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,630
You'll need to support not just yourself,

759
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,110
but your parents too.

760
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,990
I won't be a farmer,

761
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,880
so why make me learn farming?

762
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,710
I want to study.

763
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,110
I refuse to farm.

764
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,320
It's one thing for my father to force me,

765
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,720
but you're educated too.

766
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,810
Why are you acting the same way?

767
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,550
It's precisely because I'm educated

768
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,010
that I'm telling you this.

769
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,030
No matter how much you study,

770
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,560
you still need sustenance.

771
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,840
The skills of spring planting
and summer harvesting

772
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,440
can't be learned from books.

773
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,510
If one day

774
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,930
you truly understand all of this,

775
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,440
you'll realize

776
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,630
how close this land is to you.

777
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,030
No matter what you do in the future,

778
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,690
this skill will stay with you,

779
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,490
and you'll never go hungry.

780
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,630
Uncle.

781
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,200
Farming is such a joy.

782
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,230
What you plant in spring
will reward you with grain come autumn.

783
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,510
What's so good about studying?

784
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,840
Just looking at words gives me a headache.

785
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,670
Jiaming,

786
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,880
stop giving bad advice.

787
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
Just farm your land
and mind your business.

788
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,190
Time to eat.

789
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,030
Get up, the food's ready.

790
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,960
Come, have some.

791
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,280
Be good.

792
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,230
When you're done,
make sure you learn properly from Dajiao.

793
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,190
I won't tell Father

794
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,320
about what happened today.

795
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,980
You hear me?

796
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,740
Grab some dried sweet potatoes
for yourself.

797
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,840
Hurry up!

798
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,450
What's going on?

799
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,360
This isn't just about a lack of wheat.

800
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,280
It's an insult to us.

801
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,630
Investigate thoroughly!

802
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,350
Understood!

803
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:01,910
Sir.

804
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,760
Sir.

805
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,550
Sir.

806
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,700
What's this all about?

807
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,450
I don't know either.

808
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,160
Captain Morita said

809
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,840
this isn't about
how much wheat is missing.

810
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,500
It's an insult to our holy war,

811
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,230
and it must be investigated thoroughly.

812
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,960
Understood.

813
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,770
We'll definitely investigate thoroughly.

814
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,600
Ning Xuerui.

815
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,000
Who did it?

816
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,000
The captain has ordered
a thorough investigation.

817
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,320
This wheat is still filling out.

818
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,110
Isn't this just a deliberate provocation
against the Japanese Army?

819
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,860
Administrator Liu,

820
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,760
I can vouch for every farmer

821
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,630
in the village:

822
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,400
No one would ever do such a thing.

823
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,760
This grain is our lifeline.

824
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,400
Who would joke about
something this serious?

825
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,840
Could you kindly check again

826
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,030
to see if it might be

827
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,280
animals

828
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,240
or wild boars causing the damage?

829
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,470
Sir,

830
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,490
it could possibly be animals

831
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,690
or wild boars

832
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,690
that damaged the wheat.

833
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,630
Idiot!

834
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,220
It was done on purpose!

835
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,760
Damn fool!

836
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,990
He says

837
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,410
this was intentional.

838
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,440
Search

839
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,940
the whole village!

840
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,280
Search every corner thoroughly.

841
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,780
You people really know
how to cause trouble.

842
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,000
Sir, it's fine. This way, and over here.

843
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,840
Search!

844
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,160
Who do you think pulled that out?

845
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,800
Everyone in the village knows better

846
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
than to provoke them.

847
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,460
Hurry up, search quickly!

848
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,640
Found it!

849
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,670
It's all here.

850
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,570
Silly Tiao?

851
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,160
She's been caught.

852
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,140
Let's go see.

853
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,320
What happened?

854
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,090
Go back!

855
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,640
Dajiao!

856
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,300
Go back!

857
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,440
Come back!

858
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,630
Let's go back.

859
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,490
Go back.

860
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,150
Go back.

861
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,400
Silly Tiao, when did you hide this?

862
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,890
Let's go.

863
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,970
Go back.

864
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,230
Come.

865
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,250
Stop!

866
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,360
Silly Tiao, don't run!

867
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,000
Don't run!

868
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,320
Bastard!

869
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,710
She has an intellectual disability.

870
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,030
She has an intellectual disability.

871
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,110
Shut up!

872
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,190
Let's go!

873
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,560
Yes, sir.

874
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,600
Let's go!

875
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,510
Silly Tiao...

876
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,440
My Silly Tiao...

877
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,190
-My Silly Tiao...
-Auntie.

878
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,920
Auntie!

879
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,940
Silly Tiao!

880
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,190
Auntie!

881
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,630
How are you?

882
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,960
-Tietou's mother, come on.
-Silly Tiao.

883
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,590
Silly Tiao!

884
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,800
Japanese devils!

885
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,510
May they burn in hell!
