00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,630
What does he mean?

4
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,750
Does he really want to
marry your sister and abandon you?

5
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,680
I don't want to talk about this now.

6
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,090
Xiu.

7
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,680
Tell me the truth.

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,580
You still care about Fei Wendian, right?

9
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,970
He and I...

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,140
It's impossible between us.

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,730
I've given up.

12
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,130
I don't understand those twists and turns.

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,090
And I don't know

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,730
what it means to give up.

15
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,750
All I know is that if you like someone,
then just go all out for him.

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,680
If you don't like him,
then just forget about him.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,079
You can't be vague
and ambiguous like this.

18
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,560
Dajiao.

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
These days,

20
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,720
I've heard

21
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,600
and seen it all,

22
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,490
whether I should've or not.

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,810
I really want to leave this village.

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,860
But I really have no idea

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,880
where to go right now.

26
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,600
If you don't want to keep me...

27
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,820
I'm willing to keep you!

28
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm willing to keep you.

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,820
But you and Fei Wendian

30
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,310
have been that close since you were kids.

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
Can you just ignore him

32
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,650
and leave like that?

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,970
I know.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,720
If Fei Wendian

35
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,060
hadn't continued his studies,

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,940
you would have got married 3 years ago.

37
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,530
Xiu.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
Tell me the truth.

39
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,220
Do you still want to be with him?

40
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,810
It's meaningless

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,260
to talk about this now.

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,880
Last night,

43
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,500
you were talking in your sleep.

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,530
You kept calling his name.

45
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I know

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,710
you still like him.

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,940
You're too embarrassed to ask

48
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,220
what he's thinking,

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,770
and you don't want to ask,

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,890
then I'll ask for you.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,560
Xiu.

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
Your father didn't redeem you.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,610
I understand you're mad at him.

54
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,230
Why does the Fei family

55
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,860
have nothing to do with you?

56
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,070
I'll go ask him.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,600
I want to know
what Fei Wendian is thinking.

58
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,650
Wait for me!

59
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,790
Dajiao.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,450
Fei Wendian!

61
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,170
I was looking for you.

62
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,240
Feng Dajiao.

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,650
I...

64
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,530
What?

65
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,840
The Ning family didn't care about Xiuxiu.

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,970
Why didn't you redeem her and save her?

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,530
You even married her sister!

68
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,790
What are you thinking?

69
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,530
Many things aren't
what you think they are.

70
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,900
Susu and I are innocent.

71
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,840
But it was my fault that day.

72
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,820
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I didn't see the situation clearly,

74
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,510
and delayed the rescue of Xiuxiu.

75
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,090
Xiuxiu has married you.

76
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,330
You must treat her well.

77
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,940
Stand there!

78
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,570
Let me ask you.

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,210
Do you like Xiuxiu?

80
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,790
What difference does it make

81
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,400
if I like her or not?

82
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,360
Now, whenever I think about

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
the humiliation she suffered
in the bandits' lair...

84
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,420
Fei Wendian!

85
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,360
Are you still a man?

86
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,400
Is it Xiuxiu's fault

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,050
that she was kidnapped?

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,620
It's your fault that you didn't save her.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
It's your fault.

90
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,650
How dare you cry?

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,530
I don't know how to face Xiuxiu now.

92
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,280
Do you

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,100
still want to marry Xiuxiu?

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,159
Doesn't she hate me?

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,130
Will she still go with me?

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,330
Well...

97
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,570
I'll tell her.

98
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,850
She's at my house now.

99
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
But you have to

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,240
pick her up before noon.

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,330
Dajiao.

102
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,180
But you can't go empty-handed.

103
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,160
You can't

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,960
just take Xiuxiu away like this,

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,740
without any explanation.

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,040
People will gossip about her.

107
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,890
We can't let her suffer anymore.

108
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,570
What should I do?

109
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,230
You must treat it like a formal wedding,

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
hire a big sedan chair

111
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,659
and a group of trumpeters

112
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,330
to pick up Xiuxiu with drums and gongs.

113
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,210
Then you have to parade around the village

114
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,240
three times

115
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,820
so that everyone in the village

116
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,430
knows that no matter what,

117
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,360
you, Fei Wendian,

118
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,340
have married Ning Xiuxiu in a grand manner

119
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,730
and cleared her name.

120
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,130
Okay.

121
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,840
Okay.

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
I'll go home now.

123
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll hire a sedan chair.

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,850
I'll pick up Xiuxiu.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,130
So I

126
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,210
gave Xiuxiu back to Fei Wendian again.

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm heartbroken,

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,720
but now I'm the only one

129
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,770
who can protect her.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,690
The meat is not bad.

131
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,450
Streaky pork, really good.

132
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,169
Look.

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,120
What a pity.

134
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,330
It's better to be fattier.

135
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
No, it's great.

136
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,520
Hurry up.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Chop the meat and make porridge.

138
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,690
This meat

139
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
is worth 15 mu of land.

140
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
It's worth it.

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
I saw Fei Wendian.

142
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,050
Didn't I tell you? He and I...

143
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,760
It's not what you think, Xiu.

144
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,410
I think

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
there must be some misunderstanding

146
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,910
between you and Fei Wendian,

147
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,640
but I can't explain it clearly.

148
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,330
He'll explain it to you

149
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,600
when he sees you.

150
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,090
But most importantly,

151
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,360
Fei Wendian has hired a sedan chair

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,930
and a group of drummers and gong players.

153
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,220
He will pick you up

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,360
before noon

155
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
and take you to the Fei family.

156
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,330
Also,

157
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,600
I told him

158
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,930
to take you

159
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,900
around the village three times

160
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,760
to make up for
all the suffering you've endured.

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
Will he really come?

162
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,170
Yes.

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
He promised me.

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,790
Dajiao.

165
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,310
Come eat with Xiuxiu.

166
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,990
The meal is ready.

167
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,880
Today is meat porridge.

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,090
Come and eat.

169
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,060
Coming.

170
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,760
Have some.

171
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,570
Fill yourself

172
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,820
and then you can take the sedan chair.

173
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,980
I'm not hungry.

174
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,990
I'll get it for you.

175
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480
Wendian, I'm looking for you.

176
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,930
Have you found a way to send me home?

177
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,450
Susu.

178
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,500
Wait for me.

179
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,580
I have a way to solve your problem.

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,360
Really?

181
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,020
You really have a way to send me home?

182
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,780
Trust me.

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,900
I will definitely let you go home.

184
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,000
Have some.

185
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,500
Meat porridge.

186
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,610
Will Fei Wendian...

187
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,970
really come?

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,880
He promised me

189
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,850
he would come.

190
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,170
Have some.

191
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,050
What did you say?

192
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Feng Dajiao

193
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,760
asked you to bring Xiuxiu back

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
and hire a sedan chair
to go around the village three times?

195
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,240
Yes, Sister-in-law.

196
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,810
We have to do it this way.

197
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,560
And I'm going to
pick her up personally this time.

198
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,730
You went to see Xiuxiu?

199
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,330
Yes.

200
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,390
I ran into Dajiao
when I was looking for Xiuxiu.

201
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,650
He asked me to pick up Xiuxiu before noon.

202
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,850
If you really bring Xiuxiu back,

203
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
I'll be too ashamed to see

204
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,720
the ancestors of the Fei family.

205
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,810
Sister-in-law,

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,050
it was you

207
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
who arranged the marriage
between me and Xiuxiu,

208
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,290
and you've watched us

209
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,890
stay in love all these years.

210
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,140
You know

211
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,590
how important Xiuxiu is to me.

212
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,170
Xiuxiu voluntarily married Feng Dajiao.

213
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,690
Everyone in the village saw it.

214
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,930
She walked into the door
of the Feng family herself.

215
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,130
What reason do you have to go pick her up?

216
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,910
Wendian, this is fate,

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,970
the fate of Xiuxiu.

218
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

219
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,720
Sister-in-law,

220
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,600
you're right.

221
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,940
What's happened to Xiuxiu is her fate.

222
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,840
But I have to tell you

223
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,810
Xiuxiu's fate

224
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,210
is mine,

225
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,330
and I refuse to submit to it,

226
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,330
nor will I let her

227
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,880
be defeated by it.

228
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,220
Sister-in-law, you...

229
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,040
You can disregard my dignity,

230
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,020
the Fei family's honor,

231
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,090
and even the teachings of our ancestors.

232
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,520
But can you think about it?

233
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Do you think those lowly farmers

234
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
aren't scheming?

235
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,050
Feng Er is crazy for land.

236
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,930
He proposed to the Ning family
just for Xiuxiu's dowry.

237
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,210
Never did he expect

238
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,930
she'd refuse it.

239
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,970
Now they have come to their senses

240
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,360
and realised that Xiuxiu cannot stay,

241
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,220
so they asked you to bring her back

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,480
and had you carry her around the village

243
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
three times on a sedan chair.

244
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,720
They really put a lot of thought into it.

245
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,500
Sister-in-law,

246
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,410
what do you mean?

247
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
The Feng family doesn't want her anymore,

248
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,880
nor does Feng Dajiao.

249
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,830
Who would want a woman like her, Wendian?

250
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,690
Go ask anyone on the street.

251
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,750
Who'd marry a woman abused by

252
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,480
so many bandits?

253
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,410
Sister-in-law!

254
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,410
Put your hand on your chest

255
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
and ask yourself.

256
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,770
Are you sure you don't mind?

257
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Are you sure you wouldn't mind

258
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,050
if Xiuxiu were carrying a bandit's child?

259
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,480
I'm telling you today.

260
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,480
If you truly don't mind

261
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,810
and can carry her in a sedan chair,
parading three times around the village,

262
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll arrange your wedding!

263
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,480
Go in.

264
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,970
Go in and tell the ancestors

265
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,060
if you want to take this person.

266
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,290
After that,

267
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,330
decide for yourself

268
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,250
if you still want her.

269
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,220
I'm very anxious,

270
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,710
even more so than the first time
I waited at home for the sedan chair.

271
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,150
Will Wendian really come to marry me?

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,510
Mrs. Fei said

273
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,730
the Fei family wouldn't want
a woman abused by bandits.

274
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
Is he

275
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,660
really going to abandon me

276
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,850
and keep Susu?

277
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,800
When we meet,

278
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,430
I must get to the bottom of these matters.

279
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
But that day,

280
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,350
I waited for a long time.

281
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,780
He didn't come to pick me up.

282
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,980
Madam.

283
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,670
Come in.

284
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,460
Madam.

285
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,340
Do something for me.

286
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,980
It's past noon.

287
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I'll go greet him.

288
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,130
Dajiao.

289
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,310
If he doesn't come,

290
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,740
then so be it.

291
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,680
But why should it be?

292
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,030
He promised me.

293
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,270
I'll go find him.

294
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,390
I, Feng Dajiao, am getting married today.

295
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,740
I'm going to pick up my wife!

296
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm going to marry Ning Xiuxiu!

297
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,870
Dajiao.

298
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,090
Don't go looking for our young master.

299
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,290
He won't see you.

300
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,390
He is very busy.

301
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,820
Why? What is he busy with?

302
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,910
My young master and young mistress
are preparing

303
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,060
to return to her parents' home these days.

304
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,700
A newlywed bride should return to her
parents' home 3 days after the wedding.

305
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,430
Don't you know that?

306
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,940
All right, I'll stop talking to you.

307
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,670
I have to prepare gifts
for the young master,

308
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,980
such as those traditional gifts,

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,430
chickens, fish,

310
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,100
and everything else.

311
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,980
I, Feng Dajiao, am marrying

312
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,020
Xiuxiu!

313
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,310
Feng Dajiao is marrying Ning Xiuxiu!

314
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,870
He's going to pick up the bride.

315
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,150
I am marrying Xiuxiu!

316
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,010
I'm getting married today!

317
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,310
I'm going to pick up my wife!

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,240
Well...

319
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,390
Who is getting married?

320
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,210
Go take a look.

321
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,080
I, Feng Dajiao, am getting married!

322
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,000
Come on, have some wedding pastries!

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,020
Share these with everyone!

324
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,670
Dajiao!

325
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,610
Uncle!

326
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,300
What? Are you going to
get married again today?

327
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,410
Yesterday's wedding doesn't count.

328
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,270
Today is the formal wedding,
with a big sedan chair.

329
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,380
Stop!

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,150
What's wrong, Father?

331
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,680
Where did you get the money?

332
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,720
Can you still live your life
by being so wasteful?

333
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,550
Yes.

334
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
I want to live a good life.

335
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,440
Quiet!

336
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,460
Enough!

337
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,390
Stop talking. Listen to my nephew.

338
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,430
Let him speak.

339
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,190
I, Feng Dajiao, am going to

340
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,700
marry Ning Xiuxiu today.

341
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,570
From today onwards,

342
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,530
Ning Xiuxiu

343
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,180
is my

344
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,730
lawfully wedded wife.

345
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,680
Yes.

346
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm so lucky.

347
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
In a moment, this big sedan chair

348
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,630
will carry my new wife

349
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,630
around the village three times.

350
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,340
I want my wife to marry into

351
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,290
the Feng family in a grand manner!

352
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,620
Bring the sedan chair here!

353
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,560
Let's go!

354
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,880
Send wedding cakes!

355
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,530
Don't grab! Don't rush!

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,530
Let's go.

357
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,230
Get in the sedan chair.

358
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,090
Xiuxiu.

359
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,290
Don't wait for him.

360
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,860
What he can't do,

361
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,900
I can.

362
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm going to make up for all the suffering

363
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,180
you've endured.

364
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,500
Get in the sedan chair!

365
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,530
Get in the sedan chair.

366
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,790
Get in the sedan chair!

367
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,980
Lift the sedan chair!

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,650
Wait!

369
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,420
Xiuxiu.

370
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,810
You are

371
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,720
my lawfully wedded wife.

372
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,220
Today,

373
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,150
let's go around the village

374
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,260
three times in a grand manner!

375
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,070
My wife is afraid of jolts.

376
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,620
Take it easy, everyone!

377
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,770
Okay!

378
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,570
Lift the sedan chair!

379
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,250
Go!

380
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,960
Go!

381
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,070
They're gone.

382
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,250
I just checked.

383
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,410
I didn't lose a penny.

384
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,900
Where did he get the cash?

385
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,270
I don't know.

386
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
Eight bearers carry the big sedan chair,
right to the door!

387
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,530
Steady and smooth,
smoother than a boat ride!

388
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,180
Happy events arrive,
magpies sing to herald joy!

389
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,770
The new couple's joy and blessings
fill the sky!

390
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,290
Next year,
a chubby baby boy they will bear!

391
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,940
The Feng family's days
will be happy and harmonious!

392
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,460
Eight bearers carry the big sedan chair,
right to the door!

393
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,980
Steady and smooth,
smoother than a boat ride!

394
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,570
Happy events arrive,
magpies sing to herald joy!

395
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,290
The Feng family's days
will be happy and harmonious!

396
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,010
Next year,
a chubby baby boy they will bear!

397
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,020
The Feng family's days
will be happy and harmonious!

398
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,810
What?

399
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,220
What did you say?

400
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,290
Feng Dajiao

401
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,490
married Xiuxiu again

402
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,750
with a big sedan chair.

403
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,510
Dajiao really married Xiuxiu

404
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,890
with a big sedan chair,

405
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,630
and carried her
around the village for three times.

406
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,900
Xiuxiu stayed at his place for a night.

407
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,070
Why did he marry her twice?

408
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,790
He was trying to clear Xiuxiu's name.

409
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,240
Now everyone in the village knows

410
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,620
Xiuxiu isn't some girl
who's been abused by bandits

411
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,950
and thus left unwanted.

412
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,650
She is the best.

413
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,410
She's a girl worthy of a big sedan chair

414
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,650
and the most grand wedding ceremony.

415
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,130
I'm afraid you're the only one
in the village who thinks that way.

416
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,640
Dajiao truly wants the best for Xiuxiu.

417
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,510
He did what I couldn't do.

418
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,900
But I've lost Xiuxiu.

419
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,680
Wendian.

420
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,480
Let's think about it another way.

421
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,750
The Feng family only has
a dozen mu of land.

422
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,980
Every year, after paying taxes,

423
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,010
their family only has
enough money left to buy seeds,

424
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,810
just enough to feed themselves.

425
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,250
How could they possibly afford

426
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,490
such a grand wedding?

427
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,800
They were just deceiving you,

428
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,010
but since they failed, they had to
clean up the mess themselves.

429
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,940
Sister-in-law,

430
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,030
we shouldn't always
think the worst of people.

431
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,480
Now that things have come to this,

432
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,650
you shouldn't dwell on it anymore.

433
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,380
From now on,

434
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,450
live a good life with Susu.

435
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,580
Let's just enjoy the New Year

436
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,470
and forget about this matter.

437
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,180
No, Sister-in-law.

438
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm leaving.

439
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,830
I'll leave tomorrow.

440
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,860
Where are you going?

441
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,220
If you leave,

442
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,820
what about Susu?

443
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,740
Sister-in-law.

444
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,140
I have to make it clear to you.

445
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,790
I have to send Susu back

446
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,250
as soon as possible.

447
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,160
What era is it now?

448
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,700
Using Susu to exchange for Xiuxiu?

449
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,970
Uncle Ning is muddled, but we can't be.

450
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,500
Men and women enjoy marriage freedom.

451
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,480
If I hadn't been in love
with Xiuxiu since childhood,

452
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,730
I wouldn't have accepted

453
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,990
this old-fashioned arranged marriage.

454
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,950
Aren't we returning to
Susu's home tomorrow?

455
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,510
I'll send Susu back.

456
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,190
Then I'll go back to school.

457
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,270
Let me think about it.

458
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,490
I'll get you something to eat.

459
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,940
[This Thriving Land]

460
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,460
Look at you.

461
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
A small sedan chair would be enough.

462
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,810
You rascal! You actually
hired a big sedan chair!

463
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,480
And how much did those
wedding pastries cost?

464
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,900
How much?

465
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,860
I could have bought half a mu of land
with that money.

466
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,220
Well,

467
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,770
I didn't get the 15 mu of land.

468
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,770
I even lost the money
for half a mu of land.

469
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,380
Father.

470
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,060
It didn't cost that much.

471
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,570
Where do you draw the line

472
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,970
between much and little?

473
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,600
This is the money I scrimped and saved!

474
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,580
By the way,

475
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,470
where did you get the money?

476
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,880
Anyway, I didn't use the money
you would spend on buying the land.

477
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,420
You've just married your wife,
and now you're getting sharp-tongued, huh?

478
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,900
I'll break your legs!

479
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,980
He just got married,

480
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,660
and you want to break his legs?

481
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,500
What are you doing here?

482
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,440
Go back to your room.

483
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,240
Don't provoke your father here.

484
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,720
Father.

485
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,360
Have some cakes.

486
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,140
You haven't told me
where the money came from.

487
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,770
He never stole or robbed anyone
since he was a kid.

488
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,910
Where did he get the money?

489
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,970
It was all saved up
from doing odd jobs for other people.

490
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,560
He even managed to save up some money!
Look at him!

491
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,220
I was actually angry with you.

492
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,830
But seeing that he truly likes this girl,

493
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,500
I won't say anything more.

494
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,210
We all want what's best
for our children, don't we?

495
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,570
I hired

496
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,180
a sedan chair

497
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,260
without discussing with you.

498
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,050
I know

499
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,940
you did it for my own good.

500
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,700
On my way back today,

501
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,490
I was thinking

502
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,620
I should thank you.

503
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,290
No need.

504
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,560
Since you returned from the bandits' lair,

505
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,960
you've been thanking me.

506
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,310
I did these things not for your gratitude.

507
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,200
I want nothing.

508
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,480
I want nothing.

509
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,590
I know

510
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,580
you want nothing.

511
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,240
My gratitude

512
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,920
is sincere.

513
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,220
Lock the door when you sleep.

514
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm going to find a place to stay.

515
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,860
Dajiao.

516
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,810
You can't leave.

517
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,330
Don't worry.

518
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,610
I have a place to sleep.

519
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,950
I mean...

520
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,850
If you go find a place to stay now,

521
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,090
what will your parents,

522
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,660
and the neighbors say?

523
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,490
You want me to live a peaceful life

524
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,330
in your house, don't you?

525
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,940
I do hope

526
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,060
you can live a peaceful life here.

527
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,730
And we'll figure something out later.

528
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,980
Where there's life,

529
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,530
there's hope.

530
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,900
The only way I can live a peaceful life

531
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,140
is to make your parents and neighbors

532
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,350
believe that we are a real couple.

533
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,730
Once they stop keeping an eye on us,

534
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,960
we'll be able to live a peaceful life.

535
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,620
I see.

536
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,420
I see.

537
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,730
Then...

538
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,530
Dajiao.

539
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,980
You...

540
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,460
Are you awake?

541
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,010
Yes.

542
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,050
I want to thank you.

543
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,250
Thank you

544
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,620
for using a big sedan chair

545
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,210
to clear my name at noon.

546
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,210
Now,

547
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,950
thank you for putting up
this curtain for me.

548
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,420
I told you.

549
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,580
There's no need to thank me.

550
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,620
Madam.

551
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,220
What can I do for you?

552
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,770
Are all the things prepared
for the young mistress's return

553
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,970
to her parents' home?

554
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,530
Yes.

555
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,960
You go with the young master

556
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,570
to the Ning family later.

557
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,900
Dajiao! Dajiao!

558
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,530
The kitchen is on fire!

559
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,930
Don't come over. Let me take a look.

560
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,540
No!

561
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Get out! Get out!

562
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,730
Is everything all right?

563
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,480
It's all right!

564
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,760
It's just smoking.

565
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,020
It's all right.

566
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,330
What did you do, Xiu?

567
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,200
I just wanted to get up early

568
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,860
to make breakfast for you all.

569
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,850
But I couldn't find
the millet and white rice.

570
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,190
Are you all right?

571
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,770
Mother, Xiuxiu threw
a whole armful of firewood

572
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,010
into the stove.

573
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,460
No wonder the smoke and flames got so big.

574
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,060
I couldn't find any matches,

575
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,620
only the chestnut flower braids.

576
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,140
I finally managed to light it,

577
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,940
but I was afraid the fire would go out,

578
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,600
so I threw all the firewood in.

579
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,160
It's not your fault.

580
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,740
You don't cook at home, do you?

581
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,560
In our family,

582
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,460
we always use chestnut flower braids
to light the stove.

583
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,320
We don't have any matches at home.

584
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,630
Don't worry. I'll teach you slowly.

585
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,040
No need to teach me.

586
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,720
Just tell me and that'll do.

587
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,120
Dajiao's wife.

588
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,190
You don't have to do
this kind of work anymore.

589
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,560
If you want to do something,

590
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
do something important.

591
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,260
What do you mean by that?

592
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,090
You don't know?

593
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,130
Let me tell you.

594
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:27,679
Go home and ask your father for the land.

595
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,020
Bring me the deed

596
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,780
to the 15 mu of land.

597
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,770
I don't have a father.

598
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,400
How could you say that?

599
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,650
You don't have a father?

600
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,690
Were you born out of a stone?

601
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,340
You can't say you have no parents.

602
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,530
I don't have a father,

603
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,730
and I don't want that lousy land either.

604
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,810
Lousy land?

605
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,980
It might seem lousy to you,

606
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,420
but to us farmers,

607
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,820
it's our lifeline!

608
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,260
We depend on this land to survive!

609
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,480
Your father only gave 15 mu of land,
which isn't much,

610
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,250
but I accepted it because of you.

611
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,850
Whether you accept it or not

612
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,250
has nothing to do with me.

613
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,740
In my eyes,

614
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,310
that land is nothing but trouble.

615
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,710
It's a death warrant.

616
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,970
I don't want it.

617
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,890
How could she say that?

618
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,150
How could she say that?

619
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,800
Can you stop talking about that land?

620
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,230
If we don't talk about the land,
what else is there to talk about?

621
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,430
Are we just going to
sweep this matter under the rug?

622
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,960
Take it easy. Give her some time.

623
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,580
What's the point of waiting?

624
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,660
What if her puffy-eyed father

625
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,780
changes his mind?

626
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,490
It's no use arguing about it.

627
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,860
It depends on Xiuxiu.

628
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,390
You little brat! You're defending her!

629
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,010
Is it true that if I want to

630
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,610
live peacefully in the Feng family,

631
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
I have to take that land?

632
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
You won't go back to the Ning family;

633
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,530
you won't acknowledge your father;

634
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,330
and you don't want any of his things.

635
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,590
I understand all that.

636
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,820
You can't force someone
to do something they don't want to do.

637
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,940
If my father brings up that land again,

638
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,740
just tell him to come to me for it.

639
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,300
Dajiao!

640
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,050
Dajiao!

641
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,500
Dajiao!

642
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,650
Dajiao!

643
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,050
Zhuzi.

644
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,460
Hurry up!

645
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,260
What's wrong?

646
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,700
My cow is sick.

647
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,610
Hurry up and come with me!

648
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,140
Let's go.

649
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,900
Xiuxiu, are you inside?

650
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,170
Xiuxiu.

651
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,780
Dajiao's father is just like that.

652
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,570
He's completely obsessed

653
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,170
with land.

654
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,050
Don't take it to heart.

655
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,170
We'll talk to him about it later.

656
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,050
I forgot why I came here.

657
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,130
I want to make you a pair of shoes,

658
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,380
a pair of cotton-padded shoes.

659
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,650
I'll make

660
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,210
whatever you like.

661
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,480
Just make it the same as yours.

662
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,860
That won't do.

663
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,480
I only make shoes
for Dajiao and his father.

664
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,990
I don't have your size.

665
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,370
Let me measure your foot.

666
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,390
Sit down.

667
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,780
After I take your measurements,
I'll head over to Granny Zheng’s.

668
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,010
She has many shoe patterns.

669
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,260
All the young girls
and married women in our village

670
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,920
go to her to get shoe patterns.

671
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,940
Come on.

672
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,420
I'll do it myself.

673
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,260
Make a pair of warm and nice shoes

674
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,590
to wear for the New Year.

675
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,730
My goodness!

676
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,430
Look at your foot!

677
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,410
It's really pretty!

678
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,900
Let me sketch this part again.

679
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
And one more touch here.

680
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,910
All right.

681
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,960
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

682
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,610
Thank you.

683
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,900
Don't mention it. We're family.

684
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,030
I'm happy to make a pair of shoes
for my daughter-in-law.

685
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,520
You are so nice to me.

686
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,540
We are all family now.

687
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,860
Don't always say "thank you".

688
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,160
I'm not an outsider.

689
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
Take your time. I'm leaving.

690
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,410
Your feet look pretty.

691
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,210
My goodness.

692
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:56,860
Mother!

693
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm back!

694
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,130
Mother!

695
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,860
You're back?

696
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Don't kick me out.

697
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,900
I've discussed with Mrs. Fei.

698
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,260
Wendian personally sent me back.

699
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,260
I mean, what took you so long?

700
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,260
Susu!

701
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,770
Sister-in-law.

702
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,000
You are so beautiful!

703
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,260
You look like

704
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,560
a whole new person with this outfit!

705
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,760
The fabric is so good.

706
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,300
Is it from Hangzhou?

707
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,450
Mrs. Fei gave it to me.

708
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,940
I didn't want to wear it,
but she insisted.

709
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,170
And this pearl hairpin.

710
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,090
She pulled it from her own head

711
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,970
and put it on me when I was leaving.

712
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,380
Mrs. Fei

713
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,810
really went out of her way

714
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,980
and treated you well.

715
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,240
Wendian, you're here!

716
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,140
Hello, Uncle.

717
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,030
What uncle?

718
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,460
You should change the way you address him.

719
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,590
I'll go find Mother.

720
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,550
Brother-in-law. Come on in!

721
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
Master! Master! Master!

722
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,740
It was sent by

723
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,920
Steward Liu from the Fei family.

724
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,380
Mother.

725
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,420
I'm back.

726
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,260
Xiuxiu is back?

727
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,650
Mother.

728
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,210
I'm Susu.

729
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,820
Susu.

730
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,340
How did you get back here?

731
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,570
Wendian sent me back.

732
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,210
Mr. Fei.

733
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Good boy.

734
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,140
The Ning family is to blame for this.

735
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,780
Aunt,

736
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,610
now that things have come to this,

737
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,940
no one is to blame.

738
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,260
It's just fate.

739
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,650
You need to take good care of yourself.

740
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,900
Uncle.

741
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,210
Aunt.

742
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300
These past few days,
Susu has been staying at my house,

743
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,230
and we've treated her like a guest,

744
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,690
not daring to make the slightest mistake.

745
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,260
However, because Susu and I

746
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,690
have never had

747
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,380
an arranged marriage,

748
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,980
my sister-in-law asked me

749
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,380
to bring Susu back today.

750
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,170
Aunt,

751
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,610
Susu and I are completely innocent.

752
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,860
Mrs. Fei is so thoughtful.

753
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,600
You don't know, do you?

754
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,880
Mrs. Fei even sent a message.

755
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:19,900
What is it?

756
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
Mrs. Fei

757
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,900
sent back both

758
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,260
our dowry list

759
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,900
and your betrothal gift list,

760
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,420
saying that the Fei family
can forgo all of these

761
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,050
except for the 50 mu of land.

762
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,660
Since Susu is already

763
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,230
a daughter-in-law of the Fei family,

764
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,010
if she breaks off the marriage
and remarries,

765
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,870
she would need several times
the amount of dowry to get married again.

766
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,240
These betrothal gifts

767
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,460
can be considered as a gift to Susu.

768
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,650
What? What does Mrs. Fei mean?

769
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,650
What's wrong with your family?

770
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,370
This is a ridiculous matter.

771
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,920
Sending Susu back

772
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,770
is only right and proper.

773
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,450
But Susu is already your wife.

774
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,750
If you send her back,

775
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,050
will she still be able to get married?

776
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,670
Sister-in-law, what are you talking about?

777
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,980
Father asked me
to marry him for my sister.

778
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
What? You didn't go to
rescue my sister before,

779
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,170
so she married Feng Dajiao out of spite.

780
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,610
Now you want to make the best
of a mistake and send me away

781
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,940
so you can save yourselves
the trouble, right?

782
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,600
Mother, they are bullying me!

783
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,300
Come here.

784
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,380
The doctor said

785
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,510
if you want your mother to live longer,

786
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,520
you must not let her worry anymore.

787
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,610
Listen to me.

788
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,100
It won't be good if you come back.

789
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Not to mention
the gossip of the neighbours,

790
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,220
but even at home,

791
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,300
things

792
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,720
won't be the same as
when you were a little girl.

793
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,530
How is it different?

794
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,530
How can it be different?

795
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,980
How can it be the same?

796
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,690
You've married once.

797
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,300
But it wasn't my choice!

798
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,820
Father deceived me!

799
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,300
If I were you, I wouldn't come back.

800
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,500
You stupid cow!

801
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,240
Brother.

802
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,320
You stupid cow!

803
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,380
Who are you to talk here?

804
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,090
What took you so long?

805
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,530
If you keep talking nonsense,

806
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,380
I'll beat you to death!

807
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,820
Kejin. Kejin...

808
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,300
Sister, don't be afraid.

809
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,300
Come to me.

810
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,650
Fei Wendian.

811
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,080
You can't marry Xiuxiu.

812
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,780
What? Are you

813
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,430
going to keep Susu?
