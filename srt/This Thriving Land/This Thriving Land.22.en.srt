[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,920
Heaven really isn't giving us
a way to survive.

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,710
The worst is when it's a gap
between harvests

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,570
and there's a drought on top of it.

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,009
Whatever you fear most always comes true.

7
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,920
Father,

8
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,990
go without worry.

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,060
I'll take care of things here.

10
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,370
No need to hire help
for the permanent tenancy land.

11
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,500
I can farm it myself.

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,010
They say that in the Northeast,

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,190
it's all rich black soil.

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,870
It can grow good crops

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
and produce excellent grain.

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
When the time comes,

17
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,450
I'll return to bring you all there.

18
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,400
You'll have more than enough

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,630
rice,

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,590
flour...

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,910
And steamed buns.

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,630
Father!

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,630
Go back now.

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,480
Go back.

25
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,430
Did you hear me? Go back!

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,590
No crying!

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,050
Look at you, so sick and weak.

28
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,980
Hurry back home!

29
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,590
Father!

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
Listen to your mother

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,000
and take good care of her.

32
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,110
-Father!
-Father!

33
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,560
Mother.

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Be careful.

35
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,630
Look at you, carrying such

36
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,360
heavy things.

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,620
What's wrong, Mother?

38
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,829
He's going up north for work.

39
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,140
The entire family is going hungry.

40
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,180
Your Uncle Fei said he's leaving

41
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,210
so they have one less mouth to feed.

42
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,850
If he does well there and gets some land,

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,450
he'll come back for his wife and children.

44
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,370
So the whole family
will eventually move away?

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,660
They're just taking it one step at a time.

46
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,570
Father!

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,779
Say goodbye to your father.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Father!

49
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,710
Father!

50
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,430
Yinzi.

51
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,000
Here, take this.

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,020
Take it,

53
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,540
Father.

54
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,960
Father.

55
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,430
-Father!
-Father!

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,050
Father!

57
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,950
Come back soon.

58
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,340
Look how stubborn Yinzi is,

59
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,690
not even letting others see her cry.

60
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,360
What kind of life does Yinzi have?

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,890
Her father left,

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
leaving a sick mother at home

63
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,320
with five mouths to feed.

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,050
What kind of life is that?

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
I don't agree.

66
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,930
That land is for growing sorghum.

67
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,500
How can we plant medicinal herbs there?

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,540
What's sorghum?

69
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,630
It's what we use to make the bread
that keeps us from starving.

70
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,270
Good grief, you want to grow herbs.

71
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,390
Can you eat herbs?

72
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,360
Herbs can be sold for money.

73
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,370
Sold for money?

74
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,360
I've never seen it.

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,180
I've never heard of it either.

76
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,780
I've talked about it before.

77
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,760
Last time Mother and I
went to the mountain,

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,930
we dug up to salvia miltiorrhiza
and sold it for 30 cents.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Thirty cents? You...

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
If we grow more, we can sell more.

81
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,840
Let's plant it everywhere.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,550
Then we can earn more money
and buy more land for you.

83
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,520
Oh my goodness,

84
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,240
getting all cozy and dreamy, aren't you?

85
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,620
No way. That land
is only for growing sorghum,

86
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,659
not herbs.

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,070
Stop slamming the table.
You'll scare your grandson.

88
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,210
Don't be afraid, it's okay.

89
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,409
Let's drop the topic.

90
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,160
When I clear up new farmland,

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,420
I'll give two mu of land

92
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,300
to my wife.

93
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,380
She can plant whatever she wants.

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,300
Let's go home.

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,800
What land are you clearing?

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
You think it's that easy
to clear wild land?

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,510
We're leaving now.

98
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,270
Go ahead.

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,410
Don't go clear land tomorrow.

100
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,520
What? You don't believe me either?

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,380
Come with me to town tomorrow.

102
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,560
What for?

103
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,130
Why are there so many pharmacies here?

104
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,830
They're even selling medicine
on the streets!

105
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,920
I often heard Mother talk about

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,680
a place called Tonghe Street

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,340
where they all sell medicine.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,680
From freshly picked herbs

109
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,970
to these dried ones, they have everything.

110
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,100
I just want to see
which herbs sell well

111
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,409
and which quality gets the best price.

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,750
Come take a look!

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,430
Check it out!

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:46,950
This one has good business.
Let's have a look.

115
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,350
[Renhe Clinic]

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,390
Wait a moment, please.

117
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,310
Let me see.

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,440
Okay, just a moment.

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
Sir!

120
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,360
Sir, sir.

121
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,430
Do you buy salvia miltiorrhiza?

122
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,430
Yes, we do. Just a moment.

123
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,870
You do?

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,250
Yes, one moment please.

125
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,830
Just a moment, alright.

126
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,890
Coming right away.

127
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,060
Sorry for the disturbance, everyone.

128
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,360
Hey, buddy,

129
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,630
I just sold you some medicinal herbs

130
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
and you paid me.

131
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,790
I put it in my money pouch,

132
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,690
then I picked up my basket,

133
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,720
and as soon as I turned around,
the money pouch was gone.

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,920
What's going on here?

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm telling you,

136
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,980
I handed the money to you directly,

137
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,940
and you took it,

138
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,420
so don't say I didn't pay you.

139
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,450
You did give it to me,

140
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,960
and I put it in my money pouch,

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,630
but how did the pouch disappear?

142
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,230
It must still be in this room.

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,190
Then please look for it quickly.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Everyone,

145
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,430
my money pouch was stolen by a thief

146
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,670
just moments ago.

147
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
That was money from selling herbs.

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
If I don't bring it back,
my boss will punish me.

149
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,270
Please allow me to search around.

150
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,750
Thanks. Thanks.

151
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
How long do we have to wait?

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,750
I need to get home to cook.

153
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,430
My grandson is waiting.

154
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,430
I only came to buy some ointment.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,390
Why not search me first?

156
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,510
I've got nothing but ointment.

157
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,720
Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,820
I need to hurry home.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,290
Just search everyone
and we'll know who took it.

160
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,750
Exactly.

161
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,430
He's worried because he lost his money.

162
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,450
Let's be understanding
and all search around.

163
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,980
How much money did you lose?

164
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,610
What does the money pouch look like?

165
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,910
Twelve silver dollars from
selling the medicine.

166
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,270
They were in an old leather pouch.

167
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,800
Then let's search quickly.

168
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,880
Thank you.

169
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,330
How about this?

170
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,530
This lady and I will search each other.

171
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,970
Everyone, please watch.

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,530
Thank you, young lady.

173
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,590
I'll search you now.

174
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,220
Brothers, sisters, aunties,

175
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,049
uncles,

176
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,960
sirs,

177
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,630
thank you so much.

178
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,669
Thank you.

179
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,320
Thank you.

180
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,240
Thank you.

181
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,630
Could the two clerks inside

182
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,200
also come out to be searched?

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,390
It would put our minds at ease.

184
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,030
Alright, fine.

185
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,200
Search what?

186
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,270
We never left the counter.

187
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,510
I didn't take his herbs either.

188
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,750
If you can't keep track of your own things

189
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,630
and everyone is like you,

190
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,560
how are we supposed to do business?

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,060
Buddy, you should report this
to the authorities.

192
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,700
Alright.

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,390
Sir, please don't report this.

194
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,760
Go and report it!

195
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,210
Hurry, come out here.

196
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
If authorities get involved,
we'll have to close for half a day,

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,810
and the boss will be furious
about the losses.

198
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,870
What are you doing?

199
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,720
Sir,

200
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,630
if we close,

201
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,510
our losses will be significant.

202
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,870
How about you search me first?

203
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,910
Okay, come on.

204
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,630
Alright?

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,550
Where do you think you're going?

206
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,350
Please don't!

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
He's the one who took it!

208
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,220
This is my money pouch.

209
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,630
This is my money pouch.

210
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,910
What's going on?

211
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,720
What kind of clerk is this?

212
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,100
A thief!

213
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,890
He stole!

214
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,930
Don't move!

215
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Everyone, everyone,

216
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,510
please calm down.

217
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,610
This new clerk

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
was hired temporarily.

219
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,060
I had no idea

220
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,880
he was a thief.

221
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,750
Help,

222
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,390
take him to the authorities.

223
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,000
Everyone, please be witnesses
for our shop.

224
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,560
Take him away.

225
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
Everyone,

226
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,230
thank you, thank you.

227
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,520
Here you go, sir.

228
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,320
My surname is Chang,

229
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,190
and my name is Chun.

230
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Thank you both for helping me just now.

231
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,860
Times are tough these days.

232
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,650
It's rare to meet kind people
like you two.

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
When traveling,

234
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,900
we're bound to meet folks in trouble,

235
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,520
so we help when we can.

236
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,290
I live in a town near Anguo.

237
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,300
You know Anguo, right?

238
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,880
It's been a medicinal herb hub
since ancient times.

239
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,070
Since 1921,

240
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,510
Cao Kun from Zhili

241
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
established a tax bureau

242
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,790
in our

243
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,720
herbal  market.

244
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,630
They set up checkpoints
at every intersection in town,

245
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,320
collecting

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,960
contract taxes and export duties,

247
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,090
squeezing money from herb merchants.

248
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,630
I used to be the shopkeeper's apprentice.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,150
Later, I earned his trust,

250
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,330
and he sent me out to buy and sell herbs.

251
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,080
If I had lost the money this time,

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,570
and the boss thought I'd pocketed it,

253
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
all these years of work
would've been for nothing.

254
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,720
This is

255
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,900
half of my payment.

256
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,670
It's a small token of my gratitude.

257
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,800
We can't accept this.

258
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,880
We're just strangers who met by chance.

259
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
It was fate

260
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,330
that we could help you.

261
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,970
We can't take your money.

262
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,570
Right,

263
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,820
there are many prying eyes out there.

264
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,550
Please put your money away safely.

265
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,230
Don't show off your wealth again.

266
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,200
I can see that

267
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,550
you two are truly kind-hearted people,

268
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,150
so I won't stand on ceremony.

269
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,440
If you ever need me in the future,

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
I'll be there right away.

271
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,500
Just wait a moment.

272
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,960
Look.

273
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,790
I don't have much to give you.

274
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,830
I noticed your husband
takes care of your belly.

275
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,320
You must be pregnant.

276
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,190
This is for your unborn child.

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Just tell them

278
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,160
it's from their uncle.

279
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,670
Well, well,

280
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,290
I'll accept it then.

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,350
I thank you on behalf of my child.

282
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,320
It's beautiful.

283
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,670
Chang Chun,

284
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,680
since you know about herbs,

285
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,390
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

286
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,000
Go ahead.

287
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,590
Are you

288
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,900
familiar with salvia miltiorrhiza?

289
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,530
I heard from my mother-in-law

290
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,240
that my ancestors

291
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,920
used to grow salvia miltiorrhiza.

292
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,880
The soil in our area is suitable,

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,630
but I don't know why

294
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
no one grows it anymore.

295
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,350
Is it because people
don't know how to grow it anymore?

296
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,130
I do know about salvia miltiorrhiza.

297
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,440
It has many uses,

298
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,510
but it's not actually a type of ginseng.

299
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,840
According to Rihuazi Herbal Book,
this salvia miltiorrhiza

300
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
calms the mind,
strengthens willpower,

301
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,030
promotes blood circulation,

302
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,000
treats cold and heat exhaustion,

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
relieves joint pain and paralysis,

304
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,510
drains pus, stops pain,
promotes tissue growth,

305
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,530
breaks up stagnant blood,

306
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,560
replenishes new blood,

307
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,270
stabilizes viable fetuses
and expels dead ones,

308
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,710
regulates women's irregular menstruation
and blood-related anxiety,

309
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,680
and treats malignant sores, scabies,
and all kinds of toxins.

310
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,870
According to Shennong Herbal Book,

311
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,890
this salvia miltiorrhiza

312
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,370
is classified as a superior herb.

313
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,320
It has a bitter taste,

314
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
is slightly cold in nature,

315
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,750
treats evil qi in the chest and abdomen,

316
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,870
relieves intestinal rumbling,

317
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,150
eliminates cold and heat accumulation,
breaks up masses,

318
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,080
stops irritability and bloating,
and nourishes qi.

319
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,970
What you're saying

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,150
is a bit over our heads.

321
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,550
Dajiao,

322
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,220
we've just met a master herbalist.

323
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,000
I wouldn't dare call myself a master.

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I grew up in Anguo since childhood.

325
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,000
My family knew

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,750
I would make this my livelihood,

327
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,840
so they made me
memorize medical books every day.

328
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,670
Would it work
if I grow salvia miltiorrhiza?

329
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,730
Of course it would.

330
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,240
Please tell me more about it.

331
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,540
You asked the right person.

332
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,910
Xiuxiu and I thank you.

333
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,790
This Chang Chun is so kind.

334
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,520
He actually told us to wait at home,

335
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,150
saying he'll bring us the seeds
in half a month.

336
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,100
Half a month from now
is the best planting time.

337
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,190
Xiuxiu,

338
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,340
this is just good karma coming back to us.

339
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,750
Dajiao.

340
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,730
We should set aside some land

341
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,130
to grow medicinal herbs.

342
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,560
I think

343
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,370
I should put in more effort

344
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,670
to clear that Turtle Hill.

345
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
Let's not

346
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,950
tell our parents about this yet,

347
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,260
especially Father.

348
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,270
Let's wait until Chang Chun

349
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,240
brings the seeds

350
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,790
before telling them, okay?

351
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,790
Sure.

352
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,210
No need to make them worry in advance.

353
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,290
Come.

354
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,510
Yinzi,

355
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,790
Tietou is here!

356
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,240
You never tell me anything.

357
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Your father went to the Northeast,

358
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
and I was the last to know.

359
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,240
Let me do it.

360
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,290
Isn't that Yinzi and the others?

361
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,360
Tietou!

362
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,790
Yinzi, look!

363
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,210
It's Xiuxiu and Dajiao.

364
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,490
Dajiao!

365
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,680
Xiuxiu,

366
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,140
let's go help them.

367
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,630
Come.

368
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,750
Take your time eating these.

369
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,810
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

370
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,160
Go play over there, but don't go too far.

371
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,760
Okay.

372
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,510
I was just thinking

373
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,430
that apart from our land,

374
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,830
we have nothing else.

375
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,360
So,

376
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,600
we need to figure out a way

377
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,440
to make money from the land.

378
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,910
Crops don't count.

379
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,010
Those are just to fill our bellies.

380
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,570
There must be another way.

381
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,550
After coming back from town with Dajiao,

382
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,600
I feel even more motivated.

383
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,270
Xiuxiu,

384
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,840
I believe you can do it.

385
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,930
Even though my family only has

386
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,840
two mu of land,

387
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,690
I plan to set aside 30 percent

388
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,360
to grow salvia miltiorrhiza with you.

389
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,420
That's wonderful!

390
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,800
Xiuxiu, you rest here.

391
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,130
I'll get you some water.

392
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,550
Dajiao,

393
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,650
want some water?

394
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,610
I'm not thirsty.

395
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm thirsty!

396
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,470
Get it yourself.

397
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,650
Xiuxiu.

398
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,870
Thank you,

399
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,550
Yinzi.

400
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,900
These are what Dajiao and I

401
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,350
brought back from town.

402
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,470
Take them home

403
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,590
for your brother and sisters.

404
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,730
Thank you, Xiuxiu,

405
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,430
for always thinking of us

406
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,360
and coming specially to help.

407
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,670
No need to thank me.

408
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,790
We're family.

409
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,600
I know.

410
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,650
You...

411
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
You don't like asking for help.

412
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You always try to
handle everything yourself.

413
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,600
But sometimes,

414
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,080
men's work should be done by men.

415
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,870
Being so stubborn

416
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,600
only makes life harder for yourself.

417
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,810
People strive for dignity,
fire for flames,

418
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,210
and Buddha for incense.

419
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,710
You're right, Xiuxiu.

420
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,030
I was born stubborn.

421
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,600
But this family of mine

422
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,890
doesn't allow me to be stubborn.

423
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,100
Actually, things aren't that bad.

424
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,890
I just pray

425
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,140
my mother gets better

426
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,170
and my siblings have enough to eat.

427
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,080
Things will get better.

428
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,550
There will be a way.

429
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,080
Xiuxiu,

430
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,930
I'm not good with words,

431
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,109
but I really enjoy talking with you.

432
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,950
It's like you have
a bright flame inside you

433
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,190
that gives your words and actions

434
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,430
such strength

435
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
and hope.

436
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,790
When I'm with you,

437
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,710
I feel brighter inside too.

438
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,510
If that's true,

439
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,160
I'll gladly share this flame with you,

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,819
so we can both shine together.

441
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,010
Let's shine together.

442
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,550
Hold on.

443
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Young lady,

444
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,230
let me ask you something.

445
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,920
Do you know Guo Guiyao?

446
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,310
You know,

447
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,160
that salt peddler Humpback Guo?

448
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,030
Yes, I do.

449
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,000
Where is he?

450
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,490
His house is over there.

451
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Dajiao!

452
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,180
It really is you!

453
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,130
Xiuxiu, who's this?

454
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,640
What brings you here?

455
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I don't know.

456
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,270
I ran into you
before I even entered the village.

457
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,200
Where's Xiaohu?

458
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It's a long story.

459
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
Let me have some water first.

460
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,190
My wife has water. Xiuxiu!

461
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,820
Don't move. I'll do it.

462
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,400
I'll do it.

463
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,770
Is that the wife from the rich family?

464
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,700
How did you know?

465
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
I heard about it from Guo Guiyao.

466
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,920
Does she know how to farm too?

467
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,270
Yes, she's very good at it.

468
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,130
She's getting better as she goes.

469
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,660
Water.

470
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,320
Here, miss,

471
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,600
some water for you.

472
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,510
Thank you.

473
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,530
Who is this person?

474
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,710
If I'm not mistaken,

475
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,720
you must be Sister-in-law, right?

476
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Yes.

477
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,740
This is my wife Xiuxiu.

478
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,200
Hello.

479
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, Dajiao,

480
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,440
why don't you introduce me to your wife?

481
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,500
Introduce you?

482
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,040
How should I do that?

483
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,120
I only know your name is Lulu,

484
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,000
and you have a brother named Xiaohu.

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,330
That's all I know.

486
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,550
So you're deliberately trying to
make it seem

487
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,830
like we're not close
in front of your wife?

488
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,940
But we really aren't close.

489
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,770
We're not?

490
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,540
Are we?

491
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,880
Then that night
when you were at my place...

492
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,790
Xiuxiu,

493
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,440
Tietou and I are going to plow that field.

494
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,040
Call us if you need anything.

495
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Go ahead.

496
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Miss,

497
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,990
you met Dajiao

498
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,190
when he was peddling in Qingkou, right?

499
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,030
Dajiao has mentioned Xiaohu to me,

500
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,890
saying that Xiaohu

501
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,170
was Guo's temporary helper there.

502
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,350
But Dajiao never mentioned you to me.

503
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,920
Perhaps he was saving that for later.

504
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,380
Miss,

505
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,380
are you here looking for someone

506
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,780
or just passing through?

507
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,020
Xiaohu is close to Guo,

508
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,370
so you must be close to Guo too, right?

509
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:05,890
Oh yes,

510
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,370
they're very close.

511
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,480
Aren't you looking for Humpback Guo?

512
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,940
I'll take you to him later.

513
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,000
Alright.

514
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,300
Since I'm here,

515
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,580
I should say hello to him.

516
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,370
Dajiao,

517
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,990
since you know each other,

518
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,550
all who come are guests.

519
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,980
Let's finish plowing.

520
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,910
Then he'll hitch up the ox
to take you there.

521
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,330
Don't you have a horse?

522
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,330
Yinzi, I'll leave this here for you.

523
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,450
Alright.

524
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,170
I'll take you there
after I finish plowing.

525
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,240
Humpback Guo!

526
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,000
Humpback Guo!

527
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,920
We're here.

528
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:44,800
Lulu.

529
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Xiu, stay there.

530
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,550
We'll head home after dropping her off.

531
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,160
Lulu, why did you come here?

532
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,240
Thank you.

533
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,680
Dajiao,

534
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,110
Miss Xiuxiu.

535
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,270
Guo,

536
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,610
this girl was looking for you,

537
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,870
so we brought her here.

538
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,240
She's in your hands now,

539
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
so we're leaving.

540
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,120
Hey, wait—

541
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,680
Go ahead.

542
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,760
You're leaving after dropping me off,

543
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,560
like you're just dumping cargo?

544
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,210
We're leaving now.

545
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,590
Dajiao!

546
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,590
Well...

547
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,880
Let's go.

548
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,850
Come on!

549
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,840
Stop the car.

550
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,480
What's wrong?

551
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,120
Why are we stopping here?

552
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
I think this spot is good.

553
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,920
Good for what?

554
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,710
It's shady here.

555
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,660
It might help clear your head

556
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,830
and it's perfect for us to
have a little chat.

557
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,500
Xiuxiu,

558
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,960
can't we talk at home?

559
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm starving.

560
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,900
You really want to talk about this
in front of our parents?

561
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,480
Talk about what?

562
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,550
Her.

563
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,200
That Lulu.

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,810
What's with her?

565
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,580
I really don't know why she's here.

566
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,480
I really don't know her well.

567
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,500
Then start from the beginning,

568
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,030
from the first time you met.

569
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,250
The village

570
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,240
doesn't have many vacant houses left.

571
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,100
I've been searching everywhere.

572
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,490
This one is the most suitable.

573
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,830
You just said you like Dajiao?

574
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,880
Don't joke with me.

575
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,880
Who's joking?

576
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,510
I'm serious.

577
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,640
When did you start liking him?

578
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,890
How did I not notice?

579
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,680
The first time you brought him
to hear me sing,

580
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,830
I noticed

581
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,590
he was different
from the other men in the audience.

582
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,590
He was the only one

583
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,610
who wasn't trying to take advantage of me.

584
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,410
You all can listen. I'm leaving.

585
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
Later, Xiaohu was arrested.

586
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
Dajiao came to see me,

587
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,280
saying he wanted to help rescue Xiaohu.

588
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,170
Guiyao said

589
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,770
Xiaohu would be released in a few days.

590
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,530
But every time I close my eyes,
I see Xiaohu's face

591
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,960
I can't sleep at all.

592
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,200
I still owe him two bags of salt.

593
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,450
I must find a way to save him.

594
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
For the first time,

595
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,800
I felt warmth from a stranger.

596
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
When Dajiao learned that Xiaohu and I
had no family

597
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,150
and that we had to do these things
to survive,

598
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,680
he even left money for me.

599
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,610
I can't buy this pot anymore.

600
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,550
I have no money left.

601
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,480
Dajiao!

602
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,640
Later...

603
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,350
Xiaohu?

604
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,510
Dajiao accompanied me
to the customs office

605
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,830
and ransomed Xiaohu out.

606
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,430
You didn't listen to me sing,

607
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,250
so I won't take your money.

608
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,960
Xiaohu didn't want Dajiao to leave.

609
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,600
Neither did I.

610
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
In my heart,

611
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,380
I couldn't forget him anymore.

612
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,310
I've been in this part of society

613
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,830
for so many years now.

614
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,090
I've never met a man like Dajiao

615
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
before.

616
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
After sending Xiaohu to Qingkou,

617
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,510
I came here.

618
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,030
Let me tell you,

619
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm dead set on this, like a turtle

620
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
that swallowed a weight.

621
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,350
Is that all?

622
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,150
Do you trust me so little?

623
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,610
Anyone with eyes can see what's going on.

624
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,940
Then why didn't you just ask her just now?

625
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,660
How could I?

626
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,160
I didn't want to talk to her too much

627
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
in front of you.

628
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,370
I was afraid it would upset you.

629
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,810
You're quite thoughtful.

630
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,940
Xiuxiu, let's go home.

631
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,200
Sit properly.

632
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,160
We'll live our own life.

633
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,820
She can do whatever she wants.

634
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,310
Dajiao!

635
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,070
I asked around

636
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,300
and heard you were at Turtle Hill.

637
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,030
Why is this soil so rocky?

638
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
Is this land even usable?

639
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,980
You must have too much energy to burn.

640
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,060
Dajiao?

641
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,890
Dajiao,

642
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,040
does your family need more land?

643
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Why are you clearing this rocky patch?

644
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
Land doesn't bite your hands.

645
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,740
Land feeds people.

646
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,920
The more the better.

647
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,790
I think

648
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,680
your family must be short on land.

649
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,400
Otherwise, who would bother

650
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
fighting with these rocks here?

651
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,430
How about I buy you some land?

652
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
I brought money with me.

653
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,380
Tell me,

654
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,500
how much do you want?

655
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,720
I can't promise the good stuff,

656
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
but I can afford 4, 5, 6, or 7 mu

657
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,510
of decent land.

658
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,070
Why would I want your land?

659
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,520
Why do you think?

660
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,330
I can't and I shouldn't take your land.

661
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,960
Why can't you take it?

662
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,610
If you ask me,

663
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
even if you come here,

664
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,700
I can't chase you away.

665
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
This Ox Temple Village

666
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
doesn't belong to me.

667
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,790
So please listen to me.

668
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,000
Stay for a couple of days
and then leave quickly.

669
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,310
Where am I supposed to go?

670
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,550
Where you go is your choice.

671
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,750
Just don't stay here.

672
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm not leaving.

673
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,790
I'm sticking with you.

674
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,370
You won't leave? Then I will.

675
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,060
Dajiao!

676
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,020
Don't follow me!

677
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,680
Slowly.

678
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,890
Dajiao?

679
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,570
Where are you going?

680
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,640
I'm hungry,

681
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,900
so I'm going back home to eat.

682
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,110
Why didn't you take the shortcut?

683
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,200
Why did you come around
the back of the mountain?

684
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,460
I was just checking...

685
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,840
Why did you come up this way?

686
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,030
Your father told me

687
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,350
to check if there's any land

688
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,410
on the back that could be cultivated,

689
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,610
so I came around this way.

690
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,210
None of that land is any good.

691
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,320
It doesn't get enough sunlight

692
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,950
and there are too many rocks.

693
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,080
Xiuxiu told me that your plot of land

694
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,170
is almost cleared.

695
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,130
I'm going to take a look.

696
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,590
Father!

697
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,490
Go ahead.

698
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,510
I'll show you the way.

699
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,160
This way.

700
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,440
Be careful.

701
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
Xiu, watch your step.

702
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,990
Not bad!

703
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,800
You carried this soil
up here all by yourself?

704
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,530
Good job.

705
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,640
That's my son.

706
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,360
Now then,

707
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,520
you go eat first,

708
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,950
and when you're done,

709
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,040
I'll work with you.

710
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,310
Look how happy your father is.

711
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,550
His eyes are shining.

712
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
You're amazing! This is wonderful.

713
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,270
Since Father approves, I feel at ease.

714
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,160
Ever since

715
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,680
your father inherited the 18 mu of land
from your grandfather,

716
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,270
he's been constantly wondering

717
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,110
when we could reach 20 mu.

718
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,270
Our family has 18 mu of land now.

719
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,670
If we develop this area a bit more,

720
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
we can easily get another two mu.

721
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,640
We can proudly tell everyone

722
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,510
that our family has 20 mu of land!

723
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,250
Our Feng family

724
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,830
has 20 mu of land now!

725
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,680
This is our family's!

726
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,590
Twenty mu!

727
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,830
Mu!

728
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,440
Mu!

729
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,110
Just listen to that.

730
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,840
Just listen.

731
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,350
Twenty mu.

732
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,640
You've fixed this place up really nicely.

733
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,500
Planning to stay for a while, aren't you?

734
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,400
These are from the best shops in town.

735
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
I'm not cheating you.

736
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,270
You won't lose out.

737
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,300
This is for you.

738
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,070
First, help me pay a month's rent,

739
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,730
plus the gift money for these.

740
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,760
Is it enough?

741
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,270
If not, I can add more.

742
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,470
I'll tell you if it's not enough.

743
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,830
But I've been running around,

744
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,160
and I've actually been quite helpful.

745
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,550
Don't act smart after getting a good deal.

746
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,950
I've been on the streets.

747
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,090
You want me to calculate everything?

748
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,270
You can't take a joke?

749
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,470
I'm just confused.

750
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,870
Who are you dealing with
that requires so much effort?

751
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,110
Well...

752
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,250
That's none of your business.

753
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,760
Our family hasn't spent a penny

754
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,790
and we'll soon have 20 mu of land.

755
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,550
Come on, raise your glasses.

756
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,640
You can't drink.

757
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,030
You've got my grandchild in your belly.

758
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,580
Your father can't hold his liquor,
but he drinks so much.

759
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,190
You take after your father.

760
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,120
You can't hold your liquor either.

761
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,640
Who is it at this late hour?

762
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,710
-Don't move, I'll go.
-I'll go.

763
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,230
I'll check who it is.

764
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,810
The day Dajiao married you,

765
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,750
I was happy.

766
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,270
Today

767
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
is the happiest day of my life.

768
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,010
Father,

769
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,200
let me tell you one more thing.

770
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,800
It's additional good news.

771
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,810
What do you mean?

772
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,310
Dajiao!

773
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,550
Dajiao, this...

774
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,950
Dajiao, Sister-in-law,

775
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,830
having dinner?

776
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,270
What perfect timing,

777
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,750
I've brought some good wine
and food for you.

778
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,400
What's all this for?

779
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,330
Dajiao, this...

780
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,440
Dajiao,

781
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,880
you're my savior.

782
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
I've come here

783
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,160
to ask Dajiao's parents

784
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
to be my godparents.

785
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,120
You two

786
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,740
must be Dajiao's parents, right?

787
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,210
Here, let me fill your cup.

788
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,830
If you don't mind,

789
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,240
please accept my bow.

790
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,040
Young lady, I don't know you,

791
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,870
and Dajiao never mentioned you.

792
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,270
You...

793
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,030
Dajiao,

794
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,570
what's wrong with you?

795
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,400
You saved my life and Xiaohu's life.

796
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,330
Why didn't you tell my godparents?

797
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Why didn't you tell us you became

798
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,430
someone's savior?

799
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,880
The additional good news you mentioned

800
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,030
was this?

801
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,440
What? No.

802
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,000
From now on, you two

803
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,550
will be my godparents,

804
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,880
and Dajiao will be like my real brother.

805
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
Godfather, Godmother,

806
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,090
let's drink to that.

807
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,610
This girl...

808
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,000
No...

809
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,290
Brother, Sister-in-law,

810
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
let me fill your cups too.

811
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,270
Don't, don't.

812
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,530
Your sister-in-law can't drink.

813
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,460
She's pregnant.

814
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,510
Don't worry.

815
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,730
I know there's a cause

816
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,920
and effect for everything.

817
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,550
You came in to bow and drink with us,

818
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,550
but I don't get it.

819
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000
I can't drink this wine.

820
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,820
Please help me understand.

821
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,350
Alright.

822
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,070
Come,

823
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,110
please sit down.

824
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,400
Sit and let me explain.

825
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,790
Well,

826
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,350
I'll

827
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,350
first tell you both

828
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,880
how Dajiao

829
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,960
saved me and my brother.

830
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
For this story,

831
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,370
I need to start from the beginning.

832
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,310
So, I am

833
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,860
from Baoding, Hebei.

834
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,790
When I was nine,

835
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,860
I lost both my parents.

836
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,110
After that,

837
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,080
I took my little brother Xiaohu

838
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,350
to Qingkou to find
my mother's only brother,

839
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,280
my Second Uncle.

840
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,350
Who would have thought
that right after we arrived,

841
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,010
Second Uncle passed away too?

842
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,760
We'll go reheat the food for our guest.

843
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,720
Come on, Dajiao.

844
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,280
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

845
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,200
Did you arrange for her to come?

846
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,640
What?

847
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,180
Her coming here?

848
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,590
How could that be? What are you thinking?

849
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,540
Then what did you mean
by "additional good news?"

850
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,200
I wanted to talk about

851
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,920
Chang Chun bringing us
herb seeds.

852
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
Since Father was in a good mood,

853
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,700
we could discuss about

854
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,990
growing medicinal herbs on Turtle Hill.

855
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,230
About growing herbs?

856
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,470
She certainly has
a more persuasive mouth than yours.

857
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,880
Growing herbs.

858
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,720
Buying land is the right move.

859
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,510
Let me tell you,

860
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,470
you've come to the right place
and found the right person.

861
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,440
I know every good piece of land

862
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,000
in our village by heart.

863
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,590
That's great.

864
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,450
We'll talk about your land later.

865
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,860
You came here

866
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,960
and brought all those things.

867
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,850
I appreciate it all.

868
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,220
We appreciate your gratitude,

869
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,240
but you can't cling to our home.

870
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,550
What's that supposed to mean?

871
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,810
What do you mean by clinging to your home?

872
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,880
Does your home

873
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,880
have good food and drinks,

874
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,900
or comfortable accommodations?

875
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,510
Or are your family members
particularly good-looking?

876
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,270
Seriously.

877
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,980
Young lady,

878
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,590
go on.

879
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,570
You want to buy land here

880
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,200
and settle down here?

881
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,310
I have no family,

882
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,160
so it doesn't matter where I go.

883
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,550
I might as well stay here,

884
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,410
relying on you,

885
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,370
Godmother and Dajiao.

886
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,410
This way, I have a family now.

887
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,800
Oh right, I forgot to mention

888
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,490
that for the land I want to buy,

889
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,440
I want to get

890
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,680
about six or seven mu,

891
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,960
preferably adjacent plots,

892
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,000
and set aside two mu for my parents

893
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,820
as a small token of filial piety.

894
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,440
What did you say?

895
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,400
She said she's buying six or seven mu
for her brother

896
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,200
and giving you two mu as her filial duty.

897
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,790
That won't do, honey.

898
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,590
Wait, wait, wait.

899
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,790
What do you mean?

900
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,290
How can you talk like that?

901
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,440
Young lady.

902
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,510
Let me ask you,

903
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
where are you staying now?

904
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,800
I don't have a place to stay.

905
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,010
My things are stored in
Humpback Guo's storehouse.

906
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,670
I'm...

907
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,250
I'm just staying in the temporary shelter

908
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,360
that he set up for me.

909
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,510
That simply won't do.

910
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
This Humpback Guo

911
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,460
has no sense of hospitality.

912
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,790
So here's what we'll do.

913
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Dajiao,

914
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,260
clean up the side room

915
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,090
and let your sister stay there.

916
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,840
That's wonderful, Godfather!

917
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,080
She'll stay with us?

918
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,469
Look how enthusiastic your father is.

919
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,760
What kind of game is she playing?

920
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,780
She's staying.

921
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,360
Let's just make do for one night.

922
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,860
When Father sobers up tomorrow,

923
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,520
I'll talk some sense into him.

924
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,960
You can't hold your liquor,

925
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
yet you drink so much.

926
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,710
Look at you, what an ugly drunk.

927
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,070
You don't even realize it.

928
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,550
Drink this hot water.

929
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm putting it here.

930
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,810
Good morning, Godfather and Godmother.

931
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,590
Morning.

932
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,070
Godfather,

933
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,640
good morning!

934
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,510
She... she is...

935
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,150
Is...

936
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,940
That liquor wasn't for nothing.

937
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,210
This is your goddaughter.

938
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,710
Land... land...

939
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,000
Buying land!

940
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
That's right!

941
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,150
Yes.

942
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,710
I was just saying
we need to hire a matchmaker.

943
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,560
Why is it so lively out there?

944
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,230
They've started putting on a show outside.

945
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,560
How can it not be lively?

946
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,270
What show.

947
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,170
You're needed for every show.

948
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,750
Get up and take a look.

949
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,810
If you're comfortable living here,

950
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you can stay here.

951
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,570
Great! I've gotten quite comfortable here.

952
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,600
It's just that

953
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,590
the door of my side room

954
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,920
is a bit drafty.

955
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,400
At night, the wind howls through it

956
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,540
and it scares me a little.

957
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,080
The side room is drafty?

958
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,110
That won't do.

959
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,110
Dajiao!

960
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,590
Are you up yet?

961
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,920
Fix the door in the side room.

962
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,710
Your sister said

963
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,280
it's drafty in there.

964
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,080
Hurry, your sister is calling for you.
Go quickly.

965
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,920
I'm coming!

966
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,150
Is your salt coming out this slowly?

967
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,900
We won't exchange for it today.

968
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,240
Humpback Guo,

969
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,260
look how good this stuff is today.

970
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,020
Give me a bit more in exchange.

971
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,550
Come on, this is for trading.

972
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,770
Another day.

973
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,210
What do you mean another day?

974
00:36:59,210 --> 00:36:59,980
What are you talking about?

975
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,940
Guo!

976
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,010
Miss Xiuxiu.

977
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,360
What a coincidence.

978
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,710
You're shopping?

979
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,980
Help the auntie exchange for her salt.

980
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
That's right.

981
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,810
I was about to.

982
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,960
I've given you extra.

983
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,630
That's more like it.

984
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Do you need something, Miss Xiuxiu?

985
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,170
You dropped something.

986
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,910
Why don't you keep it?

987
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,990
Let me ask you,

988
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,280
what's the deal with that Lulu?

989
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,190
I just hired her brother for odd jobs.

990
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,760
I barely know her.

991
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,760
What's happening now?

992
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,610
What's happening?

993
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,430
She's become my parents' goddaughter,

994
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,670
supposedly to repay

995
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,710
Dajiao for saving Xiaohu.

996
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,550
She's already moved into
the Feng Residence.

997
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,360
Impressive.

998
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,400
How is she this impressive?

999
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,130
Impressive?

1000
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,750
No.

1001
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,160
You're praising her?

1002
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,440
What I mean is,

1003
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,640
I didn't make her come here.

1004
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,580
This scheme

1005
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,060
wasn't my idea either.

1006
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,550
Dajiao, you must be tired.

1007
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,080
Have some water. Continue later.

1008
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,650
No need.

1009
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,700
Look at all your sweat.

1010
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,960
Let me wipe it for you.

1011
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,670
No, no.

1012
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,440
Step back,

1013
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,970
or you might get hit.

1014
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,630
It's fine.

1015
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,670
So great.

1016
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,000
You...

1017
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,150
So you really plan to accept

1018
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,080
my parents and live with us?

1019
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,920
Your parents are so nice.

1020
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,960
I'd be missing out if I didn't.

1021
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,290
Besides, don't you know

1022
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,550
my brother and I

1023
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,160
grew up without parents?

1024
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,490
Brother,

1025
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,510
we'll be family from now on.

1026
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,360
Isn't that good?

1027
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,690
I don't think it's good.

1028
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,590
If you really want to live in our village,

1029
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,520
I can't stop you.

1030
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,190
You can buy a piece of land

1031
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,550
and build your own house.

1032
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,070
We can help if you need it,

1033
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,290
but you can't live in our home.

1034
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,910
You need to move out soon.

1035
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,230
See how much Mother and Father adore me?

1036
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,710
I don't have bad intentions,

1037
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,000
I just want to help you
take care of them.

1038
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,840
I know you don't have bad intentions,

1039
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,590
but my parents have me and Xiuxiu
to take care of them.

1040
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,720
They don't need you.

1041
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,540
You living in our house

1042
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,550
will upset my wife,

1043
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,040
and I don't want that.

1044
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,920
I've said everything I could
to drive her away.

1045
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,920
I knew

1046
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,590
this wasn't so simple.

1047
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,840
Miss Xiuxiu,

1048
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,700
why don't you listen to my advice?

1049
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,440
What advice?

1050
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,670
To let her become
a mistress?

1051
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,840
No, no.

1052
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,110
What I mean is

1053
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,190
that perhaps you could

1054
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,630
tolerate her for a little while longer.

1055
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,230
Once she sees that Dajiao
has no interest in her,

1056
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,110
she'll give up.

1057
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,630
Right now, it's like a hot pan of oil,

1058
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,440
and you're pouring cold water on it.

1059
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,030
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

1060
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,160
You're afraid she might harm herself?

1061
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,560
I don't think she's that kind of person.

1062
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,630
I just think

1063
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,590
she's had a hard life too.

1064
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,330
Besides,

1065
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,800
she doesn't mean any harm,

1066
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,400
right?

1067
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,230
Guo,

1068
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,370
what she's harming is my marriage.

1069
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Marriage is like a bowl.

1070
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,680
It breaks when you hit it.

1071
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,510
Even if you mend it,

1072
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,840
it'll never be the same.

1073
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,160
Let me ask you,

1074
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,960
if you had a precious bowl in your hands,

1075
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,070
would you let it crack?

1076
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,360
Besides, we're in the Republican Era now.

1077
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,080
Must I go backwards in time?

1078
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,920
A precious bowl in your hands...

1079
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,240
What does that mean?

1080
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,230
Whatchu you doing?

1081
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,280
You scared me!

1082
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,030
Where did you come from?

1083
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,550
You two sisters are going to be
the death of me today.

1084
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,920
What?

1085
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,910
My sister came to buy something?

1086
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,510
Your sister came to sell something.

1087
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,440
Sell something? What did she sell?

1088
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,230
A bowl.

1089
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,140
A precious bowl held in her hands.

1090
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Where have you been?

1091
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,040
I looked for you all morning.

1092
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,450
Weren't you busy fixing the door?

1093
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,080
Why were you looking for me?

1094
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,400
Didn't I tell you already?

1095
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,930
It has nothing to do with me.

1096
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,510
I told her this morning
while fixing the door

1097
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,820
to hurry up and buy the land.

1098
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,750
Once she buys it,

1099
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,360
my father and I
will arrange to build her house,

1100
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,760
so she can leave quickly.

1101
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,170
You're even going to help build her house?

1102
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,590
I don't want to
put up with her for even one day.

1103
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,120
Alright,

1104
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,900
I won't put up with her either.

1105
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Once Chang Chun delivers the herbs,

1106
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
we'll plant them,

1107
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
and then make time to drive her away.

1108
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,890
You know what?

1109
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,750
Guo already found her a place to stay

1110
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,620
and paid a month's rent,

1111
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,050
but she still tells Father and Mother
she has nowhere to go.

1112
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,050
I just don't want to expose her lies.

1113
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,560
My dear wife,

1114
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,260
you have such a kind heart.

1115
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,910
Didn't I tell you before?

1116
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,110
I heard her and Xiaohu say before

1117
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,670
that they suffered a lot growing up.

1118
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,570
Even if it's just for Xiaohu, I should...

1119
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,570
Stop right there.

1120
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,550
These are two different things.

1121
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
Don't mix them up.

1122
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,460
I refuse to be someone

1123
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,280
who just muddles through life
being nice to everyone

1124
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
for the sake of it.

1125
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,090
And you shouldn't either.

1126
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,360
Whatever my wife says is right.

1127
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,230
Tell us another one! One more story!

1128
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,840
Another one! Tell us another one!

1129
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,700
One more story!

1130
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,840
There was a rich lady

1131
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,620
whose family fell on hard times.

1132
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,590
To make ends meet,

1133
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,030
she had to sell vegetables.

1134
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,070
But she was too embarrassed
to call out to customers.

1135
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,920
After waiting for a long time,

1136
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,840
her vegetables began to wilt,

1137
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,230
which made her very anxious.

1138
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,090
At that moment,

1139
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,630
she noticed next to her,

1140
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,320
there was a female farmer
selling vegetables,

1141
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,710
calling out cheerfully to customers.

1142
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,570
She got an idea.

1143
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,580
She moved her vegetable stand

1144
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,150
next to the farmer.

1145
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
When the farmer shouted,

1146
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,590
"Vegetables for sale!"

1147
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,840
she would shyly say,

1148
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
"Me too."

1149
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,510
When the woman yelled,

1150
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,280
"Vegetables for sale!"

1151
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,150
"Me too."
