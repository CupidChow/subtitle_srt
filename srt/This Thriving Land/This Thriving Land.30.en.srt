00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,920
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,930
How's the prep going?

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,180
Everything's ready.

5
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,680
Remember, unless absolutely necessary,

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
don't open fire.

7
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,090
Got it.

8
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,690
Xinming,

9
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,229
ride to the village entrance
to meet Xiuxiu.

10
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:55,840
Okay.

11
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,570
Everyone else,

12
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,450
take cover.

13
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,180
Kejin,

14
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,220
you're not going anywhere.

15
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,550
Leave the grain here!

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,280
Dajiao,

17
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,540
get out of my way!

18
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,030
Kejin,

19
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,870
look at these children.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,579
Look at these disaster refugees!

21
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,860
Just a grain of food,

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,710
and they'll survive!

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,220
If it were your son Jiaming, I'd help.

24
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,870
But what do these people
have to do with me?

25
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,130
I don't even know them!

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,760
Ning Kejin,

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,640
hand over the grain!

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Hand over the grain! Hand over the grain!

29
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,079
Move aside!

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
If you don't leave the grain,

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,190
we won't back down!

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,390
Either that,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,170
or drive right over us!

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,900
Kejin, just leave the grain here.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
Susu, what are you doing here?

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,240
Don't cause me more trouble!

37
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,490
If you still see me as your brother,

38
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,490
get out of the way!

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Are you moving or not?

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,690
None of you will move, huh?

41
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll drive right over you all.
Start the car!

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,430
Ning Kejin!

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,490
Ning Kejin!

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,530
If you want to run someone over,
run me over first.

45
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,590
And me!

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Xiuxiu.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Can't you give me a break?

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Kejin,

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,310
take a good look.

50
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,630
Look at these people.

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,120
Besides the disaster refugees,

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,230
they're the very villagers
you risked your life to save

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,400
when the bandits attacked the village.

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,930
Could you really hurt them?

55
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,110
If they were grateful to me
for saving them,

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,960
they wouldn't be blocking my way!

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,870
Ning Kejin.

58
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,320
In times like these,

59
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,790
saving people from misery

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,750
and bringing peace
for generations to come

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,870
is our duty.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,250
What are you saying?

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Speak plain words. I don't understand!

64
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,030
I beg you,

65
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,800
leave the grain

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,510
to save them.

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,740
I consider you family,

68
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,870
my brother-in-law.

69
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,870
Take my advice:

70
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,000
make them leave now.

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,470
I won't let you rob me of my grain
at my own doorstep.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,330
I'm carrying a gun, and it's loaded.

73
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,790
Bullets don't show mercy!

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Kejin.

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,120
Kejin!

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Will you back down or not?

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,870
Kejin, put the gun down!

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,670
You think I don't dare shoot you?

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Young Master Ning,

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,810
we're just here to help.

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,070
I don't want to die.

82
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,570
Take the grain!

83
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,950
Take the grain!

84
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,480
Go!

85
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,370
Take the grain!

86
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,680
Take it.

87
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,600
Go!

88
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,870
Guys, stay in line.

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,630
Stay in line.

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,820
Stay in line.

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Stay in line.

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,950
Don't push! Don't push!

93
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,040
There's enough for everyone.

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,409
Don't push.

95
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,760
Please stay in order.

96
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,830
Don't push. Don't push.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
Don't push.

98
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,770
Guys, don't push. Don't push!

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,440
Quiet!

100
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,230
Today,

101
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,760
everyone here

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
will get food,

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,310
but please line up first.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,430
Line up. Everyone will get food.

105
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,780
Line up.

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,310
Line up. Line up.

107
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,630
There's grain for everyone!

108
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,560
There's enough grain. Don't push.

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,490
Line up.

110
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,780
Distribute the grain.

111
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Here.

112
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,800
Line up. Line up.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,260
Those in the back, line up.

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,210
My grain! My grain!

115
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,270
Xuexiang, Xuexiang.

116
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,480
There's nothing you can do now.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,080
Xuexiang,

118
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,070
there's nothing you can do.

119
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,950
My grain!

120
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,830
Something's happened!

121
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,760
Master, Master!

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,240
M-Madam…

123
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,080
Madam is going into labor!

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,280
M-My grain…

125
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,470
Xuexiang, go check on her.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Susu.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Jia, keep watch here.

128
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,120
Come, this way.

129
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,870
Push!

130
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,750
Almost there. Push!

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,680
Push!

132
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,990
Keep pushing!

133
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,920
Push!

134
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Push! Almost there!

135
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,270
Push, push, push!

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
Push! Harder!

137
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,560
How is it going? How is it going?

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Stop yelling. It's not like you can help.

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,970
Just wait quietly!

140
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,300
I have no strength left.

141
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,280
Push again! Push!

142
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,020
Here.

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Push, push, push!

144
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,470
Push! Push harder!

145
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,560
Over here. Over here.

146
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,070
You can get grain here too.

147
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,310
The baby's out! A healthy boy!

148
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,360
Xuexiang.

149
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,510
Congratulations, Xuexiang.

150
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,030
You got a son in your later years.

151
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,830
This is truly a great blessing
for the Ning family.

152
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,650
My son.

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,750
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,800
My grain!

155
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,630
Xuexiang,

156
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,970
what you lost is made up for
in another way.

157
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,800
It must be for the best.

158
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,670
Forget about the grain.

159
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,210
Father,

160
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
aren't you coming in to see your son?

161
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
Go, go. Go take a look.

162
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,660
Go in, Xuexiang!

163
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,720
This grain handout

164
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,130
was done efficiently with great results.

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It's all because

166
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,510
we worked together as one.

167
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,430
On behalf of those

168
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,250
starving refugees,

169
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,520
I thank you all.

170
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,430
Our relief work in this area

171
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,809
has now come to an end.

172
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,640
We'll wrap up quickly

173
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,309
and move on to the next place.

174
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,270
You're leaving already?

175
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,510
Yes.

176
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,110
There are other tasks

177
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,090
waiting for us.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Also,

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,150
during the grain handout today,

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,360
we ran into the police

181
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,950
and had a confrontation.

182
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,030
I think

183
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,460
this might make some people suspect

184
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,590
that this operation

185
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,940
was more than just a refugee riot.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,860
There will inevitably be consequences.

187
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,870
So,

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,870
starting now,

189
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,790
the gathering place
at the elementary school

190
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,920
is canceled for now.

191
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,920
Alright,

192
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,360
that's all I have to say.

193
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,760
Meeting dismissed.

194
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,910
Xiuxiu.

195
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,770
Xiuxiu.

196
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,300
Xinming.

197
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,390
Yinzi has given birth.

198
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,790
She gave our father a son.

199
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,570
How is Yinzi?

200
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,290
She's fine.

201
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,910
Come on, let's go see her.

202
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
He looks just like me.

203
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,100
He looks exactly like Kejin
when he was little.

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,270
Your brother's name is Kejin,

205
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,190
so I'll name you…

206
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,080
Keyu.

207
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,670
Your second uncle said
I got a son late in my later years,

208
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,730
and it's a blessing for the whole family.

209
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,280
You came to bring joy to me, didn't you?

210
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,150
Father, congratulations.

211
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,170
Good. I'll give you a reward.

212
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,550
And the midwife,
go claim your reward later.

213
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,610
Thank you, Father.

214
00:09:59,610 --> 00:09:59,940
Come.

215
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,840
Come with me.

216
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,980
You've made a great contribution
to the Ning family.

217
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,270
I'll remember it.

218
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,490
Cut the crap.

219
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Go deliver a few bushels of grain
to my parents,

220
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,540
and dried sweet potatoes
enough for half a year.

221
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,120
That much?

222
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,260
Keyu,

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
this time,

224
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,240
I'll listen to your mother.

225
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,220
Let your jerk
of a grandpa stuff his face.

226
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Give me my son.

227
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,020
I won't let you hold him, you old jerk.

228
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,110
Give him to me.

229
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,640
Let me hold him a bit longer.

230
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,110
Let this old jerk
hold him a little longer.

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,750
Come on.

232
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Everyone, keep up!

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,960
Go!

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,670
Pipe players up front,

235
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,240
play louder!

236
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Louder!

237
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
You hear me?

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,170
Hurry. Keep up.

239
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,550
Careful. Careful.

240
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,350
[A Beautiful Moment]

241
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,110
First bow to heaven and earth.

242
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,260
Second bow to the parents.

243
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,200
Husband and wife bow to each other.

244
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,910
I married into this family at 18.

245
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,630
Only after the ceremony did I find out

246
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,630
I'd married a man with consumption.

247
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,150
Not long after our wedding,

248
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,210
he passed away.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
I was left with his memorial tablet,

250
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,230
not knowing whether to stay or to leave.

251
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,830
[Memorial Tablet
of My Late Husband, Fei Wentang]

252
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Father.

253
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,130
Wendian,

254
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,740
kneel to your sister-in-law.

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,790
This family

256
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,790
is now in your hands.

257
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,670
-It was at that moment that Old Master Fei
-Father.

258
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,730
brought the motherless Wendian to me

259
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,240
and knelt before me
with the household keys in his hands.

260
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,840
All these years,

261
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,240
-I've managed
-Madam.

262
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,050
to keep this family together.

263
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,580
Young Master has returned.

264
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,470
Drink it later.

265
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,970
Xiaoqin,

266
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
go brew a fresh pot of tea
for Young Master.

267
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Use the best tea leaves.

268
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,670
Yes.

269
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,690
No need, Sister-in-law.

270
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,750
This is fine for me.

271
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,670
Young Master.

272
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,730
Why have you lost weight again?

273
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,870
You donated so much grain

274
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,730
but didn't fill your own stomach?

275
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,070
Sister-in-law,

276
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,000
you're worried about me again.

277
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
Then are you still mad at me?

278
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,580
I'm asking why you've lost weight again.

279
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,870
I eat well and sleep well.

280
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,790
Sister-in-law,

281
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,390
don't worry about my health.

282
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,390
I just…

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,190
I just don't want to see you upset.

284
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Always trying to sweet-talk me.

285
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,790
When you're away from home,

286
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,460
filling your stomach is the priority.

287
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,220
Got it?

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Got it.

289
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,290
Sister-in-law, you...

290
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,860
These are the keys
to all the Fei family granaries.

291
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,850
Since I took them from Father-in-law,

292
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,210
the granaries have never once been empty.

293
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,750
But these keys

294
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,390
aren't easy to carry.

295
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,920
All these years in my hands,

296
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,110
they've felt as heavy
as 1,000 pounds.

297
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,530
Every year after the harvest,

298
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,860
I had to spend days
checking the granaries

299
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,160
and then visit the ancestral hall.

300
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,220
That was my way to tell Father-in-law

301
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,550
and the ancestors that I didn't fail them.

302
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,370
But now,

303
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
I don't even dare go into the granaries.

304
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm afraid that in the empty granaries,

305
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,510
my voice would echo back to me.

306
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,870
Now that you've started your own family,

307
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,340
you can take charge.

308
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,970
Susu has started learning
to read the account books.

309
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,630
I'm returning the keys

310
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,140
to the granaries to you.

311
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,070
Sister-in-law,

312
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,100
if you're still mad at me,

313
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,980
you can hit me.

314
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,650
I came back to make you feel better.

315
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,200
As long as it eases your heart,

316
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,750
punish me however you want.

317
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm not mad at you.

318
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,370
I mean what I said.

319
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,360
All these years,
I've been managing this household for you.

320
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,630
Now that I'm giving the keys to you,

321
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
it's one burden off my mind.

322
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,720
Sister-in-law,

323
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,530
all these years,
I've watched with my own eyes

324
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,660
how you've single-handedly
kept this family together.

325
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,680
It wasn't easy.

326
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,000
But crops

327
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,150
can grow again.

328
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,680
So many disaster refugees—

329
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,550
men, women, young and old—

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
if they starved to death,

331
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,560
their lives would be gone forever.

332
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,530
Saving one life brings
tremendous good karma.

333
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,460
Sister-in-law,

334
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,080
that makes sense

335
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,720
even by your principles.

336
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,600
You just

337
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,560
feel guilty
toward the Fei family ancestors.

338
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,060
Don't put such heavy chains on yourself.

339
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,670
The Fei family ancestors are long gone,

340
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,570
including my parents

341
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,570
and even my brother,
whose face I can no longer recall.

342
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,080
All these years,

343
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,490
you've done enough for the Fei family.

344
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,840
I think it's the so-called
family rules and teachings

345
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,000
that have been suffocating you.

346
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,510
You need to take those chains

347
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,750
off yourself.

348
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,390
Go kneel in the ancestral hall.

349
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,150
Who talks about their ancestors like that?

350
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,400
Sister-in-law,

351
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I won't kneel in the ancestral hall.

352
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,720
I came back for two reasons:

353
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,150
first,

354
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,120
to make you feel better;

355
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,700
second…

356
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,230
to say goodbye to you.

357
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,130
I have a mission.

358
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,570
I'm leaving again.

359
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,330
Forgive me.

360
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,050
If you won't kneel,

361
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,240
I'll kneel for you.

362
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,760
I'll ask the ancestors to protect you.

363
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,920
I'll pray to them

364
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,610
for full granaries soon.

365
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,720
What are you doing?

366
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,520
Learn from me.

367
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,200
What's there to learn
about making firewood bundles?

368
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,130
I won't learn it.

369
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,829
There's skill in making firewood bundles.

370
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,650
It's more important than chopping wood.

371
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,960
Otherwise, after you chop wood,

372
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,760
you won't be able to bring it home.

373
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,930
I don't get it.

374
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
Why do I have to chop wood?

375
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,510
My mother and I

376
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,900
never chopped wood.

377
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,590
Then how did you make a fire?

378
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,460
My mom said,

379
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,470
with so many woodpiles in the village,

380
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,000
pulling several sticks from one
would be enough for cooking a meal.

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
That's what your mom taught you?

382
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,310
Yeah.

383
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,870
My parents said

384
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,400
farming is the hardest

385
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,390
and the most looked-down-on work,

386
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
that farmers

387
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,830
are the most despised people,

388
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,270
and that whatever trick is used,

389
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,960
only those who can make money
are truly capable.

390
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,670
Uncle and you
work in the fields every day.

391
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,000
You're doomed to be poor your whole lives.

392
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,460
Listen to me, Meiwei.

393
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
For us farmers,

394
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,080
the most shameful thing
is not holding a hoe.

395
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,310
For a person, the most shameful thing

396
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,610
is stealing
and trying to get something for nothing.

397
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,790
Everything your parents taught you
is wrong.

398
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,110
If you don't straighten up,

399
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,470
I won't look after you anymore.

400
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,880
My parents and wife

401
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,000
won't look after you either.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,960
You can follow what your father,

403
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,760
mother, and brother taught you.

404
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,850
Steal when you can.

405
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,350
If you can't, then starve.

406
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,420
If you get caught, take a beating.

407
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,480
Once the wounds heal, go steal again.

408
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,380
Dajiao,

409
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,750
I don't know
how to make a firewood bundle.

410
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,920
I can't carry it.

411
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,050
I just taught you. Why didn't you learn?

412
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,590
Will you learn it or not?

413
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,390
I'll learn it.

414
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,070
Listen to me, Meiwei.

415
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,040
A man's got to have backbone.

416
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,170
You're my cousin.

417
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,940
In our family,
it's men's duty to work hard.

418
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,230
There's no shame in it.

419
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
If a man

420
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,750
can't even feed himself,

421
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,520
that's truly shameful.

422
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Watch carefully.

423
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,440
A rabbit!

424
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,680
Dajiao,

425
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,320
a rabbit!

426
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,850
Today I'll teach you

427
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,880
another trick—

428
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,030
how to catch a rabbit.

429
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,880
Dajiao,

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
you catch a rabbit

431
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,000
by building a snare.

432
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
But I catch one

433
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,310
by waiting outside the rabbit's burrow.

434
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,930
Why don't we compete?

435
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,920
Let's see

436
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,340
who catches one first.

437
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,160
You really know how to do that?

438
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,440
Of course.

439
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,590
Fine.

440
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
Let's compete.

441
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,020
You go that way.

442
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll go this way.

443
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,450
Let's see

444
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,560
who catches more.

445
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,780
What do you say?

446
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,050
Let's do it.

447
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,960
You definitely can't beat me.

448
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,780
You're lucky today.

449
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,200
Fine.

450
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,230
Your way worked better than mine.

451
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,160
Do you admit defeat?

452
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,700
This one is too small though—

453
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,860
just a little bunny.

454
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,310
I'll catch a bigger one for you
another time.

455
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,510
Wanna compete again?

456
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,200
You're cheating.

457
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,130
Not admitting defeat is cheating.

458
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,350
Meiwei,

459
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,500
listen.

460
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,350
There's one thing you'll never beat me at.

461
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,880
What?

462
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,860
You can't run as fast as me.

463
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,200
Dajiao!

464
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,550
Sir.

465
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,550
Sir.

466
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,720
Meiwei, run!

467
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,970
Don't worry about me!

468
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,070
Dajiao!

469
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,050
Look, sweetie, it's flying.

470
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,150
Uncle!

471
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,540
Uncle!

472
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,790
Xiuxiu!

473
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,510
What happened?

474
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,400
Dajiao

475
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,900
was taken away by a black car
with smoke coming from its rear.

476
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,370
What exactly happened?

477
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,080
Wendian.

478
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:51,960
Xiuxiu?

479
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,570
Wendian.

480
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,880
Xiuxiu, why are you here?

481
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Where's Wendian?

482
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,920
I've waited for him all afternoon.

483
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,780
Jia just went out looking for him.

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,680
Xinming!

485
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,940
-Xinming.
-Jia.

486
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,830
Jia.

487
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,240
Hey, Xiuxiu.

488
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,370
Where's Wendian?

489
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,760
I only found his bike on the road.

490
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,310
I've searched everywhere around.

491
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,110
No sign of him.

492
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,030
I heard Dajiao was

493
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,920
also taken away in a black car.

494
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,070
Mr. Fei said he'd go back
to see his sister-in-law at noon

495
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,590
and then visit Ning Xuexiang

496
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,160
to apologize to them in person.

497
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,110
He said after that, he'd come back to me.

498
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,680
But now…

499
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,500
No.

500
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,440
I need to go to the Fei Residence again

501
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,790
and see if I can find out
where Mr. Fei went.

502
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,830
I'll go with you.

503
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,360
Alright.

504
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,800
Xinming,

505
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,830
you stay here and watch the house.

506
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,270
Okay.

507
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,290
Xiuxiu,

508
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,240
were Wendian and Dajiao

509
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,270
arrested as Communists?

510
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
What should we do?

511
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,160
-Xiuxiu.
-Don't panic.

512
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,030
Xiuxiu.

513
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,560
Mrs. Fei.

514
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
Take this money.

515
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,310
I…

516
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,370
You must bring Wendian back.

517
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,330
If it's not enough,

518
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,090
send a message back to me.

519
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,440
Even if it costs everything we have,

520
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
we can't let anything happen to Wendian.

521
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,340
Mrs. Fei, don't panic yet.

522
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,440
I don't even know

523
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,900
where they've been taken.

524
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,210
Keep the money for now.

525
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,220
Don't worry.

526
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,450
If what Meiwei said is true,

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,650
then Mr. Fei Wendian and Dajiao

528
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,650
might have been taken by the police.

529
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,480
Oh, right,

530
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,200
Xiuxiu,

531
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,210
your brother knows those people,
doesn't he?

532
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,160
I also think

533
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,330
Kejin must be involved in this.

534
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,700
I'll go to the county police station
right away.

535
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,400
Now?

536
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,350
I'll go with you.

537
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,510
Jia, you'd better not.

538
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,420
Fei Wendian has already been taken.

539
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,950
You should find a place to hide.

540
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll go with you.

541
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,420
Alright.

542
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,250
Xiuxiu,

543
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,640
you two shouldn't go out at night.
It's too dangerous.

544
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,300
Wait until tomorrow morning.

545
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,790
I'll go report to the organization now.

546
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,320
We'll find a way to find out

547
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,660
if Mr. Fei Wendian and Dajiao were

548
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,110
really taken by the police.

549
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,440
Once we learn anything,

550
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,930
we'll have Tietou send word to you.

551
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,350
Be careful when you go to save Dajiao.

552
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
Take all these buns.

553
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
Don't worry.

554
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,590
I'm going with Susu.

555
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,150
These are too many.

556
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,640
Take them all.

557
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,120
I'll just take a few.

558
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,930
You keep the rest to eat.

559
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,830
First, I'm worried about Dajiao,

560
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,690
and now I'm worried about you too.

561
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,960
You must be careful. Remember that.

562
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,180
Mother, I'll be fine.

563
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,770
These few are enough.

564
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,430
Keep the rest for yourselves.

565
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,270
Take them all.

566
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,730
Keep some for yourselves.

567
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,510
Xiu.

568
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,580
Xiu.

569
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,510
Father.

570
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,550
Xiu,

571
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,230
I dug up the money

572
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,820
I saved for buying land.

573
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,540
All our savings

574
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,530
are here.

575
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,000
A total

576
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,240
of 36 silver dollars.

577
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,730
Take it.

578
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
Just bring Dajiao back.

579
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,900
Father.

580
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,960
Keep this money safe.

581
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,510
If we really need it,

582
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,010
that means there's still room to maneuver.

583
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,870
I'll come back and get it from you.

584
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,640
Keep it safe for now.

585
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,640
Alright.

586
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,480
Xiu,

587
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
it's all up to you now.

588
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,530
Good girl.

589
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,150
Xiuxiu.

590
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,000
I brought something important.

591
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,060
What did you bring?

592
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,830
My sister-in-law

593
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,490
let me bring 50 silver dollars.

594
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,290
I don't think we need money yet.

595
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,100
Still, better to bring some.

596
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,890
But, Xiuxiu,

597
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,030
I forgot to bring food. Did you bring any?

598
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,600
I did.

599
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,800
Let's go.

600
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,880
Can you manage?

601
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,710
Of course.

602
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,580
Come on.

603
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,070
Get on.

604
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,610
Ride slowly.

605
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,410
Hold on tight.

606
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,090
[Shuhe County Police Station]

607
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,570
When I saw Fei Wendian

608
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,060
staring straight into the gun muzzle
without blinking,

609
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,400
I suddenly understood—

610
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,550
he could forget himself
for the sake of the disaster refugees

611
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,830
and the poor common folk.

612
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
At that moment,

613
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
I respected him
from the bottom of my heart.

614
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,480
Wendian!

615
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,110
Wendian!

616
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,320
Wendian.

617
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,770
Why did they beat you?

618
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,860
What's the charge?

619
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
No charge.

620
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,480
They just wanted

621
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,700
to get the information they wanted

622
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,630
out of me.

623
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,110
But things

624
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,490
didn't go as they had planned.

625
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,000
So…

626
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,410
they lashed out in anger.

627
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,240
How could you beat him
without a conviction?

628
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,170
Do you have any respect for the law?

629
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,110
Dajiao!

630
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,160
Dajiao.

631
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,590
Don't waste your energy on them.

632
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,970
This isn't a place where law matters.

633
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,960
Later,

634
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,170
when they interrogate you,

635
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,590
blame everything on me.

636
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,190
Their target isn't you.

637
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,240
This way,

638
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,440
you'll be safe.

639
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Why would I shift the blame onto you?

640
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,830
I was part of this too.

641
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,960
Besides, what we did was right.

642
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,400
If we hadn't opened the granaries
and taken the grain,

643
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,060
so many people would've died.

644
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,570
You're right, Dajiao.

645
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,230
It's precisely because our organization

646
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,630
is doing the right things

647
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,710
that they feel

648
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,150
afraid and threatened.

649
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,170
Wendian.

650
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,960
You don't need to take all the blame.

651
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,610
To be honest,

652
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,000
even if you hadn't come,

653
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,590
we'd have taken grain
from those landlords anyway.

654
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,930
We couldn't just watch so many people

655
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,260
drop dead in front of us.

656
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
Even if God himself came down,

657
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,200
we'd still be in the right.

658
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,990
Dajiao,

659
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,680
you must do as I say.

660
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,070
They've tortured me.

661
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,350
That means my identity's exposed.

662
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
But Jia and Xinming

663
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,240
don't know I've been captured.

664
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,680
So when you get out,

665
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,310
you must find a way to warn them

666
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,310
and tell them to leave immediately.

667
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,910
I got it.

668
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,270
Help me

669
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,090
sit against the wall for a bit.

670
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
It really hurts.

671
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,510
You poked right at my wound just now.

672
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,790
Xiuxiu.

673
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,350
What are you here for?

674
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,200
I'm looking for someone called Ning Kejin.

675
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,550
Is he a cop or a prisoner?

676
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,650
Neither.

677
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,970
I don't know him.

678
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,460
Never heard of him. Get out of here.

679
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,650
Why are you shooing me?

680
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,790
If you don't know him,
can't you ask around?

681
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,680
How would you know
if he's here if you don't ask?

682
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
Go away. Go away.

683
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,550
Don't interfere with our work.

684
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,110
Susu.

685
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
Why did you yell at me?

686
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,920
Don't argue with him.

687
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,700
Let's just stand in this most visible spot

688
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,230
so people inside can see us.

689
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,400
Xiuxiu,

690
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,510
how are you so sure Kejin is inside?

691
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,450
See that car over there?

692
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,790
The black one.

693
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,150
I recognize that license plate.

694
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,660
When Kejin was transporting grain,

695
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,990
he rode in that very car.

696
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,620
Didn't I tell you to leave?

697
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,120
Move. Don't stand there.

698
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,280
Why are you yelling?

699
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,550
Am I in your way standing here?

700
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,280
If not, mind your own business.

701
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,350
Dajiao,

702
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,310
back then,

703
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,050
you married Xiuxiu

704
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,880
with an eight-bearer sedan.

705
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,400
I truly admire you

706
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,640
for that.

707
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,250
You have more courage than me.

708
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,320
You have a better sense of responsibility
to your family than I do.

709
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,680
I can't do the same.

710
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,590
As you can see,

711
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,640
I've now chosen

712
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,310
this bright path.

713
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,720
That means I must be ready
to give up my family

714
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,920
and even my life at any moment.

715
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,710
I have a favor to ask.

716
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,080
Go ahead.

717
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,920
If one day

718
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,920
I give my life for the cause,

719
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,280
could you look after my sister-in-law
for me?

720
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,940
She's had such a hard life.

721
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,200
She's spent her whole life
serving the Fei family,

722
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,860
never putting herself first.

723
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,880
Wendian,

724
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,040
your sister-in-law and Susu need you.

725
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,680
So do many others.

726
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,860
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

727
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,830
Susu…

728
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,590
In the end, I never managed

729
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,830
to divorce Susu.

730
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,180
But if one day I died,

731
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
it would at least

732
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,770
free her

733
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,450
from this empty marriage.

734
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,520
When that happens, you and Xiuxiu

735
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,240
must help her

736
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,910
start a life that belongs to herself.

737
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,960
Promise me?

738
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,350
Xiuxiu,

739
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,110
you must be tired from standing so long.

740
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,880
Sit for a bit.

741
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,260
I'm fine.

742
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,090
I want to stand right here

743
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,200
to make the one inside feel sorry.

744
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
You mean Kejin?

745
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,590
How come I can't tell if he's in there?

746
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Back up! Back up!

747
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,960
Or I'll beat you up.

748
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,660
Go ahead.

749
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,520
If you hurt us,

750
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,830
my brother won't let you off.

751
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,200
You…

752
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,270
Kejin.

753
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,150
What's all the shouting?

754
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,160
Ning Kejin!

755
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
Ning Kejin!

756
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,530
What's all this noise?

757
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,000
Captain,

758
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,030
these two women are making a scene,

759
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,310
asking to meet someone called Ning Kejin.

760
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,330
I said I don't know him,

761
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,850
but they keep making a scene.

762
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,220
So you're the family
of the prisoners Feng Dajiao

763
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,460
and Fei Wendian?

764
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,000
Alright then,

765
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,830
come with me.

766
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
Sir, I've been wrongly accused!

767
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,750
Shut up!

768
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,680
Here.

769
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,690
Dajiao!

770
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,090
Wendian.

771
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,830
Xiu.

772
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,980
How did you get hurt?

773
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,350
Who beat you like this?

774
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,470
I'm fine.

775
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,720
All superficial wounds.

776
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,060
Why are you two here?

777
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,590
We came to rescue you,

778
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,960
but they said they're transferring you
to another prison.

779
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Transferring us?

780
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,900
Letting you in here

781
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,610
was already my superior
doing you a favor.

782
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,890
Get your superior here.

783
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,440
You think you can meet whoever you want?

784
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,550
Ning Kejin!

785
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,350
-S-Stop shouting.
-Ning Kejin, come out!

786
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,610
I'm going to throw you out!

787
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,560
Ning Kejin!

788
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,590
Stop yelling!

789
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,780
What's going on?

790
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,220
I only just heard they were arrested,

791
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,390
so I came to check on them.

792
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,440
Kejin, it really was you?

793
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,900
What's it got to do with me?

794
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
If it were me, would I still show up here?

795
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,370
I'm thinking about pulling some strings

796
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,370
to get them out.

797
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
But let me be blunt.

798
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,540
You robbed me of the grain,

799
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,340
humiliating both Father and me.

800
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,510
Once you're out,

801
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,760
find a way to restore dignity to us.

802
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,760
Also, the grain you took

803
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
was reserved by my father

804
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,590
for the Nationalist Government.

805
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,880
You took it and gave it out.

806
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,280
We had to offer
another two trucks of grain.

807
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,659
Kejin,

808
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,489
raiding your grain truck was my idea.

809
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,070
But it was thanks to your grain

810
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,870
that so many disaster refugees survived.

811
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,620
How about this?

812
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,280
On behalf of

813
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,460
those disaster refugees,

814
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
I thank you.

815
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,270
But Ning Kejin, think about it.

816
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,290
Why did we do that?

817
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,560
Because you've

818
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,110
sided with these old powers who do nothing

819
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,320
but line their pockets.

820
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
Open your eyes—

821
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,030
they've hollowed out this country

822
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,760
-and ruined it.
-Fei Wendian.

823
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,320
How dare you still talk nonsense here?

824
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,540
Why do you think

825
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,460
you're the only one tortured?

826
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,230
I never thought

827
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,360
I'd walk out alive.

828
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,630
But Dajiao is innocent.

829
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,150
Susu,

830
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
how am I supposed to save him?

831
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,330
Say no more.

832
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,280
Or neither you nor Dajiao can get out.

833
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,920
Enough.

834
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,500
You think you lost face.

835
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,690
We get it now.

836
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,590
Just release them.

837
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,320
How?

838
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,050
I don't run the prison.

839
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,070
Then what do we do?

840
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,090
I have to ask someone for help.

841
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,090
Then go!

842
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,470
A-Ask for help…

843
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:43,900
Kejin,

844
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,130
I brought this.

845
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,130
Take this.

846
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,840
Use it to smooth things over.

847
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,030
Get them released.

848
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,550
Kejin, we'll be waiting for your news.

849
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,000
Come in.

850
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,240
Boss.

851
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,510
I just saw them.

852
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,940
They're so frightened this time.

853
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,520
But the beating
my second sister's husband took

854
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
was a bit too harsh.

855
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,330
So, Kejin, are you blaming me?

856
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,410
No, of course not.

857
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,080
How could I?

858
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,030
Boss,

859
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,550
even though the grain of my father and me

860
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,960
is gone for good,

861
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,110
you've

862
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,950
helped us

863
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,970
save face in the village.

864
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,310
So,

865
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,340
how about letting them go?

866
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,230
I truly

867
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,220
wanted to help you.

868
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,530
I just needed to say the word.

869
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,780
How could I refuse?

870
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,360
But now,

871
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,480
things are different.

872
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Different how?

873
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,690
I've got a list here.

874
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,030
On it are names of Communists

875
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,190
and radical leftists.

876
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,420
Your second sister's husband is on it.

877
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,070
If I release him

878
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,630
[Communists and Radical Leftists]

879
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,320
and this gets looked into,

880
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,720
not only will I lose my position,

881
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,630
but you may never become

882
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
the director of the militia bureau.

883
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,250
But if

884
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,530
we don't release him

885
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,340
and get something out of him,

886
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,800
it'll be our proof of loyalty.

887
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,700
I won't have to be a deputy anymore,

888
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,930
and you'll become

889
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,600
the director of the militia bureau soon.

890
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,920
Boss, you're so nice,

891
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,070
always looking out for me.

892
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,840
But Boss,

893
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,280
I don't know about the others on the list,

894
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,910
but I know my brother-in-law too well.

895
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,020
He's just a lousy teacher.

896
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
What could he possibly know?

897
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,190
I think

898
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,800
the real big fish

899
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,660
is the person behind this list.

900
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,840
Boss, you've been so good to me.

901
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,560
I need to do something for you.

902
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,170
I'll catch that big fish

903
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,000
behind the list for you.

904
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,260
When I do,

905
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,170
you'll surely get promoted

906
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,690
and become rich.

907
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,930
My friend,

908
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,380
so many people are watching.

909
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,550
I can't

910
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,330
make all the decisions alone.

911
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,880
Whether to release him,

912
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
whether to interrogate him,

913
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,670
it's all up to you.

914
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,950
Besides, we're sworn brothers.

915
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,840
That makes my sister your sister.

916
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,210
She's so young.

917
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,670
Boss,

918
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,950
you can't let her

919
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,270
become a widow so young.

920
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,000
Xiuxiu, can Kejin really get them out?

921
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,190
If he could let us in,

922
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,670
he can surely let them out.

923
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,220
Xiuxiu.

924
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,260
They're out.

925
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,960
Move.

926
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,640
Let's go.

927
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,950
Wait a moment.

928
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
Fei Wendian, listen.

929
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,340
I only saved you for my sister's sake.

930
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,040
You need to think carefully

931
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,130
about your future path.

932
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,400
I don't want my two sisters
to become widows in the future.

933
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,930
Let's go.

934
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,510
Go.

935
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
That's it for now.

936
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,250
Dajiao, Xiuxiu,

937
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,510
please find a way

938
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,030
to warn Jia and Xinming

939
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,260
and tell them to leave immediately.

940
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
I'll go report to the organization.

941
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,510
Take good care of yourself.

942
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,990
Okay.

943
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,500
We'll leave first.

944
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,080
You take care of Wendian.

945
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,580
Be careful on your way.

946
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,110
Susu,

947
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,850
you should go back too.

948
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm fine now.

949
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,870
It's too dangerous here.

950
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,650
Sister-in-law is
really worried about you.

951
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,180
Won't you go back to see her?

952
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,490
If I go back,

953
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,450
I'll only drag you and her down.

954
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,260
Thank you for saving me this time.

955
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,660
That's what I should do.
No need to thank me.

956
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Can you travel with those injuries?

957
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,670
They're all superficial.

958
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:32,840
Susu,

959
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,730
when I'm not around,

960
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,190
you and Sister-in-law
must protect yourselves.

961
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,030
If anyone asks
about the grain handout,

962
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,510
just blame it all on me.

963
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,840
Have a seat.

964
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

965
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,360
I know.

966
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440
You want me
to take care of Sister-in-law.

967
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,700
I haven't told you yet.

968
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,320
Back when the bandits
besieged the village,

969
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,830
she and I looked out for each other.

970
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,090
That brought us close.

971
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,730
Now she treats me really well.

972
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,520
Don't worry.

973
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,140
That's not what I mean.

974
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,740
You want to talk about the divorce again,
don't you?

975
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,670
To be honest,

976
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,420
I want you to stay
and take care of Sister-in-law.

977
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,920
But I'm afraid.

978
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm afraid you'll end up
living the same life she has.

979
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,050
She married my brother,

980
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,100
and not long after, he died.

981
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,070
Since then,

982
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,860
she's been supporting
the Fei family all alone,

983
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,660
thinking only of the family,

984
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,230
never of herself.

985
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
She's suffered too much.

986
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,070
And now, as I leave,

987
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,510
I can't promise you

988
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,790
that I'll make it back alive.

989
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,630
Why say such unlucky things?

990
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,340
It's over now, isn't it?

991
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,600
You've been released.

992
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,600
Why talk like there's no tomorrow?

993
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,740
I know you mean well,

994
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,780
but you don't have to push me away.

995
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Let me tell you—

996
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,320
I'm not the 17-year-old girl anymore.

997
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,190
Sister-in-law is good to me,

998
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,590
so I should be good to her.

999
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,710
I'm quite happy
staying in the Fei Residence.

1000
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,840
I'll definitely take good care of her.

1001
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,760
And I hope, whenever you're free,

1002
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
you'll come home

1003
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,670
to see her.

1004
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,670
I'll go now.

1005
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,390
Father, Mother.

1006
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,150
I'm back.

1007
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,320
Dajiao!

1008
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,730
I was so afraid you wouldn't return.

1009
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,960
Don't jinx it.

1010
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,030
Xiuxiu,

1011
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
you've done such a great job.

1012
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,110
We must thank Meiwei.

1013
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,490
If he hadn't sent word,

1014
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,890
we'd never have known you were arrested.

1015
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,440
Meiwei,

1016
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,210
I'll take you hunting rabbits some day.

1017
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,920
Okay!

1018
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,980
Son,

1019
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:57,970
come here.

1020
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,980
By the way, Dajiao,

1021
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,850
you lost at capturing rabbits.

1022
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,660
Do you admit it?

1023
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,670
I do.

1024
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,460
You won.
