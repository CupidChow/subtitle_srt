1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,639
We know the parasite
organization that Team Grey is after

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,101
has been using Saejin Church as
a sort of base of operations.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,979
We got a report and then began our raid.

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,189
While most of them are presently hiding,

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,860
we believe that key figures of the group
are still somewhere in Namil-gun.

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,237
And who made the report?

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,240
Jeong Su-in, 29.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,326
Employed as a market clerk
here in Namil-gun.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,494
You're wrong about that.

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,539
You mean that she was a clerk.

11
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,584
Jeong Su-in isn't a clerk now.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,794
She's nothing but a parasite.

13
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,048
I saw it personally and captured her.

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,633
That's not true.

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,597
I, uh, I'm the head of
the Violent Crimes team, sir.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,598
Kim Chul-min.

17
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,809
Jeong Su-in, she… she's just a human.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,480
She's not a monster. The tests confirm it.

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,857
She's been tested.

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,859
Right?

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,821
Why aren't you telling them the truth?
What are you hiding?

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,989
Uh…

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,950
If she was tested,
then show us the results.

24
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,287
Uh… Yes, of course.

25
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,211
Based on our examination
of her brain and hair samples,

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,213
uh, at present, the tests

27
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,841
do not show the characteristics
we've seen in parasites.

28
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,807
I saw her change myself,
or maybe I'd better explain again?

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,393
She's just a parasite. The woman's dead.

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,356
And there's still so much
that seems suspicious.

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,818
Jeong Su-in could be
a new type of creature.

32
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,903
Our current methods
of identifying parasites

33
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,279
can't tell us everything,

34
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,740
and we have to develop new ones.

35
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,450
So what's that mean, then?

36
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,287
You mean to tell me that
you'd put someone in that mask

37
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,997
and let them be tortured
without any proof?

38
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,582
Any definitive proof?

39
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,753
If something happens to her,
who takes responsibility, huh?

40
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,046
What if you're wrong?

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,632
-She's a monster just because you say so?
-Hey, sir, let's--

42
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,009
Jeong Su-in is just
a regular, innocent kid!

43
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,303
-Yes, all right.
-Just sit down.

44
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,639
-Let's all calm down.
-I'm all right.

45
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,767
So, then, what is
Jeong Su-in's current condition?

46
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,396
She's in a coma as we speak.

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,316
She lost consciousness during capture,
though there was no physical contact.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Her brain waves and pulse are slow.

49
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,071
Even though she's unconscious,
security is tight

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,198
since the situation remains uncertain.

51
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,742
Ah, well, if I may, then,

52
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,538
we now think that the timing is right

53
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,541
to be honest
regarding these parasitic beings.

54
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,044
In order to prevent
further chaos caused by rumors

55
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,422
and unverified information online,

56
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,383
it's necessary to inform the public
about the parasites

57
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,385
and give them what reassurance we can.

58
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,137
In order to achieve this,

59
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,974
Team Grey will need
a full understanding of the parasites,

60
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,935
and they must develop some means
by which to reliably contain them.

61
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,729
Is that understood?

62
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,357
First, we need to transfer
Jeong Su-in to headquarters

63
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,693
to determine her probable condition.

64
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,237
We will conduct
a thorough and detailed study.

65
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,490
The transfer operation will be led
by team leader Choi Jun-kyung.

66
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,411
In addition, I asked
the officers of Namil Police Station

67
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,205
to fully cooperate with Team Grey

68
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,958
and put their best efforts into
eradicating the parasite organization.

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,878
This is a very serious matter
concerning public safety.

70
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,505
So the authorities
in the surrounding areas

71
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,300
will send two units
of highly trained police.

72
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,428
As soon as you're able to do so,
commence the transfer.

73
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,388
Team Leader Choi, understood?

74
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,099
Yes, it's understood.

75
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,520
That'll be all.

76
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,791
What do you suppose it means?

77
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,835
A detailed study might include
splitting her open, you know?

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,920
They could kill her.

79
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,799
If that happens,
has she got any family, still?

80
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,095
Jesus. Poor thing.

81
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,410
-Everything normal?
-Yeah, there's nothing unusual.

82
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,413
Her brain waves and pulse are
both completely normal.

83
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,165
Go take a break, then, okay?
I can handle things here.

84
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,501
Oh? You sure that's okay?

85
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,547
-Great. I'm off, then.
-Yeah.

86
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,409
PARASYTE: THE GREY

87
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,971
What is this?

88
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,977
This is not the real world.

89
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,147
Who are you?

90
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,235
The organism inside you now,

91
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,071
who you call Heidi, I believe.

92
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,572
What?

93
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,825
You are in a dangerous situation
in real life.

94
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,702
Should you wake up now,

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,206
you'll be in excruciating pain
and have a panic attack immediately.

96
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,501
Of more importance, you will die.

97
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,338
And so, I split your consciousness
from the outside world.

98
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,673
But…

99
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,924
You mean, I'm not…

100
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,137
We are in the place
where your spirit dwells.

101
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,347
Deep inside.

102
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,237
Since this is most likely

103
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,906
the only in-person conversation
we will have,

104
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,742
I thought this was
an ideal location for it,

105
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,411
where the truth of you resides.

106
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,037
We don't look alike.

107
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,623
That face you're wearing is mine!

108
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,668
In the end, we have no option
except to live as one.

109
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,464
I assumed that you would find
this face less difficult to accept.

110
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,382
But, if you prefer, I can use this.

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,263
Do we report the change?

112
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,349
I don't think
we need to report the small stuff.

113
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,810
It's gotta be a dream, hmm?

114
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,728
Yeah, I guess.

115
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,606
All Namil Police Station
personnel handling the operation,

116
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,233
please come to the conference room
on the third floor.

117
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,529
-Hey, Chul-min.
-Yeah?

118
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,158
We identified the man we suspect
was with Su-in last night in the park.

119
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,451
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,787
-All right. I'll be right in.
-All right, see you inside.

121
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,747
Attention.

122
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,416
There's been a change
in the traffic control dispatch schedule.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,169
Please check
the most recent communications.

124
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,887
I have no reason
to cause you any harm, Su-in.

125
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,222
Do not be afraid.

126
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,400
Do you recognize this place now?

127
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,445
Yeah, I do.

128
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,156
This is my old house.

129
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,203
That's my dad…

130
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,874
the day I reported him
and the police came.

131
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,714
After my mom had left us,
he started to take his anger out on me.

132
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,884
Over and over,

133
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,053
I was beaten.

134
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,849
So I reported him

135
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,894
because I wanted to live.

136
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,898
The day I summoned the courage to survive…

137
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,443
this is that day.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,823
But afterward,

139
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,952
everyone looked at me
as if I was the monster.

140
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,831
How could a kid report her own father?

141
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,501
They looked at me
like I was the monster.

142
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,302
Sir?

143
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,346
Who's this?

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,390
Seol Kang-woo,
with two arrests for violent crimes.

145
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
We got this from Guro Police Station.

146
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,187
The Mangnani Gang? In the Guro area?
He's a lackey of theirs.

147
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,399
Several of the bodies we found
at Saejin Church

148
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,817
were men from that gang.

149
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,360
They must've gone after him.

150
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,322
Ah, the detective in Guro said

151
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,824
that there's been a pretty big struggle
with Mangnani members

152
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,826
and the Yeongdeungpo Cheolis.

153
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,078
And Seol Kang-woo
was sent by the Mangnanis

154
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,623
to murder a boss in the Cheolis,
but he failed.

155
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,168
After that, he must've fled
to his hometown, Namil-gun.

156
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,211
He's been causing some trouble
in the area,

157
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,130
like a fight in a bike shop there.

158
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,300
So his gang just decided
to give him up as an olive branch.

159
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,885
He's small potatoes,

160
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,346
so his gang used him and dumped him.

161
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,305
Fucking idiot.

162
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,434
Oh, sir, and there were two taxis
out at Changseong Park yesterday.

163
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,644
Looks like here.

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,812
One went to the Cheonggun Apartments.

165
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,357
One to Namil Terminal,
out in the motel district.

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,152
The terminal? Too obvious, right?
Some criminal he is, huh?

167
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,904
He might have run
to another region.

168
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,365
Should we send out some guys?

169
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,824
Uh, no. Uh, I'll go.

170
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,743
What?

171
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,372
Uh, in a little bit,
Team Grey is gonna transfer Su-in.

172
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,749
-You both help out here, all right?
-Yes, sir.

173
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,709
-Got it, sir.
-Your handcuffs, let me…

174
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,710
-Okay.
-Come on.

175
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,003
-Here, sir.
-Thanks.

176
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,173
-You're fine by yourself?
-Just don't tell Team Grey about me.

177
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,716
-We'll keep it quiet.
-Yeah, I won't.

178
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,472
The bus for Gyeongnam
has arrived at the terminal.

179
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,225
Prior to boarding,
please double-check your tickets

180
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,811
and ensure you have
all of your belongings with you

181
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,479
as you get ready to depart.

185
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,698

NAMIL-GUN PARASITES

A WASTE-FREE, ECO-FRIENDLY FESTIVAL

00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,375
CHOI YONG-JAE MEMORIAL FESTIVAL

189
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,837
Nothin' in the news about it.

190
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,143
Welcome, sir.
May I have your ticket, please?

191
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,503
I thought you'd try pulling a runner.

192
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,884
Stay still, come on, now.

193
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,512
All right.

194
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,389
Don't make this worse, okay?

195
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,186
Shit.

196
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,980
Relax your arm, punk.

197
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,612
Shit.

198
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,492
Hang on. You cops gotta
keep to your rules, don't you?

199
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,993
Do my rights and all that?

200
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,247
Remember the one about "remain silent"?

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,752
I'd suggest you use it and stay quiet.
All right, asshole?

202
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,796
All right, I'll go. It's just…

203
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,381
Can't you take me
to a different station far away?

204
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,176
Just what bullshit are you selling now?

205
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,930
At your station, you got a monster.
No bullshit, man.

206
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,516
-And he's disguising himself as a cop.
-What?

207
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,727
At the amusement park,
in the van with a mask on it?

208
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312
One of your own guys killed it.

209
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,816
The thing in the mask was
another monster, right?

210
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,236
We've all been properly tested.

211
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,447
Assholes always try to bullshit,
don't they?

212
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,115
Impossible the test missed one?

213
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,953
Huh? He wore a raincoat? Huh?

214
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,789
I clearly saw
that bastard kill the monster.

215
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,874
-Come on, kid.
-I'm serious.

216
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,170
Okay. What's he look like? Huh?

217
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,131
Here. Come on. Well?

218
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,843
Which one is he? Look?

219
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,220
Which one? Huh?

220
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,392
Ah shit, man! It's this guy!
This bastard's the monster!

221
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,602
Wow, he's acting like a human, I guess.

222
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,147
Shit, he really does look human.
Crazy, huh?

223
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
Listen to me, all right?

224
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,784
Tell me what happened to you and Su-in.

225
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,078
Every possible detail you can.

226
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
You got that?

227
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,175
Route 39, you said?
Good, okay. Thanks a bunch.

228
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
Hey, no problem, sir.

229
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,679
Take care of yourself.
Be safe out there, okay?

230
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,473
Hey, just following orders.
I'd better head out.

231
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,808
Let's meet up soon, okay?

232
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,144
-Fight on!
-Fight on!

233
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,701
When is the transfer?

234
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,660
Two hours.

235
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,288
They're gonna transport her on Route 39.

236
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,581
Understood.

237
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm handling things on my end,

238
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,169
so why are all these issues
just coming up now?

239
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,089
I mean, do we… do we still move forward?

240
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,716
We do.

241
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,302
And it begins today.

242
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,705
I begged Mr. Chul-min

243
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,874
to please let me go
and see my mom just once,

244
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,210
so he found her new address for me.

245
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,213
I was so curious.

246
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,091
"Will my mom have missed me?"

247
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,556
"I'm the child she bore first,
so shouldn't she miss me?"

248
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,269
I saw just how much happier
she seemed with her son

249
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,604
and how she cared for him and her husband.

250
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,650
But she looked at me

251
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,486
like I was a disgusting bug.

252
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,117
How could she do that to me?

253
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,747
I'm her child too. How could she do that?

254
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,709
How can I be the one person
who makes her sick?

255
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,463
So that's when I knew…

256
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,592
that I was just born rotten.

257
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,764
I was a person
that nobody could ever love.

258
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,106
Su-in, you can't show up here again.

259
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,425
Your kind cannot consider one another
independent of context…

260
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,597
as your mother was living with a husband
who was violent to her.

261
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,642
Thus, you are a reminder of those days.

262
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,687
So rather than disliking you as a person,

263
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,233
her memories of you are
now tangled in that pain,

264
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,112
and so she reacts
as if you are repulsive to her.

265
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,282
It is untrue that you bear
any curse or affliction.

266
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,784
It is true.

267
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,204
It's just like how you took this body
as your own.

268
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,832
The reason you could make me like this

269
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,417
is you got someone who's under a curse.

270
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
It is not because I chose this
that we are here.

271
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,966
Had we been unable to combine,

272
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,801
then we both would have died.

273
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,636
Then I would have rather died!

274
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,098
Why did you turn me
into a monster? Why?

275
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,327
Your explanation

276
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,331
is that Su-in's hosting a parasite somehow
inside of her?

277
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,374
Mm-hmm.

278
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,293
Even though, uh, how can I say this?

279
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,628
Her personality is still part of her.

280
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,255
-Right?
-Ah, jeez.

281
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,465
Not just her personality is there.

282
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,551
Jeong Su-in is still the same as usual.

283
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,887
Jeong Su-in is the main being.

284
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,055
There are times when her, uh…

285
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,390
We call it Heidi.

286
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,058
Heidi will lend a hand.

287
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,311
So what's Heidi's goal, then?

288
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,146
It's to guard Su-in.

289
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,273
Why? So it's safe too.

290
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,820
-Let's talk at the station.
-Oh, come on!

291
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
I just told you
there's a monster there, dude.

292
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,409
Just kill me now! It's kinder!

293
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,433
Mmm, what?

294
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,357
Oh shit.

295
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,778
Su-in's going to Grey HQ this afternoon.

296
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,571
She'll die if they take her there.

297
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,159
Somehow, her consciousness is still there,
so she's a human being.

298
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,662
They can't send a human being to death.

299
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,997
Mm-hmm. Yeah, so?

300
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,165
Hey.

301
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
You're part of this.

302
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,588
We're gonna get her out before then.

303
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,550
-How though?
-Listen to me.

304
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,137
If you can get Su-in back for me,
I assure you, I'll protect you.

305
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,723
Okay? Just trust me.

306
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,518
I can get Team Grey on my side.

307
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,895
It seems to me they don't know
much more about the parasites

308
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,605
than anybody else in this world.

309
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,483
And then there's the parasite
that… that they captured.

310
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,027
You saw him get murdered. You see?

311
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,863
You and Su-in have…
you have all the information

312
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,699
that Team Grey needs right now.

313
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,076
I'll use it to try
and make a deal with them.

314
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,413
But what if
they don't believe all that?

315
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,373
Hey, what's the point
of Team Grey anyway, huh?

316
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,417
The point is
to protect humans from parasites.

317
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,628
If we kill all the parasites
from Saejin Church,

318
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,631
if you prove that you can be helpful
in eradicating them,

319
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,091
it's case closed.

320
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm telling you, I'll protect you!

321
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,096
All right.

322
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,515
I swear. If anything happens,

323
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,352
I'll smuggle you out of the country
to a safe place, okay?

324
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,109
I actually get to choose?

325
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,612
That's right.

326
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,281
What do you say?

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,452
Will you split and run
or help me save her?

328
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,877
Hey, asshole.

329
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,339
You know why you got betrayed
by your gang, and you're on the run now?

330
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,091
You're a goddamn coward, that's why.

331
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,801
Aren't you?

332
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,055
Your little sister was in their pantry.

333
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,182
Your older sister's been turned.

334
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,516
Right?

335
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,478
And Su-in, who saved you, is in danger.

336
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,897
And you're gonna bolt. That right?

337
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,233
You're a goddamn coward.
That's what you are.

338
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,446
You're just a bastard
who betrays the people who trust you.

339
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,405
No, wait.

340
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,032
"Betray" is not right.

341
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,285
You don't have the spine
to trust anybody else.

342
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,705
That's why you're always running
from everything.

343
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,833
The Mangnanis knew about you,

344
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,669
so they dumped your pathetic ass
to make a deal instead.

345
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,463
Yeah.

346
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,175
Get lost. Run.

347
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,428
I could never rescue Su-in
with a coward like you.

348
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,266
There's no point in giving scumbags
a chance for a fresh start.

349
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,269
Run.

350
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,647
Run away, you bastard!

351
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,901
And if you and I ever meet up,
I'll rip you apart, got that?

352
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,987
Christ. Piece of shit.

353
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,865
You fuckin' dickhole bastard.

354
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,162
Goddammit! Fuck this shit!

355
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,668
Ah shit!

356
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,338
Hey, have you ever considered
being a home-shopping guy?

357
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923
You're persuasive as hell.

358
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,217
You're really not that funny, so zip it.

359
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,511
I can only just tolerate you as is.

360
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,472
Right. So tell me your plan.

361
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,145
NAMIL POLICE STATION

362
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,691
Listen up.
I'll give you an access card.

363
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,527
Take it up to the second floor. Got it?

364
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,073
Wear this.

365
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,453
Down the hallway on the right is
the locker room Team Grey is assigned to.

366
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,123
We should arrive back there
in time for the guard change.

367
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,708
You'll go in with the guard,

368
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,210
then you take him out
and go to the container.

369
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,962
Won't I be noticed?

370
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,466
The task force was formed
less than a month ago.

371
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,217
They barely recognize each other.

372
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,971
All you have to do is
go in and act natural, okay?

373
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,600
LOCKER ROOM

374
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,818
Hey, can you take someone out
by yourself if you need to?

375
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,821
Hey, I'm not a pussy.
Just one cop? Of course!

376
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,119
Elite ones?

377
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,080
Who are you?

378
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,666
Come on! I was a marine!

379
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,587
Hey! Who the hell are you?

380
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,547
How did you get in here?

381
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,428
Hey, I just asked you--

382
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,399
Here. Take this.

383
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,611
-What is it?
-It's pepper spray.

384
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,780
Seriously?

385
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,074
No, I don't need that. No. Christ!

386
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,368
Are you kidding? Shit!

387
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,828
Just take it.

388
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,039
You little shit!

389
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,425
Got a large size here, huh?

390
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,447
All officers,
check in with your team lead,

391
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,825
then form up by unit.

392
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey.

393
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,675
That little son of a bitch.

394
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,350
Once you get inside,

395
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,937
find the remote
that controls the mask on Su-in's head.

396
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,939
Hey, you're late.

397
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,359
Ah, there's nothing special here,
so just wait until they head out.

398
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,778
-Have a good one.
-Mm-hmm.

399
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,370
Wait a minute.

400
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,668
Did you eat dinner?

401
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,629
The menu any good?

402
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,926
Oh, it was good, huh?

403
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,596
Okay, but what is it?

404
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,478
Hey, what unit are you from again?

405
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,573
Well, you promise it's good though?

406
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,035
All right. Good luck.

407
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,169
Okay, everyone.

408
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,297
We're taking off earlier than planned,
so let's get prepared.

409
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,308
I'm gonna take the remote control myself.

410
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,733
Someone should travel with her
so her condition can be monitored.

411
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,985
You. Get in the container.

412
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,821
Do you read me, soldier?

413
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,199
All right, let's load up and move out.

414
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,284
Right away, ma'am.

415
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,413
Hey, didn't you hear her?
Hurry up and go. Hurry.

416
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,665
In there.

417
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,378
Hey, uh…

418
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,760
Hey, everyone move! Quickly!

419
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,512
-Let's move. Everybody.
-Yes, ma'am.

420
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,514
-Move it!
-Let's keep it up!

421
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,643
Goddammit.

422
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
-Oh shit.
-Hurry up!

423
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,980
All right.
Come on back. Come on back.

424
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,446
Keep going. Yeah, further back.

425
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,205
All troops,
start boarding your vehicles and stand by.

426
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,422
I shouldn't have trusted
that piece of trash. Shit.

427
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,132
Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait.

428
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,760
-I knew it. Wow.
-What are you…

429
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,719
I knew you'd be here,

430
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,014
so I told the chief that
we could help provide support out there.

431
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,183
We should brief later. I did good.

432
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,394
Yeah. Great thinking.

433
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,109
Time to go.

434
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,447
Vehicles departing.

435
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,325
All units
follow the lead transport vehicle.

436
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,710
Su-in.

437
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,338
Heidi? Anybody? Wake up.

438
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,479
Jeez,
every cop in the city's out here.

439
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,242
Wow, I… We're just transferring one girl,

440
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,869
but this turnout,
I mean, it's overkill, isn't it?

441
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,287
Don't you think?

442
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,206
Yeah.

443
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,293
You're tense. Why's that?

444
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:39,963
Tense?

445
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,468
You said once we transfer her,
they're gonna split her open.

446
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,220
That's why.

447
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,349
-Ah jeez.
-Hey.

448
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,060
You go to church, right?

449
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,021
What church is that again?

450
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
Why do you wanna know?

451
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,779
Huh?

452
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,532
Uh, it's just hilarious, that's all.

453
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,702
Not like you'd go with me, man.

454
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,746
Damn right.

455
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,219
What's the situation up there, lead?

456
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,931
Traffic congested
a hundred meters ahead.

457
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,016
Stay vigilant.

458
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,726
Get out and check what's going on.

459
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,062
Copy. Two men moving to the front.

460
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,279
We're stuck?

461
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,206
What is it? Some kind of crash?

462
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,124
-What is it?
-Whoa! What the heck?

463
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,091
Found the issue.
We're inspecting the scene.

464
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,098
Seems like there's an accident.

465
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,692
Emergency! Emergency!

466
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,320
Man down! We need reinforcements!

467
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,373
Multiple casualties! We're under attack!

468
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,791
They're here for the Dog.

469
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,209
Make it quick. Pull out.

470
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,962
Multiple targets identified
among the civilians!

471
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,225
We need backup!
Multiple parasites! Engaging in combat!

472
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,227
Evacuate! Evacuate!

473
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,270
Go, go, go!

474
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,938
Evacuate! Move back!

475
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,189
Shit.

476
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,191
Evacuate now!

477
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,881
We have to evacuate everybody.

478
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,135
Multiple parasites identified!
Send reinforcements!

479
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,265
Shit!

480
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,516
What was that?

481
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,228
Hey, prioritize the people. Ah shit!

482
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,273
Okay, okay! Everyone, come out!
Hey, hey, hey, get out!

483
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,150
Hey, hey!
Out of the car! Hurry!

484
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,069
Get back! Hurry! Get out now!

485
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,529
Don't stay in your car! Hurry!

486
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,058
Parasites are coming up
onto the bridge!

487
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,031
Transport vehicle, status report!
Transport vehicle, status--

488
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,681
Goddammit!

489
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,195
Hey. Hey, you okay?

490
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,947
Jeong Su-in?

491
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,074
Heidi!

492
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,153
Shit!

493
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,704
Who the hell are you, asshole?

494
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,083
Ah shit!

495
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,443
Ah shit!

496
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,009
There have always been people
trying to help you,

497
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,720
even when you considered yourself
to be a monster.

498
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,226
Simply by acknowledging

499
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,355
that there are people who
think of them and care for them,

500
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,108
humans know they are not alone.

501
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,111
You did well.

502
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,530
That was so brave, Su-in.

503
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,658
You rescued yourself, isn't that right?

504
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,378
Ah shit!

505
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,465
Hey, let's go home, huh?

506
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,884
Which one do I push, huh?

507
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,052
Oh fuck!

508
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,473
Ah, I don't know. Shit!

509
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,312
Whoa! That did it!

510
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,231
And now, you have to return.

511
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,160
Hey.

512
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,043
What…

513
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,587
There's no time, hurry!

514
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,505
Get up.

515
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:44,965
Careful, now.

516
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,265
Hold on! Hey, hey, hey!

517
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,184
Wait, wait, wait.

518
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,686
-Police. We need to check your car.
-Huh?

519
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,356
A vehicle has been stolen.
Please get out of the car.

520
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,817
-Step out now, sir.
-Wait. But this is my car.

521
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,155
No!

522
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

523
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,498
Stop!

524
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,208
Stop!

525
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,716
Chul-min! Get in the car! Quick, get in!

526
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,260
Hurry up!

527
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,108
That damn monster tried to murder us!

528
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,484
-Shit!
-What monster?

529
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,611
Help me understand this.

530
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,780
Was that Chul-min by those cars?

531
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:54,493
Yeah. He and I decided
to bust you outta that place, okay?

532
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,662
We're almost through it too!

533
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,040
Just back up, okay? Who's the monster?

534
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,877
Huh? It's that one cop who shot at us.

535
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,170
He's a monster.

536
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,214
Remember that monster in the iron mask?
He killed that monster.

537
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,757
How else can I explain it?

538
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:33,949
Won-seok?

539
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,784
Tell me what's up.

540
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,004
What? Where'd they go?

541
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,757
Hey, your cop did something.

542
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,677
Can you pull over here?

543
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,679
-What?
-He's with a monster. Stop!

544
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,264
-Are you nuts?
-Just pull over!

545
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,807
Hey!

546
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,399
Hey!

547
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,653
Oh shit.

548
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,073
Hey, I'm tapping out!

549
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,367
Fuck, goddammit.

550
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,172
So what is this?

551
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,843
Let's stop the pretense.

552
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,482
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

553
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,320
Listen.

554
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,242
As you know, in our line of work,

555
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:02,371
we chase after deadbeat criminal punks,
night after night, and how are we repaid?

556
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,289
Huh?

557
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,959
We're constantly criticized.
We get beaten up and stabbed.

558
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,796
And even after all that bullshit,
we barely even get a raise.

559
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,465
We can't afford our kids' tuition,

560
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,926
let alone live up
to basic human standards.

561
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,970
You're out of your mind, aren't ya?

562
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,017
"If someone had just explained it,
I'd never have joined!'

563
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,893
You always said that, remember?

564
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,522
If opportunity knocks on the door,

565
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,816
open it.

566
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,945
You're not the man I know.

567
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,782
You asked me what church I go to.

568
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,204
I go to Saejin Church.

569
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,425
Chul-min, can you put that down
and hear me out?

570
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,178
It's different there

571
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:00,971
at Saejin.

572
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,349
How to put it?

573
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,102
These things are more intelligent.

574
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,731
They have a clear comprehension
of our society. They see the truth.

575
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,317
Unlike us human beings, they're rational.

576
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,444
See, all I am

577
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,947
is a man who's tired of waiting
for a chance.

578
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,493
So I just… opened the door.

579
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,122
You shouldn't miss this opportunity. Okay?

580
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,082
Please.

581
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,875
Chul-min.

582
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,419
Come on, I promise. It's for the best.

583
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,630
I don't wanna kill you.

584
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,632
Just trust me.

585
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,426
That's why you killed the Hunting Dog.

586
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,024
Whoa!

587
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,450
Jeong Su-in! Jeong Su-in! Get in, hurry!

588
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,048
You want 'em caught?

589
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,092
Since they both run from us now,

590
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,720
it suggests they desire self-preservation.

591
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,182
They will not be a threat to us now.

592
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,271
And this body requires more practice.

593
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,950
Sir, no more parasites in the vicinity.

594
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,868
Assess civilian
and team casualties

595
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,119
and bring in forensics.

596
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,339
Jeong Su-in, you okay?

597
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,508
Heidi, you there?

598
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,969
Just tell me how she is, all right?

599
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,556
Jeong Su-in needs time now
to process this.

600
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,477
Time enough to heal.

601
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,414
You should change.
There's blood on you.
