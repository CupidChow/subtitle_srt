1
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,936
Hey, that's
a really expensive watch, okay?

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,396
It's a limited edition.

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,859
It's a little bit old, looks like.

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,654
1.5 million.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,240
-Only that much?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,827
Oh Christ.

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,373
Yeah, I guess I can work with that.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,131
Okay, here's one million won first.

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,262
The remaining 500,000.

10
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,140
Jeez, this area sure has changed a lot.

11
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,683
Huh?

12
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,144
It's just not like it was, you know?

13
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,064
Come on.
Who wears a watch like this these days?

14
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,149
That watch is a fake, anyway.

15
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,108
What?

16
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,755
It doesn't work.
Can you reconnect it?

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,050
Yes, of course.
Uh, your account's past due.

18
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,384
80,000 won.

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,222
Mmm.

20
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,267
-Please just get it done soon.
-Yes, will do, sir.

21
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,417
You planning to toss this?

22
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,087
No way! I don't make money by toss--

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,966
Uh, a belt will make it run like new.

24
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,597
Hmm?

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,559
-What, man?
-Huh?

26
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,394
No smoking?

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
-Uh, no smoking, but you're good.
-Mmm.

28
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,191
How much you want for it?

29
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,237
Uh, shit, I'd give it to you for 350k.

30
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,241
This whole area
is shady these days.

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,200
What?

32
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,536
Let's say 200.

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,538
Yeah, right. No way!

34
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,666
Changing the belt would cost
almost as much as that. No way.

35
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,042
Fine, all right.

36
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm grabbing a phone real quick.
Get it ready.

37
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,381
Fine. Just stay close!

38
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,475
Hey, guy, is my phone ready?

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,978
Ah, yes, it's ready. Here you go, sir.

40
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,106
KANG-WOO'S FRIEND KI-SEOK

41
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,404
-The person you have called…
-Uh, Excuse me?

42
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,739
Please try--

43
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,241
Earlier this morning,
I had some guys asking for you.

44
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,579
They looked around, showed your picture.
Pretty persistent.

45
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,125
Hmm. Well, here. A tip.

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,627
-Oh, thank you.
-Mmm.

47
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,464
Hey, hey, hey, what's up with the bike?

48
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,216
Hey, what's been taking so long?

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,219
-You're back already?
-Yeah, hurry up, I'm busy.

50
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,013
Uh, I need parts,
but not too long now, okay?

51
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
Ah shit. You sold me out, dude?

52
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,521
Sorry.

53
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,190
Seol Kang-woo!

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,902
Oh no! Don't break that!

55
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,057
Come here!

56
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,459
Move it!
Get out of the way! Hey! Fuck!

57
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,549
-He's right there, go!
-Grab him! Let's go!

58
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,801
Hey, hey!

59
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,512
Come on!
You want some of this, you little--

60
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,186
Hurry! Let's get him, go!

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,398
-Get him!
-Get him, you bastards!

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,859
Hurry up!

63
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,527
Stop!

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,616
Open this gate, you son of a bitch!

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,702
Let's go around! Hurry, go around!

66
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,590
Whoa, hey!

67
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,760
Got something to say? What?

68
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,283
Did they all forget
the time I worked delivery out here?

69
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,326
Christ.

70
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,162
Ah shit.

71
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,007
-Hello?
-Mmm, Kyu-min, hey.

72
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,801
Hey, Kang-woo! Are you all right?

73
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,428
Yeongdeungpo guys jumped me, dude.

74
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,931
Shit, Kang-woo.
Where are you? What happened?

75
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,015
A lot.

76
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,434
They had two vans chock-full of assholes.

77
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,852
Wait, what? You serious?

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,147
I think it's best I get outta here.
I'll head outta town.

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,732
Send me some cash here, man.

80
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,734
Christ, as if money is all you need?

81
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,946
You'll need a car and shit.
I'll just come to where you are.

82
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,239
Yeah, I appreciate it.

83
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,323
How's Jong-do been?

84
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,493
Jong-do is really worried.
Saying he made you do him a favor.

85
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,454
Ah, don't worry about us over here.
Just tell me where you are.

86
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,166
-I'll head right over.
-Oh, no, no, no. I… I can't meet up now.

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,501
We'll meet up later.

88
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,337
-I got a few things to do.
-Aren't Yeongdeungpo guys on your tail?

89
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,923
Other things are important
right now, okay?

90
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,926
-Don't take it out on me.
-Let's meet up about 9:00.

91
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,678
-Okay, sure.
-Text you a place, okay?

92
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
All right. Be careful out there.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,306
Know this number now, right?

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,808
Yeah, got it. See you later.

95
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,151
Where are you, little sis?

96
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,708
SAEJIN

97
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,457
PARASYTE: THE GREY

98
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,960
Ah, good work, everyone.
Can I go in?

99
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,213
-Okay, go ahead.
-I'm with Team Three.

100
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,637
Wow, jeez.

101
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,061
-Hi.
-Oh, hello.

102
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,315
I'll bring that in, Detective. Thanks.

103
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,817
Oh, no, it's okay.
Is the Team Captain here?

104
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,486
Yeah, she's right back there. Go ahead.

105
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,445
Ah.

106
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,579
Uh…

107
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,250
Hi, Miss Choi.
Thanks for your hard work.

108
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,292
Ah, thanks.

109
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,712
Here. Some of those…
…cases you asked for.

110
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,297
I'm grateful, Detective.

111
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,132
Kang Won-seok, miss.

112
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,219
I'm grateful, Kang Won-seok.

113
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,263
You know,
we could've reviewed this for you.

114
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,306
Ah, our team prefers to inspect these

115
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,059
since we're familiar
with parasite-type cases.

116
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,894
Ah, that's true.

117
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,482
Anything more, then, before you go?

118
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,192
Ah, right.

119
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,695
Uh…
I'm actually… You see, I'm…

120
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,991
PROFESSOR CHOI JUN-KYUNG'S
CRIMINAL PROFILING

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,451
I'm such a big fan.

122
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,622
You're the top profiler in Korea,
and you train all our best units.

123
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,832
Would you…

124
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,918
Do you mind si… signing the book
for me, Miss Choi?

125
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,379
-Yeah.
-Amazing! I appreciate this! Wow!

126
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,880
Thanks a lot.

127
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,259
I mean, you're the best.

128
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,513
You could be a professor and take it easy,
but you do fieldwork instead.

129
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,807
-Seems so honorable.
-It's nothing.

130
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,643
It's my goal
to create a more secure world.

131
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,563
Ah, trying to guard humanity. Cool.

132
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,317
So, uh, how does
someone get put on this team?

133
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,068
What?

134
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,739
You know, I wanna do something
to make a more secure world for everybody.

135
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,451
Uh, well,

136
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,745
if you actively cooperate here

137
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,706
and can help us
track down some of the parasites,

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,376
I might… say something
to headquarters for you.

139
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,128
You mean it? Thanks, Miss Choi!

140
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,506
And any way I can help you,
no matter how small,

141
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,593
uh, please call me, and I can rush over.

142
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,510
Here. My card.

143
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,889
-There.
-Mmm. Great.

144
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,100
-Ah, hmm. See you. Thanks.
-Okay.

145
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,687
And, uh, for humankind… Go, Team Grey.

146
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,147
Mmm.

147
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,774
Right, I'll…

148
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:11,045
CASE FILE: ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF SUPERMARKET CLERK

149
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,189
5,500 won.

150
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,234
Okay, can you print a receipt?
I can get reimbursed for it.

151
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,028
It's you. Hi.

152
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,571
Could we, uh, have a chat?

153
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,700
In 15 minutes.

154
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,785
I'll sit out back until then.

155
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,079
-Coffee's on me.
-Great.

156
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,676
They say she's unharmed,
except she's been in a coma.

157
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,928
And her clothes were soaked
in her own blood too.

158
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,806
I was about to die out there,

159
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,308
and then, instead of me, he died?

160
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,814
Detective?

161
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,524
-Oh.
-What brings you here?

162
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,445
What do you mean? To see you, that's all.

163
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,740
Is that so? A surprise visit, then?

164
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,700
Surprise? No.

165
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,453
I was in the area anyway, so…

166
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,926
Uh, wait, let me… I'll grab it.

167
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,262
-Oh? Uh…
-It's a gray hair here.

168
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,764
No, I don't have any…

169
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,184
Hey, that's not a gray hair.

170
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,103
Guess I'm wrong.

171
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,814
Everything good?

172
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,320
Hmm?

173
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,156
I'm all right.

174
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,784
Same as always, I suppose.

175
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
Great, good.

176
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,456
And you can always call me
if you need to, okay?

177
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,459
Promise? You'll call?

178
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:15,961
Okay.

179
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
You know that boy?

180
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,773
I don't. No.

181
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,402
So how are your wife and son?

182
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,363
Uh, in the Philippines still.

183
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,616
Seems he keeps working hard in school.

184
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,951
Jeez, it's some time now.

185
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,204
Years. I get so bored most days.

186
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,792
So, you, uh, you better call me soon.
We'll grab dinner, just the two of us.

187
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,001
Okay.

188
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,212
Anything at all, just call. All right?

189
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,176
It means so much, really.

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,978
It means so much, huh?
Well, I guess that's my cue to scram.

191
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Nice seeing ya.

192
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,357
-Hey, I didn't tell you to go!
-No, no, I'm going. Oh, almost forgot.

193
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,359
For you.

194
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,280
What is this?

195
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,447
A present.

196
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,074
Stay strong.

197
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,201
But don't work too hard, okay?

198
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,454
Take care, Detective.

199
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,421
SAEJIN CHURCH

200
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,356
The pastor is anxious to talk with you.

201
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,483
Get in the vehicle.

202
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,954
I do not want trouble with our kin
with so many humans nearby.

203
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,997
Get in quickly.

204
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,683
What are you weirdos up to now?

205
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,318
You see, we need kin
with strong abilities.

206
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,782
Once the host's brain is eaten,
we must then advance our talents

207
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,950
in order to live on.

208
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,453
I told the pastor you imitate
the countenance of earthlings well.

209
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,831
Because of that, he will meet you.

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,084
That is why you are here.

211
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,188
SAEJIN CHURCH

212
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,361
The mutant's here?

213
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,615
Oh shit, I told her
not to go near the monsters.

214
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,367
Man, she just doesn't listen.

215
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,165
The fuck?

216
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,842
KYU-MIN: I'M AT NAMCHEON GAS STATION
WHERE ARE YOU?

217
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,138
I'LL BE THERE SOON

218
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,917
We are all gathered, so we shall begin.

219
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,129
One of our kin, who escaped to join us,

220
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,340
had this dire message.

221
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,599
I have learned
of a police organization

222
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,519
that is actively hunting down our kin.

223
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,231
And one of our kin has been captured alive

224
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,067
and held by that same police squad.

225
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,862
They are torturing him and using him

226
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,491
to hunt down
and execute the rest of our kin.

227
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,702
It is only a matter of time

228
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,207
before that woman discovers our kin
and destroys us all.

229
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,628
If we kin are to survive,
a plan is necessary.

230
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,174
Without one, I have no doubt that woman

231
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,302
will proceed to track us

232
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,180
and show no hesitation to kill us all.

233
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,319
Not long ago, our kin appeared on Earth
with one goal in mind.

234
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,365
Take over human brains.

235
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,619
Take over and proceed
to eat all humankind.

236
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
We kin are all born

237
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,791
with that simple, driving instinct.

238
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,087
Yet, unfortunately, one of us began to act
on that simple instinct

239
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,465
as he took control
in a place people had gathered

240
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,926
and brought these hunters down on us.

241
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,055
His true form was exposed
to countless people at that time.

242
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,266
And because of this,

243
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,936
the human's research into us
has proceeded quite rapidly.

244
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,692
We were not given a chance
to examine our own existence,

245
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,779
as they chose to conduct their research.

246
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,156
They chased us

247
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,660
and took our own kin hostage
to use as an agent of our extermination.

248
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,245
I have learned

249
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,208
they have come to our city
to continue their slaughter.

250
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,447
Although humans are weaker in some ways,

251
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,824
we have no choice
except to depend on humans

252
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,743
as we subsist on their bodies.

253
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,870
Yet, I'm certain

254
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:57,417
our genesis can be traced directly,
without doubt, to those same exact humans.

255
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,296
We now know humans are actually
very much like us.

256
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,424
They also feed on something.

257
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,179
A great force called "the organization"
is what feeds them all.

258
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,764
This organization is intangible,

259
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,767
yet they sacrifice themselves for it
as they parasitize it.

260
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,353
They do things we cannot understand

261
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,772
that are unrelated
to the human's own survival

262
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,358
and that serve
to further this sole ambition.

263
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,116
That is why the stronger combatants
in the contest between us

264
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,033
are the humans.

265
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,539
Since we cannot reproduce
to ensure our continued existence,

266
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,876
we are now compelled
to construct a diametric cooperative.

267
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,798
Thusly, we have to combine
all our singular talents

268
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,174
to enhance that organization.

269
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,929
This strategy is the only option

270
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,850
to ensure
the continued existence of our kin,

271
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,145
or we will be exterminated.

272
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,545
Die! Die!

273
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,672
Die! Die!

274
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,434
We have been discovered just now.

275
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,441
Go kill the human
using the skills we have been honing.

276
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,694
Do it now. Spare no haste.

277
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,237
Go forth and slay him.

278
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,877
Enough already, okay?
We're both exhausted.

279
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,713
Hey! Get in the car!
If we stay here, we're all gonna die!

280
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,214
-What the hell is this?
-Turn around!

281
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,799
-Bastard. Are you nuts?
-Run!

282
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,468
-Hold him down.
-Just listen!

283
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,596
Let go! Hey, we gotta run! Run! Hey!

284
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,600
Those guys are monsters.

285
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,520
Hey there, folks. Why don't you guys go?
This isn't any business of yours.

286
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,399
These men are trespassers.

287
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,276
What the hell is she saying?

288
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,653
I said you should go!

289
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,158
In any case, I think
we must now destroy them all.

290
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,954
Hey, old guy.

291
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,333
You must have good life insurance, huh?

292
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,293
-I said--
-Oh shit!

293
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,879
What is that?

294
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,963
Wh… what is that?

295
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,759
What is that?

296
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
Let's get 'em.

297
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,183
What the fu--

298
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:29,958
Ah shit.

299
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,298
What? You're the trespasser?

300
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,383
The gas station?

301
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,301
-Huh? Tell me! Where?
-What?

302
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,804
Not that way. Here. This way. Go!

303
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,033
A human escaped us.

304
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,702
I will take care of this.

305
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,912
These humans can go to the pantry.

306
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:23,511
NAMCHEON GAS STATION

307
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,682
The person
you have called is currently unavailable.

308
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,350
Please try again later.

309
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,229
Why won't he pick up the phone?

310
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,278
-Kang-woo!
-Kyu-min!

311
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,865
Kyu-min! Give it to me!
Give me the car key! The key!

312
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,408
-The car key?
-The key!

313
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,659
-Hey, wait. I--
-Get in!

314
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,924
Kang-woo, what's going on?

315
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,594
-Fuck, man. Not right now.
-And who the hell is this girl?

316
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,056
Kang-woo, what just happened?
Was it Yeongdeungpo guys?

317
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,015
Nah.

318
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,351
Call the cops, okay?

319
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,436
The cops? No, wait. What happened, dude?

320
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

321
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,026
You can't do that!
Don't you call the fucking cops right now!

322
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,363
Did the guys from Yeongdeungpo
try to kill you?

323
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,989
All those assholes are toast! Shit!

324
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,285
Hey, how'd they know where I was, huh?

325
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,328
Who ratted to 'em?

326
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,921
Die, bastard!

327
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,678
Die!

328
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,693
Son of a bitch!

329
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,788
They're on us!

330
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,184
Your turn!
Hurry up and do something!

331
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,313
I said do something!

332
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,113
Ah shit, man.

333
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,096
Kyu-min. Kyu-min.

334
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,723
Kyu-min, Kyu-min, wake up. Hey.

335
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,143
Hey.

336
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,353
Think you can get out?

337
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,021
We gotta go.

338
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,274
Those stupid Yeongdeungpo guys
tricked you, man, huh?

339
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,318
You're wrong.

340
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,237
It wasn't them at all.

341
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,032
Jong-do told me that you had to die.

342
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,037
Hey. That's bullshit, man.

343
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,208
No, he made a deal to kill you

344
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,419
just to make peace with those guys.

345
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,841
Hyung, you gotta
keep your head on straight, man.

346
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,770
Oh, goddamnit.
Why is everyone screwing around?

347
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,026
Let go!

348
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,622
Then you are not of our kin?

349
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,460
So what are you?

350
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,004
Have you fused with the human?

351
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,799
Then you are a threat to my kin.

352
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,385
I must tell the pastor of this.

353
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,698
I see your combat abilities are very poor.

354
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,577
You focused instead
on a complex skill like flying.

355
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,622
A terrible pity.

356
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,373
Now, you

357
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,918
choose to work against us all.

358
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,753
I can see

359
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,213
you are…

360
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,800
a scourge on us.

361
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,316
Let go!

362
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,443
I said let go!

363
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,695
Let go, you bastard! Let go!

364
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,656
I can't die! Damn it!

365
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,241
I wanna live, you asshole!

366
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,213
What are you doing?

367
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,093
You trying to die? Huh?

368
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,345
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

369
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,434
Ah shit!

370
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,019
I can't reach!

371
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,729
Grab on to me! Hurry!

372
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,755
She is utterly helpless, the one inside.

373
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,666
CASE FILE: ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF SUPERMARKET CLERK

374
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,628
"In order
to kill the market clerk,

375
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,966
it looks like Lee Kyung-chun, 43,
with two priors for violent acts…"

376
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,054
"In the end, the suspect died
of unknown trauma."

377
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,683
"His plan to kill the clerk
ultimately failed." Huh.

378
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
So she's a parasite.

379
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,485
Jeong Su-in.
