1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,388
You always buy so much food.

2
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,598
Are we gonna be able to eat all this?

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,392
We'll eat it all sooner or later.

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,561
Oh my gosh.

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,564
Oh, the receipt.
You know, to get our parking validated.

6
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,233
It can't be that much.
Let's just head out, honey.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,903
It's all right, just wait for me.
Start the car, and I'll be right back.

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,447
Jun-kyung. Jun-kyung!

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,075
Lord, what a penny-pincher.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,330
She's still a total mystery.

11
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,049
What is that?

12
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,694
Everybody run! He just killed someone!

13
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,411
Hey, come back!

14
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,627
Honey!

15
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,921
Honey, wait!

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
-Wait! What are you doing?
-Look out, he's coming!

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,842
-Get out of here!
-He's right there!

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,993
Mommy!

19
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,663
Mommy, where are you?

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,958
Mommy!

21
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,544
Mommy, where are you?

22
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,878
Su-jin!

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,091
Thank God! Su-jin!

24
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,927
-Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
-Mommy! Mommy!

25
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,567
PARASYTE: THE GREY

26
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
-Hey, could I get one of those?
-Hmm.

27
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,333
A thousand won.

28
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,713
They charge for a toothbrush
in this town? Shit.

29
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,675
If it's just lightly used,
I can return it, huh?

30
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
Which one are you?

31
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,734
I can't tell. Just Su-in?

32
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,949
Yeah, it's just you.

33
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,743
Sit down for a minute. Let's talk.

34
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,585
Okay. Now, I'm gonna tell you
what you need to hear, hmm?

35
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,130
Listenin' to me in there, Mr. Hyde?

36
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll take that as a yes.

37
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,682
The best thing we can do now…
is tell someone what we saw out there.

38
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,477
-The authorities?
-Yeah.

39
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,480
We can tell them that Saejin Church
is full of dead bodies.

40
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,608
I won't give our names
so we don't end up being hunted.

41
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,567
Seem good?

42
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,613
I actually know a police officer.

43
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,074
It's someone you trust?

44
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,286
I had to turn in my dad
to the authorities,

45
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,747
and this man was the one who responded.

46
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,207
You reported your dad?

47
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,419
Yeah, my dad was abusive,

48
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,174
and this man helped me
get away from my dad.

49
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,217
Jesus.

50
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,678
Can't catch a break, can you? That's nuts.

51
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,807
Report it to him, then. Hmm?

52
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,517
A call should do.

53
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,147
Are you on board, then? Mr. Hyde?

54
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,191
We're all on the same page here, right?

55
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,486
Hyde sounds too scary.
What's a good name, hmm?

56
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,947
Heidi? Or is that a bit much?

57
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,824
A bit much, huh?

58
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,868
Anyway, Miss Heidi,

59
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,622
it doesn't matter
if those things are family to you.

60
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,792
I gotta report it for my family.

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,424
My older sister, Kyung-hee

62
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,301
and Jin-hee too.

63
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,558
I don't know much, but I know
I can't forgive… what they did there.

64
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,819
Sorry.

65
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,946
Hey, no, no.

66
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,490
Don't be sorry, no.

67
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,491
Right, let's go.

68
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,369
Let's go call the police, hmm? Come on.

69
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
Got any coins?

70
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,216
Hey, Min-su.

71
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,552
-Yes, sir?
-About this file-- Excuse me.

72
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,016
-Yes, hello? Yeah, go send it out.
-Is this Detective Chul-min?

73
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:55,933
Who is this?

74
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,186
Uh, who I am isn't relevant right now.

75
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,355
Uh, there's something
you really gotta hear, okay?

76
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,649
Hey, wait, how'd you get this number?

77
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,195
Y… you don't need to know that, sir.
It's safer like this.

78
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,449
Uh, so in Namcheon,
there's a church there, you know?

79
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,452
Saejin Church, and it's way out
in the mountains, okay?

80
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,622
And there's a bunch of monsters
out there, man.

81
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,833
-Actual monsters.
-What?

82
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,668
Yeah, they look like humans,

83
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,713
and then they open their heads,
like…

84
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,966
…and then tentacle-looking things,
like, launch out.

85
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,928
That's what they use as weapons
to go after people and kill them.

86
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,931
Anyway, there's a bunch of bodies
out there.

87
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,974
Yeah, I did my part, then.
So there, it's reported.

88
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,684
May I ask who you are--

89
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,902
Damn, I never thought
I'd report anything to the cops. Shit.

90
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,239
How will we know whether or not
they actually do anything?

91
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,115
We'll just call him back up again.

92
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,619
So, for now, let's just try
to lie low somewhere.

93
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,246
Why?

94
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,583
It's like… there are two of you guys,
and I'm alone,

95
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,877
so Heidi's, like, insurance
so I don't get hurt.

96
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,713
I… I have to go to work.

97
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,840
Where?

98
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,384
Market.

99
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,348
Yes, hello, this is Su-in's cousin.
Sorry to bother you.

100
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,017
Yeah, I dropped by to bring some food
and to check up on her,

101
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,604
and, uh, she's coughing
and seems flushed too.

102
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,024
Yeah, exactly,
so she won't be in today for work.

103
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,486
Of course. That's really kind of you.

104
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,405
I'll certainly take care of her,

105
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,408
and I'll make sure to come in
and thank you when she's better.

106
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,368
Thanks.

107
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,456
You're a great liar. It's incredible.

108
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,334
I did theater in middle school.

109
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,379
It was, uh, an all-boys school.

110
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,298
I was Juliet.

111
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,592
SAEJIN CHURCH

112
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,512
Saejin Church, huh?

113
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,308
Why's it out in the middle of nowhere?

114
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,063
Does the source seem credible to you?

115
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,566
We just got a tip-off, so why not?

116
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,818
And anyway…

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,114
about the monsters he said he saw.

118
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,782
That description?

119
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,577
The parasites look just like that.

120
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,786
Ah, think so?

121
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,333
So if there's a group up there,
what do we do?

122
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,337
I better tell Team Grey, then, right?

123
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,255
Not so fast.

124
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,883
We don't even know who called it in.

125
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,885
I'll come back.
Just Team Grey should be told--

126
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,845
Calm down, man, breathe.

127
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,890
And what if they really are at the church?

128
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,768
I'll handle it.

129
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,937
Sh, okay?

130
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, Detective Kim.

131
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,583
Ah, yes, hello.

132
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,168
I was just on my way to see you.

133
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,504
Ah, really? Uh, about what?

134
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,131
Well, you know that girl, Jeong Su-in?

135
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,343
I see you handled
two reports involving her, right?

136
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,595
One was years back, and one's recent.

137
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,430
ATTEMPTED MURDER OF SUPERMARKET CLERK

138
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,974
Yeah.

139
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,893
She works at a grocery store.

140
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,729
Something happened with an upset customer.

141
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,273
We caught up yesterday.

142
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,067
She's working hard at the market.

143
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,488
I made sure to pluck a hair out.

144
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,781
She passed the test.

145
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,618
Hmm. I guess you two share a close bond.

146
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,037
What brings you out here?

147
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,706
Uh…

148
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,585
Uh, a tip-off was called in
regarding Saejin Church.

149
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,422
And the man said
monsters are running around up there.

150
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,049
The man said monsters?

151
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,844
Does it seem like this tip could be
something credible?

152
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,305
I can't really be sure.
It's just the man described creatures--

153
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,224
-Miss Choi.
-Uh…

154
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,397
Seems you were spot-on, then.

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,190
-Get the team ready.
-Yes, ma'am.

156
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,193
-Thank you for the tip.
-What?

157
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,863
Oh, uh, the tipster's identity…

158
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,701
Ah shit.

159
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,955
Hey, grab the boys
and meet me at the church.

160
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
-Let's hurry, guys!
-Yes, sir!

161
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,384
Hey, channel five. Channel five!

162
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,178
Copy.
We'll contact you on arrival.

163
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,390
This is getting crazy.

164
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,769
Shit. Come on, let's go.

165
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,005
So what's that smaller building?

166
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,549
Looks like a warehouse,
except it's got AC.

167
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,594
-Search that building as well, then.
-Yes, ma'am.

168
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,930
It just seems so quiet.

169
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,603
Well, then?

170
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,314
Did they all disappear?

171
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,775
All of them?

172
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,200
If they do show up,
you just let me know, okay?

173
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,410
Press your little button.

174
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,248
What does he have in his hand?
Some kinda remote or something?

175
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,999
If parasites are nearby,

176
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,335
he can just send a warning
by pressing that.

177
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,550
If he hasn't sensed them, that must mean
there are no more parasites here.

178
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,134
Or perhaps he's lying to us.

179
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,886
-Huh?
-Ma'am, we're ready to enter.

180
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,096
Get started.

181
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,512
Lift the tarp.

182
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,604
We've found body parts in the warehouse.

183
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,447
It must've been
one of their pantries.

184
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,412
Right side, clear.

185
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
Left side, clear. All clear.

186
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,560
Not much left to investigate.

187
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,272
-Ah shit.
-I'll take a look over there.

188
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,028
The hell happened here?

189
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,258
For you.

190
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,220
What is this?

191
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,193
Have you found anything?

192
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,029
Uh…

193
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,031
uh, no, no.

194
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
Seems pretty much empty here?

195
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,285
What about next door?

196
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,956
Complete chaos.
You should really come see.

197
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,056
As you can see, the bodies we found there

198
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,434
had been mutilated and cut into pieces,

199
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,644
so it'll take time
to count all the victims

200
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,895
and to identify them all.

201
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,732
So far, we have over 500 body parts.

202
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,692
We'll analyze the DNA of each part

203
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,445
in order to verify their identity
and reunite them.

204
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
We need help to accomplish this,

205
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,615
so we'll bring in
nearby forensic teams to assist.

206
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,035
Does the church belong to anyone?

207
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,165
Kwon Hyuk-ju, 42 years old.

208
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,333
He's a pastor
who started the church 15 years ago.

209
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,502
And where is this pastor now?

210
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,132
A few weeks ago, his wife disappeared,
as reported by her family.

211
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,010
It seems that he has disappeared, too,
so reports say.

212
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,888
Then they're likely parasites now.

213
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,183
Or I suppose one changed into a parasite
and ate the other.

214
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,353
Was there anything else found
at the church?

215
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,773
It seems a large number
were meeting there,

216
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,775
but they changed locations

217
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,027
and took some important evidence
with them.

218
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,616
Detective Kim, anything you can add?

219
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,785
Uh, about what?

220
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,914
Your Namil officers
may know something of importance.

221
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,291
Well, no. None of my men know much at all.

222
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,087
You know,
we've never seen anything like this.

223
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,547
So, no, there's nothing to report.

224
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,551
That pastor needs to be found
before we make any moves.

225
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,554
Let's try looking
for the pastor's place of residence

226
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,056
to get us started.

227
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,600
A Namil officer
could try taking point on that.

228
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,895
Ah, oh, I'll start, miss. I got it.

229
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,440
Great. Let's begin
our Saejin Church inquiry.

230
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,776
Let's be detailed and precise,
but be quick.

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,320
Uh, okay, then.

232
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,659
Need a hand?

233
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,161
Uh, no, it's just legwork. I can do it.

234
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,556
Sweetie, hi.

235
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,808
Daddy, I got a perfect score
on my English test!

236
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,685
Oh wow! Wow, did you?

237
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,687
You must be a smarty, huh?

238
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,730
-You have the top score?
-Yeah, I do!

239
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,566
Oh, that's great! That's great!

240
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,235
Wow, sweetie! That's really great, huh?

241
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,405
-I'll get you yummy treats later, okay?
-Okay.

242
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,865
-Sound fun?
-Come home soon!

243
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,867
Okay, yeah, see ya, hon.

244
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,989
Goodness, you're all looking really good.

245
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,076
Pastor, wow!

246
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,163
Your chapel looks like
it's full of benevolence.

247
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,290
It's not bad for a last-second find.

248
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,084
Well, then.

249
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,588
Were you eating your meal?

250
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,007
Our escape was possible thanks to you.

251
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,342
Oh, don't mention it.

252
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,968
Uh, we cut it close.

253
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,554
A bit later, you might not have
made it out of there alive.

254
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,848
Do you know how they found us?

255
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,767
I dunno.

256
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,062
See, we got an anonymous report
called in to us.

257
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,232
It's a man, from what I heard.
What's going on?

258
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,525
My host's younger relation, I assume.

259
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,444
We must catch him.

260
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,655
What of the one who gave chase?

261
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,907
Found dead.

262
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,535
Judging from the trauma,
it does look like our kin did it.

263
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,832
Why would you kill your own kind?
I mean, jeez. Seriously? That's so sick.

264
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,585
At a time when you need all-hands-on-deck.

265
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,506
And now you guys start
betraying each other? Seriously?

266
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,549
A losing team's not much fun, you know?

267
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,593
"Betray"?

268
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,722
I just meant-- Sorry, that was too harsh.

269
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,936
It is unlike you to say such things.

270
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,063
Is this, then…

271
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,653
…"humor," as your kind calls it?

272
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,825
Yeah.
Keep on practicing, I guess.

273
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
Anyway, how, uh, secure is this place?

274
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,250
While they use the Hunting Dog,
no place is completely secure.

275
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,086
The Hunting Dog must not live.

276
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,215
Ah, you have to complicate things,
don't you?

277
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,553
A weapon?

278
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,221
You will need this blade.

279
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,976
We made it as similar
to our tentacles as possible.

280
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,187
The Hunting Dog will know its comrades,

281
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,815
so we cannot attempt an assassination.

282
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,240
This task is now yours to carry out.

283
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,665
This area of Dongyeong-dong
was slated for redevelopment.

284
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,252
Meanwhile, people are heading out
in droves to enjoy the wonderful weather--

285
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,296
Namcheon City will soon hold the opening…

286
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,131
Why isn't it on the news already?

287
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,968
They could've taken care of it discreetly.

288
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,807
MR. CHUL-MIN

289
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
Who's that?

290
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,021
The cop guy? Answer it.

291
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,190
Answer, we need more info.

292
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,735
Hello, Detective?

293
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,944
Su-in, hi.

294
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,112
Hey.

295
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,572
Uh…

296
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,742
uh, can we meet up later today?

297
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,078
I wanna discuss something.

298
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,665
Gimme a minute to check my schedule.
I… I'll call you back.

299
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,793
Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

300
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,260
Ask him what happened.

301
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,638
But then he'd know that we made that call.

302
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,765
Oh, true, huh? So what?

303
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,768
He told me he wants to get together.

304
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,605
Hey, remember how I got betrayed?

305
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,982
Can you be sure that he's not in on it?

306
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,778
No, he's probably
the most trustworthy person I know.

307
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,447
It's not like we have
any other options, right?

308
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,573
Okay.

309
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,702
To be sure, text him you want
someplace totally remote, okay?

310
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,788
I'm not trusting anybody right now.

311
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,337
Say Changseong Amusement Park.
Half an hour.

312
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,591
Looks good.

313
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
LET'S MEET AT CHANGSEONG THEME PARK
IN 30 MINUTES

314
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,569
Jesus, it really hurts, man!
Seriously, it hurts a lot!

315
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,195
-Come on!
-Let go of me!

316
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,864
Hey, let go of me! Let me go!

317
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,533
-Let go of me already!
-You need to cooperate.

318
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,201
-I will, Jesus!
-Back off!

319
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,911
Seriously?

320
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,331
Uh, can you also

321
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,001
contact the traffic department
for their assistance?

322
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,295
And put a tail on Detective Kim.

323
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,265
Yeah?

324
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,476
In the field, you know that.

325
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,686
Dispatched? Right now?

326
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,983
No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, I'll be there.
Send the location.

327
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay.

328
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,501
CHANGSEONG THEME PARK

329
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,840
I didn't even know this was here.

330
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,133
Didn't know the park?

331
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,929
When I was little,
I'd sneak in all the time with my sisters,

332
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,430
and we'd just mess around.

333
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,307
See that over there?

334
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,477
Rumor said someone fell from there,
so the place closed.

335
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,898
You know, nobody died.
It's just a stupid rumor.

336
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,403
So you talked about your dad earlier.

337
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,782
Is your mother around?

338
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,078
She's moved on to someone new.
Got another kid.

339
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,664
We've all seen that before, yeah.

340
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,667
Just stay busy and keep moving.
Life, right?

341
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,504
Now, we're sorta like orphans, huh?

342
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,756
We should stick together.

343
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,593
We're adults now. We're not orphans.

344
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,597
Everybody ends up alone, anyway.

345
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,604
Hey, Su-in.

346
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,650
Just hang on.

347
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,986
And you are?

348
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,449
Oh, hey. I work as her guardian.
We're both orphanage brats.

349
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,660
Is that so? You can wait here.

350
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,371
Su-in, can I talk to you real quick?

351
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,710
Detective, is something wrong?

352
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,756
The keychain I got for you.
Do you have it on you?

353
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,927
It's gone missing. Sorry.

354
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,356
Where did you find my…

355
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,359
It was at Saejin Church.

356
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,445
What happened out there?

357
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,616
It's all right. You can tell me the truth.

358
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,707
Su-in.

359
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,586
Are you in danger?

360
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,005
No, it's not that.

361
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:23,952
One of your kin?

362
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
Where are you?

363
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,879
Ten minutes?

364
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm going in without you.
Just meet me here.

365
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,111
They found us. We have to go.

366
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,113
Let's hurry up. We gotta go.

367
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,324
Su-in, look at me, please.
Tell me what happened.

368
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,576
No, I can't explain now.

369
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,910
Su-in, wait!

370
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,329
-We have to go.
-Are you really Su-in? Back off!

371
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,998
Detective!

372
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,167
-Who are you? Tell me who this is?
-Just let him go!

373
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,377
-Tell me now!
-Detective, it's not like that!

374
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,212
-Saejin Church, come on!
-What?

375
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,843
So you're the one that called us, huh?

376
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,012
What do you know?

377
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,723
Saejin Church was full of bodies, kid!

378
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,433
Huh? What'd you see?

379
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,776
No, Detective!

380
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,653
We gotta go!
Come on! Come on, let's go!

381
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,614
Ah shit!

382
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,099
Over here.

383
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,810
Get down.

384
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,544
Shit.

385
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,518
-Trace her location!
-Yes, sir!

386
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,103
Move! Hurry up, let's go!

387
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,442
Quick! Let's go!

388
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,956
Hey, I think we might need Heidi.

389
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,834
As it is, we are trapped.

390
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,794
Shit! Fuck! Don't scare me like that.

391
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,507
I can take care of that one there.
You can escape and run.

392
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,467
And then, you…

393
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,469
Once she is dispatched, I shall run.

394
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,600
Okay, I'm gonna go steal a ride,
and I'll honk beep beep beep, okay?

395
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,643
That's your signal.

396
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,394
Whatever you do, hurry.

397
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,896
Time is limited.

398
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,359
Ah shit!

399
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,158
Miss Choi is this way!

400
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,411
Team Alpha, proceed inside.
Team Bravo, secure the perimeter.

401
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,454
Move in now!

402
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,873
Roger that.

403
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,757
All clear.

404
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,343
No visual on the target. Moving in.

405
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,522
Ah Christ!

406
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,161
Target spotted.

407
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,498
Stop!
We're warning you! Step back!

408
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,631
Miss Choi, are you all right?

409
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,508
Let go!

410
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,878
Still another parasite, I guess.

411
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,508
You two, stay close. Let's get going.

412
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,094
We're gonna catch that bitch alive
or kill her here.

413
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,718
Why would you shame yourself
by turning against your own kin?

415
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,783
Su-in.

416
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,411
-Detective Kim, stop.
-Move.

417
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,204
-Move it, jackass!
-Detective!

418
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,706
Stop! It's dangerous!

419
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,126
Detective.

420
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,088
-Su-in.
-Get away from her.

421
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,716
She could turn into a parasite any second.

422
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,885
Bring paramedics.

423
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,681
I said bring the paramedics right now!
She's hurt!

424
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,350
We've been ordered to kill her!
Step aside, Detective!

425
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,936
Hey, you can't kill this girl.

426
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,607
Can't you see? She's human. A normal girl.

427
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,525
Please just bring the damn paramedics!

428
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,527
She's a parasite, not a human being!

429
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,904
Get away from her now!

430
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,339
Ah shit.

431
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,968
She's fucked. I did what I could.

432
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,804
Goddammit.

433
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,102
Lower your guns.

434
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,522
I said lower your weapons!

435
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,067
Detective Kim,
this is your last warning.

436
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,820
If you don't move,
we have no choice but to fire!

437
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,947
I swear, she's not a parasite.

438
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,241
Please! Don't.

439
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,286
Seriously? What the hell are you doing?

440
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,203
No!

441
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,085
What is that thing?
What is that? What are you doing?

442
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,797
Let me go!

443
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,882
Let me go, you bastards!
