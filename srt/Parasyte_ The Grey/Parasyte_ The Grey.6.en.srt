1
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,601
Ah shit!

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,645
Oh, Deacon Kang!

3
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,439
That was actually a nice shot!

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,568
Jeez, I wanted to play
a round of golf with you,

5
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,820
but my goodness,
I don't ever seem to get any better.

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,072
Hey, just come along anyway!

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,577
Ah, you must plan on sending Ju-eun
to study abroad, don't you?

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,120
I don't know.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,330
Our daughter's still so young.

10
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,916
Oh! What are you saying?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,086
Young children
can learn languages better, you know.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,546
You're right.

13
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,173
Actually, I'm quite worried.

14
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,760
If they're behind already,
how can they succeed?

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,597
I just worry that our kids
will end up just like us.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,099
Hey, stop it.
You're gonna embarrass me. Come on.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,642
But it's the truth.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,520
Your career has no future.
Not with a cop's salary.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,398
And there's no promotion for you in sight.

20
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,901
I know that if we all pray hard together,

21
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,279
then you're bound to receive a miracle
to set everything right.

22
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,031
Amen, miss.

23
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,365
Mm-hmm. Yes.

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,952
Well, speaking of prayers,
it's about our pastor.

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,789
Just last week,
he didn't come to the service.

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,540
-Hmm.
-Did you hear anything?

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,459
No, nothing.

28
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,461
And I heard at the hair salon earlier

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,464
that there might be trouble
with the pastor's wife.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,924
Like, she was anxious.

31
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,427
I'm worried about her.
I haven't been able to reach her at all.

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,182
Say, how about I check in on them later
on my patrol? I'm happy to.

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,476
-So nobody worries? Yeah.
-Oh! Thanks!

34
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,687
Where are people sending their kids
to study these days?

35
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,272
Well, I've heard Canada is--

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,594
The story today is about
Korean tidal flats.

37
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,389
It was discovered
that tidal flats can absorb carbon,

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,224
which has sparked a lot of interest.

39
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,228
The academic world calls tidal flats
a blue carbon ecosystem

40
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,188
since they help reduce greenhouse gases.

41
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,690
Pastor Kwon?

42
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,567
…who will fill us in on the ways Korea…

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,529
Huh? Oh, uh, you're in here, Pastor.

44
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,533
Please welcome Professor Yoon Ji-hun
from Hankuk University.

45
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,327
-Yes, hello. I'm Yoon Ji-hun.
-Professor Yoon…

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,081
Professor Yoon. Professor Yoon.
Professor Yoon. Professor Yoon.

47
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,374
Professor Yoon.

48
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,211
T… tidal flats. Tidal flats. Tidal flats.

49
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,713
-Pastor Kwon?
-Flats.

50
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,592
There are a number of factors
that impact tidal flat formation.

51
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,179
It is often said that there are at least
three oceanographic conditions…

52
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,931
Oceanographic conditions.

53
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,808
Uh, can you excuse me a minute?

54
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,979
Oc… Oc… Oc… ocean, ocean.

55
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,538
Pastor Kwon.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,217
Oh my God! Wh-- what the--

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,010
What is--

58
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,056
You… are an agent of law?

59
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,515
Wha…

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,774
Our kind was created
with one single mandate to obey.

61
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,942
One true cause.

62
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,403
"To eat… humankind."

63
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,823
So I carried out
thorough research on humans

64
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,992
and the vast domain that they have built.

65
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,830
Compared to Earth's numerous creatures,
you are unique.

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,667
Humans have built a very

67
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,627
interesting system.

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
You do not need to fear me.

69
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,843
I intend for you and I to join as allies.

70
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,471
And I believe,

71
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
as partners, you will also gain.

72
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,061
If you do not find my offer to be

73
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,688
suitable,

74
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,482
then this is where you will die.

75
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,360
Just wait. I--

76
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,613
You see,

77
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,867
controlling a single host is inadequate.

78
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,121
I want to govern
a human organization myself.

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,500
Attach myself as a parasite
to the institution,

80
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,546
and then I can head humanity.

81
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,312
What is that awkward smile?

82
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,023
It is better to appear serious, correct?

83
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,484
Ah, you really are adapting quickly now.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,361
So you know,

85
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,990
this plan of yours, if it does happen,

86
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,454
I just think I could do a lot for you
if I was on the National Assembly.

87
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,621
How does that sound?

88
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,667
Then take whatever position you desire.

89
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,755
This organization is nearly ours.

90
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,652
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE PARASITES IN NAMIL-GUN

91
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,949
Good morning.

92
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,120
I am the leader of Violent Crimes Team,
Kim Chul-min. Thank you for being here.

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,541
Today, I will give you a status update
regarding our parasite investigation.

94
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,589
Recently, the Namil Police,
together with the parasite task force,

95
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,717
executed a very thorough
purge operation in the area.

96
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,764
Now, Namil-gun stands as an area
that is almost entirely rid of parasites.

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,308
However, some survived,

98
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,228
and we know they are hiding somewhere
in this region.

99
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,106
Even so, the Korean music festival

100
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,109
and the memorial
in honor of Choi Yeong-jae

101
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,610
will go ahead as planned.

102
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,071
We continue to urge the public
to remain vigilant

103
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,407
until we've eradicated all parasites

104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,034
and they can threaten our freedom no more.

105
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,747
It has been decided

106
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,251
to make this information
on these two individuals known

107
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,420
so we can locate them with your help.

108
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,298
First, Jeong Su-in. Twenty-nine years old.

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,427
Second, Seol Kyung-hee.
Forty-five years old.

110
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,681
Both women are current residents
of Namil-gun.

111
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,142
Their height is about 160 centimeters.

112
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,436
The two women pictured here…

113
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,312
Here's your bag, sir. Thanks.

114
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,232
Cash?

115
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,360
…witness anyone else
exhibiting strange behavior,

116
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,903
please send in a tip

117
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,156
or call in to report it right away
to the police

118
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,742
or the parasite task force
here at the National Police Agency.

119
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,162
All the information collected about them

120
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,832
is on the National Police Agency's website
so everyone can see it.

121
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,459
Once again,

122
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,920
we urge you to provide any information
you may have to the authorities

123
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,549
and to continue to offer us
your cooperation in these times.

124
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,676
That's you for everybody to see.

125
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,844
Let's be on guard.

126
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,389
Why would they do this?
Why take it this far?

127
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,601
The mayor is going to come
to the festival here.

128
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,022
If Heidi and that other monster show up,
things will get crazy.

129
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,233
He'll jump bodies
to be mayor right then and there.

130
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,113
KYUNG-HEE

131
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,536
It's me. What?

132
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,455
It is your sister.

133
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,584
Bitch, I suggest
that you skip the "family ties" bullshit.

134
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,044
Let us meet.

135
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,796
Is this a joke, bitch? Don't mess around.

136
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,467
Tell the woman who is of our kind.

137
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,677
She will be a better adjudicator.

138
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,262
Fuck that shit.

139
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,516
Go ahead.

140
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,810
If you saw the news, you know
that you and I are in similar straits.

141
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,271
Now, we must cooperate.

142
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,066
You will come to Cheongil Garden.

143
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,196
Wait, don't tell me you're going?

144
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,783
The thing that killed my friend Chul-min

145
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,203
is totally focused on being made
into the leader of a whole city.

146
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,416
So what? Us two won't stand a chance.

147
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,169
So let's expand our team a bit, then.

148
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,595
PARASYTE: THE GREY

149
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,638
Thank you.

150
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,478
Good work.

151
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,479
Thanks.

152
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,196
That briefing of yours was remarkable.

153
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,115
Ah, thanks.

154
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,702
As we planned, right?
Or is there some problem with it now?

155
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,829
I wouldn't say mistakes were made.

156
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,915
Although, you really looked out
for Jeong Su-in

157
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,460
so much throughout this whole process.

158
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,380
Except it seems
your perspective has shifted.

159
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,175
It seems so?

160
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,262
Taking care of people
takes priority over my own beliefs.

161
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,556
Is that so?

162
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,393
You remember a little while ago
at Saejin Church

163
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,312
when we broke up that group of parasites?

164
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,065
You found something of hers
and put it in your pocket,

165
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,902
then met her later on
to return it at the park that day.

166
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,780
So what was it that you found there?

167
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
Does that really matter that much now?

168
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,419
You must remember what it was. Seriously?

169
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,506
Or are you trying to deny
that you found something of hers?

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,716
Would you care to elucidate?

171
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,722
You see, he's a big teddy bear, you know?

172
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,808
All right, then,
we'd better be going, yeah?

173
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,476
Let's go.

174
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,941
She is suspicious, I think.

175
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,192
Let's eliminate her.

176
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,529
-It needs to be a mishap, then.
-Like what?

177
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,824
Do as humans do.

178
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,076
Use the organization.

179
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,005
Hey, this is it?
This the place she picked out?

180
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,425
I can sense her.

181
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,385
I know she's nearby.

182
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,180
She picked a garden? Really?

183
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,978
If Heidi and that monster
start a brawl here, we're caught.

184
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,688
She will know that as well.

185
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,523
You scared me. Shit.

186
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,150
You are going to remain here.

187
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,776
Why?

188
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,947
You will be an encumbrance at this moment
because a part of you wants her dead.

189
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,849
Why did you ask to meet?

190
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,519
You and I must destroy
the traitor to our kind.

191
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,315
The one who merged with Kim Chul-min
and was once the pastor.

192
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,609
I must kill him.

193
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,780
His appearance on the news today
was surely meant to provoke us.

194
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,907
It is an obvious trap.

195
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,951
He wants to draw us to him,
then he'll strike.

196
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,454
And how is that relevant?

197
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,542
I will destroy him, as I said.

198
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,588
But he is parasitizing
a human organization.

199
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,966
Organizations are amazing things.

200
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,596
A creature on its own can prove feeble,

201
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,726
but an organization formed by individuals
is highly resilient and powerful.

202
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,522
He understood this and made use of it.

203
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,690
So you want our assistance?

204
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,445
The human I am now integrated with
may comply, though I cannot.

205
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,826
Well, you must want him punished too.

206
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,747
It is an unreasonable request
that unnecessarily risks our existence.

207
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,293
Existence?

208
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,130
And is that what matters the most to you?

209
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,313
Look at this man.

210
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,483
He tried to strike at me,
knowing I'm stronger.

211
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,986
It was not a rational choice he made,

212
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,406
but I can understand now
what made him still try foolishly.

213
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,784
I came to understand it
when our kind were killed by the pastor.

214
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,037
Shit! Just stop acting
like you understand!

215
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,124
We cannot reproduce to survive.

216
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,918
But we cannot live independent of humans.

217
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,673
All we can do is live as parasites
on the human body.

218
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,468
Whose fault is all that? Huh?

219
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,729
No one's fault.

220
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,689
We were never given a choice,

221
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,609
so we examined this proposition.

222
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,405
We asked, "Why do we exist at all?"

223
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,076
Then one of our kind explained it.

224
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,039
We exist so we can protect each other.

225
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,959
We exist in order
to take care of each other.

226
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,297
And so an organization
will help us hold on together.

227
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,135
And it is the one who helped us believe
in this meaning…

228
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
that I want to destroy completely.

229
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,934
Hey, don't be an idiot.

230
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
Anytime the guy in charge says that,

231
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,105
he's just gonna stab you
right in the back to get ahead.

232
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,151
What do you know of his intent?

233
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,569
You wanna know?

234
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,156
It's the folk music festival
'cause the mayor's gonna be there.

235
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,117
And he wants to grab the mayor's head.

236
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,329
Assuming he grabs hold of the mayor,

237
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,166
it will soon be difficult for you two
to live with human beings.

238
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,586
In the end, the humans will kill you.

239
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,546
So what will you do?

240
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,549
Hey,
we're gonna kill that bastard

241
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,635
so the mayor won't get hurt.

242
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,095
And then, guess what.

243
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,638
You're next.

244
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,556
Yeah, that's my sister's body,

245
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,267
and I'm gonna pluck that
dirty head of yours right outta there.

246
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,062
Your plan will not go as you wish, human.

247
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,483
Until then, however,
it seems we all share a goal.

248
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,875
OPENING CEREMONY OF CHOI YONG-JAE
MEMORIAL HALL, A CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

249
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,239
Are the test results
I asked for ready yet?

250
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,119
Okay, on my way.

251
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,000
This is an image from the autopsy
of Hunting Dog Number One.

252
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,046
And this is an image of a weapon
that parasites can form from their bodies.

253
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,423
It's something we've seen
in various cases.

254
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,010
A mark like that…
Is there any way it can be reproduced?

255
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,721
We created a similar kind of wound pattern
by just making a cut…

256
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,724
…with a kitchen knife,
and as you can see,

257
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,809
the resulting wounds are similar.

258
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,729
So the Hunting Dog
could have been killed with a knife

259
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,481
that made it look like a parasite did it

260
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,691
when, in reality,
it was just a clever trick?

261
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,945
Yeah, that's not something we considered.

262
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,740
But it's definitely possible
that this was staged.

263
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,493
Do you want me to… review this case again?

264
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,788
That's all right.

265
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,374
Well, since nothing is certain,
let's just keep this private, okay?

266
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,335
Of course.

267
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,881
Yeah? At HQ.

268
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,592
What?

269
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,306
Ah, Miss Choi.

270
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,225
We've received your report.

271
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,977
There's a church in Gangwon-do marked
with the same symbol

272
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,063
that was found at Saejin Church.

273
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,397
A report?

274
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,024
When and where did you get it?

275
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,237
Detective Kim received an anonymous report
about the symbol a few hours back.

276
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,446
Detective Kim?

277
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,409
Namil-gun is
almost entirely free of parasites now.

278
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,496
Let's deploy Team Grey
to Gangwon-do to beat the parasites.

279
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
What do you think, Miss Choi?

280
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,293
We should be absolutely sure
that the information is solid first.

281
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,213
That's why we wanna send Team Grey
to assess things.

282
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,756
It's our best option.

283
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,717
Who will protect this area?

284
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,346
The local authorities should have
no issues handling any threats

285
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,597
that could arise here.

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,724
So it's decided.

287
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,102
You will go to Gangwon-do
to deal with the parasites.

288
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,326
The advance party
should get ready!

289
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,120
-Go to that side. Go over there.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,205
So what are they doing now?

291
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,417
Providing security at the event tonight
for the mayor of Namcheon.

292
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,839
Yeah? Jeong Su-in's not available now.

293
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,299
It is I.

294
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,220
Jeong Su-in?
Or are you the monster?

295
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,722
Correct, this is the monster
you want murdered.

296
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,393
Careful, I'll fall in love with you.

297
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,603
What's going on?

298
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,105
We have made a mistake.

299
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,233
As you said earlier,

300
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,735
Kang is human, or so we believe now.

301
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,238
He is not a parasite.

302
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,740
But he now serves the pastor,
who is their leader.

303
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,911
He is the one that killed
your dearly cherished Hunting Dog.

304
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,457
Plus, he helped the pastor
take over the body of his colleague.

305
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,337
Hang on.
You said he was a parasite earlier.

306
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,839
Now he's a human traitor?

307
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,094
So says a parasite
on the pastor's side before defecting.

308
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,013
But there is an even bigger problem.

309
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,807
They want control of the mayor.

310
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,103
The music festival is when
the intended swap-over will likely occur.

311
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,856
-What?
-Believe what I say.

312
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,025
We are going to the festival now

313
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,443
to kill him first.

314
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,531
Yet, there must be a contingency
should we not succeed.

315
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,576
So you should also come
and help us ensure that he dies.

316
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,505
So what'd she say about it all?

317
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,132
Not that much.

318
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,176
I will save my energy
for the music festival now.

319
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,886
It begins shortly.

320
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,472
Yeah, sure, go ahead. Night night.

321
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,026
Won-seok and the pastor killed him
because he figured out the truth.

322
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,236
Please believe me!

323
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,197
It's pretended to be the detective
since it took over his body.

324
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,490
I saw it all!

325
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,286
Turn around.

326
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,997
What? But what about Gangwon-do?

327
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,292
It's on me, all right? Just turn around.

328
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,085
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,013
Not much so far, for now.

330
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,474
He might just be
waiting for us to show up.

331
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,268
How's your end?

332
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,231
Yeah, it's like that here.

333
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,150
-Should we move in yet?
-No.

334
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,236
Let's try and stick to Heidi's plan.

335
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,697
He'll sense it
if unexpected parasites show up.

336
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,534
Stay out there for now.

337
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,870
I'll try to monitor things
and update you, okay?

338
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,416
-You should try some hotteok.
-Ah, sure.

339
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,459
This is the most renowned shop
in all of Namil-gun.

340
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,169
-Is that so?
-Yes, yes, yes.

341
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,254
-Hello.
-Hello.

342
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,090
-It looks delicious, doesn't it?
-All right. Just for the mayor.

343
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:49,886
Here's a fresh and hot one, sir.
Oh! Take care, sir. It's hot, like I said.

344
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,390
Oh no!

345
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,599
Oh! Oops!

346
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,726
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Oh my goodness.

347
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,604
It's so chewy. This is really good, wow!

348
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,983
Is it made with some of
our local flour as well?

349
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,943
-No, imported.
-Huh?

350
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,695
Ah…

351
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,866
See, Namil-gun is best known
for cooking up tasty foods of all types!

352
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,786
Your specialty is your cooking skills,
is that right?

353
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,746
Yes, our cooking skills are the best.

354
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,793
Hey, you guys.

355
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,796
Check the mayor's next tour area
and make sure it's clear. Head out.

356
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,006
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, boss.

357
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,845
Do we need others?

358
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,098
Human authorities are not expedient.

359
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:39,144
Heidi and I can work as partners,
disposing of the target without aid.

360
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,275
Heidi's not scared.
It's about me, in the end.

361
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,904
It's all because

362
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,864
of how I'm breakable.

363
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,076
Her luck was just so bad.

364
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,372
Happening to crawl
into a dying girl like me, I mean.

365
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,335
That's why we didn't swap entirely.

366
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,006
Because in order to live,
she had to save me first.

367
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,344
Now she's stuck, incomplete, in my body,

368
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,431
barely able to make her power last
a quarter of an hour.

369
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,393
I became her trap.

370
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,729
She's been made into a prisoner.

371
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,149
It is clear now

372
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,777
why she is that strong.

373
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,487
What?

374
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,617
Generally, when our kind claims a human
and takes control of the brain,

375
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,870
the host's body
is not really part of us in any way.

376
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,957
Much as the car you drive
is not really part of you.

377
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,293
It can be replaced as may be necessary.

378
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,381
Because Heidi cannot replace her host,

379
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,008
she has to protect it as a part of her.

380
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,136
That is why Heidi has to be strong.

381
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,722
She always fights so desperately

382
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,058
in order to protect you.

383
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,026
He's moving now.

384
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,444
To where?

385
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,843
Mayor! This way!

386
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,777
Enter the festival grounds.

387
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,237
Move, move, move!

388
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,839
Go find the mayor. Now.

389
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,382
-Right away, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

390
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,577
Outta their fucking minds?

391
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,249
Hurry, get up! Let's go! Quick! Let's go!

392
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,296
Hey, they're taking the mayor away.

393
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,632
Hey! Come on, hurry! Shit!

394
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,015
Jeong Su-in, it's time to surrender!

395
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,934
Come out!

396
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,354
I can handle that woman,
so you go ahead.

397
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,566
Good.
Just follow my instructions.

398
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,653
Ah shit.

399
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,307
Do you really need to kill me?

400
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,813
I simply want to exist like you.

401
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,401
I truly do not want to hurt you
or anybody else.

402
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,028
The choice is yours.

403
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,290
Hey, over here.

404
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,138
What the--

405
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,307
His head's gone.

406
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,189
Where are you?

407
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,691
The back lot? Roger that.

408
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,110
The back lot.
The car is still parked there.

409
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,114
The back lot, right? The back lot.

410
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,178
Seriously? Christ.

411
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,388
Hey!

412
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,937
We're on your side, okay?

413
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,480
He must poach a body soon or die.
So take that one and--

414
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,827
Hey, a… are you all right?

415
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,021
To you, I ask

416
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,315
for forgiveness.

417
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,871
How much longer you got?

418
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,336
Ah shit. Ah, there's nobody here

419
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,713
to swap your body. There's no one.

420
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,715
So how--

421
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,092
Where do we have to go?

422
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,095
-Huh?
-The back! The back lot!

423
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,596
-We have to hurry!
-The back?

424
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,731
What are you doing? Run!

425
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,237
To the right, the right!

426
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,532
Help! Help!

427
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,883
Hurry and escape this place now.

428
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,846
Heidi, Su-in, hang on.
I'll come back for you!

429
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,029
Hey, get him out of here!

430
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,948
-This way.
-Just get him outta here now!

431
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,117
Right inside.

432
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,642
Mutant.

433
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,938
The first time you came to the church,

434
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,025
why did you decide
to side with humans instead of us?

435
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,154
I did not think a mutant like me
could actually gain your trust.

436
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,740
Why did you think that way?

437
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,161
I saw the similarities to humans you had.

438
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,915
Similarities to humans. I see.

439
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,543
Yes, you are correct.

440
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,673
It is true that neither I nor the humans
would accept a mutant like you.

441
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,220
That is exactly what keeps
the human organization strong.

442
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,472
They label the majority normal,

443
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,433
while the minority of mutants
are called abnormal.

444
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,103
They obtain the support of the majority
and strengthen the organization.

445
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,147
That is how the great life-form

446
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,275
that we know as
the human organization is born.

447
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:21,822
And the power it wields is incomparable
to a life-form as fragile as our own.

448
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:27,745
Human organizations sacrifice countless
of their own kind for a single purpose.

449
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,542
And then, once they have achieved
what they aimed for,

450
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,923
they build a shrine to the memory
of the one who served as their head.

451
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,802
Memorial halls much the same as this.

452
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,992
Jeong Su-in!

453
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
Heidi?

454
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,251
Su-in? Su-in!

455
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,336
Ah shit!

456
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,885
Do you remember
the command given to us

457
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,512
at the moment of our birth?

458
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,640
"Take over a human brain."

459
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,809
I believe that command

460
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,521
did not simply mean to take over
the physical brain of a human.

461
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,027
I believe it meant to take over the brain
of the great, living human organization.

462
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,250
Su-in, join with me now.

463
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,337
If we cooperate,

464
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,630
we can rule it all.

465
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,133
Be the head of their organization.

466
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,512
The both of you freeze!

467
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,482
Shoot her.

468
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,031
Shoot her, Miss Choi!
Please hurry! Shoot her, now!

469
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,578
Or else she'll take your head
right where you stand!

470
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,705
Miss Choi, shoot now!

471
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,890
You knew he'd be the one
I shot at, I guess?

472
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,935
I did not.

473
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,521
I do not have any skills in telepathy.

474
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,442
So then, why wouldn't you rush me?
I had a gun.

475
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,695
It is because I trusted you.

476
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,075
Jeong Su-in is a strange creature.

477
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,829
She has been badly hurt
by those close to her.

478
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,832
And yet, it does not stop her
from trusting others.

479
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,002
She chooses to be a vulnerable entity.

480
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,880
That is the way she is.

481
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,634
I wanted to let her trust.

482
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,344
Act as my example.

483
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:20,060
Jeong Su-in mourns being kept distant
by the community of her own kin.

484
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,397
She wants to live among her people.

485
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,902
Su-in! Su-in!

486
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,947
Jeong Su-in! Su-in! Are you okay?

487
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,326
Su-in will be in your hands.

488
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,580
Hey, hey, hey! No!

489
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,500
Su-in! What do I do?

490
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,293
Hey, hey! Jeong Su-in!

491
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,421
Hey! What happened?
What the fuck happened?

492
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,048
Su-in! Su-in!

493
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,468
Miss Choi!

494
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,679
Get these two to the hospital.

495
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,058
Isn't Su-in a parasite, ma'am?

496
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,938
She's a normal young woman.

497
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,524
Su-in.

498
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,890
-So what "meow"?
-Huh?

499
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,604
Work.

500
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,397
When are you done?

501
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,233
In two hours.

502
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,282
Hey, you're working too hard.
Isn't it tough on you?

503
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,202
I'll be fine. How have you been?

504
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,455
Me?

505
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,665
I recently joined a new organization.

506
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,960
You joined a gang
after all you went through?

507
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,838
Hey, I mean, I can't start one myself.

508
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,091
And I can't stay a lone wolf forever.

509
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,844
The world's a tough place, as you know.

510
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,562
Mmm.

511
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,650
Impressive, right?

512
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,485
Seol Kang-woo of Team Grey?

513
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,322
That Miss Choi lady
even gave me these new threads.

514
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,740
I even got insurance.

515
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,117
You jealous?

516
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,495
I thought about it a lot.

517
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,748
The only real choice is
to give it another shot.

518
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:31,960
That's great.

519
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,129
That's really great.

520
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,138
What?

521
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,724
-Uh--
-Is something going on?

522
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,936
It's kinda weird,
but I got some mail, right?

523
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,896
And it's…

524
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,024
it's actually from Heidi.

525
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,239
She sent it to me and not you
'cause she wants me to read it out loud

526
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,074
in a human voice.

527
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,952
So here goes.

528
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,831
"Hello, Jeong Su-in."

529
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,125
Sorry, I'll cut it out.

530
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,047
"This is my first time writing a letter,
so please excuse any missteps."

531
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,927
"I have been thinking a great deal about
the meaning of our existence,

532
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,178
what others have said."

533
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,348
"While I have yet to come
to a final conclusion,

534
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:31,562
I consider it a great stroke of luck
that you are the human I parasitized

535
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,565
and that I was unable
to fully take over your brain."

536
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,238
Ooh. Okay, so this part here?

537
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,408
You read this sentence.
Uh, I just can't manage it.

538
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,409
Hmm.

539
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,385
Su-in!

540
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,973
So you know, Miss Choi said
she has a spot for you on the team.

541
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,060
So don't be a loner, okay?
Call me if you wanna talk about it.

542
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,645
See ya.

543
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,572
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

544
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,893
Refresh me. Who is this guy?

545
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,646
Some kind of journalist, he says.

546
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,274
He says he's an expert in the field
when it comes to parasites.

547
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,027
He told us he has
very important intelligence

548
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,445
he wants to share.

549
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,781
Oh yeah? You sure he's not just crazy?

550
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,880
I'm sorry we kept you waiting.

551
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,425
Let me introduce Miss Choi Jun-kyung,
the leader of Team Grey.

552
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,261
And you are?

553
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,055
Good afternoon.

554
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,473
My name is Shinichi.
