1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,560
Jin-hee.

2
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,814
You grow the crops by yourself,
and you run the store yourself too.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,607
Aren't you tired?

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,861
It's all right.
I'm just trying to help out.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,364
-Anyways, it's just for now, you know?
-Right.

6
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,785
Oh, someone said that your big sister's,
uh, starting to do better,

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,495
and she's getting out and about.

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,706
Uh, yeah.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,043
Apparently, she's feeling better now.

10
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,254
Yeah, but what if she gets sick again?
Better take her to the hospital

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,549
She just always says she's not going,

12
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,635
so I guess I'll have to
bring her myself tomorrow.

13
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,638
I'm sorry.
I hope she gets better real soon.

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,683
She was always like a mother
to you and your stupid brother.

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,103
Jeez. Kang-woo, that punk.

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,980
Where's his help when you need it?

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,649
That useless bastard. I can't believe it.

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,404
In Seoul, he'll be earning more money
to cover all the bills.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,741
What, do you think
that punk's gonna help you out?

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,119
Sorry, it must be
really hard for you guys.

21
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,705
That's it.

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,500
Right. Thank you, sir.

23
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,459
See ya.

24
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,225
Hey. Ki-seok, it's me. It's Jin-hee.

25
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,143
Hi, Jin-hee. How are you?

26
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,228
What's going on?

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,897
Uh, see, the thing is,

28
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,526
I'm wondering if you might've heard
from Kang-woo at all.

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,735
No.

30
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,030
It's been a while
since we lost touch. Bastard.

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,782
You got his number?

32
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,493
Yeah, it's just hard
to nail him down. I mean…

33
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,246
Try sending him a DM.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,997
A DM?

35
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,667
Yeah, with that online messenger thing.

36
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,003
Huh. Are you sure he still uses it?

37
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,925
Well, I'm not sure if he still checks it,
but he might see it later and call you.

38
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,760
Mm-hmm, yeah.

39
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,139
Okay, then a message it is.

40
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,807
Okay, call me again. Whenever.

41
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,725
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,570
Merry!

43
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,448
What, what, what, what?

44
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,244
Sh! Sh, sh.

45
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,417
Who is this?

46
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,879
This is my church pastor.

47
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,674
He's the man who stopped you
from seeing a doctor.

48
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,344
Sh, Merry.
What's up with you? Sh, sh.

49
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,514
Jin-hee, it is a pleasure.

50
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,559
She has told me about her family.

51
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,313
He drove all this way
to share prayers with us.

52
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,939
It's just…

53
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,319
I don't see how that might be of any help,
really, since hospitals cure you.

54
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,740
But, anyway,
we're both going to the hospital.

55
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,367
MRI scans will clear up all this.

56
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,161
I do not want to be examined.

57
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,163
Just trust me.

58
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,625
Do not worry
that your sister might be sick.

59
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,213
-God's power will heal her--
-Excuse me.

60
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,424
We're going to get a doctor
to check her out.

61
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,343
Just to be sure.

62
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,138
A doctor is not needed.

63
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,475
It's none of your business
if she sees a doctor or not.

64
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,157
This one cannot be allowed to escape.

65
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,993
It will cause us trouble
to handle it here.

66
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,287
This place is remote and isolated.

67
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,706
Kyung-hee,

68
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,416
what's happening?

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,338
You worry about
what is going on in my head.

70
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,351
Run away, Merry! Merry! No!

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,025
Help! Somebody, help! Someone help me!

72
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,208
KANG-WOO

73
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,720
Attention, last call…

74
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,846
KANG-WOO'S FRIEND KI-SEOK

75
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,600
The number you have dialed
has been disconnected…

76
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,061
Why does he gotta
ignore me right now?

77
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,021
Attention, last call…

78
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,275
IT'S ME KANG-WOO
PICK UP YOUR PHONE, DICKHEAD

79
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,116
It's me.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,868
Why are you using
Jin-hee's phone?

81
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,536
It's too long a story.

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,038
Living in Cheonan still?

83
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,999
No, I moved out.
I live in Jinyang now because of work.

84
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,210
Jinyang? Hey, you moved far, dude.

85
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,630
Do me a big favor here, man,
and let me crash?

86
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,756
Okay, when?

87
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,592
I dunno. Um, like, probably tonight,
say, in two hours.

88
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,052
CHOI YONG-JAE, CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

89
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,388
I'm not home right now.
I'm out taking care of something.

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,057
Hey, if I'm not wanted,
just say it already.

91
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,019
Jesus. Fine. I'll text you my address
and the passcode. Wait inside.

92
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,145
Great, see you soon.

93
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,528
Ah shit.

94
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,077
Hey.

95
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,579
You done changing yet?

96
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,041
'Cause we gotta take off.

97
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,545
So hurry up and finish. Let's go.

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,632
Hey, we gotta go!

99
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,959
UNIT 402, CHANGJIN STUDIO APT.
CODE 0823

100
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,386
PARASYTE: THE GREY

101
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:39,143
There are eyewitness videos
that are becoming viral online, sir. Look.

102
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,313
This is going on at the same time
as our folk music event.

103
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,148
It's troubling us all terribly.

104
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,901
We appreciate Namil-gun's predicament,

105
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,695
yet unlike any neighboring districts,

106
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,115
you are dealing with
an organized cell of parasites here.

107
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,118
So a large-scale
cleanup operation is inevitable.

108
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,248
Just give us more time,
and Jeong Su-in will be recaptured.

109
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,253
What's Namil Police's position on this?

110
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,880
We are also doing our very best,

111
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,591
yet our primary function is
to assist Team Grey.

112
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,093
Well, in our case,

113
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,763
my chief is saying the Namil-gun Police
are supposed to take Miss Choi's orders,

114
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,640
so we can't operate as we see fit.

115
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,141
So that limits us somewhat.

116
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,769
All right, Team Leader Choi.

117
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,439
Because you worked independently
without sharing information,

118
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,900
the transfer operation
resulted in failure.

119
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,611
It's time to tell the public what we know

120
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,739
and use the extended reach
to gather more data.

121
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,159
We'll then work closely with local police
to destroy the parasites.

122
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,536
Understood?

123
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,954
Yes, sir, understood.

124
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,540
And what about us? Our music festival?

125
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,460
It cannot be held safely
until the organization has been disbanded.

126
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,506
I know all of the Namil Police officers,
and Team Grey will do their best

127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,593
to ensure that this is handled
before the event.

128
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,345
Do you people think this event is
some kind of joke?

129
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,431
We're commending a war hero!

130
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,101
Choi Yong-jae served Korea
as a civilian army leader, don't you know?

131
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,147
He led the Battle of Cheonryongsan!
We're opening a memorial in his name!

132
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,734
It's been a big part of
our development plans for years!

133
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,945
The lifeblood of the merchants
who live here depends on tourists!

134
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,240
And you expect us to cancel the memorial
and our music festival

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,366
because of monsters?

136
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,328
It's completely absurd to do such a thing.

137
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,038
And anyway, we have a guest.

138
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,457
Namcheon's mayor is attending this year!

139
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,292
I'll report this to the mayor!

140
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,294
Sir, please try to calm down.

141
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,380
Right now, we are doing all we can.

142
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,841
Well, this is
our mayor's final term this year.

143
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,428
And he's a key presidential candidate
for the upcoming year!

144
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,971
Our Korean Folk Music Festival

145
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,558
is the last big occasion
for him as mayor, understand?

146
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,227
It's not something we can cancel
just like that!

147
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,733
If I give you three days, Miss Choi,
can you get it done?

148
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Yes.

149
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,821
We don't have much time, so get to work.

150
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,291
It'll be tough, but as they say,
a crisis is really an opportunity.

151
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,959
It is a positive thing, then?

152
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
Your kind does enjoy drama, yes?

153
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,547
Wait, wait, wait. Go this way.

154
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,554
That time we

155
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,391
had Jeong Su-in examined here,

156
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,269
her X-rays came out normal.
How's that possible?

157
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,315
A mutant, no doubt.

158
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,484
Mu… mutant? What?

159
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,986
What kind of mutant
is yet to be discerned.

160
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,915
The girl who is of our kind and her ally
can be intercepted tonight.

161
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,626
She is not true kin.
She is a mutant variant.

162
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,461
Do you need support?

163
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,838
I do not.

164
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,381
She is very powerful.

165
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,967
I will not require assistance.

166
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,009
Very well.

167
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
Dispatch her and come
to the meeting place.

168
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,437
Well, whatever she's up to now,

169
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,315
we should get started
with the task at hand, shouldn't we?

170
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,904
Pastor.

171
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,991
I mean, Chul-min. Look at me, man.

172
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,954
Try to give me a little more meaningful
kinda look at a time like this, okay?

173
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,582
Uh… just copy this, okay?

174
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,542
Look at my face.

175
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,586
A meaningful look.

176
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,756
Yeah, like that. Good, smile wider.

177
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,342
Your eyes. Together with your eyes. Just--

178
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,594
Oh jeez.

179
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,570
Okay, over there.

180
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,090
So your friend lives here?

181
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,719
Ah, he's more like a brother,
not just a friend.

182
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,973
It's kinda like I'm the older brother
who protects his ass.

183
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,266
All right, we made it.

184
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,654
Ki-seok used to be a weak little asshole,
so he'd get beat up constantly.

185
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,281
So I took care of him, then.

186
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,534
Mmm. Nice of you.

187
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,660
What the hell?

188
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,620
He's ripped now?

189
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,088
So why did we come here?

190
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,551
Hey, I'm wiped out. I'm tired, okay?

191
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,680
We both need some rest,
and I wanna charge my phone.

192
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,019
And what we really need now
to keep on staying hidden is some money.

193
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,651
Hey, Ki-seok, hi.

194
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,319
Yeah, I got in.

195
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,946
Yeah.

196
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,031
Hey, when you head out,

197
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,284
grab, like, one…

198
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,077
No, no, bring, uh, two million won.

199
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,539
Hey, it's a real long story.

200
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,376
I'm joining a gym, okay?

201
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,670
So bring me cash.

202
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,260
Hey, get some rest here, okay?

203
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,558
When Ki-seok brings the money, then

204
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,395
let's run away
to somewhere remote and hide.

205
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,941
I won't be joining you.

206
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,652
Why not?

207
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,656
Do you plan on fighting?

208
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
They have to know.

209
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,703
About what though? Huh?

210
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,289
And besides, the cops are infested now.

211
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
So who you gonna talk to?

212
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,126
To that lady.

213
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,921
We'll just have to make her believe us.

214
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,047
But that's crazy.

215
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,844
This isn't your battle,
so you don't have to come along when I go.

216
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,725
This is nuts. Seriously nuts.

217
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,104
Time is running out, buyers!
Before you miss out, you--

218
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,024
Yesterday, we saw a clash
on a highway in Namil-gun

219
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,777
with armed officers
and some strange, unknown creatures.

220
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,071
Numerous citizens witnessed the scene,

221
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,283
and countless bystander videos of
the incident are now circulating online

222
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,202
and producing a lot of distress.

223
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,872
The police issued an official statement
regarding the incident

224
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,916
and say they are already on top of it.

225
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,501
I can assure you all,

226
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,169
the police have the latest information

227
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,797
regarding these
reported monstrous creatures

228
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,925
and are working toward
destroying a large number of them.

229
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,219
In order to minimize large-scale panic,

230
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,554
we kept the operation a secret until now.

231
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,431
So I offer my apologies.

232
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,852
Now, we will move ahead
and change our response strategy

233
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,479
so the investigation is open.

234
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,357
We promise to eradicate them
completely and permanently

235
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,484
with decisive military action.

236
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,195
The cooperation of the public
is of the utmost impor--

237
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,655
That big wig?

238
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,450
How do we know
if that guy's a monster or just a guy?

239
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,954
How are you gonna know what to do?

240
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,216
-The police are on their way.
-The police are coming now.

241
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,010
Can I confirm the location again?

242
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,261
May I have your name?

243
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,480
-Sorry, Miss Choi?
-What do you need?

244
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,524
It's a report just now.

245
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,652
The guy says there's been
suspicious activity in Namil-Gun.

246
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,613
It might just be the parasite's hideout.

247
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,033
Hundreds of new reports
are getting called in.

248
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,744
Is there something in this report
that sets it apart?

249
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,622
This symbol was not made public yet.

250
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,920
This information came in
before the press release.

251
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,298
We sent an undercover team
to investigate it.

252
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,885
Uh, the undercover team discovered
that people are gathering one by one

253
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,012
in the warehouse
with that symbol on the door.

254
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,516
They reported that about
20 people have gathered so far.

255
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,521
It seems certain they've been using this
as their main base since they disappeared.

256
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,776
We can assume they're well aware
that Namil-gun is still our top priority

257
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
as of right now.

258
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,363
So why not make
the smarter decision and run?

259
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,325
They perhaps decided
not to move so hastily.

260
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,327
Seems about right.

261
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,163
We've got those checkpoints
on major routes in the area too.

262
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,164
That could be it.

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,042
They're hiding
right under our noses on purpose.

264
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,504
I don't believe
parasites are that clever.

265
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,551
Uh, Miss Choi?
It seems they're pretty smart though.

266
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,721
They're quick learners
who analyzed our society

267
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,350
and chose to form a religious organization
to keep themselves under the radar.

268
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,602
Aren't you underestimating them a bit?

269
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,438
Namil-gun must be rid of parasites.

270
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,191
The governor and the citizens demand it.

271
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,902
Please make a decision quickly.

272
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,741
Then we launch or attack at sunrise.

273
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,159
Full cleanup operation.

274
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,577
All right. You do you, then.

275
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,403
Hello?

276
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,782
Jeong Su-in?

277
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,328
You're the woman
who's trying to catch me, right?

278
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,830
Su-in, you called!

279
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,374
Why not tell me where you're at?

280
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,918
Just listen to me first.

281
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,423
There are… parasites
disguised as police with you.

282
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,050
Mmm. Sure.

283
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,929
Detective Chul-min
and the one who works with him,

284
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,305
they're both parasites.

285
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,934
Oh, just a bit of an issue here.

286
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,188
You see, we had to undergo
body exams here to get clearance.

287
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,275
If anyone had failed to pass the test,
they'd be exposed already.

288
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,570
I don't know what exam you did,
but you need to check them again.

289
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,990
So if you really mean it,

290
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,993
then why don't you come
help me out with that?

291
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,371
You'd make the whole thing a lot easier

292
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,085
since you do really wanna
help us exterminate the parasites.

293
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,465
I'd be willing
to meet up with you and talk.

294
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,387
Shingwan-dong, Jinyang-si.

295
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,055
The Gukil Café.

296
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,779
Are you there?

297
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,074
Let me make myself clear.

298
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,411
I won't run, no matter how this goes.

299
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,472
What the hell?

300
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,310
Oh shit. It's late.
You always get home this late?

301
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,603
Hey. Here.

302
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,356
-Oh sweet
-Hey, what's going on?

303
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,942
What trouble did you get into now?

304
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,446
Well, I might've just saved the world.

305
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,033
I'll pay you back soon.
I will, man, thank you.

306
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,826
It's all right. No biggie.

307
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,537
Hey, Jin-hee called about you.

308
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,873
Jin-hee?

309
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,710
Did you meet up with her?
She said you never pick up the phone.

310
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,587
When was that?

311
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,464
Oh, like, two weeks ago? Yeah.

312
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,633
You've been just completely
under the radar for a minute,

313
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,302
so she messaged you, I think.

314
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,139
I told her if she sent you a message,
you might actually check it later.

315
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,061
MESSAGE SAVED, 15 DAYS AGO

316
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,729
SEND A MESSAGE TO SEOL KANG-WOO

317
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,733
DON'T COME HOME NO MATTER--

318
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,738
DON'T COME HOME NO MATTER--

319
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,743
You know why you got betrayed
by your gang, and you're on the run now?

320
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,329
You're a goddamn coward, that's why.

321
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,330
Aren't you?

322
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,375
Your little sister was in their pantry.

323
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,835
Your older sister's been turned, right?

324
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,921
And Su-in, who saved you, is in danger.

325
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,423
And you're gonna bolt, is that right?

326
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,343
You're a goddamn coward.
That's what you are.

327
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,435
Oh, goddammit. I'm such an idiot.

328
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,646
What's wrong?

329
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,442
Hey, I just need to go downtown.
Lend me your car.

330
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,329
Welcome, miss.

331
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,546
Did you happen to see
a woman make a phone call?

332
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,547
This is her.

333
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,842
Oh, she said to go to the roof. Yeah.

334
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,346
Also, she said that
you would be bringing her wallet.

335
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,225
And you'd pay for her. It's 5,000 won.

336
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,739
Jeong Su-in!

337
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,700
Are you here?

338
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
Su-in, hey!

339
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,247
Are you out here?

340
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,584
Su-in!

341
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,003
Jeong Su-in--

342
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,134
What?

343
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,678
Did you think I'd bring backup?

344
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,722
I just took some precautions.

345
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,933
Good thinking.

346
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,854
But if you try something,
you'll bring Heidi out, so stay there.

347
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
Heidi?

348
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,780
Are you saying, at the moment,
you're a regular human and the parasite…

349
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,366
Sorry. No, you said it's called Heidi?

350
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,494
She's like a split personality of yours?

351
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,496
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

352
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,499
Oh, right.

353
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,044
So what were you saying before?

354
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,921
Please listen.

355
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,132
Chul-min and the guy he works with,
they're actually parasites.

356
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,845
Let's say your accusation of Kang Won-seok
is duly noted.

357
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,475
Kim Chul-min has always fought us
tooth and nail to try and protect you.

358
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,436
So why is it you're accusing him now?

359
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,981
'Cause he's not…

360
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,861
He was killed

361
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,446
right in front of me.

362
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,657
What?

363
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,201
They cut off his head.

364
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,664
Won-seok and the pastor killed him
because he figured out the truth.

365
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
Please believe me!

366
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,795
It's pretended to be the detective
since it took over his body. I saw it all!

367
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,926
Just earlier today,

368
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,137
we got a detailed report
locating the parasites' hideout.

369
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,139
The men you mentioned,

370
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,642
detectives Kim and Kang,
were quite insistent

371
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,436
on a large-scale operation
to handle the threat.

372
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,482
If what you're saying is true,
that means those two are impostors

373
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,819
who are working undercover
to sabotage the rest of us, right?

374
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,613
Why would they want an attack?

375
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,199
Because it's all a trap.
Don't you see that?

376
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,578
If you guys go out there,
they're gonna kill you all.

377
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,706
Then you can help us make sure.

378
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,376
Why don't you join us on the raid?

379
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,544
Join you?

380
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,634
If you really are on the humans' side,
you can help us, can't you?

381
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,429
You can tell us
if we're walking into a trap.

382
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,809
All right, look. We don't want this
to turn physical either, okay?

383
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,769
So will you cooperate with us?

384
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,689
Ask Heidi to help out and capture them all

385
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,275
since she can communicate, right?

386
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,864
-Shit. Get her!
-Damn it!

387
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,119
Shit! Jeong Su-in!

388
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,791
Ah, what was that?

389
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,852
Get in! It's me! Hurry!

390
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,658
Split up and look for her.

391
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,700
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,663
Where'd you go, Su-in?

393
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,465
Jeong Su-in

394
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,177
is being
incredibly irresponsible right now.

395
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,306
Tell her it does not serve
the both of us in our survival.

396
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,977
Jeong Su-in is doing everything she can
to stay alive right now.

397
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,190
That makes no sense, given her actions.

398
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,278
Well, you… you guys think
if you keep on breathing,

399
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,613
that's living, right?

400
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,740
It's different for us.

401
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,991
With us, it's…

402
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,744
it's about our connections to others.

403
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,831
And this mess left her
completely by herself.

404
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,165
That's why,

405
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,710
in order to keep living,

406
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,380
she just needs someone
to believe in her right now.

407
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,135
She's just surviving
everything that's happening to her.

408
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,769
Regardless of how she decides
to keep herself alive,

409
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,188
do not let her get caught

410
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,774
in something dangerous for three hours.

411
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,401
Why?

412
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,155
I have been in too much control
of our shared body lately.

413
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,866
For at least the next three hours,

414
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,453
I have no choice except
to stay completely passive.

415
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,749
No matter what happens, I cannot help you.

416
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,002
-Okay.
-This is a serious warning.

417
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,046
You cannot become entangled in any peril.

418
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,132
Okay, but…

419
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,137
Jeez. Well, someone gets the last word.

420
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
The report given by the police earlier

421
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,560
confirms the existence of creatures
known as parasites,

422
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,979
which had been believed to be only rumors.

423
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,608
Other related instances and videos that
had been circulating indiscriminately…

424
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,942
Ah shit! Come on!

425
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,486
…proven to be true.

426
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,240
Many citizens are expressing their anxiety
on social media and various online portals

427
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,493
after the announcement was made.

428
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,869
Hell no.

429
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,663
This can't be happening.
This shit is insane.

430
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,000
Kang-woo, hey!

431
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,462
If you crashed the car,
I'll beat your ass, got it? Huh?

432
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,676
What? Kyung-hee? Uh…

433
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,971
Kang-woo, uh, he… he went out.

434
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,312
Huh?

435
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,689
Good morning.

436
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,903
Hey, Heidi's energy bottomed out,
and she's down for the next three hours.

437
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,739
So she said we gotta avoid
any trouble just for now.

438
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,201
Righteous Warrior, slow your roll, okay?

439
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,255
Hey, we're on our way.
What, are you worried I wrecked your car?

440
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,174
Hey, hurry up and come back.
Your sister's here waiting for you.

441
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,220
What?

442
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,638
He's coming soon.

443
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,141
Uh, so why don't you take a seat?

444
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,061
In the apartment?

445
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,271
-Like, right now?
-Yeah.

446
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,607
Okay, listen. Say you gotta go.
Doesn't matter why.

447
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,526
I don't get it. Why?

448
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,573
That's not really Kyung-hee, okay?
So split. You gotta get out now!

449
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,576
Come on. What the hell?
Just get back here, all right?

450
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,130
The woman is accompanying you?

451
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,425
You must return at once.

452
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,887
Return to your ally's dwelling.

453
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,555
You have 15 minutes,

454
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,267
or your ally will be decapitated.

455
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,689
They want Heidi, right?

456
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,190
So let's go.

457
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,818
No way. I promised her.

458
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,987
Heidi can't come help us for three hours.

459
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,950
Well, they can't know her limits, right?
They'll think that I'm one of them.

460
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,246
They have some kind of ability
to feel parasites around.

461
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,707
They won't know it's me.
They'll think it's Heidi.

462
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,628
What are you gonna do?
They could decide they better kill you.

463
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,716
It's important the parasites keep
supporting each other right now,

464
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,012
so I'll… I'll act like I'm going
to come back, and that'll keep them busy.

465
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,306
Oh shit.

466
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,390
Okay?

467
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,684
It's up to us to get Ki-seok out alive!

468
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,105
Put it in drive. Let's go.

469
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,180
I came as you asked.

470
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,391
Release your hostage.

471
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,435
We are kin, you and I.

472
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,230
I wish to rejoin my kin once more.

473
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,273
An amusing ploy.

474
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,276
Her brain sleeps inside.

475
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,530
I hardly sense my kin at all.

476
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,447
What?

477
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,617
I know the authorities
already examined your body.

478
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,421
Our kind inside your host girl.

479
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,093
Can my voice penetrate inside to you?

480
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,016
Although I am curious why
this human's brain was not fully absorbed,

481
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,561
you now represent a threat.

482
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,772
You will die here.

483
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,443
We do not need a mutant on our side.

484
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,113
You are a strong opponent.

485
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,075
If you want to protect this body,

486
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,662
then emerge now and try to save her.

487
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,168
Get down!

488
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,337
Ki-seok, run!

489
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,551
Ki-seok!

490
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,680
Ki-seok, get out of there! Hurry!

491
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,974
Ki-seok!

492
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,812
You moron. Stop that!
Don't! Ki-seok.

493
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,107
Hey! Let's go!
You're going to get us killed too!

494
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,150
Ki-seok!

495
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,907
Stay with me! We gotta go now!

496
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,575
Hurry!

497
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,246
Hey! We gotta go!

498
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,147
They're gonna die! I swear to God!
They're all gonna die!

499
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,417
The undercover team
is currently divided into four units.

500
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,671
They are discreetly monitoring the area
around their hideout.

501
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,423
-Our team is ready to move in.
-Then let's gear up and move out.

502
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,175
Hmm.

503
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,972
So when our strike team heads in,
will you two be joining us?

504
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,768
Yes, we will form a perimeter
and step in to assist your team.

505
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,895
If permitted, Captain.

506
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,024
Sounds good.

507
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,026
Come on.

508
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,361
Seems like this is
Team Grey's last task here.

509
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,280
I expect you'll be needed elsewhere.

510
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,451
Well, you know, it just depends
on what happens out there.

511
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,078
Hmm.

512
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,505
Please go on ahead.
I left something downstairs.

513
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,926
It all seems clear.

514
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,684
Miss Choi.

515
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,980
We evacuated all the residents.
All roads are getting blocked.

516
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,149
And, of course, we'll have your back.

517
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,902
Then stand by here. And thank you.

518
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,673
Which one are you this time?

519
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,010
Listen carefully.
The cleanup operation you're about to do,

520
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,511
it's a trap, you understand?

521
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,513
And who is this?

522
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,890
Are you the little Mangnani punk
Seol Kang-woo?

523
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,351
I got it right.

524
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,062
Is Jeong Su-in with you?

525
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,440
Yeah.

526
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,150
They wanna trap you.

527
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,235
So please just call off the operation.

528
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,656
It's just… It's a dilemma right now.
Might not be a real choice.

529
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,578
Namil-gun seems really bent
on still having their music festival.

530
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,246
Parasites need to be destroyed

531
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,041
so they can party on schedule,
I've been told.

532
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,001
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

533
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,797
That's bullshit, okay? No music is worth
those things eating your brain.

534
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,842
I keep telling you,
you've got parasites in your team!

535
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,218
Okay.

536
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,554
The men that Jeong Su-in denounced,

537
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,557
it turns out,
aren't actually parasites after all.

538
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,018
Huh? That can't be right.

539
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,520
You're sure you checked them
both completely?

540
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,605
I didn't check them both,

541
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,315
but Kang Won-seok isn't.

542
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,608
I know for sure.

543
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,194
What?
That stupid partner of that one cop.

544
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,113
He killed the monster
you kept in that mask, okay?

545
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,699
The one in the van, remember?

546
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,453
He had this weird iron knife
and just stabbed that thing to death.

547
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,914
The knife worked, I guess?

548
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,167
Anyway, even if
that detective isn't a monster,

549
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,169
he's definitely working on their side.

550
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,672
You two better record this call.

551
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,634
If this operation is a trap,

552
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,803
then I'll get killed going in there.

553
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,890
If I'm killed, you bring this call
to General Kim Sang-su, Police Agency.

554
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
-We're ready to enter.
-Let's proceed.

555
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,521
Alpha Team,
you are clear to engage.

556
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,107
Lead Group,
moving to the strike point.

557
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,243
Entering now!

558
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,121
Target acquired!

559
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,039
Engage!

560
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,208
There! Move in!

561
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,129
Runner! Nine o'clock!

562
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,341
-Terminated!
-Above us!

563
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,022
All Grey units, enter the building
and support the Lead Group.

564
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,357
Clearing an entry path!

565
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,693
All units into position!
Don't let any of them escape!

566
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,320
Objective confirmed.
Shoot to kill.

567
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,389
Go on through.

568
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,725
Go on through.

569
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on.

570
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,916
You've got too many eyes on you.

571
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,876
And you know what?

572
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,838
The more guests we have at the party,
the more fun we'll have.

573
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,256
Better not scare 'em away.

574
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,106
Is this the emotion

575
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,194
that humans call betrayal?

576
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,660
Stop right there!

577
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,580
-What are these assholes doing?
-Kill confirmed.

578
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,502
All targets eliminated.

579
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,879
You hear that?

580
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,590
We just cleared them all out.

581
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,053
Now, I think you're the only parasite
remaining in the whole area.

582
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,555
Jeong Su-in.

583
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,392
Oh shit.

584
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,979
I'm totally confused. What's going on?

585
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,064
What about what we saw?

586
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,983
But their operation…

587
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,031
Why would they try to kill each other?
Wouldn't they try to save each other?

588
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,496
FOLK MUSIC FESTIVAL TO CELEBRATE
OPENING CHOI YONG-JAE MEMORIAL HALL

589
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,415
I know how it is. People suck.

590
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,625
I got stabbed in the back by my own gang.

591
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,297
You saw the monster crawl into that cop
and do a host switch?

592
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,091
Then what if it

593
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,053
doesn't intend to just stop
at taking a regular guy?

594
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,474
What if it really wants a human leader
as its new host body?

595
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,311
What?

596
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,063
I think the mayor is their goal.

597
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:40,284
NAMCHEON MAYOR'S SURPRISE VISIT
