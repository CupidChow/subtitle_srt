1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,389
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT.

2
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,190
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION SHRANK
TO A HUNDREDTH OF ITS SIZE,

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,818
WOULD THE POISON SPEWED
ALSO DECREASE BY THE SAME AMOUNT?

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,789
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION WERE CUT IN HALF,

5
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,375
HOW MANY MORE FORESTS WOULD SURVIVE?

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,383
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT.

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,969
WE MUST PROTECT
THE FUTURE OF ALL LIVING THINGS.

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,601
What did you say, motherfucker?
That's such bullshit.

9
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,062
You think I'm scared
to kill somebody, huh?

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,521
ENOUGH, OR YOU'LL MAKE HIM CRY

11
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,731
Fuck.

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,566
THIS LOSER AND HIS INFERIORITY COMPLEX

13
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,235
Try me.

14
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,281
Seriously? These bastards.
Shit!

15
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,556
Whoo!

16
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,944
Wake up!

17
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,863
Why'd you even come here? Just to sleep?

18
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,531
Come on, bro!

19
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,449
Hey!

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,202
Let's go dance! Come on!

21
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,996
Christ, you're so boring.

22
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,122
Stay there, then.

23
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,499
Oh, you're back!

24
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,502
Hey, did you sober up? Huh?

25
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,705
PARASYTE: THE GREY

26
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,041
ONE HOUR AGO

27
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,628
Huh?

28
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,630
Don't. Just work.

29
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,673
Just a minute.

30
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,812
It's acting up. The register.
It's driving me nuts, seriously.

31
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,981
A bag for you, sir?

32
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,275
Point card?

33
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,403
Okay, that'll be 44,000 won.

34
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,704
You'll need to get a sticker for this one
at the butcher counter, okay, sir?

35
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,707
Excuse me.

36
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,501
Sir, um…

37
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,134
You'll need to go over to the counter
and get a price tag to check out.

38
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,637
Nah, they gave it to me that way.

39
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,390
You still gotta go get a price tag
so I can scan it.

40
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,100
Hey, come on.

41
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,353
Can't you just get the stupid thing?
Jesus Christ.

42
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,689
Sir, the butcher handles the meat,
so you'll need to go over there--

43
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,359
Why can't you, bitch,
just go and do it, huh?

44
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:46,197
Huh? Why is this dumb bitch
ordering around a customer?

45
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,624
Ah, this is such bullshit.

46
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,959
I can't even…

47
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,627
I could kill you all.

48
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,256
Oh fuck. I swear to God.
I'll just kill 'em all.

49
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,674
What's that about?

50
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,759
Did you say something?

51
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,594
Next, please.

52
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,818
Okay, bye. See ya tomorrow!

53
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,237
Oh, Su-in, good night.
Good work today.

54
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
Thank you.

55
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,075
Nice job today.

56
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,240
Hey, you stupid bitch.

57
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,908
What'd you say before, huh?

58
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,993
Say it to me again, you little fucker!

59
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,247
Huh? Come here, fucking bitch!

60
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,546
You bitch! Get back here!

61
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,510
Hey! Think I can't go this far?

62
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,972
You shits believe
I can kill somebody now, huh?

63
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,598
Just watch.

64
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,934
I'll do it now. I will. Just watch.

65
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,060
I'll cut her up.

66
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,188
Ah fuck!

67
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,190
Hey!

68
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,360
You think you can hide from me, huh?

69
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,861
You just fucking wait.

70
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,448
Stupid bitch.

71
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,437
Hello? I'm at the intersection
near the Namcheon power plant.

72
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,689
I think there's been an accident here.

73
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,150
There's a motorcycle knocked over.
Yeah, and a car.

74
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,366
Yes, sir. Yes, I'll brief you
first thing in the morning.

75
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,909
Yeah. Yeah, copy that.

76
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,621
-Ah, hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

77
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,414
Christ, this is exhausting, isn't it?

78
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,876
I know, it's the third violent crime
just since this morning.

79
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,086
Some kinda day. Where's Won-seok?

80
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,921
Detective Kang will be here soon.

81
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,425
Christ. Anytime something awful happens,
he's late.

82
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,718
So who's the suspect?

83
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,428
-Well, his name is Lee Kyung-chun.
-Yeah.

84
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,390
Forty-three years old. Got priors
for some violent crimes. Schizophrenic.

85
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,018
-Schizophrenic?
-Yeah.

86
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,105
He and the victim argued
at the supermarket where she works.

87
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,733
Employees have already given us
their statements, sir.

88
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,820
The story goes he followed her in his car,
ran her over, and then he drew a weapon.

89
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,615
Crazy jackass. And so?

90
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,284
What else?

91
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,078
Ah, well, it's--

92
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,498
Um… he had a weapon, and he chased her,

93
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,667
and then he died somehow.

94
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,043
He bled to death.

95
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,336
Who did?

96
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,420
The maniac?

97
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,755
Yeah, he got split open.

98
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,966
Looks like, basically,
his chest all the way up to his face.

99
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,678
I thought you said he jumped her.
What do you mean he got split open?

100
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,013
Yeah, it's all pretty strange, boss.

101
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,850
Nobody's sure if he got cut in the crash
or might have gotten cut later.

102
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,478
Hopefully, the pathologist can say.

103
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,814
It's one thing
after another today.

104
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,149
Who's the victim?

105
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,236
Yes, uh, the victim is
Jeong Su-in, 29 years old.

106
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,326
Uh, I'm sorry, boss. Do you know her?

107
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,749
Yeah.

108
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,715
How's she doing?

109
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,385
They say she's unharmed,
except she's been in a coma.

110
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,970
What do you mean?

111
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,056
She was ambushed by Mr. Crazy,
but she's unharmed? How?

112
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,058
That's confusing too.

113
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,811
There are places
where she's got these scars,

114
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,438
like she got stabbed.

115
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,857
And her clothes were soaked
with her own blood too.

116
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,319
Only, they said the scars look old
like they're not from this.

117
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,512
Su-in, you can't show up here again.

118
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,276
Sorry, what's going on?

119
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,861
Are you feeling better?

120
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,783
Detective.

121
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,992
Su-in.

122
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,578
Are you all right?

123
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,332
What am I doing here?

124
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,708
Do you remember anything?

125
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
Today, a man tried to stab you to death.

126
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,672
Uh, yeah, the man
that I met earlier at the market.

127
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,174
Yeah, that man, right.

128
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,718
Yeah, that man's why we're here.
So are you all right?

129
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,223
I remember arguing with him
over some meat, I think.

130
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,225
Then I think he followed me.

131
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,686
Yeah, I got run into, and then…

132
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,607
then he started to stab me.

133
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,151
Luckily, you… you don't seem to be hurt.

134
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,611
Wh… wha…

135
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,030
I know I got cut though.

136
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,158
I know, but they said those scars
looked like they were pretty old.

137
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,577
I don't have scars.
That doesn't make sense.

138
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,790
What about your attacker?
Was he injured at all during the attack?

139
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,000
Uh, N… no.

140
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,212
-Hmm.
-He was following, so I tried to run.

141
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,590
There was so much blood, I couldn't…

142
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,885
-It's hard to remember.
-Mm-hmm.

143
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,763
You found him, right?

144
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,017
He was dead at the scene.
Slashed from his chest to his face.

145
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,435
Enough, okay?

146
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,646
I'll do the talking.
You guys wait outside.

147
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,690
-Yeah?
-Yeah, okay.

148
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,275
Just wait outside.

149
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,996
I still don't understand.
I was about to die out there.

150
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,915
And then, instead of me, he died?

151
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,044
Hey, when something like this happens,

152
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,464
it's not uncommon for you
to have problems with your memory.

153
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,426
Don't feel pressured to remember it now.

154
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,972
It's just… I did get stabbed, you know.

155
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,933
Why?

156
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,227
Why do you think that?

157
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,231
'Cause I kept thinking one thing,

158
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,233
"All over again."

159
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,653
"All over again"?

160
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,071
Yes.

161
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,657
Time to be unhappy all over again.

162
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,913
It's this recurring feeling.
I'm used to it now.

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,249
"It's time to be unhappy again."

164
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,629
Su-in, that won't happen to you again.

165
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,798
When I was ten, and my dad was abusing me,
I had the same thought.

166
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,593
When my dad hit me with a clothes iron,

167
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,137
broke my bones, and, you know,

168
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,140
I used to think like that.

169
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,936
"It's time to be unhappy again."

170
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,564
Tonight, when I got stabbed,

171
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,276
it just brought
all those feelings out again.

172
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,366
Nothing like that
is going to happen again, okay?

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,535
If you hadn't been there
to save me from my father,

174
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,287
I wouldn't even be alive right now.

175
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,749
No, you called us out there.

176
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,461
Do you think it's easy
for a ten-year-old little girl

177
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,630
to report her own dad to the police?

178
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,675
I wasn't the one who saved you.

179
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,594
You're the one who saved yourself.

180
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,722
Su-in,

181
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,976
I believe you can always save yourself.

182
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,981
I know it.

183
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,276
If there's anything
that comes back to you about tonight,

184
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,486
just let us know.

185
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,657
And just so you know,
I'm really happy you're safe. Hmm?

186
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,577
If you need anything,
give me a call, all right?

187
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,957
Get some rest.

188
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,060
Hey, Chul-min! Sorry.
I'm sorry I'm late.

189
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,603
No, please. No rush.

190
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,439
-Where were you, evening mass?
-Jesus.

191
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
Won-seok,
praying doesn't suit you.

192
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,276
-Shut up, all right?
-You go to church?

193
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,903
Anyway, get out of here.

194
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,114
Oh, you saw the girl, right?
I was hoping--

195
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,907
Ah, let me just breathe a sec.

196
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,117
Tomorrow, get here early.

197
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,326
-Got it.
-Right.

198
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,705
Look, if we solve a couple big cases
from today, who knows?

199
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,373
We could get promoted soon, right?

200
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,771
A FEW MONTHS LATER

201
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,074
Hello, boss.

202
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,158
Hello, boss.

203
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,668
Have the Mangnani Gang
made any moves lately?

204
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,961
No, they're quiet.

205
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,548
We took their business,
and they can't do a thing about it, huh?

206
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,050
They're weak, you know?

207
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,635
That's right. Good work.

208
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,969
Have a good evening, sir.

209
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,569
The boss is in room eight.

210
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,054
Son of…

211
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,949
Hey, where are my guys?

212
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,288
He's there! Right there!
Go get that bastard!

213
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,874
-Come here!
-Come here, son of a bitch!

214
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,459
-Come here, asshole!
-Hey, you bastard!

215
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,105
This is our final stop.
Everyone off, please.

216
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,584
Thank you for calling.
You have one new voicemail.

217
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,377
Press one to check your messages.

218
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,588
Press two to manage your mailbox.

219
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,173
Hey, it's Jong-do.

220
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,634
Listen, the Yeongdeungpo guys
are really pissed right now,

221
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,636
so lay low for the time being.

222
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,804
Don't use your cell phone
if you can help it.

223
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,140
No, actually, just toss it.

224
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,100
I'll contact you
once things get sorted out.

225
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,645
Press one
to listen to your next message.

226
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,979
Press two to replay--

227
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,945
Hey, you scared me.

228
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,701
You probably forgot
your little bro's face by now, huh?

229
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,329
Don't worry about me.
I won't stay here long.

230
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,042
Jin-hee mentioned you… had, like, a tumor.

231
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,877
But you look fine.

232
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,046
Is Jin-hee around?

233
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,757
She has gone somewhere.

234
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,136
Where'd she go?

235
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,013
I would not know.

236
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,812
What is she wearing?

237
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,223
No matter what happens,
she never leaves the store unattended.

238
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,725
Gone somewhere, huh?

239
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,602
You don't know where?

240
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,648
Ki-seok?

241
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,570
The number
you have dialed has been disconnected

242
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,906
or is no longer in service. Goodbye.

243
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,617
SAEJIN CHURCH
REVIVAL PRAYER MEETING

244
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,330
MR. CHUL-MIN

245
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,999
Hey, Detective.

246
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,835
Hey, is everything okay?

247
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,753
Yeah, it's been normal here.

248
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,672
Just work.

249
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,424
But you still need
to take care of yourself.

250
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,301
Just take it easy for now.
Why don't you go on a vacation?

251
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,263
The hospital told me it's okay though.

252
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,974
There's nowhere for me to go anyway.

253
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,225
Yeah, I guess so.

254
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,061
Still, don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

255
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,480
Okay, I'll try not to.

256
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm indebted to you, sir.

257
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,819
Come on. No need for that.

258
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,070
You stay safe now.

259
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,533
The bus is stopping at Gyeongjin Market.

260
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,659
The next stop is--

261
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,070
Could you please open the door?

262
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,317
Hey, I said
I'd get us a hotel room nearby.

263
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,445
Let us go to my place.

264
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,323
Oh yeah? I'd like that, baby. Just…

265
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,535
Most girls would rather stay at a hotel,
wouldn't they?

266
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,661
I do not.

267
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,705
Only my place will do. No other.

268
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,166
Okay. You know, I like women like you.

269
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,377
Women who take charge.

270
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,296
You do come off
a bit cold sometimes.

271
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,764
Wow! Here, baby? Huh?

272
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,808
It seems isolated, huh?

273
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,810
I mean, it's kinda falling apart.

274
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,645
Baby, does anyone live here?

275
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,065
I mean, I'm not saying it's shabby.
Baby, are you mad?

276
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,151
What I meant was that I didn't know
people still lived in places like this.

277
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,528
That's all.

278
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,614
This place is getting redeveloped,
I guess.

279
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,037
Baby, it seems like you live in a place
that doesn't suit your vibe, you know?

280
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,752
Wow, let's take a look.

281
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,590
Oh, you've got unique taste, huh?

282
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,383
I mean, I'm not saying it's weird.

283
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,973
Uh, okay, this is a first for me, I'd say.

284
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,184
Already?

285
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
Uh, can I wash up quick somewhere?

286
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,691
Why is the floor--

287
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,195
What the heck?

288
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,033
Your family, I'm guessing.

289
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,078
There is alcohol in this human's veins,
is there not?

290
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,080
Is that your pop?

291
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,043
Humans can detoxify
when left alive for a while.

292
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:08,960
What?

293
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,380
But how do we ensure his silence
until that time?

294
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,967
What's up with you? Oh shit.

295
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,219
Oh, you assholes think
I'm some kind of pushover.

296
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,138
We could cut off his arms.

297
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,682
No. He can remain intact.

298
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,019
I think it is best
to render him unconscious and tie him up.

299
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,062
Come on, man.

300
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,148
Just hang on a minute.

301
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,734
You don't seem to be aware.
I'm an important man.

302
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,383
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

303
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,099
Ah! Thank God! Help me!

304
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,727
Target one, down!

305
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,778
Shoot the target, shoot!

306
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,126
Target two, down!

307
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,268
Target three, down!

308
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,352
Are you our kin?

309
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,945
A prisoner of theirs?

310
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,989
Don't touch that.

311
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,244
I got it first.

312
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,223
The target escaped.
Moving west via rooftop!

313
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,808
Miss Choi, are you okay?

314
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,644
-I wanted him alive. Shit.
-You want him alive?

315
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,396
It'd be good to catch another one.

316
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,358
We could use more Hunting Dogs.

317
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,568
Honey? Okay in there?

318
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,029
How's your end?

319
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,031
Wrapped up now. All targets killed.

320
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,826
And how's that punk?

321
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,578
He was clearly in shock.
We sent him to the hospital.

322
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,081
Hmm. Our team's watching him?

323
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,082
Yeah.

324
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,714
Wow, they're all working together now.

325
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,635
They were having
a little get-together, huh?

326
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:49,556
There's not much left behind.
These seem to be victims' belongings.

327
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,149
Let's break it open.

328
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,308
What is this?

329
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,143
Let's bring forensics.

330
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,941
What do you think that means?

331
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
It's the symbol for their pantry.

332
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,528
What?

333
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,032
Those bastards are banding together.

334
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,467
Are you certain she is our kin?

335
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,308
Should she be brought
into our organization, then?

336
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,187
I understand.

337
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,980
I will approach her now.

338
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,739
It seems like a lot of people
these days have trouble falling asleep.

339
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,868
For you listeners out there struggling
like our last caller,

340
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,788
whose worries are keeping you awake
this late at night,

341
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,124
why don't you try drinking
a cup of warm water…

342
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,937
MR. CHUL-MIN

343
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,402
Who are you guys?

344
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,696
Just go away!

345
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,161
You are convincing as an Earthling.

346
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,830
What? What does that even mean?

347
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,874
This one seems strange.

348
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
Are you certain she is kin?

349
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,045
What do you want?

350
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,673
Let us confirm her identity.

351
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,595
Oh fuck!

352
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,156
We are kin. You see now.

353
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,378
If you are kin,
you must join us in our organization.

354
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,589
We must work together
in order to ensure our survival.

355
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,971
SAEJIN CHURCH
REVIVAL PRAYER MEETING

356
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,266
You are welcome if you are of our kin.

357
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,185
Have you seen my dog?

358
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,271
Merry! Merry!

359
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,857
Merry--

360
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,784
You witnessed what happened, yes?

361
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,915
I did not want
to expose myself unnecessarily,

362
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,374
yet now you must be killed.

363
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,544
Then just kill me. I take it back!

364
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,298
Why were you here observing us?

365
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,426
See, my sister's acting weird,

366
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,762
so I followed her here.

367
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,141
So the kin I talked to was your sister?

368
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,226
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,564
Give me your wallet.

370
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,742
IDENTIFICATION CARD
SEOL KANG-WOO

371
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,166
Now pay attention to my instructions.

372
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,585
If you do not do exactly as I command,

373
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,005
I will be sure
to hunt you down, understand?

374
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,677
Understand?

375
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,304
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,082
Jeong Su-in, right?

377
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,673
Goddamn, that monster was right.

378
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,759
Who are you?

379
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,429
I'll make this quick.

380
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,891
So you've been getting unpleasant
kinda brain waves from some people, right?

381
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,688
Don't go near them, okay?
They're all monsters.

382
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,023
It said to tell you.

383
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,442
What are you talking about?

384
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,446
Do you remember you got stabbed a bunch
by some crazy guy?

385
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,197
That's when a monster…

386
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,452
I mean, it's more like
a… a larva thing from a monster

387
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,079
made its way inside you,
Jeong Su-in, okay?

388
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,915
Normally, it's supposed to
eat brains, you know?

389
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,209
See, your wounds,
because it patched those,

390
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,462
it didn't have time
to munch your brain, okay?

391
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,880
You didn't change all the way.

392
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,716
I'm-- Ah shit! What am I even saying?

393
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,221
So, uh, it means you're a… a mutant, okay?

394
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,431
That's the idea.

395
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,351
Jekyll meets Hyde, right? Get it?

396
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,561
So who told you this?

397
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,897
You did. Hyde did. Hyde, you hear that?

398
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,441
I did what you wanted. I told her, okay?

399
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,525
I'll head out.

400
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,654
Not yours.

401
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,845
IS THERE REALLY SOMEONE ELSE IN MY BODY…?

402
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,448
What you heard earlier is true.
Believe everything he said.

403
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,576
I need to explain our condition
to you in detail.

404
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,787
Ask your questions, and I will answer.

405
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,178
WHO ARE YOU? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU?

406
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,941
NAMIL POLICE STATION

407
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,699
The hell?

408
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,251
Arms out
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

409
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,921
You may proceed.

410
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,424
-Hey, Chul-min, you're here.
-Hi.

411
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,635
Hey, what's up? VIP visit or what?

412
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,971
Ah, I heard

413
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,223
they're a special task force from Seoul.

414
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,808
They look special, don't they?

415
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,310
What? What kind of task force?

416
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
They look special.
They act special.

417
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,940
They'll explain it all soon.
They're having a briefing in a minute.

418
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:51,944
Stop. Arms out
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

419
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,700
Go ahead.

420
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,828
Okay?

421
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,830
Yes, proceed.

422
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,460
Hey there.

423
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,088
Hey.

424
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,423
What is all this?

425
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,217
Hell of a way to say hello,
guns in our faces. Christ.

426
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,932
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

427
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,814
Whoa!
When did all this get set up?

428
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:11,857
Jeez.

429
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,162
What's this? "Body snatchers"?

430
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,997
Wow.

431
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,291
They look well-prepared.

432
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,251
Oh man.

433
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,181
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO PARASITE
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

434
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,182
All right, hello!

435
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,185
Namil Station officers,
we're glad you're here!

436
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,770
Ah, and the chief.

437
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,731
Thank you, sir,
for allowing us to be here today.

438
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,318
Now, please, a round of applause
for your chief, everyone!

439
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,909
All right, I'll start
with some info on me.

440
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,081
I work as the parasite special forces unit
Team Grey captain.

441
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,875
Choi Jun-kyung. Nice to meet you all.

442
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,671
It must've been inconvenient
for all of you

443
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,048
to go through the exam earlier.

444
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,093
So now, I'll reveal
the exam results for everyone.

445
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,596
When you arrived,
our team took some full-body X-rays

446
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
of everyone entering the station.

447
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:31,729
And the number
of parasitic organisms found was

448
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,522
absolutely none! Perfect!

449
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,443
What is this?
A school talent show or what?

450
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,405
So, every day, we'll be scanned like that?

451
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,740
No, not at all.

452
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,117
The X-rays
were only performed this morning.

453
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,371
And that's because the parasitic organisms
appeared here all at once,

454
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,624
and it looks like they've already
synchronized with their hosts.

455
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,712
The exam this morning
has proven to the entire team here

456
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,715
that none of you are parasites,
so don't you worry.

457
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,842
I keep saying "parasite this"
and "parasite that."

458
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,677
Sounds strange, doesn't it?

459
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,555
Allow me to explain what exactly I mean.

460
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,897
Now, everyone recalls
the EDM festival killings we had recently.

461
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,857
Isn't that right?

462
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,942
I can tell you what really happened.

463
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,819
The truth behind this incident is

464
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,655
this… this right here.

465
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,200
The monster you see in this video

466
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,410
ruthlessly slashing away
at innocent people

467
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,078
is a parasitic organism.

468
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,205
How about that?

469
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,042
So where is he now? What's he doing, hmm?

470
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,796
Right at this instant, he's…

471
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:42,841
…here with us!

472
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,176
What the hell is that?

473
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,597
In order to prevent
social chaos,

474
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,227
Team Grey created a dedicated team
to restrict and control media awareness

475
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,232
and strictly control all information
with regard to this parasitic organism.

476
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,946
A few months ago, the parasites came
in a kind of larval state,

477
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,657
appearing all over Korea
and all over the world at large

478
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,242
with no explanation.

479
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,955
We're not sure where all these
nasty parasites are from quite yet.

480
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,500
But they enter a human body
through the ears, nose, or mouth,

481
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,837
at which point, they take total control
over the host's brain

482
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,382
Because… they feed off of it.

483
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,761
Now, the parasitic organisms
that complete their mutation

484
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,515
follow their instincts to devour humans
and sustain their own lives.

485
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,475
And here's an important note.

486
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,646
Their heads can actually
transform completely.

487
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,858
They can control exactly
the rigidity and the power

488
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,651
of their cranial transformation,

489
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,946
and they can even use it
as a sharp blade to kill.

490
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,781
And their smallest cells

491
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,868
can actually think
just like the complete body.

492
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,204
These terrifying creatures
have infiltrated human society

493
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,874
and are targeting us all right now.

494
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,375
Each one of us.

495
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,422
At first,
when I was still a larva,

496
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,091
I followed my instinct
to take over a human brain,

497
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,259
which is how I found you.

498
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,112
I tried to eat your brain,
parasitize your body, and seize control.

499
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,364
But I realized
the body I was trying to parasitize

500
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,908
was seriously wounded.

501
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,660
Therefore, in order to heal you,

502
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,538
I tried to synchronize
with your entire body.

503
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,333
As a result,
I was able to repair your body,

504
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,085
but I had failed
to completely take control

505
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,503
of your brain.

506
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,923
Once it has synchronized, the parasite

507
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,759
runs the human host's brain completely.

508
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,929
When that happens,
the person's consciousness

509
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,014
is also completely absorbed
by the parasite,

510
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,643
and then you will no longer know
who they are. They are not human.

511
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,145
Their minds are totally gone,

512
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,899
but their bodies continue to live on,

513
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,654
used as a stable source
of vital nutrients for these parasites.

514
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,740
Because I failed
to completely take over your brain,

515
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,452
I can only take control
when you are in danger…

516
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,789
…to protect the body that we share.

517
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,961
Based on my experiments with you so far,

518
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,130
I can only briefly
take over your consciousness

519
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,632
about 15 minutes a day.

520
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,303
Therefore, I will use
that limited amount of time

521
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,473
to protect this body,
which now maintains my life.

522
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:42,813
Excuse me? Is there a way those parasites
can, uh, can be killed?

523
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:43,772
Oh.

524
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,733
You see,
a parasite will shrivel up and die

525
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,443
without a living host body.

526
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,823
And so, to attack the parasite
inside a human,

527
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,993
we simply have to incapacitate the body.

528
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,204
The host the parasite is feeding off of
must be destroyed.

529
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,957
One, you make the body bleed out
all at once.

530
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,918
Or two, destroy the heart entirely
in one go.

531
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,006
Therefore, a gun
with a small caliber bullet won't work.

532
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,674
Use a knife, or better yet…

533
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,055
…a shotgun.

534
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,018
A shotgun like this one
is a lot more effective…

535
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:26,565
…at destroying the entire heart
in one blast.

536
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,779
Is there some type of test
besides X-ray imaging to find parasites?

537
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,615
Well, these creatures
are mingling in with us

538
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,702
and look exactly like the rest of us,
don't they? So how?

539
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,580
How can we discern,
without an X-ray, who's a parasite?

540
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,497
Anyone?

541
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,168
Pluck out a bit of their hair.

542
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,502
A strand of hair?

543
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,797
You see, the parasites
are made up of a single cell mass.

544
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,383
They can live briefly,
even if they are divided into pieces,

545
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,094
until you get it
into small enough sections.

546
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,596
Then they lose intelligence,

547
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,307
as well as the ability
to return to the main body.

548
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,562
If you can get a strand of hair from one,
it crumbles away and vanishes completely.

549
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,149
So now, if you suspect someone around you,

550
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,235
just pluck out a hair
and watch for the signs.

551
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,074
All right, I'll move on
to the next part of the lecture.

552
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,494
For better or for worse,
in the case of our country,

553
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,913
we had a parasite
at an EDM festival, right?

554
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,831
As you saw in the video,

555
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,085
it went on a rampage,
killing people left and right.

556
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,711
Through the evidence we gathered,

557
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,047
we learned parasites
were the cause of it all.

558
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,424
A parasite task force was formed here

559
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,385
faster than any other world power
on the whole planet.

560
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,722
And our research had
a convenient head start.

561
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:45,644
See, the one who led the charge
of that important research… come on down!

562
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,904
He's my other half.

563
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,864
That's her husband? But how?

564
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,619
To be more exact, it's the parasite
that crawled in and took over my husband.

565
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,955
Don't be afraid.

566
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,334
Now, the mask you see this one wearing
has a rare component we built in.

567
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,463
The mask has a clever device
that dispenses a kind of chemical

568
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,382
the parasites are susceptible to.

569
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,508
Like so.

570
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,051
This remote here.

571
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,178
This little button…

572
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,934
…it dispenses the chemicals,
and the parasite will be immobilized.

573
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,938
Also, in the mask,
there's a sensor that will monitor

574
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,024
if the parasite transforms itself
in order to escape.

575
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,861
If that happens,
then the solution is promptly dispensed,

576
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,114
which brings the parasite
a great deal of pain, as you can see.

577
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,448
Sorry.

578
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,369
It's just, why keep
that… that thing alive?

579
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,915
There's a feature that we discovered
concerning these creatures.

580
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,667
It seems they can use brain waves

581
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,712
to detect other parasites
that are in proximity to them,

582
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,215
which is why we're using this one

583
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,303
as a kind of radar to detect
if there are any other parasites nearby.

584
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,514
And so, that's why
this parasite has a name.

585
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,266
The "Hunting Dog."

586
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,395
The people
who give you a strange feeling?

587
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,189
They are our kin.

588
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,733
And they sense
that you are one of their kin.

589
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,069
But if they find out
that you are a mutant,

590
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,238
they will try to eliminate you.

591
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,825
So trying to approach any of them
could be dangerous

592
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,036
if you wish to continue to survive.

593
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,122
I am trying to warn you
of that likelihood.

594
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,708
I think it is important
to know each other well,

595
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,085
so I took a video of myself on your phone.

596
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,908
Our Hunting Dog
has informed us

597
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,495
that here in Namil-gun,
where the Namil Police Station operates,

598
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,914
the parasites are gathering in force.

599
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,044
So that's why we've decided
to visit for a while

600
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,921
and hunt them all down for you.

601
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,549
So bring us any unsolved killings

602
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,053
as well as any other suspicious cases
you may stumble on.

603
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:29,766
These are cases that just might turn out
to lead us to their gathering spot.

604
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,725
Understand?

605
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:36,564
Just hang on. Is it really all right
to torment a person like that?

606
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,317
What was that?

607
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,618
If you think like that

608
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,037
for even one second…

609
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,716
…this will happen to you.

610
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,730
My husband is no longer here before you.

611
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,898
He's been made into a monster!

612
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,526
A plague that should be wiped off
the face of the earth!

613
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,238
Once transformed like this,
they aren't really human!

614
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,115
They're not human!

615
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,408
Understand?

616
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,619
Huh?
