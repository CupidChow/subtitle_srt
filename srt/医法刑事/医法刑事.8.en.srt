00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,884
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,923
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,890
This is the gift I received.

4
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,522
Boss. What is this?

5
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,151
I knew it. I can never predict his moves.

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,188
Hey, you punk.
Move that hand in this instance!

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,273
Stay still!

8
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,321
-Cut me.
-Father.

9
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,374
If your revenge was to end like this,
you wouldn't have waited five years.

10
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,578
Do it.

11
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,584
If you can.

12
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,499
You're right.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I waited years for my revenge.

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,625
It'd be futile to end it like this.

15
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,850
But the thing with revenge

16
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,352
is that it's futile when it ends.

17
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,089
I'm just returning

18
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,591
what I got.

19
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,603
You psycho!

20
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,561
Do you think you'll live after this?

21
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,271
If it seems unfair, call the police.

22
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,404
Then you'll first have to explain
how this knife ended up with me.

23
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,364
Father. Father, are you okay?

24
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,992
I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.

25
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,834
All right, now.
You should get treated first.

26
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,044
I'm glad we're at a hospital.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,921
Right?

28
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,427
ACQUITTED

29
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,307
SENDER: CRIMINAL DEPARTMENT ONE
BAEK KANGHO

30
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,773
ACCUSED: GONG GUKKWANG AND THREE OTHERS

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,196
ACQUITTED

32
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,158
They were interrogated under detention,

33
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,366
but it's acquitted.

34
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
ACQUITTED

35
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,379
THE ACCUSED AND DETAILS OF THE CASE

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,883
Should we continue to sign the contract?

37
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,255
Or will you sue my attorney

38
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,844
and take a rain check?

39
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,643
Let's do it now.

40
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,387
We can't dismiss our project
just because some dog bit me.

41
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,765
We both have read through the contract,
so let's do it quickly.

42
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,484
Did you have any clauses
you wanted to revise?

43
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,154
I did, actually. It's…

44
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,646
BREACH OF CONTRACT

45
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,946
Right here.

46
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,663
"If one of the parties
does not follow through with the contract,

47
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,911
the said party must pay the other
100 million US dollars."

48
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,254
I don't like this clause.

49
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,750
Why? Are you scared to sign this?

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,883
If you stick to the contract,
you won't have to mind it.

51
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,511
No, I like what it says.
I don't like the amount.

52
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,049
How can we trust each other
with just 100 million dollars

53
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,184
of pocket money?

54
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,643
What? "Pocket money?"

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,020
Thanks.

56
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,486
CONTENT

57
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,286
How about one billion dollars?

58
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,123
It has to be this big for us to believe
that the contract will be carried out.

59
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,582
Isn't that so?

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,140
Chairman Gu, one second.

61
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,604
A billion dollars
amount to over one trillion won.

62
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,767
We don't need to take on such a huge risk…

63
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,101
We need a firm guarantee.

64
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,226
You tried to call off the last contract,
so here we are now,

65
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,904
once again.

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,038
GU JINGI

67
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,007
All right. We should probably celebrate
the signing of our contract,

68
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,012
but…

69
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,927
we probably can't do that today.

70
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,349
I'll provide the celebration later.

71
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,820
Are you trying to play hospital?

72
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,074
You used to be called
the best cardiac surgeon in Korea,

73
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,834
but you opened a tiny local clinic?

74
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,748
You're making me embarrassed.

75
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,209
What are you trying to say?

76
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,917
I know what you're up to.

77
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,668
You'll try to open up Hyukchul's mouth

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,840
by operating on Junhwan.

79
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,387
But that's impossible.

80
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,893
I won't let that happen.

81
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,482
I'm sure you feel better after doing this.

82
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,225
We should patch things up now.

83
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,574
Our Cardiothoracic Surgery needs
a talent like you.

84
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,526
Start as the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery. In a decade,

85
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,565
I'll make you
the director of the hospital.

86
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,487
Father.

87
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,370
If it's because of your mother,

88
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,664
I'm sorry to say that

89
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,920
it's not what I wanted either.

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,750
It was an unfortunate accident.

91
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,131
Think wise.

92
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,968
This is the last time
I reach out my hands to you.

93
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,682
I'm glad

94
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,143
I won't have to receive
this disgusting offer again.

95
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,729
"Disgusting?"

96
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,976
How do you qualify
to say that to me right now?

97
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,400
You let your friend die
to get your revenge on me,

98
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,193
and you're making a deal with me,
your enemy,

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,396
by using a patient's life.

100
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,028
It's a cliché,
but there is a saying for this moment.

101
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,543
You try to catch the monster,

102
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,464
but you end up becoming one.

103
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,830
A monster.

104
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,261
I guess so.

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,189
<i>People's interest in Banseok University
Medical Center grows by the day.</i>

106
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,067
<i>However, suspicion has been raised
that the murder case of Dr. Park</i>

107
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,576
<i>turned out to be done by a hired killer.</i>

108
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,543
<i>-Reporter Ban Soohee?
-Yes.</i>

109
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,460
<i>There are suspicions of murder instigation
by Candidate Gu Jingi.</i>

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,460
<i>His candidacy hearing is
in just two weeks,</i>

111
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,292
<i>so this scandal may cause a big impact.</i>

112
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,960
<i>Does the prosecution have
an investigation plan?</i>

113
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,094
<i>Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of Medical Crime Department</i>

114
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,085
<i>plans on summoning Gu Jingi</i>

115
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,887
<i>at the trial of the actual murderer,
Mr. Nam.</i>

116
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,598
<i>On the other hand,
Han Yihan, Mr. Nam's attorney,</i>

117
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,232
<i>had also been an attorney
for Dr. Park, the dead doctor.</i>

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,940
<i>-All eyes are on him to find out…</i>
-You lunatic.

119
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,901
<i>-…how he'll defend…</i>
-How dare you throw him in this scandal?

120
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,783
You still don't know anything.
It's almost pathetic.

121
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,236
-What did you say, you punk?
-Hyunseong!

122
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,159
Do not get into this.

123
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,494
Darn it.

124
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,656
Han Yihan.

125
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,325
This won't change anything.

126
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,922
You got yourself
into something very absurd.

127
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,382
It's like you're digging up
your own grave.

128
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,301
"If you seek revenge,
you should dig two graves."

129
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
One for my enemy, one for me.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,560
Your spot is right next to mine,
so look forward to it.

131
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,127
I didn't think you would put on
such a huge show.

132
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,088
A knife on his neck?

133
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,554
You told me to do as I like.

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,546
Oh, don't take it the wrong way.
I mean you went beyond my expectation.

135
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,471
So much so that I do not regret
every penny I paid you.

136
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,318
RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTIONS

137
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,189
Thank you so much.

138
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,359
Let me buy you a meal next time.
What would you like?

139
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,525
Just send me a mobile coupon.
Iced Americano is enough.

140
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,075
Then I'll send you ten. Ten coupons.

141
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,619
Come on.

142
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,329
Hello, Deputy Chief Kook.

143
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,825
Prosecutor Geum, what brings you here?

144
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,326
Well…

145
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,295
Deputy Chief Kook, why are you here?

146
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,630
I was in the Eastern District Prosecutors'
Office until recently, but I came back.

147
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,090
-I see.
-You know, things were great

148
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,468
while I worked with you and Kangho.

149
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,347
You two were both talented,

150
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,392
so our department had
the best performance.

151
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Yes, right. We did.

152
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,857
-Is Kangho well?
-Yes.

153
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,819
That punk never calls.

154
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,113
Anyway, why don't we grab
a meal together next time?

155
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,156
Sure. Goodbye.

156
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,788
Of all people…

157
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,713
Be careful. These things cost
an arm and a leg.

158
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,343
These are very sensitive and delicate.

159
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,340
Smooth. Please move them smoothly.

160
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,722
The threshold! Be careful.

161
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,335
Carefully.

162
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
Smoothly. To the right.

163
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,262
Yes.

164
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,018
Be careful. Careful.

165
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,864
Hey, is this a dream or what?

166
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,234
These are rarely seen
even at general hospitals,

167
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,856
but we have everything at a local clinic.

168
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,863
Can you pinch me?

169
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,319
That hurts.

170
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,832
Man.

171
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,248
So? Do you like your legal fee?

172
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,378
Thank you. It's more than I expected.

173
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,759
No pressure.

174
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,796
It's my thing to always prepare
more than what one expects.

175
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,176
I was already going to pay you

176
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,314
a billion won or even ten billion.

177
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,767
You're here too. Prosecutor Geum.

178
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,816
So? How does Dr. Han's new hospital look?

179
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,282
It looks nice.

180
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,994
Did your sign your new contract?

181
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,531
Of course.
I had a lot of fun thanks to him.

182
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,115
I'm glad.

183
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,124
I'll get going now. You two should chat.

184
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,285
I'm sure this is
a meaningful day for you two.

185
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,669
Thank you. I'll be in touch.

186
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,893
Congratulations.

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,595
You're a doctor again.

188
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,233
Thanks.

189
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,975
All right, why don't we throw a party?

190
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,073
We need to drink and eat meat
on a great day like this.

191
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,821
Seokyeong, let's go.

192
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,696
Let's go, Yihan.

193
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,472
Hey.

194
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,513
Soohee, what's your ideal type?

195
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,967
Well.

196
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,189
Young, rich, sexy, and tall.

197
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,397
Young and… What's that?

198
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,686
I'm joking.

199
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,193
I'm not looking to date anyone,
so when someone asks,

200
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,607
I just say I like a guy
who's young, rich, sexy, and tall.

201
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,237
Oh, I see.

202
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,502
How long have Yihan
and that prosecutor dated again?

203
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,424
I'm not sure.

204
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,338
It was after Seokju became
a long-term patient, so…

205
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,963
About five years.

206
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,336
Five years.

207
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,510
That's a long time.

208
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,051
It was. And it has been five years
after their breakup,

209
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,603
so there's a decade between them.

210
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,604
Why do you suddenly ask?

211
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,808
Just because.

212
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,231
It looks natural for them
to stand next to each other.

213
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,124
Back then,

214
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,744
did Daewoong leave Banseok with you?

215
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,001
Yes.

216
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,578
Darom and Daewoong helped me for years
as if this was their business.

217
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,706
If it hadn't been for them,
I wouldn't be here today.

218
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,721
I should be grateful for them too.

219
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,257
Come on.

220
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,812
Until everything is over,

221
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,771
nobody here should get hurt,

222
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,558
including you, Seokyeong.

223
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,975
What about you?

224
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,572
You shouldn't get hurt too.

225
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,066
And don't ever do

226
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,365
anything that is dangerous again.

227
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,696
Don't get hurt elsewhere

228
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,254
before I forgive you.

229
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,795
I'll try.

230
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,601
Yihan, will you grill meat all night?

231
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,308
Come and eat. I got it.

232
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,595
Seokyeong, you should sit down and eat.

233
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,309
And have a drink too.

234
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,522
Sure.

235
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,808
Dr. Han.

236
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,029
I need to talk to you.

237
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,041
I'm calling off Junhwan's surgery.

238
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,329
You already know

239
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,209
there's no other way of saving your son.

240
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,881
And can you make it work?

241
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,843
What about the equipment? And the staff?

242
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,262
Don't worry. I'm equipped with
a cardiopulmonary bypass machine and ECMO.

243
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,302
And Dr. Choi Yosub will assist me.

244
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,017
He was appointed as an associate professor
at Banseok University Medical Center.

245
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,309
It was Chairman Gu's special order.

246
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,652
CHOI YOSUB

247
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,860
<i>Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave your message…</i>

248
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,607
Do you get it now?
Dr. Choi won't help you.

249
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,949
No matter how good you are,

250
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,325
how can you operate without assistance?

251
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,502
So? Are you planning on

252
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,586
stealing another patient's heart again?

253
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,553
Just as you did to Seokju?

254
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,838
No, I'll never…

255
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,844
Nam Junhwan doesn't have much time.

256
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,215
If he goes into a serious stroke
from arrhythmia, he can die right away.

257
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,726
But if he still won't get the surgery,

258
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,731
it means you'll steal
someone else's opportunity yet again.

259
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,493
My brother, Seokju,

260
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,945
was the same age as your son.

261
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,504
If you plan on stealing
someone else's heart again,

262
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,924
if you create another victim like Seokju,

263
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,134
I'll make sure
your son is tormented for life.

264
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,473
I'll put in everything I have
to expose the truth.

265
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:41,435
I'll make sure the whole world knows
how Nam Junhwan got a heart transplant.

266
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,191
What?

267
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,810
Not only is he the son of a man
who killed two doctors,

268
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,228
everyone will know that his mom is a nurse

269
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,068
who killed two patients
to steal their hearts.

270
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,994
On top of that, he'll know
the heart she stole is thumping in him.

271
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,038
Between this life

272
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,038
and death,

273
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,919
which will be more tormenting?

274
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,768
<i>Things were great</i>

275
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,268
<i>while you and Prosecutor Geum were
working for me as partners.</i>

276
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,769
You know that I sort of tried
to help you two start dating.

277
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,265
Deputy Chief Kook, stop it.
That was ages ago.

278
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,188
Anyway, why was Seokyeong there?

279
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,777
No idea. She was talking to a staff
of Recordings and Transcriptions.

280
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,120
I see.

281
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>Anyway, let's meet up soon
and grab a meal,</i>

282
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,913
the three of us, like the old days.

283
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,286
Sure. Goodbye.

284
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,333
DEPUTY CHIEF KOOK

285
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,707
Could she be…

286
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,380
<i>Grab all of Han Yihan's stuff.</i>

287
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,303
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

288
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,261
FIVE YEARS AGO

289
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,550
You can't just take these.

290
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,053
We got patients' information there.

291
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,295
We're on official duty. Move aside.

292
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,096
-But still.
-Please leave.

293
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,230
This is obstruction of justice. Sorry.

294
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,444
Baek Kangho speaking. Who's calling?

295
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,444
I'm Director Gu Jingi
of Banseok University Medical Center.

296
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,113
Would you like a cup of tea in my office?

297
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,412
<i>Ichigo…</i>

298
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,123
<i>ichie.</i>

299
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,126
It means "Once in your life."

300
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,835
When you meet someone over tea,
you must treat your guest dearly

301
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,300
as if it's the first and last time.

302
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,137
It's the spirit of the tea ceremony.

303
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,060
So I always drink tea whenever I meet
distinguished guests for the first time.

304
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,191
First, let me know
why you wanted to see me.

305
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,353
You don't have to worry.

306
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,315
I'm not here to ask for your favor.

307
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,363
It's quite the opposite.

308
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,490
Every year,
thousands of medical lawsuits are opened.

309
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,246
But only one of those thousand is
punished criminally.

310
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,828
It's nearly impossible to get
a medical license revoked.

311
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,916
Even if it gets revoked,

312
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,548
it can be restored after a year or two
just by writing a letter of apology.

313
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,547
Why are you telling me all this?

314
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,304
I heard that the guardian
of the patient who died

315
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,507
is your junior colleague
from the same office.

316
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,309
Watching her cry over her brother's body

317
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,438
made me feel heartbroken too.

318
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
I know Han Yihan very well.

319
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,027
He'll never…

320
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
He'll never admit to the charge.

321
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,445
He deeply believes in his ability

322
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,332
to the point of arrogance.

323
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,042
That's why I'll help you.

324
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,172
So that he never
gets to be a surgeon ever again.

325
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,806
Okay. So what can I do?

326
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,317
I just made him pay for what he has done.

327
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,132
Are you okay?

328
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,546
I wanted to kill her.

329
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,431
Even though she stole Seokju's future,

330
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,468
since I'm a prosecutor,

331
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,732
I tried to be objective and
handle it rationally according to the law.

332
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,443
But I couldn't help it.

333
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,607
How could she think of doing that again
to save her own child?

334
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,815
I understand.

335
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,532
The moment I saw Gu Jingi,

336
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,201
I couldn't hold myself back either.

337
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,124
I keep…

338
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,079
I keep having these terrible thoughts.

339
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,040
Cho Junghyun deserves to die,
but her son is innocent.

340
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,881
But I keep wanting to take revenge.

341
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
I know I shouldn't be like this,

342
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,885
but it's so hard to bear.

343
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,635
Why…

344
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,063
Why Seokju?

345
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,484
Why did my little brother
have to suffer such a horrible fate?

346
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,397
It's so unbearable.

347
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,370
Great shot to the middle of the fairway.

348
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,752
It's been a while,
but that made it worth coming.

349
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,293
I must hit it as far as yours

350
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,745
to keep up with you, sir.

351
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,548
I'm not so sure.

352
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,919
I believe I'm not
the only one you're keeping up with.

353
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,432
If you try to hold
two diamonds in one hand,

354
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,219
you'd only put a dent in them.

355
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,311
Choose only one.

356
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,351
Either me or Assemblywoman Yoon Misun.

357
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,029
How is it that your balls ended up
right next to each other?

358
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,535
My goodness, sir.
You're fiercely competitive.

359
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,448
You had to startle me with such a joke
right before my shot.

360
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,616
From the very beginning,
there has been only one diamond

361
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,129
in my heart.

362
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,502
Son, why don't you show off

363
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,208
your swing for Yuna?

364
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,255
Yes, Father.

365
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,552
Hit it farther.

366
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,511
Farther than your father.

367
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,595
Okay, got it.

368
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,913
Good.

369
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,043
You hit the sweet spot.

370
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,760
Prosecution, state the charges.

371
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,008
Yes, Your Honor.

372
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,969
On February 14th, 2022, at Seoul Northern
Detention Center, the defendant

373
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,223
murdered Park Kitae by stabbing his neck
several times with a broken toothbrush,

374
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,647
causing the victim to die
on the spot from excessive bleeding.

375
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,902
Accordingly, we charge the defendant
with murder under Article 250-1

376
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,902
of the Criminal Act.

377
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,948
Defense, state your case.

378
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,950
The defendant pleads guilty to murder.

379
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,368
However, it is the defense's argument that
responsibility should be eliminated or

380
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,457
reduced as it was involuntary manslaughter
due to his physical and mental disability.

381
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,789
Prosecution, request for evidence.

382
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,246
Evidence number four,
the crime scene photos.

383
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,457
Number five,
the police investigation report.

384
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,428
Number 16, Gu Jingi's testimony.
We request these as evidence.

385
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,180
Defense, state your opinion
on the evidence.

386
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,681
We disagree with
the prosecution's evidence

387
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,098
numbers five and 16.

388
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,646
Prosecution, request for witnesses.

389
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,189
We request Director Gu Jingi,
who testified on evidence number 16,

390
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,725
as a witness.

391
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,355
Defense, do you have
any requests for evidence?

392
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,031
We will make requests as necessary
during the trial.

393
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,235
Then the next trial will be held

394
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,995
at 10 a.m. four days from now.

395
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,098
You requested Chairman Gu Jingi
to be a witness for Nam Hyukchul's trial?

396
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,479
He's not going to appear.

397
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,322
If he has nothing to hide,
he has no reason to refuse.

398
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,435
If he doesn't respond, it'd only fuel
the suspicion that he incited the murder.

399
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,606
Geum Seokyeong!
Why are you acting so rashly?

400
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,116
Do you want to end your career?
Don't you think about the consequences?

401
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,291
Did you join forces with him

402
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,710
to corner Chairman Gu?

403
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,575
Why would I do such a thing?

404
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,587
It's based on my judgment as a prosecutor.

405
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,257
Besides, it doesn't matter
if he doesn't appear.

406
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,179
Whether he comes or not,
the truth will be revealed.

407
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,008
I got a call from Deputy Chief Kook.

408
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,427
He saw you at the Southern District
Prosecutors' Office yesterday.

409
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,024
Why were you there?

410
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,978
To check investigation records.

411
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,112
On what?

412
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,824
Assemblywoman Yoon Misun
receiving illegal political funding.

413
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,830
You remember, right? The investigation
was closed internally five years ago.

414
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,871
She is a leading candidate
for the next presidential election,

415
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,127
so that case came to mind.

416
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,882
-That's all?
-Of course.

417
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,626
Why else?

418
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,344
Never mind. You may go.

419
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,574
You want to extend the time frame
of the new drug's clinical trial?

420
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,528
Yes. It's going to be
the world's first Alzheimer's treatment.

421
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,578
We must be cautious.

422
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,081
It's enough already.

423
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,872
Proceed to the next step.

424
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,548
Father, but I'm in charge.

425
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,798
The decision is up to me--

426
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,009
You don't think that your merit alone

427
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,970
got you that position, do you?

428
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,434
You must return the favor.
That's the way of the world.

429
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,644
So just do as I say.

430
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,191
I'm sorry that
we can't have dinner together.

431
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,781
I have another meeting now.

432
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,991
I shouldn't hog your precious time, sir.

433
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,954
-I'll come up with another occasion soon.
-All right.

434
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,001
See you more often
at Banseok going forward.

435
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,498
Yes, sir.

436
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,731
-Please pull over.
-Yes, ma'am.

437
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,490
You may go home now.
I'd like to take a walk.

438
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,492
Okay, ma'am.

439
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,807
Thank you for coming on short notice.

440
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,809
No, I should thank you.

441
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,644
You asked to see me again.

442
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,234
Can I drive?

443
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,572
I want to speed mindlessly
until my head goes empty.

444
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,819
Of course.

445
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,565
But if you really want to empty your head,
I recommend something else.

446
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,954
I'll let you drive fast.

447
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,622
No other thoughts will enter your mind.

448
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,116
What a crazy and wicked employer.

449
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,995
How could you call a subordinate
to a race track for your date?

450
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,213
I will report you
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor

451
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,464
and make you go bankrupt.

452
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,795
Sure. You can talk to my lawyer.

453
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,054
How is the track?

454
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,348
The tire sticks to the asphalt.

455
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,474
Enjoy yourself.

456
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,637
I warmed it up nicely.

457
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,766
Good work. I will be sure to repay you.

458
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,809
I will keep that in mind.

459
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,768
I will be upstairs.
Call me if you need me.

460
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,753
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

461
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,721
Shall we drive?

462
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,087
Respond half a beat faster.

463
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,550
It's different from regular roads.

464
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,800
Now comes the straight section.

465
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,971
Deeper.
Step on the accelerator all the way.

466
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,589
More. Deeper.

467
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,717
More! Step on it!

468
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,638
Empty your head
until you can't think of anything.

469
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,348
More.

470
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,649
What kind of people love so dangerously?

471
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,945
Do you also think

472
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,617
I became the director
because of my father?

473
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,285
Anyone who knows you in the slightest
wouldn't speak such nonsense.

474
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,637
I got proposed

475
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,846
by Hyunseong.

476
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,317
Did you say yes?

477
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,361
I said that I can't say yes yet.

478
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,160
I said I will say yes
if he surpasses his father,

479
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,244
Chairman Gu Jingi.

480
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,454
Surpass his father?

481
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,834
Isn't that your desire?

482
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,671
If you hadn't said those words,

483
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,631
the thought of surpassing his father
would have never crossed his mind.

484
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,673
His life has a set ending.

485
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,047
Inheriting Banseok Foundation
and the hospital.

486
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,144
Nothing more.

487
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,433
Are you saying I am different?

488
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,015
You are just like me.

489
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,310
You don't have fear. You don't set limits.

490
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,265
Because you felt that,

491
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,904
you were drawn to me.

492
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,395
Don't marry Gu Hyunseong.

493
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,544
Why not?

494
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,704
Do you love me?

495
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,372
Yes, I love you.

496
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,078
A lot.

497
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,551
But I won't propose to you
like Gu Hyunseong.

498
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,086
Instead of being someone's woman

499
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,166
or wife,

500
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,717
you should simply be Lim Yuna.

501
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,555
That's when you shine
the most brilliantly.

502
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,728
That's right. That's what I want.

503
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,453
I want to drive once more.
I want to drive faster.

504
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,915
What… What happened?

505
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,764
We need to stabilize his heart rate.

506
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,009
I will inject the medicine.

507
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,803
<i>He needs to get surgery.</i>

508
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,472
If he doesn't get transplantation
or surgery for cardiomyopathy,

509
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,638
the next crisis could be

510
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,024
fatal.

511
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,983
What? But…

512
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,361
Who will operate?

513
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,862
I can't do it.

514
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,624
It's a difficult surgery,

515
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,949
so not even Director Gu Hyunseong
has done it.

516
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,161
That means

517
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,253
Dr. Han is my only hope.

518
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,499
Dr. Choi, please… Please help me.

519
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,087
Please save Junhwan.

520
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,933
If you assist him, Junhwan will live.

521
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,970
I am sorry. I can't do it.

522
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,177
I am sorry.

523
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,874
<i>Please save him.</i>

524
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,036
We'll trust you with our son's surgery.

525
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,915
So please help me get him out

526
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,258
of Banseokwon.

527
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,263
What are you saying?

528
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,723
You just need to get him discharged.

529
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,390
You don't need help.

530
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,020
If I try to get him discharged,
Chairman Gu might do something.

531
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,595
He might do something bad to my son.

532
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,516
What? No way. He wouldn't go that far.

533
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,105
Hold on. Do you honestly think
he might do that?

534
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,366
This is Gu Jingi we are talking about,
so it's entirely possible.

535
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,535
I agree. He has done worse.

536
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,910
What? Are you saying

537
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,998
we need to get him
out of Banseokwon like spies?

538
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,804
That's what we are saying.
So shut your mouth now.

539
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,259
I see. That's what you are saying.

540
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
As you know,

541
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,094
Banseokwon's security system
matches that of a government building.

542
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,064
All visitors' identities
are checked in real-time

543
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,099
<i>through surveillance cameras
at the front and back gates.</i>

544
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,885
<i>The entire building is covered
by glass with special coatings</i>

545
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,648
<i>that keep outsiders from looking inside.</i>

546
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,570
<i>All elevators are operated
by security cards.</i>

547
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,446
A closed security system
is vulnerable to an insider's help.

548
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,278
We know insiders. We know two of them.

549
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,330
Keep me out of this.
I can't enter the VIP floor yet.

550
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,826
Once a week,

551
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,834
Banseokwon's highest-ranking VIP visits.

552
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,207
-Turn off the security cameras.
-Okay.

553
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,465
<i>It takes five minutes for the VIP
to enter and take the elevator.</i>

554
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,049
<i>During that time,
all security cameras get turned off.</i>

555
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,766
We have to get him out during that time.

556
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,484
When will the VIP visit Banseokwon?

557
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,690
Tomorrow. The exact time is unknown,

558
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,573
but the VIP will visit tomorrow night.

559
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,397
Tomorrow.

560
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,240
Do you still use the underground passage
that connects Banseokwon and the hospital?

561
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,914
No. Not since you left the hospital.

562
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,128
You want me to help you
get a patient out of Banseokwon.

563
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,749
Who is this patient?

564
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,838
He is the son of Cho Junghyun,

565
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,973
the head of the nursing department
who is close to Chairman Gu Jingi.

566
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,505
He has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
I will operate.

567
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,480
And why should I help you?

568
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,515
Cho Junghyun's ex-husband

569
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,185
is the man who killed Park Kitae,
Nam Hyukchul.

570
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,065
If the operation ends successfully,
Nam Hyukchul will reveal

571
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,695
that he killed a man on Gu Jingi's order.

572
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,738
It will be a shocking revelation.

573
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,794
Do you think people will believe
a death-row inmate?

574
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,040
Whether they believe him or not,

575
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,172
this will snowball,
and they'll be more suspicious.

576
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,959
Then the stock price
of Banseok R and D Center will plummet.

577
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,165
And that's what you want.

578
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,346
Sure. I'll trust you then.

579
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,059
What can I help you with?

580
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,860
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

581
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,912
I'm going to operate on Nam Junhwan
in the morning two days from today.

582
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,659
Nam Hyukchul will only confess
if the surgery goes well.

583
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,621
Do you think you can finish
before the hearing?

584
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,200
I'll do my best.

585
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,880
But if I don't finish in time,
stall time for me.

586
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,629
Okay. I'll try.

587
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,915
Right. What about Dr. Choi?

588
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,299
I don't think he can join me.

589
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,969
It's fine. Jayden will help me
find another surgeon.

590
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,926
We won't be able to find
a cardiac surgeon,

591
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,977
but we can still find someone
to assist me.

592
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,691
Jayden.

593
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,733
But can we trust him with something
as important as this?

594
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,199
I think you might be trusting him
a bit too much.

595
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,319
I know we're working together,

596
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,276
but we don't know
what kind of person he is.

597
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,955
What's this about?

598
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,291
What was so important that
you had to discuss it now at my house?

599
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,172
Before I go on, I would like to apologize.

600
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,089
I apologize
for the incident in your office.

601
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:54,926
I didn't know
my lawyer would do something like that.

602
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,886
No need to apologize.
It's water under the bridge.

603
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,274
It's not exactly a token of my apology.

604
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,517
But I'll give you the information
you might find helpful.

605
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,310
Information?

606
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,573
Mr. Han will try to sneak out a patient
tomorrow night from Banseokwon.

607
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,025
He will probably do it
when your VIP arrives.

608
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,701
And my intel is solid

609
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,874
because I promised to let him use
my elevator for the penthouse.

610
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,166
How odd.

611
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Didn't you join forces with Han Yihan?

612
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,549
Why are you telling me all this?

613
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,263
I'll be honest.

614
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,600
I want more shares of the R and D Center.

615
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,471
I don't want Banseok to crumble.

616
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,402
If Nam Hyukchul reveals
shocking information

617
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,768
that can shatter
the foundation of Banseok,

618
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,610
it would devalue my investment.
Don't you agree?

619
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,780
I'm just an investor that seeks profits.

620
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,161
I don't have any loyalties to Han Yihan.

621
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,708
I'm using him for now.
And once he's useless,

622
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,174
I can toss him.

623
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,607
We'll arrive in three minutes.

624
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,275
Okay. I'll get it ready.

625
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,578
Our VVIP will arrive in three minutes.
Let's turn off the cameras.

626
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,103
It's starting.
The security cameras are off.

627
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,766
<i>We have five minutes.</i>

628
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,344
Gosh. If Chief Prosecutor Baek finds out,
he'll give us an earful.

629
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,922
Prosecutor Geum.
Why don't we wrap up here?

630
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,046
Come on! If you're going to
keep complaining, leave!

631
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,509
We can do this without you.

632
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,555
You punk. Why are you yelling at me?
Do you think I'm worried about myself?

633
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,350
I'm worried that
she might end up in trouble.

634
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,944
Hey, I'm talking to you.

635
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,479
-Be quiet. They're here.
-What?

636
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,855
-That guy…
-<i>Yihan, I need you to operate.</i>

637
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,784
<i>There is someone we need to save.</i>

638
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,784
<i>He was supposed
to be summoned for an investigation.</i>

639
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,118
<i>When I went to him,
he hurt himself with a knife.</i>

640
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,042
<i>They got us good this time.</i>

641
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,621
We're not giving up.
We're letting it stew.

642
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,417
I'm sure you know

643
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,880
some things are bound to get out.

644
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,087
Wait. I recognize that guy.

645
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,133
Isn't he the one
from the illegal political fund case?

646
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,005
Yes, he is. Look. He's Yoon Misun's aide.

647
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,428
You're right.
That's Assemblywoman Yoon Misun.

648
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,812
She's the party representative.

649
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,403
Right. When we were working at
the Southern District Prosecutors' Office,

650
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,480
we were investigating
her illegal political fund.

651
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,646
But that punk caused a scene.
He tried to kill himself.

652
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,946
So the case was a bust.

653
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,158
Hold on. That's Chairman Gu Jingi.

654
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,660
Hello.

655
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,161
Thank you for coming out to greet me.

656
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,623
For you, of course I should.

657
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,076
Let's go in.

658
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:57,054
Gosh. I can't believe
Gu Jingi got mixed up in this too.

659
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,299
What if he didn't get mixed up?
But he'd been with her the whole time?

660
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,889
What?

661
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,095
The aide was operated on
at Banseok University Medical Center.

662
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,098
Once he woke up,
I was going to resume, but I couldn't

663
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,944
because my brother had died.

664
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,271
Then Prosecutor Geum…

665
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,946
Dr. Han!

666
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,367
Let's go.

667
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,457
Is the new drug project on schedule?

668
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,791
Of course.

669
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,917
Phase Three of the clinical trials
will begin within this month.

670
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,545
We'll request the Ministry of Food
and Drug Safety for its approval.

671
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,133
I'm looking forward to it.

672
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,638
The very first cure
for Alzheimer's in the world.

673
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,354
I'm sure you know

674
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,850
that one of my campaign pledges is
the biomedical business.

675
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,813
Of course. The world will soon be--

676
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,854
Will it be in a frenzy?

677
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,477
Yes, in a good way.

678
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,841
Dr. Han.

679
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,469
Step back.

680
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,299
I'll handle them.

681
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:36,733
What should we do?

682
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,516
-Get him.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,197
Hello, ma'am.

684
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,041
I'm looking forward to our session.

685
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,628
Lately, my chin feels a bit thick.
And I feel heavy too.

686
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,089
Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best.

687
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,548
This way, ma'am.

688
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,930
You're not coming?

689
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,808
You should escort her.
I need to take care of something.

690
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,810
Okay.

691
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,020
Go on.

692
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,443
<i>They are here.</i>

693
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:22,975
I'll get him.

694
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,352
Darn it.

695
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,394
Step back.

696
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,987
I won't be asking again.

697
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,659
Step aside unless you want me to hurt you.

698
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,632
Daewoong!

699
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,719
Darn it!

700
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,312
Yihan.

701
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,023
Yihan, are you all right?

702
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,357
Stop!

703
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,662
You chose him in the end.

704
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,913
Then you must pay the price
for betraying me.

705
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,831
Your son.

706
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,713
I warned you.

707
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,804
I told you the person you treasured
the most would end up on the table

708
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,008
if you didn't listen to me.

709
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,309
But I will give you one last time
to redeem yourself for old times' sake.

710
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,471
It's not too late

711
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,016
to join me.

712
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,654
Then I'll forget about this whole thing.

713
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,107
And I'll get you a heart as promised.

714
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,778
There's no need.

715
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,658
Junhwan isn't here anyway.

716
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,264
Han Yihan.

717
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,216
Thank you for stalling time with us.

718
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,349
Thanks to you, he's safe on a chopper.

719
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,577
<i>A helicopter?</i>

720
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,199
A medical helicopter would be nice,
but if you can't find it,

721
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,371
find one with a lot of space inside.

722
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,879
It's not like you can schedule
the helicopter or park it like a taxi.

723
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,877
The propeller
would make a lot of noise too.

724
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,383
If Director Gu Jingi gets wind of this

725
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,045
and sends someone to the rooftop,

726
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,892
the patient could be in danger.

727
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,432
There's an underground passage
between Banseokwon and the hospital.

728
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,805
We'll distract them, making it look like
we're moving the patient.

729
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,018
I need you to leak our plan to him.

730
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,284
That I will try to move the patient
around the time his VIP client visits.

731
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,116
So you'll be the bait
to keep him distracted?

732
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:05,751
Are you sure?

733
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,416
I must pay the price to get what I want.

734
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,051
And if you want to win,

735
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,349
bet on me.

736
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,385
<i>Fine.</i>

737
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,931
I'll bet on you.

738
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,854
Boss, are you sure about this?

739
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,824
Give it up.

740
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,945
It's over now.

741
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,830
No. It's not over yet.

742
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,206
If your surgery fails,

743
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,035
everything will go back to square one.

744
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,803
You must have hurt your arm badly.

745
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,011
You seem uncomfortable.

746
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,467
Go ahead and try it.

747
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,061
You haven't cut for five years.

748
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,140
And you don't even have
a good surgeon to assist.

749
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,564
Go ahead and save him.

750
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,268
That is, if you think you can.

751
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,381
Go!

752
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,961
We got the patient.

753
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,747
<i>We'll head to the hospital.</i>

754
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,046
Okay. Keep checking on the patient.

755
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,304
<i>Yes, doctor.</i>

756
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,338
Daewoong, step on it.

-How are his vital signs?
-His BP dropped.

760
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,954
I gave him epinephrine en route.

761
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,329
Let's go inside.

762
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,223
-Daewoong, prep him.
-Okay.

763
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,140
Come with me. I'll go over the game plan.

764
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,851
Dr. Han.

765
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,060
Don't worry. I'll do my best to save him.

766
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,895
So you keep your promise too.

767
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:19,942
Okay.

768
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,962
I didn't think we'd ever be
in the same surgery again.

769
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,549
Same here. Are you sure you can do this?

770
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,090
You haven't done it for years.

771
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,758
You can see it yourself.
See if I can do this or not.

772
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,025
Hey, I'm ready.

Please let me join you too.

776

00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,419
I will begin the surgery.

781
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,603
It's time.

Are you all right, Yihan?

00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,941
All rise.

790
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,171
Give me the scalpel now!

791
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,850
I'll do it.

792
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,653
We'll switch places. Come to my side.

793
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,731
<i>Okay.</i>

794
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,860
<i>-What's wrong?
-I think there's a tear in the heart wall.</i>

795
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,450
Did something go wrong?

796
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,820
It's time.

797
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,699
<i>What is it?</i>

798
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,124
Your Honor. Could I provide
my legal service to the defendant?

799
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,538
What is this?
Why do you want to represent me?

800
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,375
Check it yourself. We'll talk then.

801
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,211
But he won't turn that easily

802
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,507
because his son's life is at stake.

803
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,511
Are you telling me
Dr. Han will kill the boy

804
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,933
if Nam Hyukchul
doesn't do what he promised?

805
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,102
Defendant, did you make up your mind?

806
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,350
-Yes.
-It won't be easy, as expected.
