1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:04,882
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,608
Was this really your decision?

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,988
I don't care.

4
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,947
I'll continue to save you.

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,498
<i>You've reached the 911 situation room.
How may I help you?</i>

6
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,794
I have an emergency patient.

7
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,001
He has carbon monoxide poisoning.

8
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,546
<i>Is the patient conscious?</i>

9
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,724
<i>We'll dispatch a unit.
Tell me your address.</i>

10
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,681
Jeungdong-ri, Yangseo-myeon,
Yangpyeong-gunâ€¦

11
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,646
<i>Hello? Sir?</i>

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,114
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

13
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,161
I guess we were never meant
to get along, Doctor.

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,042
Who knew I'd have a chance
to get back at you?

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,705
Gosh. Just stay on the ground.

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,165
That way,
you'll be a bit more comfortable.

17
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,586
All right. Mr. Kwon.

18
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,262
We've been through a lot together
despite our differences.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,564
Don't just stand there.

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,601
-Let him rest in peace now.
-Yes.

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,411
High beams? What on earth?

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,843
Who are these thugs?

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,589
I'm here to save you.

24
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,969
Wrap this up quickly.

25
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,154
It's been a while,
but I'm ready to have some fun.

26
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,308
Who are you guys?

27
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,979
Forget it.

28
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,524
Hey, crush them.

29
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,127
You punk!

30
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,982
I like it here. There are no guns here.

31
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,689
Come on. Seriously? He's got a gun.

32
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,693
Back off, everyone! Unless you want me
to make a hole in your stomach.

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,817
Come on, you idiots.

34
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,487
Wrap this up now!

35
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,157
Don't move!

36
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,964
Whoever moves first
will be the first to go. Got it?

37
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,326
This will count as self-defense, right?

38
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,911
You have to defend me
if that punk files a lawsuit against me.

39
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,002
You're still making jokes?

40
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,382
Even after you almost got shot?

41
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,462
It wasn't easy to hire you as my lawyer.

42
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,881
I can't lose you like this.

43
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,054
And if I had gotten shot,

44
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,925
you would have done anything to save me.

45
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,098
With this hand of yours.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,060
Of course, I would have.

47
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,729
But

48
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,861
I would have charged you
for the treatment.

49
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,856
Dr. Han.

50
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,823
I didn't know you could make jokes too.

51
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,089
EPISODE 13

52
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,211
Are you all right, doctor?

53
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,474
I'm all right. What about the patient?

54
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,720
His oxygen saturation level is too low.

55
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,974
Bring his oxygen level to the highest.
Get the Ambu bag ready.

56
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,346
-Okay.
-He's maxed out already.

57
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,983
Get ready for a cardiac arrest.

58
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,241
-How long until we arrive?
-Twenty minutes.

59
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,954
Check his pulse.

60
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,243
There's no pulse.
It might be a cardiac arrest.

61
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,197
I'll perform CPR.

62
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,043
His sinus rhythm isn't back.
His heart stopped.

63
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,125
I'll use the defibrillator.

64
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,337
-A hundred joules.
-A hundred.

65
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,811
There's no pulse.

66
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,636
-Charge 150 joules.
-On it.

67
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,939
No pulse. I'll perform CPR.

68
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,954
What?

69
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,203
Yoonseok is alive?

70
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,252
Yes. Mr. Han and several men showed up.

71
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,632
And they took him.

72
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,088
And Gong Gukkwang
was arrested at the scene

73
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,709
for the possession of an illegal weapon
and aggravated assault.

74
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,432
He was arrested?
How could you let this happen?

75
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,389
You should have
at least gotten rid of Yoonseok!

76
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,549
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,597
Get out.

78
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,179
Get out and make sure
the reporters don't publish anything!

79
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,425
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,153
<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

81
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,528
I have a favor to ask you.

82
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,776
Go ahead.

83
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,115
<i>I need Banseok Foundation's legal team.</i>

84
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,158
Give me the best lawyer you have.

85
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,157
May I ask what this is about?

86
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,748
Gong Gukkwang was arrested.

87
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,248
<i>If he talks, the list of political funds
I received will be disclosed.</i>

88
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,383
I'm sure you know that
once the list hits the headlines,

89
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,257
you won't pass the hearing
for the Minister of Health and Welfare.

90
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,723
I'll send over the team leader
of our legal team.

91
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,011
But what about Mr. Kwon?

92
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,812
He's still alive.

93
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,192
<i>I was told Han Yihan treated him
on the spot and moved him to a hospital.</i>

94
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,225
<i>But I haven't found out his condition yet.</i>

95
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,113
If you can, find out about that too.

96
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,361
I'll try.

97
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,539
This is so upsetting.

98
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,749
Had I been there with you,

99
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,747
those punks would be half dead.

100
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,672
How could you go there by yourself?
What were you thinking?

101
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,958
Seriously. This could've turned out worse.

102
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,416
What happened?

103
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,425
-Are you hurt?
-It's nothing. I'm good.

104
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,759
No, this is serious.
You were hit by a wooden stick.

105
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,465
If he got the back of your head,
you would've had a brain hemorrhage.

106
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,929
What? Why did you punch me in the side?

107
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,478
Read the room, will you?

108
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,691
Hey, he's bleeding
because he got hit by a wooden stick.

109
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,651
How is he okay? It was a wooden stick.

110
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,948
What happened?

111
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,407
I went to Yoon Miseon's vacation house
to see Kwon Yoonseok.

112
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,453
Gong Gukkwang and his guys
were at the house.

113
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,117
Luckily, Jayden showed up,
so I was able to get out of there safely.

114
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,745
Jayden?

115
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,924
That's not important.
I need to see Lim Taemoon right now.

116
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,134
Why?

117
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,681
I need to convince him to bring me in
as a witness at the hearing.

118
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,055
If not now, there's no way
I would be able to attend the hearing.

119
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,135
Are you all right?

120
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,849
I'm okay.

121
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,940
Give me your car key.

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,030
What if you go there alone
and end up in danger again?

123
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,776
Give me your car key. I'll drive.

124
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
-The list of witnesses for the hearing.
-Okay.

125
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,924
It was hard to reach a compromise
between the major parties.

126
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,921
So it took some time.

127
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,802
LIST OF WITNESSES FOR THE HEARING
OF THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

128
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,089
I see Cho Junghyun,
the head of the nursing department.

129
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,133
Well, we had no choice.

130
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,429
When we tried to exclude
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong

131
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,182
and Mr. Han Yihan from the list,

132
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,104
the ruling party strongly opposed that.

133
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,892
So we had no choice but to accept
the other witnesses they wanted.

134
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,226
There's nothing we can do then.

135
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,268
Thank you for your effort.

136
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,186
-Here.
-Thank you.

137
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,294
What's this about?

138
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,247
<i>There's something
I have to tell you in person.</i>

139
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,798
It's late. Let's talk later.

140
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,460
<i>I only need a moment of your time.</i>

141
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,048
<i>Please stop the car. I'm right behind you.</i>

142
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,054
What?

143
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,635
Fine.

144
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,769
-Stop the car.
-Yes, sir.

145
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,204
Go ahead. What do you need to tell me?

146
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,958
Put me on the witness list for the hearing
of the Minister of Health and Welfare.

147
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,792
Witness? I can't allow that.

148
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,960
We already reached an agreement.
So the list is set.

149
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,758
It's only been agreed upon.
But it hasn't been announced yet.

150
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,682
I'm sure we were discussed
as possible witnesses.

151
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,969
Do you still need his permission?

152
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,189
Permission? That's nonsense.

153
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,480
Didn't Gu Jingi instruct you

154
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,400
to only bring in the people who would be
favorable to him for the hearing?

155
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,034
This is an insult.

156
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,949
Let's forget about the surgery then.

157
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,197
And I don't want you
to call me ever again.

158
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,698
How much longer will he boss you around?

159
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,711
You're doing everything he wants
because he has something on you.

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,261
Will you continue doing this
even after you become the president?

161
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,047
If you don't handle him now,

162
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,473
you will never be able to escape
from Gu Jingi.

163
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,226
To prevent it, we'll help you.

164
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,979
We plan to catch Assemblywoman Yoon
for accepting illegal political funds.

165
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,903
Once that happens,

166
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,822
you'll be the presidential candidate
of Daehan Party for sure.

167
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,451
-We're checking it now.
-Yes.

168
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,117
Yes.

169
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,503
-We're checking it now.
-Thanks.

170
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,579
-Please wait.
-It's not confirmed.

171
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,424
-She was irrelevant.
-Okay.

172
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,079
<i>I told you before.</i>

173
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,801
Ma'am, there was breaking news
regarding Mr. Kwon.

174
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,173
Turn it on.

175
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,426
<i>Gukkwang Gang is
an organized crime syndicate that owns</i>

176
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,642
<i>a private money-lending business
and illegal financial business.</i>

177
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,524
<i>The boss of the gang was arrested
by the police for assaulting a lawyer.</i>

178
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,767
Mr. Gong and three of his gang members
are suspected of assaulting a lawyer,

179
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,857
Han Yihan, at the vacation house of
the presidential candidate, Yoon Miseon,

180
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,324
<i>when the lawyer was trying
to meet with her aide, Kwon Yoonseok,</i>

181
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,905
<i>-in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province.</i>
-Did you want to see me?

182
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,701
<i>Mr. Kwon was found unconscious
by the dispatched paramedics.</i>

183
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,366
<i>He was transferred to a nearby hospital
and is getting treated there.</i>

184
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,752
New-Hope Medicine Clinic.

185
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,502
<i>I'm Reporter Ban Soohee of MBS News.</i>

186
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,384
Did Han Yihan cause trouble again?

187
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,171
You got the request to appear
at my hearing as a witness, right?

188
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,465
Yes, sir.

189
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,546
Han Yihan was selected as a witness too.

190
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,601
-Him too?
-Yes.

191
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,473
So

192
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,305
I need you to do something for me.

193
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,811
Sure.

194
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,105
CEO OF GUKKWANG CAPITAL GETS ARRESTED

195
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,704
DID YOON MISEON REALLY LAUNDER MONEY?

196
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,867
I told him to stay low.

197
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,753
<i>Your name.</i>

198
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,869
I plead the Fifth.

199
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,706
Gong Gukkwang.

200
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,505
-Your age.
-I plead the Fifth.

201
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,718
Forty-six years old.

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,640
Why did you try to kill the victim?

203
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,890
What? You can't come up
with your own answer for that one?

204
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,522
Let me make a call.

205
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,517
Why? So you can call your lawyer?

206
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,904
No. I'll call a prosecutor.

207
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,819
GONG GUKKWANG

208
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,709
<i>The person you reached is not available.</i>

209
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,042
<i>You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

210
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,756
<i>Goodness. He's hurting my feelings.</i>

211
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,299
We even went to the sauna together
and all.

212
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,891
This reminds me of my days on Wall Street.

213
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,307
What's the stock price
for the R and D Center?

214
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,146
It's 47,100 won per stock.

215
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,151
The market capitalization is
at 3.8 trillion won.

216
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,994
It went up as expected.

217
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,779
When the hearing starts tomorrow,
the price will skyrocket.

218
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,534
And when it does, short sell the stocks.

219
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,619
Short sell them? How many stocks?

220
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,670
As many stocks as you can.

221
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,789
We'll get them back
in R and D Center's stocks,

222
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,206
as for our 300-billion-won investment.

223
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,916
But we still need to get some cash.

224
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,296
I understand that
you like taking risks for high returns.

225
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,143
But isn't that too risky?

226
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,510
There's no guarantee Gu Jingi
will be disqualified at the hearing.

227
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,640
What if the price goes up--

228
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,481
It's not the time to get scared right now.
It's time to go all-in.

229
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,524
Watch me.

230
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,477
The stocks of the R and D Center
and the hefty amount of cash.

231
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,741
I'll get them both.

232
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,659
Getting you here wasn't easy,
Mr. Gu Hyunseong.

233
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,668
We don't admit to any charges
you're bringing up.

234
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,712
You barged in during the board meeting

235
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,915
and disclosed
the attempted murder charge on him.

236
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,336
I'll sue you for publicly disclosing
the charge and slandering.

237
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,852
Go ahead. I don't plan
on making excuses over that.

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,180
I get why he doesn't want to admit
to the attempted murder charge.

239
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,810
He won't even admit to changing

240
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,103
the operating surgeon
and fabricating the medical records?

241
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,107
Even when we found evidence
from searching the hospital?

242
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,690
It was
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung's order.

243
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,818
As for him, he was led to believe
that Gil Soyeon's mother was updated

244
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,906
regarding the change in the OR.

245
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,411
And he was not aware of
the fabricated medical records either.

246
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,785
Let me get this straight.

247
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,331
You want to toss out
Assistant Director Lee too?

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,206
If you keep cutting off your people,
you'll end up alone.

249
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,665
I don't follow you.

250
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,548
Mr. Gu.

251
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,550
Somehow, we ended up
getting to know each other a lot.

252
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,097
Let me ask you a question.

253
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,061
You forced other doctors

254
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,270
to perform the surgery for you
and framed other people,

255
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,731
but you have turned a blind eye
to the pain of the victims of malpractice.

256
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,980
What kind of doctor are you trying to be?

257
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,363
Wait.

258
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,988
Do you just need the title, doctor?

259
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,534
We won't answer any questions
that are irrelevant--

260
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,115
You should ask Han Yihan.

261
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,161
You don't have to answer questions.

262
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,254
I'm sure you know

263
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,419
he killed your brother
when working as my ghost doctor.

264
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,463
Director Gu.

265
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,961
Yes, I know that.

266
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,755
But he at least admitted to his crime

267
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,513
and he regrets what he did.

268
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,805
But what about you?

269
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,807
Have you thought

270
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,483
about taking responsibility even once?

271
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,899
This is enough.

272
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,689
If you continue this line of questioning,
I'll file a formal complaint.

273
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,073
Prosecutor Geum.

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,410
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to talk to you.

275
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,750
Let's take a break.

276
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,000
INTERROGATION ROOM

277
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,633
What's this about?

278
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,837
Well, just like you said,
I contacted the police

279
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,594
and tried to take over
Gong Gukkwang's case.

280
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,505
But they said
a prosecutor already took it.

281
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,264
Already? Whoâ€¦

282
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,975
Was it Kangho?

283
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,729
Yes.

284
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,691
He said this was a big case,
so he wanted to investigate it personally.

285
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,818
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO A PERSONAL MATTER

286
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,487
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE

287
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,866
Gu Jingi instigated perjury.

288
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,043
And Park Kitae recorded that?

289
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,673
Yes.

290
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,536
It's in here.

291
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,955
When did you find that?

292
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,054
Only recently.

293
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,220
I will attend the hearing tomorrow
and disclose this recording.

294
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,466
And Cho Junghyun will testify with me too.

295
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,478
With the evidence for instigating perjury

296
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,901
and a witness to testify
for illegal transplant surgery,

297
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,692
we'll be able to get
Gu Jingi disqualified tomorrow for sure.

298
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,654
After that,
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong will indict him.

299
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,527
What's wrong?

300
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,525
I'm sorry. I'm a bit fascinated.

301
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,735
What do you mean?

302
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,868
You have never explained your plan to me
in advance like this

303
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,036
unless you needed my help.

304
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,417
This sudden change is making me

305
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,459
see you differently.

306
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,545
To be honest,

307
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,843
I didn't trust you completely.

308
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,144
Frankly speaking, your first impression
didn't seem that trustworthy.

309
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,595
But I decided to trust you from now on.

310
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,898
You stayed by our side
even in dangerous situations.

311
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,526
What's going on?

312
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,746
Lee Dohyung.

313
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,316
An EEG device?

314
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,781
No way. Is he brain dead?

315
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,124
Lee Dohyung.

316
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,409
What are you doing here?

317
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,038
Did Gu Jingi put you up to this?

318
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,333
To kill Kwon Yoonseok if he was alive?

319
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,591
How could you say such a horrible thing?

320
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,209
Then why are you here?

321
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,762
I want you to represent me.

322
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,470
I'm about to take the fall for everything
including fabricating medical records,

323
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,013
changing the surgeon,
and violating the Narcotics Control Act.

324
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,274
So I wanted you to represent me.

325
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,885
No.

326
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,477
I can't be your lawyer.

327
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,272
Why not?

328
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,685
Kitae's only crime was perjury,

329
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,360
but you helped

330
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,451
Gu Jingi take out Seokju's heart.

331
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,989
I did no such thing! Please trust me.

332
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,115
Chairman Gu Jingi
took out the heart by himself.

333
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,831
When I arrived, it was already over.

334
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,122
I may not be a good man,

335
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,496
but I would never kill a person
to take out the heart.

336
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,126
If you are telling the truth,

337
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,171
testify at the hearing tomorrow.

338
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,684
If you are ready
to take responsibility for your crimes,

339
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,716
I will defend you
to the best of my abilities.

340
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,473
If I do that,

341
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,887
Chairman Gu won't let me be.

342
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,227
Don't worry about that.

343
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,110
If you do one thing for me,

344
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,821
I can destroy Gu Jingi for good.

345
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,652
PATIENT'S ROOM

346
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,872
BAEK KANGHO

347
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,843
Did you take the Gong Gukkwang case?

348
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,929
Yes, I did.

349
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,722
You took over the investigation
and acquitted him five years ago.

350
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,558
Will you do the same this time?

351
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,597
What are you talking about?

352
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,309
Why would I do that?

353
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,989
PUBLIC SAUNA

354
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,987
So?

355
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,544
They don't prove the tie
between me and him.

356
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,040
Are you going to be this way?

357
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,341
Did you think
that these photos would make me talk?

358
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,797
You still have a lot to learn.

359
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,419
Why are you doing this?

360
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,965
What deal did you make with Gu Jingi?

361
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,049
There is no deal.

362
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,640
I followed my judgment and acquitted him.

363
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,890
If you truly think
that I made a deal with Gu Jingi,

364
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,523
bring me the evidence I can't deny,

365
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,021
not these flimsy photos.

366
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,438
Don't worry.

367
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,781
I won't side with Gu Jingi at the hearing.

368
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,608
I will testify the fact
without adding any guesses or opinions.

369
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,365
You should reveal the truth,
not tell the fact.

370
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,785
That's what the hearing is for.

371
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,825
The truth is different for everyone.

372
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,405
What they believe is the truth.

373
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,747
No.

374
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,076
There is only one truth.

375
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,585
Gu Jingi

376
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,547
killed Seokju!

377
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,774
Seokyeong, are you okay?

378
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,137
Don't touch me.

379
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,400
At the hearing,

380
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,624
Han Yihan will reveal evidence.

381
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,656
And Cho Junghyun

382
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,871
will testify to Gu Jingi's crime.

383
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,420
Listen to them and judge

384
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,380
what the truth is.

385
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,258
<i>Mr. Kwon Yoonseok</i>

386
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,930
abused Candidate Yoon's power
and received slush funds.

387
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,891
When the corruption got revealed,
he attempted to commit suicide

388
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,433
because he was afraid of punishment.

389
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,728
Let's wrap it up this way.

390
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,060
How about the fact that I dragged my boys
to the vacation house?

391
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,732
Can you cover that up too?

392
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,193
When you arrived,

393
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,647
Kwon Yoonseok was already on the ground.

394
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,074
You brought your employees
in order to solve the trouble that arose

395
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,368
during the money-laundering process.

396
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,327
As for the assault on Mr. Han Yihanâ€¦

397
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,996
Let's say it was unpremeditated.

398
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,336
There is bad blood that goes back
to the detention center.

399
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,416
Due to threats and assault,
you won't be able to avoid imprisonment.

400
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,928
But it won't go over three years.

401
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,296
Geumcheon-gu
will be redeveloped as planned.

402
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,854
Think that you are making
about 100 billion won a year

403
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,771
and cultivate yourself spiritually.

404
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,770
Three years?

405
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,112
You promise.

406
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,369
I am sorry to interrupt,
but the prosecution wants to take over.

407
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,495
Already?

408
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,750
Who is the person in charge?

409
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,634
He is from Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

410
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,340
He is Senior Prosecutor Baek Kangho.

411
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,474
Baek Kangho.

412
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,891
It's okay. He is my backup.

413
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,509
-Are you certain?
-I am certain.

414
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,556
He was the one who built a connection
between me and Chairman Gu Jingi.

415
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,475
I met him a few days ago.

416
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,152
Okay. We will end the meeting now.

417
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,317
All right.

418
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,031
<i>Brain dead?</i>

419
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,236
Yes.

420
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,412
He has a respirator and EEG device
attached to him.

421
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:42,825
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung checked
that the graphs weren't moving.

422
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,546
Then the chance of him waking up--

423
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,588
It's the same as death. He won't wake up.

424
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,761
I am glad.

425
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,510
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

426
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,220
Once this incident gets wrapped up,

427
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,729
I will help Banseok
to the best of my abilities.

428
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,059
Thank you.

429
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,483
You did great work.

430
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,226
Don't mention it.

431
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,236
Since five years agoâ€¦ No.

432
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,071
Since what happened with Jihyuk,

433
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,869
you were the only one
who followed me wholeheartedly.

434
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,620
I am thankful for that.

435
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,579
Please do well at the hearing
tomorrow as well.

436
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,747
-Please don't worry.
-Okay.

437
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,923
You can get going now.
I will contact you tomorrow.

438
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,841
Please get some rest.

439
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,219
Prepare a press conference.

440
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,684
I will answer all allegations myself.

441
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,021
Yes, ma'am. I will prepare it right away.

442
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,281
Thank you.

443
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,111
Thank you, Yoonseok.

444
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:04,206
You don't think Lim Taemoon is the VIP
who received Seokju's heart?

445
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,419
Lim Yuna said it herself.

446
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,839
Lim Taemoon received surgery
in the US, not Korea.

447
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,966
She asked me to keep it a secret,
but I thought that you should know.

448
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,014
It could be a lie.

449
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,466
Perhaps she doesn't want to admit
that her father received

450
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,675
an illegal heart transplant.

451
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,885
But she seems to be telling the truth.

452
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,443
Then who? Who took Seokju's heart?

453
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,397
Could it be someone else who isn't here?

454
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,703
LIM TAEMOON

455
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,617
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR A PARTY

456
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,044
YOON MISEON

457
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,710
YOON MISEON

458
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,134
Yoon Miseon.

459
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,086
Maybe she visits Banseokwon in secret

460
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,340
to receive checkups
on her transplanted heart.

461
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,012
It can't be Yoon Miseon.

462
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,546
Judging from my memory,
this person wasn't so small.

463
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:07,894
<i>A VIP for whom Gu Jingi would kill someone
to acquire a heart.</i>

464
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,270
We just need to put Gu Jingi behind bars.

465
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,284
Then I will do whatever it takes

466
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,741
to make him confess the identity
of the VIP who received

467
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,701
Seokju's heart.

468
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,956
Tomorrow, everything will end.

469
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,423
One of us will gain a lot

470
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,094
and the other will lose a lot.

471
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,179
That's too bad.

472
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,853
Both of us could have been winners.

473
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,148
Perhaps so.

474
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,234
But you didn't keep your promise.

475
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,824
Do you know what percentage
of candidates become disqualified

476
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,528
after the hearing?

477
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,028
Less than 10%.

478
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,954
That means most candidates pass.

479
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,081
Unless a definite criminal activity
gets proven,

480
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,456
I will pass the hearing.

481
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,539
"A definite criminal activity."

482
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,376
Something like opening the chest
of a 19-year-old boy

483
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,683
and taking out the heart?

484
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,887
How ironic.

485
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,058
I just told you, didn't I?

486
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,690
You will need to prove it.

487
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,022
Do you think I won't be able to?

488
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,896
Do it if you can.

489
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,647
Please empty the penthouse
once the hearing ends tomorrow.

490
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,909
People who are more deserving

491
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,791
will use the place.

492
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,582
After tomorrow, we will see

493
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,245
who will leave Banseokwon.

494
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,466
There are no traces of drugs?

495
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,480
No. Everything was clean.

496
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,154
TEST RESULTS, NEGATIVE

497
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,733
For goodness' sake.

498
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,613
It isn't a drug you can stop using easily.

499
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,487
Run the test again.
The results might be wrong.

500
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,953
Yes, sir.

501
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,750
And you should check this out as well.

502
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,325
PRESCRIPTION
PATIENT NAME: KIM YOUNGHO

503
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,876
It's a prescription.

504
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,375
Kim Youngho?

505
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,342
It was among the shredded paper
that came from the penthouse.

506
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,133
-The penthouse?
-Yes.

507
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,300
But it's someone else's name.

508
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,179
Don't you know what this drug is?

509
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,853
That part was too damaged
to make out the words.

510
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,359
Find out who Kim Youngho is.

511
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,976
And look for the missing part.

512
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,106
Yes, sir.

513
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,608
DRUG DOSAGE

514
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,792
<i>The extended trading volume is very high.</i>

515
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,410
<i>The estimated price already rose
by over 10%.</i>

516
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,997
It will hit the ceiling
once the hearing begins.

517
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,753
Let me repeat.
That's the time for short selling.

518
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,258
<i>We will sell stocks
when the price is the highest</i>

519
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,378
and buy them back
when the price is the lowest.

520
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,045
TIME, TRADED PRICE, NET CHANGE,
AMOUNT OF STOCK DEAL

521
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,304
Are you sure about this?

522
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,925
If Gu Jingi becomes
the Minister of Health and Welfare,

523
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,683
the stock price will skyrocket.

524
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,354
<i>We didn't secure many shares
for Banseok R and D Center.</i>

525
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,734
We will lose over 100 billion won.

526
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,563
<i>Even if we short sell stocks,</i>

527
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,146
we should lessen the amount--

528
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,571
Short selling a big amount of stocks
will make the investors panic sell.

529
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,992
It's a surefire way
to crash the stock price.

530
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,070
Just do as I say.

531
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,987
I will take responsibility.

532
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,579
Do well. We will watch it at home.

533
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,081
It won't do you any good
to see me get grilled.

534
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,050
Don't bother with it.

535
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,971
Listening to people's chatters
will trouble your heart.

536
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,433
Father.

537
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,682
Good luck.

538
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,894
Don't worry.

539
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,265
-Okay.
-All right.

540
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,227
Stay inside.

541
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,244
He will be okay, right?

542
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,400
Of course.

543
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,658
Your father is an extraordinary man.

544
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,032
He will overcome.

545
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,170
WITNESS REQUEST FOR THE HEARING
JUNG YOONJUNG

546
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,129
<i>From Geum Seokju,</i>

547
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,626
a transplanted heart was taken out?

548
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,262
That's murder.

549
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,022
You are right. It was murder.

550
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,599
That's why Dr. Han
and Prosecutor Geum want revenge.

551
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,107
Hold on. Thenâ€¦

552
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,859
Then by fabricating the autopsy report,

553
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,110
I covered up Chairman Gu's murder.

554
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,701
Geum Seokju wasn't the only one.

555
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,921
Dr. Park Kitae was killed
by Chairman Gu too.

556
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,339
Why did he get killed?

557
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,340
He tried to confess to committing perjury
at Geum Seokju's trial.

558
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,217
I will attend the hearing as a witness.

559
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,144
Even if I try for the rest of my life,

560
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,274
I won't be able to pay Dr. Han back
for what he has done.

561
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,402
What should I do?

562
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,270
You should decide for yourself.

563
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,986
But remember one thing.

564
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,275
Unless you disclose
Chairman Gu Jingi's crime now,

565
00:33:55,491 --> 00:34:00,201
you will get dragged around all your life
and suffer due to guilty conscience

566
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,617
like I have.

567
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,721
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR LEE DOHYUNG

568
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,885
Yes, sir.

569
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,524
Will you attend the hearing?

570
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,522
I am torn.

571
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,066
Banseok's Legal Team is trying to frame me
for Gu Hyunseong's crime.

572
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,614
<i>Can we meet up and discuss the matter?</i>

573
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,873
Can you come to Banseokwon?

574
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,582
Ms. Cho Junghyun will come too.

575
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,738
Okay.

576
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,787
<i>I will be there.</i>

577
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,075
Okay.

578
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,249
THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS

579
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,875
I will be back, Seokju.

580
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,340
Please watch and see

581
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,263
how I make them pay

582
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,802
for their sin.

583
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,231
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

584
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,151
You came. Sit down.

585
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,240
All right.

586
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,111
We are in the same boat.

587
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,078
If one of us talks,
we will go down together.

588
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,371
So let's be honest.
What are you going to do today?

589
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,374
I will attend the hearing
and reveal everything.

590
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,094
That includes the perjury
and what happened five years ago.

591
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,213
Me too.

592
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,546
I don't know as much as the two of you do,

593
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,591
but I will reveal that I fabricated
Geum Seokju's autopsy report.

594
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,347
Right. We should do that.

595
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,183
That would be the right thing.

596
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,651
Please enter.

597
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,373
What are you doing?
Why is the Security Team here?

598
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,697
I am terribly sorry.
I wasn't going to go this far.

599
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,536
Stay here until the hearing ends.

600
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,463
Then you will be fine.

601
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,539
Sit still and nothing will happen.

602
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,837
Hand over your phone.

603
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,097
Hi.

604
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,015
I kept them in the room as you instructed,
Chairman Gu. I mean, Minister Gu.

605
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,939
-Good work.
-It was my pleasure.

606
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,520
You promised to make me the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

607
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,225
Mr. Cheon, get in the car.

608
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,646
Yes, sir.

609
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,565
Yes. You will be the director of Banseok
University Medical Center from now on.

610
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,198
I will protect
your medical license as well.

611
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,445
Thank you.

612
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,906
Thank you so much, Minister Gu.

613
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,416
Thank you.

614
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,455
Sir.

615
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,585
What is it?

616
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,573
-Welcome.
-Hello.

617
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,236
-Let's go.
-All right.

618
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,032
-Please say a few words.
-Please say a few words.

619
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,947
-Is it a suicide or not?
-Please say a few words.

620
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,326
-Please tell us.
-Please wait.

621
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,373
Please make a comment
about your aide, Kwon Yoonseok.

622
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,536
-Did he attempt to commit suicide?
-Please give us a comment.

623
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,666
There is an allegation that it wasn't
a suicide attempt. Please comment.

624
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,967
Thank you for coming.

625
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,686
I will answer to allegations
in the press conference room.

626
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,912
I am in your care.

627
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,297
I, a candidate for a government position,
solemnly swear to follow

628
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,599
my conscience to speak the truth as it is

629
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,215
without any concealments or embellishments

630
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,938
at the hearing that is run
by the National Assembly.

631
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,896
A candidate for a government position,
Gu Jingi.

632
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,945
<i>Candidate Gu, please take a seat.</i>

633
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,907
Five years ago,

634
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,955
why did you frame me?

635
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,711
<i>As you knowâ€¦</i>

636
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,003
When I told Seokyeong
about your coercive investigation,

637
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,207
she said

638
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,683
that you would never do such a thing.

639
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,684
If someone who would never do such a thing
acted that way,

640
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,636
there must be a reason.

641
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,517
No matter the reason,
today's hearing will be

642
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,611
your last chance to tell the truth

643
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,196
and seek forgiveness.

644
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,663
<i>Since today's hearing is receiving
much attention from the public,</i>

645
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,377
<i>many journalists came.</i>

646
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,248
<i>For the public's right to knowledge,</i>

647
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,455
<i>we will guarantee
the journalists' activities</i>

648
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,466
<i>as long as they don't interfere
with the hearing.</i>

649
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,467
<i>During today's hearing,</i>

650
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,894
<i>the ministerial candidateâ€¦</i>

651
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,470
How will he take responsibility?

652
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,970
<i>The candidate's abilities
and qualifications need to be checkedâ€¦</i>

653
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,677
VIDEO CALL

654
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,772
<i>We ask for your cooperation.</i>

655
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,774
What timing.

656
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,225
<i>I will now explain the process
of the hearing.</i>

657
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:49,163
The most important part of today's hearing
is figuring out the truth

658
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,528
behind the various suspicions
regarding the candidate

659
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,536
and verifying his morality.

660
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,082
As a result, after his opening statement,

661
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,083
we will call the witness
and hear their testimony.

662
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,536
<i>After the witness has been questioned,</i>

663
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,013
<i>the assemblymen will ask their questions
before we hear from the candidate</i>

664
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,009
<i>-The phone has been turned off.
-and his closing statements.</i>

665
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,182
<i>-After the beep--
-That will be the order of this hearing.</i>

666
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,019
You will enter
after the candidate's opening statement.

667
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,189
-Please get ready.
-Okay.

668
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,396
<i>I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon,
and for 30 yearsâ€¦</i>

669
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,316
What happened?

670
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,533
I got it. I'll check the video,
post it on the streaming site,

671
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,815
and send it to reporters.

672
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,698
Send it to me when it's ready.

673
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,914
<i>Okay.</i>

674
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,834
<i>I've worked hard
to cure people in our hospital,</i>

675
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,995
<i>and our Health and Welfareâ€¦</i>

676
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,462
The assemblywoman is coming out.

677
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,427
The reason I invited you all to this place

678
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,016
is to apologize
for the unforgivable crimes

679
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,361
my aide, whom I valued greatly,
has committed.

680
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,949
My aide, Kwon Yoonseok,
received bribes for the purpose

681
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,738
of collecting campaign funds,

682
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,370
and he laundered the money
through a loan shark

683
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,040
to fulfill his personal greed.

684
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,960
You should become an actress,
not a politician.

685
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,543
Today, I intend to explain

686
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,285
all the suspicions
regarding me and Banseok Foundation

687
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,668
for the last time,

688
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,554
and I promise to dedicate myself
to the progress

689
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,893
of Korea's medical and welfare system.

690
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,139
Thank you.

691
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,388
That will be all
for his opening statement.

692
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,020
-Please bring in the witness.
-Yes, sir.

705
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,330
There's a problem.

706
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,084
A problem?

707
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,327
VIDEO CALL FROM SUSIE YOON

708
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,917
What do you want?
I'm really busy right now.

709
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,376
<i>I stopped the short selling
of Banseok R and D center.</i>

710
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,008
What?

711
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,314
With what right?

712
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,638
As the Chief Director of headquarters.

713
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,636
You revised the contract
with Banseok on your own,

714
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,307
but I can't let you do something
so dangerous.

715
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:13,026
I make the decisions and am responsible
for all the business in Asia.

716
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,568
Start short selling. Right now.

717
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,123
I think the risk is too big too.

718
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,540
You won't be responsible
for my career too.

719
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,370
Baek Kangho and Han Yihan
are the only ones who are in attendance.

720
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,584
The witnesses will take an oath.

721
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,205
Witness.

722
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,344
<i>Please stand up.</i>

723
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,007
<i>I solemnly swear</i>

724
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,392
<i>to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

725
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,760
<i>and nothing but the truth</i>

726
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,597
<i>under pains and penalties of perjury.</i>

727
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,636
Witness Han Yihan.

728
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,226
-Baek Kangho.
-Please have a seat.

729
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,401
WITNESS

730
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,403
You have been the legal counsel
for the victims of medical malpractice

731
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,027
at Banseok University Medical Center.

732
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,992
-Yes.
-Among them,

733
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,584
Park Kitae, a doctor
at Banseok University Medical Center,

734
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,000
was murdered while he was incarcerated.

735
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,369
The prosecution claimed

736
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,125
that the candidate abetted that murder.

737
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,629
As the lawyer who defended the deceased,

738
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,302
I would like to know
what you think about that.

739
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,338
The relationship between
the late Park Kitae and Candidate Gu Jingi

740
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,057
wasn't just simply the chairman
of the foundation and a doctor.

741
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,268
Five years ago, the candidate

742
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,230
had the deceased perjure himself
during the trial for Geum Seokju.

743
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,855
The contents of that conversation
are here.

744
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,489
The candidate was afraid that the deceased

745
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,707
<i>would reveal that he perjured himself
in the Geum Seokju case,</i>

746
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,666
<i>and he murdered him the day
before the sentencing.</i>

747
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,961
This is your last chance.

748
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,553
Start the short selling.

749
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,128
<i>No. You can't.</i>

750
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,172
<i>We can't increase the risk by double.</i>

751
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,837
Why don't you come to an agreement?

752
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,176
Shut it and do it!

753
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,388
If you don't, you're fired.

754
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,734
-Assemblyman!
-What is this?

755
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,478
In order to prove this,

756
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,145
I ask that you reveal the contents
in it right now.

757
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,605
Hold on, Witness.

758
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,905
This hearing for the minister
is being aired live on TV.

759
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,040
We can't reveal any evidence
that we haven't agreed on in advance.

760
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,498
If you only reveal the evidence
you've agreed upon in advance,

761
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,371
how will you verify the suspicions
regarding the candidate?

762
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,537
Even still, revealing the contents
of a private conversationâ€¦

763
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,837
It was not private.

764
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,010
It was a conversation with the candidate

765
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,718
who took an oath to public office.

766
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,010
We must reveal it here.

767
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,303
Why are you preventing him
from revealing evidence?

768
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,597
Are you trying to cover it up?

769
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,520
That's right.
Why are you afraid to reveal it?

770
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,560
Reveal it this instant!

771
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,480
-What nonsense are you talking about?
-What are you afraid of?

772
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,772
Be quiet!

773
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,855
-Reveal the evidence!
-Silence!

774
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,031
-This is a hearing to vet him!
-Sir!

775
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,149
Okay. We will check it. Go ahead.

776
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,950
HEARING FOR GU JINGI,
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE CANDIDATE

777
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,174
<i>I, Yoon Miseon,</i>

778
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,671
promise the citizens

779
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,973
that I will cooperate diligently
as a testifier

780
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,678
with the police and prosecution's
investigations.

781
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,429
Will you continue the election race?

782
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,221
Who did your aide receive bribes from?

783
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:34,055
Your political funds were under suspicion
five years ago. Is that related?

784
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,364
I will continue to compete
in the election race until the end.

785
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,154
And I believe
that the police and prosecution

786
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,954
will reveal the answers
to all the questions

787
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,568
I am unable to answer today.

788
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,786
I would like to apologize once again
for causing concern

789
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,369
to the people
for such a shameful incident.

790
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,917
Please move aside.

791
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,924
-Move over.
-Excuse me. Let us through.

792
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,876
Excuse me. Please move.
We're with the prosecution.

793
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,256
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

794
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,441
I'm Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
from the Medical Crime Department.

795
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,443
And the man sitting next to me is the man

796
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,982
in charge of Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon's
political funds,

797
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,533
Chief Aide, Kwon Yoonseok.

798
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,744
Mr. Kwon regained consciousness
in the hospital yesterday,

799
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,326
but he had to hide this fact
to be protected.

800
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,710
<i>At the trial for Geum Seokju's death,</i>

801
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,843
<i>there is something I want you to do.</i>

802
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,301
<i>I want you to testify that Dr. Han Yihan
didn't properly suture</i>

803
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,392
<i>the surgical site
after an emergency procedure.</i>

804
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,049
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

805
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,137
So you want me to testify in court

806
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,853
that Dr. Han Yihan
didn't suture the surgical site?

807
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,395
-Yes.
-Why do you want me to lie?

808
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,688
Yihanâ€¦

809
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:09,534
I mean, Dr. Han is your favorite doctor.

810
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,413
Me? I like Han Yihan?

811
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,201
Yes. Isn't that why you had him
work with your son?

812
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,655
Watch your mouth.

813
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,161
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

814
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,753
The brother of a prosecutor just died.

815
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,211
Someone must take responsibility for it.

816
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,421
Why?

817
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,510
Will you take responsibility for it?

818
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,262
No, sir.

819
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,433
I trust you understand

820
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,973
what I'm saying
without further explanation.

821
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,815
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

822
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,383
According to Clause One, Article 31
of the Criminal Act,

823
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,126
abetting in perjury is a serious crime
resulting in ten years of prison.

824
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,632
As you heard in the file,

825
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,384
the late Park Kitae was threatened
by the candidate

826
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,136
and perjured himself in the trial.

827
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,888
And when he tried to reveal this,

828
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,812
he was murdered.

829
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,770
NO TAEHYUN, CHOI SEUNGJUN

830
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,479
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

831
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,736
<i>Five years ago, Candidate Yoon</i>

832
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,358
coaxed Mr. Kwon to attempt suicide

833
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,275
to stop the investigation
of her illegal political funds.

834
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,331
She tried to use the same method
to stop the investigation again,

835
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,119
but when Mr. Kwon refused,

836
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,872
she tried to get Gong Gukkwang
to murder him

837
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,788
and make it look like a suicide.

838
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,753
This is false information.

839
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,803
Five years ago and now,
I have never received political funds.

840
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,009
This is all a political maneuver
to slander me, and it's false information!

841
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,130
We haveâ€¦

842
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,054
evidence.

843
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,305
This is a ledger that Mr. Kwon kept
for over ten years

844
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,066
which contains a list of Yoon Miseon's
illegal political funds

845
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:12,444
and the funds that went through
Gukkwang Capital.

846
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,370
And the first name on this list

847
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,578
is Candidate Gu Jingi

848
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,332
who is currently having a hearing
at the National Assembly

849
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,331
to become Minister of Health and Welfare.

850
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,012
<i>Candidate Gu.</i>

851
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,221
Are you the person
in the recording that was just played?

852
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,098
Please answer!

853
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,929
Didn't you say you could clear
any suspicions about you?

854
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,386
Why won't you explain?

855
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,396
That's right.
Don't just listen and explain yourself.

856
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,770
That's right. There is clear evidence.

857
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,645
The witness said I threatened him,

858
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,777
but does it sound like I threatened him?

859
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:04,044
I have no memory of having
this conversation with the deceased.

860
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,671
-Are you kidding me?
-How could you not remember?

861
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,538
The witness was charged

862
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,545
with medical malpractice
in the death that occurred five years ago.

863
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,971
If there was a problem with the trial,

864
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,218
the responsibility would go

865
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,089
to the prosecutor of that case, not me.

866
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,886
Mr. Baek Kangho.

867
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,483
What do you think
about what the candidate said?

868
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,732
Yes, it's true.
I must take responsibility for it too.

869
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:38,319
At that time, I listened to the candidate
and conducted an excessive investigation.

870
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,993
I also agreed to have Gong Gukkwang

871
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,794
threaten Han Yihan
who was being held in a detention center

872
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,245
and turned a blind eye.

873
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:47,788
Gong Gukkwang?

874
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,587
Are you talking about the CEO
of Gukkwang Capital, Gong Gukkwang,

875
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,168
who was recently arrested?

876
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,503
Yes, that's correct.

877
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,429
According to Clause Three, Article 200
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

878
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:06,637
when the prosecution has reason to believe
that the suspect has committed a crime

879
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,685
that requires
at least three years in prisonâ€¦

880
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,808
and there is concern
they might get rid of the evidence,

881
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,356
they can arrest the suspect
without a warrant.

882
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,317
As a result, I will arrest

883
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,911
Candidate Yoon Miseon
without a warrant right now.

884
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,448
What? You're arresting me?
Who do you think you are?

885
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,163
Move. What are you doing?
Stop them right now.

886
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,414
Move aside.

887
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,495
If you stop us, we'll arrest you
for obstructing justice.

888
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,582
You're under arrest
for violating the Political Fund Law

889
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,167
and abetting in murder.

890
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,092
Let go of me!

891
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,630
I'm Yoon Miseon,
Daehan Party's presidential candidate!

892
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,683
Let go. You can't do this!

893
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,470
No, if you committed a crime,

894
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,181
you get punished

895
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,024
whether you're a candidate
or the president.

896
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,771
Drag her out.

897
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,062
-Let's go.
-Let go!

898
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,435
-Move over!
-Let go.

899
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,651
Move!

900
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,731
-Move.
-Assemblywoman Yoon.

901
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,487
Assemblywoman Yoon.

902
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,108
This isn't true. Think about it.

903
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,818
As the director
of Banseok University Medical Center,

904
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,948
why would I solicit a prosecutor
to conduct a coercive investigation?

905
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,827
Then what is this recording?

906
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,291
As I had mentioned,

907
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,294
I don't recall having this conversation
with the deceased.

908
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,667
I would like to ask the witness.

909
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,838
Where and how did you get this recording?

910
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,675
I received this directly from a friend

911
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,258
of the late Park Kitae.

912
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,515
From his friend? I see.

913
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,520
I am aware that the witness, Han Yihan,
has a personal grudge against me.

914
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,824
Because of such feelings, he has slandered
Banseok University Medical Center

915
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,029
and the foundation without any evidence.

916
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,110
I ask that the prosecution
conduct a thorough investigation

917
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,656
to verify that the recording
hasn't been fabricated.

918
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,618
-That's right.
-How can we believe in that?

919
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,203
-It doesn't make any sense!
-Ridiculous.

920
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,118
-This is perjury!
-Verify it!

921
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,916
TIME, TRADED PRICE, NET CHANGE,
AMOUNT OF STOCK DEAL

922
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,591
<i>See? It won't crash.</i>

923
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,206
You stupid woman.

924
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,258
<i>If you did it as I said, people
would've panicked and sold their stocks.</i>

925
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,973
Then the stock prices
would've taken a nosedive.

926
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,974
That is what we call a gamble.

927
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,350
<i>Didn't I give you advice?</i>

928
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,944
<i>Don't gamble and do business.</i>

929
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,569
-What will you do?
-Verify it!

930
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,490
-Listen.
-Settle down.

931
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,239
Everyone, settle down!

932
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,161
Settle down!

933
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,660
We can't conduct the hearing like this.

934
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,163
Please settle down.

935
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:35,464
Okay, so there were a lot of suspicions
raised about me,

936
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,671
but I have never lived a shameful life
as a medical professional.

937
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,053
Let me tell all the assemblymen
and reporters here once again.

938
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,971
All of the suspicions surrounding me
are completely false.

939
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,099
THE SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT GU JINGI

940
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,479
Excuse me, everyone.
Can you focus on the hearing?

941
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,186
The candidate is speaking.

942
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,987
Sir, you should see this.

943
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,571
-What is it? Show me later.
-You need to see this.

944
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,213
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE, WITNESS

945
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,252
Youâ€¦

946
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,302
Again?

947
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,929
<i>It looks like
you got an irresistible offer.</i>

948
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,483
<i>-I didn't think--
-This is nothing.</i>

949
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,691
<i>-Let go!
-Chairman Gu.</i>

950
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,916
Did you know about this?

951
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,095
<i>Record it?</i>

952
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,771
Record my conversation with Chairman Gu?

953
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,982
If you want to hunt someone powerful,
you need the proper weapon.

954
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,896
It's hard to prove a crime
with a witness and a recording.

955
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,777
So meet with Chairman Gu
and make him admit

956
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,700
that he opened Geum Seokju's chest
and took out his heart.

957
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,457
Film it with this.

958
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,922
I can't do it.

959
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,837
What if he tries to kill me too?

960
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,131
I'll give you ten billion won.

961
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,926
Ten billion won?

962
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,089
You're risking your life,

963
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,429
so you should get that much.

964
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,933
I'll give you something
neither Gu Jingi nor Han Yihan

965
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,812
can give you.

966
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,544
My knightâ€¦

967
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,542
finally got the king.

968
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,499
GU JINGI, CANDIDATE
FOR MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

969
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,417
GU JINGI, CANDIDATE
FOR MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

970
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,853
How could he?

971
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,103
<i>Please spare me.</i>

972
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:51,898
<i>Don't you know what I did for you?
How dare you do this to me?</i>

973
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,236
<i>Sir!</i>

974
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,366
<i>Whyâ€¦</i>

975
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,583
Candidate, what is this video?

976
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,036
Who are you stabbing?

977
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,247
NO TAEHYUN, CHOI SEUNGJUN, JEON DONGSEOK

978
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,337
CHAIRMAN OF THE HEARING

979
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,507
It's Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

980
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,891
The man who got stabbed in the neck
by Gu Jingi

981
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,894
was a witness to this hearing.

982
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:30,317
He is Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

983
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,121
NO TAEHYUN, CHOI SEUNGJUN, JEON DONGSEOK

984
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,867
HEARING FOR GU JINGI,
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE CANDIDATE

985
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:32,459
<i>Gu Jingi, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Dohyung.</i>

986
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,125
<i>-Chairman Gu.
-Focus on protecting Banseok.</i>

987
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,224
Protect them from Jayden and Honours Hand.

988
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,297
<i>If chasing desires is evil,</i>

989
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,175
<i>I will gladly become a villain.</i>

990
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,932
<i>Jayden, you're abandoning me like this?</i>

991
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,064
I'll kill you.

992
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,060
<i>You killed my brother.</i>

993
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,399
<i>Prosecutor Geum. Are you okay?</i>

994
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,979
Han Yihan? You still need him?

995
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:56,065
<i>It seems like you want revenge
more than me.</i>

996
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,282
What's the reason?

997
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,412
If you're curious, you should find out.

998
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,529
I intend to do so. I'm dying to know.
