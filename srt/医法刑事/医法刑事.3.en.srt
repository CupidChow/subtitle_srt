THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,132
I didn't kill him!

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,050
EPISODE 3

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,052
He didn't die because of me.

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,971
Why admit my mistake and ask for leniency?

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,515
I was on night duty that day.

7
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,351
I just went to help
because we had a rush of patients!

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,146
But because not everyone is a doctor,

9
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,897
they don't really understand that.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,818
Likewise, you don't know much about laws
since you aren't a lawyer, right?

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,945
So just do as I say, please.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,157
When you're at a hospital,
you have to listen to the doctor.

13
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,577
If you don't listen to your lawyer
and insist on your own way like this,

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,162
you're going to be in big trouble.

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,956
But what you're saying is nonsense!

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,752
Of course, I wanted to save
that child's life, you know?

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,961
I did my best.

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,588
But doctors aren't gods.

19
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,800
Doctors can't save all emergency patients!

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,763
Sir, you really don't get it, do you?

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,932
A special law is about to be enacted
with the name of the patient victim

22
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,185
who was being treated
and died under your care.

23
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,439
And why did you post the patient's
medical information on social media?

24
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,818
If it wasn't for that,
you wouldn't lose your medical license.

25
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,280
That's because

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,449
people were blindly criticizing me.

27
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,034
Just serve two years.

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,954
More than 300,000 petitions
have been submitted to the president.

29
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,123
You can't be acquitted.

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,001
So admit to the charges

31
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,004
and serve just two years.

32
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,673
And we'll guarantee you a full professor
position at Banseok Medical School.

33
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,805
I want to see Director Gu.

34
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,518
I must hear it directly
from Director Gu Jingi.

35
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,106
If he visits me just once
and makes a promise in person--

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,734
If you aren't good at what you do,
at least be quick-witted.

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,363
-What?
-Make a wise decision.

38
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,324
-What did you say?
-If your license gets revoked,

39
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,161
all the efforts you've made
for the past 20 years will go to waste.

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,498
So do as I say.

41
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,708
This is what's best for you.

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,131
Please wait.

43
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,641
It's unfair.

44
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,060
It's so unfair.

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,563
Why is this happening to me?

46
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,864
SEOUL NORTHERN DETENTION CENTER

47
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,201
Where have I…

48
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,661
Hello, Director Gu?

49
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,707
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

50
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,130
Mr. Park Kitae.

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,425
Another lawyer wants to see you.
Would you like to meet with him?

52
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,509
A lawyer?

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,261
Who is it?

54
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,763
Is it someone
from the Banseok Legal Team--

55
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,141
No, he isn't from Banseok.

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,435
Should I tell him no?

57
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,936
No, I'll do it.

58
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,148
-I'll meet with him.
-Okay, please stay seated and wait.

59
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,860
Another lawyer?

60
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,862
Who would that be?

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,576
What? You… How is that you're…

65
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,139
medical malpractice specialist lawyer?"

66
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,523
Why are you surprised?

67
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,943
Did you think I would be gone forever?

68
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,112
If we were to ever meet again,

69
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,740
I had planned on giving you a beating
to the point your life hangs by a thread.

70
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,369
But seeing how pathetic you look,
I feel a little better.

71
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,875
How does it feel to go through
what I went through five years ago?

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

73
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,717
I did that then

74
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,803
because I was so scared too.

75
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,723
Director Gu said I'd be next
if I didn’t do as he said.

76
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm sorry. I've really done you wrong.

77
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,732
Please forgive me, Yihan!

78
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,068
What's going on?

79
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,071
Everything is fine. We were just talking
and he just got a little agitated.

80
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,490
If he gets more agitated,
I'll have to stop the meeting.

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,617
-It's a warning.
-Yes, understood.

That’s not going to crack your head.
You need to bang it harder.

84
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,425
Don’t put on a show and lift up your head.

85
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:05,179
I saw enough of your repulsive acting
in the court five years ago.

86
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,686
What do you want after all this time?

87
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,397
I know that I wronged you.

88
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,774
It wasn't easy for me either.

89
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,943
It has been painful
and difficult for me too.

90
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,321
And look how pathetic I am now.

91
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,364
What do you want
after showing up out of nowhere?

92
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,867
I'm about to rot away in prison.

93
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,702
What do you want from me?

94
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,748
That’s it.
Now you're back to your true self.

95
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,917
You're a selfish, shameless opportunist,

96
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,295
and a chicken-hearted coward.

97
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,717
So be selfish
and take this opportunity too.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,844
Just be who you are, Park Kitae.

99
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,805
Opportunity? What opportunity?

100
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,724
Admit that you committed perjury

101
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,227
in court five years ago
because Director Gu bribed you.

102
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,522
Then I'll reveal that you're innocent.

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,566
How?

104
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,195
The lawyer from the legal team said
I had no chance of winning this trial,

105
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,280
so I should admit and ask for leniency.

106
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,115
Of course.

107
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,203
That way, they can put
all the blame on you.

108
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,708
The legal team only works
for the hospital's benefit.

109
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,504
And from the hospital's point of view,
it's best to make

110
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,964
the individual doctor responsible
for the malpractice.

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,300
You still don't get it?

112
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,929
Your lawyer is
on Banseok's side, not yours.

113
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,932
They will put all the blame on you

114
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,308
and get away with it.

115
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,561
Those scumbags.

116
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,523
That's why they kept forcing me
to admit to the charges.

117
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,445
So from now on,

118
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,322
just do as I say.

119
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,077
Then your license won't get revoked
and you won't have to serve time.

120
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,421
-Supervisor! Sir!
-What happened?

121
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,047
It hurts so much.

122
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,217
Why did you sign up
to do this unnecessarily?

123
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,011
I'm bleeding. I need to stop the bleeding.

124
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,264
Gosh, it hurts so much.

125
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,267
You should've been more careful.

126
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,060
Your hands are crucial as a physician.

127
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,148
It's a minor wound. You just need to take
medication for a few days and be careful.

128
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,359
Let's see. Where are the antibiotics?

129
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,695
Do you have amoxicillin?

130
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,284
The thing is…
That works on me particularly well.

131
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,997
I'll give it to you. You're a doctor
from Banseok University Medical Center.

132
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,582
I'm sure you know what's best.

133
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,004
-You know how to take it, right?
-Yes.

134
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,173
Thank you.

135
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,470
-Revoke it!
-Revoke it!

136
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,846
-We refuse patients!
-We refuse patients!

137
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,931
Stop the coercive investigation!

138
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,683
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

139
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,560
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

140
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,270
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

141
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,856
-Our nation will collapse!
-It will collapse!

142
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,149
<i>Anaphylaxis?</i>

143
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,694
You have an adverse reaction
to penicillin, right?

144
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,198
-Yes.
-I'll make you overdose on antibiotics

145
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,532
and cause an anaphylactic shock.

146
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,786
But what if
it really becomes life-threatening?

147
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,999
Don't worry. I'll never just let you die.

148
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,752
Besides, you're the one
who has seen it the most.

149
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,381
I even bring the dead back to life.

150
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,656

151
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,538
What on earth are you doing here?

152
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,384
What are you doing?

153
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
You're not a doctor anymore.

154
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,472
Then, should I just leave him to die?

155
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,851
Please step aside.

156
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,978
Who are you?

157
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,272
-I'm his lawyer. Please step aside.
-Pardon?

158
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
He is breathing!

159
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,708
What's happening to him?

160
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,751
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

162
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,729
What's the matter with him?

163
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,694
Please hold this.

164
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,047
Please pour the alcohol.

165
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,552
Hold his head and legs down.

166
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,183
Please hold him down tighter.
He'll die if he moves.

167
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,302
Pour the alcohol.

168
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,180
My hands too.

169
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,822
-Please hold this.
-Okay.

170
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,218
We are set. Keep holding it.

172
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,881
-To which hospital will he go?
-Donghan Hospital.

173
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,050
I administered epinephrine
for an anaphylactic shock

174
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,969
and performed a cricothyroidotomy
to establish an airway.

175
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,054
-Please tell the doctor in charge.
-Thank you.

176
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,734
911

177
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,236
<i>I will continue
to deliver the breaking news.</i>

178
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,281
<i>During sentencing, Dr. Park collapsed
due to the difficulty in breathing.</i>

179
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,242
<i>Paramedics brought him out
and moved him to the ambulance.</i>

180
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,786
A cardiac arrest was unexpected.

181
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,162
<i>While undergoing trial,</i>

182
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,081
<i>Dr. Park suddenly experienced
chest pains and labored breathing.</i>

183
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,751
<i>The cause has not yet been identified.</i>

184
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>Dr. Park regained consciousness
after receiving emergency measures</i>

185
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,715
<i>and got transferred to a nearby hospital.</i>

186
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,384
-<i>As Dr. Park can't undergo the trial</i>
-What?

187
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,595
<i>due to his health,</i>

188
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,348
-<i>the proceedings remain unclear.</i>
-That man…

189
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,518
<i>The department of justice
hasn't issued a statement on the matter.</i>

190
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,103
<i>This is the NBS News, Reporter Ban Soohee.</i>

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,690
Han Yihan.

192
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,916
So what you are saying is

193
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,293
that you replaced Pyo Eunsil

194
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,338
and became the defendant's lawyer
since yesterday.

195
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,049
-That's correct.
-I didn't hear anything about this matter.

196
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,261
He didn't say anything before the trial.
How can he dismiss me like this?

197
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
-This--
-There must be a reason why he kept quiet.

198
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
What do you mean by that?

199
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,683
You know full well what I mean.

200
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,352
If you failed
to receive trust from the client,

201
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,021
you have no one else
to blame but yourself.

202
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,023
Listen, just what do you think--

203
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,024
Stop!

204
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,736
JUDGE PARK JUNGWOO

205
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,616
I am not here
to watch the lawyers quarrel.

206
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
Before the next trial,

207
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,454
settle the matter cleanly.

208
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,625
Will another trial be necessary?

209
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,673
The sentencing should take place today

210
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,135
unless there is new evidence or witness
to prove the defendant's innocence

211
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,012
as the decision has been made already.

212
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,057
You have a point.

213
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,517
There is a witness.

214
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,312
A witness? Who is it?

215
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,814
I can't disclose information
for the witness' safety.

216
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,525
If you give me another trial,

217
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,193
I will appear in court with the defendant

218
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,280
to question the witness
and give the final statement.

219
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,785
Okay.

220
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,665
Since the defendant
can't attend the sentencing today,

221
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,418
we will have one more trial.

222
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,087
I want both the prosecutor and lawyer

223
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,798
to make thorough preparations
so that we can wrap things up.

224
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,383
Understood.

225
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,937
What are you playing at?

226
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,984
How dare you meddle
with someone else's case?

227
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,947
If you are a lawyer, act like one.

228
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,491
Didn't you learn better at law school?

229
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,368
I am sure they didn't teach you

230
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,911
to steal a case from a fellow lawyer.

231
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,163
You are the one who played dirty first.

232
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,623
Excuse me?

233
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,460
The defendant repeatedly said
that he didn't admit to the charges,

234
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,045
but you completely ignored him

235
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,881
and threatened him to serve two years.

236
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,468
You said he would lose everything
otherwise.

237
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,720
I didn't threaten him.

238
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,057
I was simply reminding
of the current situation he was in--

239
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,560
That doesn't give you the right
to change the innocent to guilty.

240
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,814
You should have trusted
your client until the end.

241
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,357
That's how a lawyer acts.

242
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,657
Pyo Eunsil speaking.

243
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,617
Pardon?

244
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,912
Yes. He is here.

245
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,289
Is that Director Gu Jingi?

246
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,128
<i>Put me on the phone.
I have something to say to him.</i>

247
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,506
<i>Director, Mr. Han…</i>

248
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,467
Put him on the phone.
I will talk to him myself.

249
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,261
Yes, sir.

250
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,981
<i>You look well.</i>

251
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,816
To be honest, I am surprised.

252
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,069
I knew I would see you again,

253
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,614
but I didn't expect such a change.

254
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,660
There is no reason to be surprised.
It's all thanks to you.

255
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,706
<i>You made a promise that night.</i>

256
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,250
You said you would take responsibility

257
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,502
for the aftermath of the surgery.

258
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,468
You will uphold that promise.

259
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't think this is the end.

260
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,651
I will request disciplinary action
for illegal practice.

261
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,820
Suit yourself.

262
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,532
Disciplinary action will be much worse
for threatening a client.

263
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,826
Here.

264
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,376
A lawyer?

265
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,755
How could you defend

266
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,801
a doctor
from Banseok University Medical Center?

267
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,053
What are you thinking?

268
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,523
I have no reason
to tell you what I am thinking.

269
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,817
Let's keep this professional.

270
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,029
We are only a prosecutor and a lawyer
who met for a trial.

271
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,234
Kangho, you are here.

272
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,069
Please give me a drink on the rock.

273
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,615
When did you start drinking?

274
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,369
I started drinking after the trial.

275
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,914
One, two, three.

276
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,332
It has been four hours.

277
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,043
I heard the news.

278
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,379
He became the lawyer.

279
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,507
He is less than human.

280
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,968
How could he do that to a trial
you are involved in?

281
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,805
To be honest,

282
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,143
I wanted to forgive him.

283
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,354
Although I resented him,

284
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,399
I knew that it was an accident.

285
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,694
He lost many things too.

286
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,866
But he became a lawyer who specializes
in medical malpractice suits.

287
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,745
It means he's lived
without any regrets or repentance.

288
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,580
Don't forgive him.

289
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,249
He doesn't deserve it.

290
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,837
If this is bothering you, I can get
another prosecutor to do the next trial.

291
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,924
No, it's not bothering me.
There's nothing between him and me now.

292
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,843
And I don't plan on avoiding him.

293
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,472
I will watch him
defend that doctor in court

294
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,059
with my two eyes.

295
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,960
<i>Be by my side</i>

296
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>I want only you</i>

297
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,716
<i>To have my dream</i>

298
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,968
Gosh, you startled me!

299
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,179
Don't.

300
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,015
-Don't step on that.
-Do you expect me to fly then?

301
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,017
Darn it. I just mopped it.

302
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,395
How can a big guy like him be so petty?

303
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,564
Come with me. Your boss scored a big one.

304
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,358
You're not my boss.
I'm much older than you.

305
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,152
Are we at school? Why bring up age?

306
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,864
At work, more competent ones
can boss people around.

307
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,703
Gosh. That little…

308
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,162
Come on.

309
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,963
-Hello, Yihan.
-Are you serious?

310
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,219
-Did you look into him?
-I did more than look into him.

311
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,721
I scrutinized this guy.

312
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,309
All right. It turns out
Hojun's father is an impressive man.

313
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,271
He's a college professor
and is well-liked by his acquaintances.

314
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,857
After losing his wife,
he raised his son alone.

315
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,317
Don't tell me this is it.

316
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,446
I guess the ace reporter from the show
business isn't so competent anymore.

317
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,073
No. That's not true.
I'm still the best there is.

318
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,998
<i>Ex-boyfriend?</i>

319
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,043
The lawyer who performed
emergency treatment in court yesterday?

320
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,545
And he was Prosecutor Geum's ex?
Seriously?

321
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,422
Ironic, isn't it?

322
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,507
Her foe ended up becoming
the defense counsel.

323
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,552
Gosh. How bad was the breakup?
How did he become her foe?

324
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,139
I'm going to tell you something,
so listen up and keep your mouth shut.

325
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,391
I'm telling you this,
so you watch what you say to her.

326
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,643
Gosh. Of course. Come on.

327
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,812
I'm a considerate guy.

328
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,523
You know why her brother died, right?

329
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,525
I do.

330
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,652
A doctor
at Banseok University Medical Center

331
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,946
made a mistake
during the heart transplant.

332
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,450
And the surgeon
who operated on her brother

333
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,702
was her ex-boyfriend. Lawyer Han Yihan.

334
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,580
-What?
-Gosh. Don't even start.

335
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,584
When it happened,
Prosecutor Geum was out of her mind.

336
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,878
Her only brother died.

337
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,047
And her boyfriend she relied on
went to a detention center.

338
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,592
She turned down the offer
to join the Special Crime Department.

339
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,178
And she joined
the Medical Crime Department instead

340
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,597
because of what happened to her brother.

341
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,890
Let me get this straight.

342
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,227
After killing his girlfriend's brother
in surgery,

343
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,813
he shamelessly became a lawyer
and took over the case?

344
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,690
He has no conscience.

345
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,567
Exactly, my point.

346
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,696
He lost his medical license
because he took bribes.

347
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,824
How dare he become a lawyer?

348
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,952
This is just unbelievable. Gosh.

349
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,496
But then he had it tough too.

350
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,375
His mother died
when he was in a detention center.

351
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,793
His mother died? Why?

352
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,837
I don't know the details,

353
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,840
but from what I heard,
she had a severe case of depression.

354
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,092
Well, that must have been awful.

355
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,510
Right.

356
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,574
Mom.

357
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,349
Mom.

358
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,669
DONGHAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

359
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,142
GENERAL HOSPITAL

360
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,859
What?

361
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,530
You want me to go back
to a detention center?

362
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,616
Can't you see this?
I still need medical attention!

363
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,451
No, you don't.

364
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,871
You can eat a full meal starting tomorrow.

365
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,874
Come on, be gentle. I'm still in pain.

366
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,002
Hang in there.
I'll get you out right away.

367
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,837
If you were going
to send me back right away,

368
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,839
why did you make an incision?

369
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,053
Think of it
as a punishment for betraying me.

370
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,307
And you would have died
if I didn't make that incision.

371
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,851
You should've been careful with the dose.
You're a doctor.

372
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,398
I can really get out
after this trial, right?

373
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,026
Don't worry. I'll get you out in one piece

374
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,572
and get you to confess to perjury
five years ago. That's my first step.

375
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,740
Your first step?

376
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,284
Then who's your next step?

377
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,455
Who do you think?

378
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,420
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

379
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,463
Thank you.

380
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,467
Banseok University Medical Center has
a total number of 72 hospitals

381
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,679
and medical centers in nine countries
such as the US, China,

382
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
Japan, and so on.

383
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,852
Over 2,000 doctors
and over 15,000 employees

384
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,439
are now working
for a global healthcare company.

385
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,441
The general hospital in California

386
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,068
was able to pay back
the loan in full recently

387
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,697
and is currently building
a 400-million-dollar hospital.

388
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,827
And our global research
and development center developed

389
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,203
a new drug to treat Alzheimer's.

390
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,831
And the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety

391
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,250
as well as the US FDA approved Phase Two.

392
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,088
Great work!

393
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,549
I have you to thank.

394
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,969
Now, let me show you
a surgery robot, V-Rock,

395
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,474
our research and development center
created for the first time in history.

396
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,313
<i>Hello.</i>

397
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,690
<i>I'm Gu Hyunseong,
the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</i>

398
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,109
<i>Today, the robot will be assisting me</i>

399
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,820
<i>with my mitral valve replacement.</i>

400
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,448
The patient is a 61-year-old man.

401
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,325
Due to rheumatic heart disease,

402
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,869
the mitral valve has severely been
deformed and calcified.

403
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,621
So we decided
on a mitral valve replacement.

404
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,291
Now, I will perform the surgery
without opening his chest.

405
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,877
With V-Rock, I proceed
with minimally invasive surgery.

406
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,755
I will begin the surgery now.

407
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,044
<i>This is an announcement
for our passengers.</i>

408
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,505
<i>We have a patient
who needs immediate medical attention.</i>

409
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:40,176
<i>If you're a doctor,
identify yourself as one to our crew.</i>

410
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,387
<i>Or please come to the entrance hallway.</i>

411
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,101
Sir.

412
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,894
No doctors?

413
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,104
Try to breathe.

414
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,939
Please keep looking.

415
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,483
I can't take his blood pressure.

416
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,902
-Oh, no.
-He's not breathing.

417
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,987
Get a defibrillator ready.

418
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,488
He's not breathing.

419
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,073
-Remove his sweater.
-Okay.

420
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,911
Gosh. Oh, no.

421
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,082
<i>Passengers…</i>

422
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,918
Move back. One, two.

423
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,505
-What's going on?
-What happened?

424
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,091
-He'll die.
-Pardon?

425
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,276
-I knew it.
-That's a pacemaker ID.

426
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,361
-So you know what this is.
-Yes.

427
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,697
The ID shows he has a cardiac pacemaker.

428
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,533
The defibrillator would have broken
the pacemaker. Then…

429
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,330
There's no way of making his heart
beat again at 25,000 feet

430
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,456
above the ground.

431
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,209
-What?
-I feel bad for the guy.

432
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,920
"IDEA Electronics."

433
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,398
Hey, what are you doing?
Why did you take my…

434
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,401
I'll pay for it.

435
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,195
Saving lives comes first.

436
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,865
-How can he save the patient with that?
-What's he doing?

437
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,501
What are you doing?

438
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,670
The pacemakers from this manufacturer

439
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,256
use magnets to activate the devices.

440
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,091
During the flight,

441
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,510
the magnetic field at high altitude
must've caused the malfunction.

442
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,597
Our planet is basically a big magnet.

443
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,642
-I see. Then this is…
-It's a magnet.

444
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,562
The pacemaker will start working
after 30 seconds.

445
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,257
He's breathing.

446
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,888
Give him water. And keep checking
his blood pressure and pulse.

447
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,181
Arrange a medical exam as soon as we land.

448
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,266
Okay.

449
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,019
-That doctor saved him.
-That's great.

450
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,646
Can you tell me
the name of the hospital you work at?

451
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,231
Or your name?

452
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,157
Did you have fun?

453
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,868
Check the risks for IDEA Electronics.

454
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,786
I see a fun game ahead.

455
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,208
<i>Passengers,
we hope you had a pleasant flight.</i>

456
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,252
<i>We will be arriving</i>

457
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,881
<i>at Incheon International Airport
in 20 minutes.</i>

458
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,592
<i>It's a clear day in Incheon.</i>

459
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,844
I resected the calcified mitral valve.

460
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,846
Now, I will put in a prosthetic valve.

461
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,308
<i>The prosthetic heart valves
from our research and development center</i>

462
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,352
<i>were made with new materials,
harmless to our bodies.</i>

463
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,354
<i>So we minimized the chance
of transplant rejection.</i>

464
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,903
It's in.

465
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,992
I'll remove the root catheter.

466
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,126
-What just happened?
-What was that?

467
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,170
-Did he fail?
-Did he mess up?

468
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,346
His volume is going down.

469
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,640
-I think there's a bleeding.
-I checked.

470
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,017
Dr. Choi, wipe the blood on the camera.

471
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,602
Pulling out the camera.

472
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,825
It's in.

473
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,369
When there's bleeding like this one,

474
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,579
I can quickly repair it with V-Rock.

475
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,656
His vital signs are all stable.

476
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,289
<i>This is all for the mitral valve
replacement demonstration</i>

477
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,708
<i>through the minimally invasive approach
with V-Rock.</i>

478
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,759
<i>Thank you.</i>

479
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,058
Gosh. Are you leaving now?

480
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,313
Your V-Rock demonstration was impressive.

481
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,230
Thank you.

482
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,818
I'm amazed at the level
of the domestically developed technology.

483
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,488
We were able to develop it smoothly
thanks to your help

484
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,615
with the Health and Welfare Committee.

485
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,201
Getting a good bill passed
at the right moment is my duty

486
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,328
as the party representative.

487
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,873
I will look forward to
your future endeavors even more.

488
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,293
Gu Jingi, Ministerial Candidate
of Health and Welfare.

489
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,920
Thank you.

490
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,186
Director Gu, politics suits you
better than medicine now.

491
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,814
That's not true.
I still have a lot to learn.

492
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,609
And my son should take over
saving lives now.

493
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,071
My son worked really hard to get this far.

494
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,533
I know that he worked hard going
back and forth between BioValley and here

495
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,202
-to develop the technology.
-Right.

496
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,288
Thanks to his hard work,
he was able to meet Yuna.

497
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,752
Gosh, Dad. Back then, it was just work.

498
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:34,215
Then what about now?
Does it mean it's more than just work?

499
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,135
I'm not sure.

500
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,762
I'll be busy once I become the director
of the research and development center.

501
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,098
But Hyunseong is the one
with the hectic schedule.

502
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,684
He's the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,
the Director of Planning and Coordination,

503
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,853
and the Director of Banseokwon.

504
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,105
I doubt he'll have time for me.

505
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,859
Don't worry.
I'll make sure he puts aside time for you.

506
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,528
-You will, right?
-Of course.

507
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,658
We should see each other more often
since we're both in Korea.

508
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,081
It's been a while, Ambassador Im Taemoon.

509
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,208
It's been a while.

510
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,419
Thanks for making the long trip.

511
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,587
How could I not come?

512
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,007
My investment yielded
an amazing result like this one.

513
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,301
Don't you agree, Director Gu?

514
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,343
Of course.

515
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,846
Without investment from Honours Hand,

516
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,849
we wouldn't have been able to grow
as much as now.

517
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,519
And the ambassador was the one
who arranged our meeting.

518
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,440
Honours Hand? A lobbyist?

519
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,529
It's where people
with a demon's tongue and fingers gather.

520
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,157
I am the black-haired foreigner
who works there.

521
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,160
I am the head of the Asian branch,
Jayden Lee.

522
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,168
His network reaches
not only the US Congress

523
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,796
but also the White House.
He's excellent at his job.

524
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,925
You guys will cross paths a lot
in the future.

525
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,307
Let's be on good terms.

526
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,060
We will be.

527
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,898
By the way, there's a problem at Banseok.

528
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,067
The surgeon killed one of the patients.

529
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,777
Can you handle it?

530
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,112
Yes. It will be settled soon.

531
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,073
You don't have to worry about that.

532
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,660
All right. Why don't we raise our glasses?

533
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,577
Shall we?

534
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,579
Cheers.

535
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,025
Hyunseong, were you waiting for me?

536
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,402
Yes.

537
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,864
Our fathers had to discuss another matter,
so they already left.

538
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,992
Thanks for escorting me.

539
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,619
You were amazing today.

540
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,956
You've gotten better
than the last time we met.

541
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,499
Thank you.

542
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,253
We wouldn't have been able to develop it
this fast without your help.

543
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,005
I was just doing my job.

544
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,173
Wait. Yuna.

545
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,010
It's been so long
since we spent time together.

546
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,721
How about another drink?

547
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,514
Now?

548
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,394
You must be tired. The flight
from the US must have been long too.

549
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,982
No. Let's grab a drink.
Just the two of us.

550
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,526
Great.

551
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,366
<i>I ask to bring in a witness.</i>

552
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,495
I'd like to question the victim's father,
Lee Kiyoon, as he's already here.

553
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,626
Counsel, you were late at our last trial.

554
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,211
Now, you're requesting a witness in court?

555
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,880
I'm sorry.

556
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,924
But as the defendant's new lawyer,

557
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,345
there is something I must check
with the victim's father.

558
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,348
This is the last time.

559
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,851
I will not allow any more surprises
in my courtroom from this point on.

560
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,144
I understand.

561
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,396
Mr. Lee. Please get ready.

562
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,067
Why would I?

563
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,986
I refuse.

564
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,489
You don't have
a legitimate reason to refuse.

565
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,907
Come to the witness stand.

566
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,369
Or is there a reason
behind your refusal to testify?

567
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,455
PROSECUTION

568
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,841
Witness, you put your son in your car

569
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,178
and drove him to the ER at Banseok
University Medical Center. Correct?

570
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,181
Yes. That's correct.

571
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,183
How was your son

572
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,102
by the time he arrived in the ER?

573
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,606
My son was already in a lot of pain

574
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,151
even before we had arrived
at the hospital.

575
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,032
Excuse me.

576
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,952
Wait. Excuse me. Can you check on my son?

577
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:13,911
What brings you here?

578
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,455
My son was complaining of a stomachache.

579
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,874
Hojun, are you okay?

580
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,085
-Please check on him quickly.
-Come this way.

581
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,340
<i>There were a lot of patients waiting,
so it took a while before he got treated.</i>

582
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,299
You'll be okay.

583
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,931
Meanwhile, my son Hojun…

584
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,394
was fighting the pain he was feeling.

585
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,730
My goodness.

586
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,317
Is the doctor
that treated your son, Hojun,

587
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,195
the defendant?

588
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,322
Yes.

589
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:55,077
That man treated my son.

590
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,996
That man's terrible.

591
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,290
What did he do to that child?

592
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,916
How can he call himself a doctor?

593
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,553
Is my son, Hojun, okay?

594
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,848
Seeing as to how he has a fever
and has been vomiting,

595
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,225
it's likely he has food poisoning.

596
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,478
I'll give him
some antibiotics and painkillers.

597
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,480
Then I'll do an abdominal ultrasound.

598
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,941
Wait. Hold on. Is that it?

599
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,943
He's in so much pain.

600
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,154
This is a regional
emergency medical center.

601
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,324
There are a lot of patients
who are more urgent than your son. Okay?

602
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,367
Keep an eye on him,

603
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,162
and if he gets worse, call a nurse.

604
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,663
Wait…

605
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:44,710
Hojun.

606
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,754
<i>He could've saved him.</i>

607
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,466
If only he had treated him properly,

608
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,344
my son wouldn't have died like that.

609
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,012
My dear Hojun…

610
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,057
I will never see him again.

611
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,854
If it wasn't for him, my son

612
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,899
wouldn't have died so painfully!

613
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,611
That's right! He should be punished!

614
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,447
-How could he?
-It's true!

615
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,075
That's right.

616
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,412
If the defendant figured out

617
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,289
that Hojun had rhabdomyolysis
during the initial treatment,

618
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,460
he might not have died.

619
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,006
However, why do you think
your son developed such a disease?

620
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,643
Rhabdomyolysis is

621
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,312
a disease where your muscle tissues
break down and melt.

622
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,314
Based on a study,
about 62 percent of all causes

623
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,317
are from traumatic muscle injury.

624
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,822
In other words, extreme exercise,
continued pressure on the muscle,

625
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:59,201
and severe physical abuse could cause it.

626
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,996
Your Honor. The counsel is asking
a question with a hidden intention

627
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,205
to confuse the witness.

628
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,665
I acknowledge that.

629
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,377
Counsel, I ask that you only ask questions
the witness can answer.

630
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,628
Yes, Your Honor.

631
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,216
Then let me ask the witness this one.

632
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,679
Have you ever physically abused
your son, Lee Hojun?

633
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,851
What is he asking now?

634
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,273
Please answer the question.

635
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,109
You can answer it with a yes or a no.

636
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,616
You evil men.

637
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,785
You killed my son,

638
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,829
but what did you just ask me?

639
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,374
Whenever I think about that day,

640
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,127
my heart…

641
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,798
breaks over and over again.
It feels like it might explode.

642
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,759
How could you call yourself human?

643
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,387
How could you call yourselves human?

644
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,433
-Has he lost his mind?
-How could he do that?

645
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,852
How could you ask that
to someone who lost their child?

646
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,228
Are you serious?

647
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,564
-I can't believe this.
-Look at him.

648
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,360
That is not an answer to my question.

649
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,864
I'll ask you again.

650
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:21,909
Did you

651
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:26,205
ever physically abuse your son?

652
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,091
Never.

653
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,760
After my wife passed,

654
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,806
it was hard to raise Hojun by myself.

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,517
But I never

656
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,894
laid a hand on Hojun.

657
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,646
Never.

658
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,234
So don't insult my family anymore.

659
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,530
Even if you don't do that,

660
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,618
I'm already living in hell.

661
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,498
Counsel. That is enough.
Please take your seat.

662
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,383
<i>-Please forgive me. Please forgive--
-My gosh.</i>

663
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,426
<i>Why don't you listen?</i>

664
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,595
<i>You should've listened
when I was being nice!</i>

665
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,682
<i>-I'm sorry. Please save me!
-Stand straight.</i>

666
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,599
<i>-I'm sorry!
-Stand straight!</i>

667
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,310
<i>-Hey! Stand straight.
-Please save me!</i>

668
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,938
<i>-My gosh. Stop crying!
-Please, Dad…</i>

669
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,815
Counsel. What is that?

670
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,318
This is evidence that proves

671
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,989
the cause of Hojun's death lies
with the witness, not the defendant.

672
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,451
<i>Stand straight, please. Stand straight.</i>

673
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,579
<i>You should listen to me. Sit here.</i>

674
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,955
Tell me.

675
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,791
I'll do all my homework,
and I won't skip the academy.

676
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,793
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

677
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,712
-Please forgive me.
-My gosh.

678
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,589
<i>-Please forgive--
-Why don't you listen?</i>

679
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,592
<i>Listen when I'm being nice!</i>

680
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,428
<i>-I'm sorry. Please save me!
-Stand straight.</i>

681
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:08,432
<i>-Stand straight!
-I'm sorry! Please save me!</i>

682
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,558
<i>-My gosh.
-Please, Dad…</i>

683
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,393
That son of a…

684
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,395
How could he do that to his son?

685
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,565
How did you get it?

686
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,901
I got it
from their foreign live-in housekeeper.

687
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,361
She doesn't speak Korean well,

688
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,823
and her husband is here illegally,
so she couldn't do anything.

689
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,201
But she wanted to protect the child.

690
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,684
Your Honor. This trial is

691
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,853
not about whether or not
the witness abused his child.

692
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,940
It's to determine whether or not
the defendant is guilty of malpractice.

693
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,901
After this trial is over,
I will personally investigate the case

694
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,863
to see whether or not
Hojun was a victim of domestic violence.

695
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,033
So here in this trial,

696
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,911
I would like you to focus

697
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,914
on whether or not the defendant
is guilty of malpractice.

698
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,168
Okay.

699
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,755
Counsel, do have anything else to say?

700
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,092
Yes, Your Honor. If you will allow me,

701
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,595
I would like to give the closing statement
on behalf of the defendant.

702
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,180
Okay.

703
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,520
It is the duty of the guardian to provide
the doctor with a complete history

704
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,021
of the patient's condition.

705
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,985
However, the witness was afraid
that his abuse would be revealed,

706
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,194
so he failed to mention the assault.

707
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,989
As a result, the defendant
diagnosed the patient

708
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,116
with food poisoning based on the symptoms.

709
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,619
Therefore,
there are two victims in this case.

710
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,791
Hojun, who was abused
by the witness and died,

711
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,587
and the defendant,
who misdiagnosed his patient

712
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,590
and is on the brink of losing everything.

713
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,385
All doctors

714
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,722
go through the deaths
of the patients they treated.

715
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,557
And among them,

716
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,395
there are deaths that are so painful
that they can never forget them.

717
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,526
Just like Hojun's death
which made all of us

718
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,944
angry and upset today.

719
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,703
Before we criticize him
for being unable to save Hojun,

720
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,205
please take a moment

721
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,376
to imagine how the defendant feels
after losing a young patient

722
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,296
who could've been saved.

723
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,797
That is all.

724
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,765
Defendant,
would you like to say something?

725
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,851
No.

726
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,436
Okay.

727
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,981
Then your closing statement will end here.

728
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,610
The defendant will be sentenced tomorrow.

729
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,947
Counsel, please come with the defendant.

730
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,406
Yes, Your Honor.

731
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,283
Please rise.

732
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,046
Mr. Lee Kiyoon.
I have some questions to ask you.

733
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,714
Please come with me.

734
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,817
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER
TO RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY

735
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,235
You should be released tomorrow.

736
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,823
Then we'll file a lawsuit against Gu Jingi
and Banseok University Medical Center,

737
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,740
so be strong.

738
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,077
Director Gu that evil man.

739
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,329
I'm going to make him regret betraying me.

740
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,249
Just wait until I get out of here.
I'm going to find that file…

741
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,960
-What file?
-Oh, that?

742
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,422
I made a recording just in case…

743
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,717
Park Kitae,
visitations are over for today.

744
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,759
You will return your cell.

745
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,927
Can I have a little more time?

746
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,179
-I just need a minute.
-The rules don't allow that.

747
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,848
Park Kitae, please stand up.

748
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,765
Yihan.

749
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,144
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
Don't worry about the results.

750
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,729
Okay.

751
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,231
Hold on.

752
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,901
Yihan, thank you

753
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
for saving someone who betrayed you.

754
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,949
If you're grateful,
don't betray me ever again.

755
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,411
Okay. I'll be on your side this time.

756
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:40,912
I'm serious.

757
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,625
Then you have to forgive me a little.
Okay?

758
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,881
Okay.

759
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,061
Bye-bye.

760
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,729
My time here is over now.

761
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,399
<i>What should be the first thing I eat
when I get out?</i>

762
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,193
-Lucky you.
-Pardon?

763
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,195
You said you were a doctor. Right?

764
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,906
No, not just any doctor.

765
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,407
You know
Banseok University Medical Center?

766
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,119
I was a cardiothoracic surgeon
at Banseok University Medical Center.

767
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,998
Although I'm sure
I won't be going there ever again.

768
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,792
Regardless, you came in after me,

769
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,462
but you're leaving before me.

770
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,090
You know what I did?

771
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,675
I hired an incredible lawyer.

772
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,970
He's amazing.

773
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,972
Just wait until I get out.

774
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:45,018
I'm going to have a feast
with fried chicken and beer.

775
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,521
<i>Drink beer with fried chicken</i>

776
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,440
<i>If you don't want that, tripe is good too</i>

777
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,859
<i>-Stand straight!
-Please save me!</i>

778
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,946
<i>-Stand straight!
-Please save me!</i>

779
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,993
You have the smartphone case
where this file was recorded. Right?

780
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,995
Yes, that's correct.

781
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,582
It's okay.

782
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,210
I'm not trying to do anything to you.

783
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,711
I just want to know.

784
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,881
How did you end up with this?

785
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:27,060
The man who lives in that house
is a bad person.

786
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,398
I told you to do your homework
before you start playing.

787
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,526
Why did you play without doing
your homework? Why don't you listen?

788
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,612
-Why don't you listen?
-I'm sorry!

789
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,114
Please forgive me!

790
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,075
It hurts!

791
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,287
Please don't! I'll listen to you.

792
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,289
Please forgive me.

793
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,125
Great, it's a Tyrannosaurus rex.

794
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,085
Are you giving this to me?

795
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,505
Yes. This is a gift from me to you, Hojun.

796
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,633
Thank you. It's so cool.

797
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,554
Hojun. Listen to me carefully.

798
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,640
If your dad hits you again,

799
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,226
press this button right here.

800
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,104
What? Why?

801
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:16,776
If you do this,
the dinosaur will protect you. Okay?

802
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,278
Be sure to do that.

803
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,494
Okay. Thank you, Niren.

804
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,919
You should listen to me.
Why don't you listen?

805
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,963
Hey, Lee Hojun.
I told you not to be such a crybaby.

806
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,091
-Hojun!
-Are you lying down in pain over this?

807
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,385
Stand up. Hurry up and stand up!

808
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,846
He's been sick for 30 minutes already.

809
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,973
He needs to go to the hospital.

810
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,769
Darn it! You're so weak for a boy.

811
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,063
Hey, lady. Get him a coat.

812
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,398
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

813
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:00,070
What hospital should I go to
at this hour? My gosh.

814
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,328
Hojun. Are you okay?

815
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,541
When Hojun went to the hospital,

816
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,752
I took it with me.

817
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,963
Why didn't you tell the police?

818
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,049
I'm not from this country.

819
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,802
If I do something wrong,
I'll get kicked out.

820
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,012
I was scared.

821
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,807
I don't speak Korean well,

822
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,226
and Hojun's gone.

823
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,603
If I tell people myself,

824
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,314
nobody will believe me.

825
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,067
I'm sorry.

826
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,610
I'm…

827
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,947
I'm really sorry.

828
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,950
I'm really, really sorry.

829
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,423
I'm sorry.

830
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,553
I should've looked into it further,
but I didn't.

831
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,638
Thank you for being so courageous.

832
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,557
So raise your head.

833
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,853
You were the only adult in Hojun's life

834
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,730
that tried to protect him.

835
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,359
Hojun.

836
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:26,489
Hojun.

837
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,575
Hojun.

838
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,244
I'm so sorry.

839
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,206
