1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:04,882
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,263
Please take a look at this.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,972
This is a marriage certificate.

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,016
We filled it out
the day before she was admitted.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,060
It was a risky surgery,

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,024
so whatever happened, we vowed
to be together for the rest of our lives.

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,725
But will that be enough
to prove the relationship between them?

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,861
Yes.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,697
If the form was filled out
under each other's consent,

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,318
the moment you file it at the borough
office, you'll be legally married.

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,327
So if I file this,
Sunae and I will be married?

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,451
Yes.

13
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,366
But you must think carefully
before you decide.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,247
If you file it, you can't take it back.

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,629
And you must also consider the possibility
of Ms. Yang's condition worsening

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,592
and not being able
to carry on a normal life.

17
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,553
I'll file it.

18
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,382
I don't care about her medical condition.

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,008
Whatever happens,
I will stay by her side to the end.

20
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,771
Then let's go to the office now.
We still have time to file it.

21
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,111
EPISODE 11

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,901
Banseok R and D Center
will be listed on the US stock market.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,610
If everything goes as you said,

24
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,156
we'll make a fortune.

25
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,696
The problem is the board.

26
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,656
There are 16 directors who have the right

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,536
to vote for the chairman
and the hospital director.

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,996
And there are six directors
who will side with you for sure

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,086
including us two.

30
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,755
We need eight votes to win over
at least a majority of the directors

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,010
to stand a chance.

32
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,505
There's one more.

33
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,974
Director of Banseok R and D Center.

34
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,018
Are you talking about Director Lim Yuna?

35
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,692
I'm certain she will side
with Chairman Gu.

36
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,151
She's about to marry Hyunseong.

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,571
Trust me.

38
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,239
And as for the two more votes we need,
I'll get them at the board meeting myself.

39
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,695
Come on. I was enjoying this fine liquor.

40
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,539
What's wrong?

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,000
Banseokwon has a VIP client.
She's an assemblywoman.

42
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,375
She makes a big fuss whenever she comes.

43
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,672
She wants us to turn off
all the security cameras.

44
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,006
And we can't walk around the building,
so no one sees her.

45
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,297
Are you talking
about Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon?

46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,886
Yes. That's her. How did you know?

47
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,142
We're directors and sons of the founder
of Banseok Foundation.

48
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,517
How is it possible there's a VIP client
we can't even meet in the building?

49
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,654
Gu Jingi.

50
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,359
Gu Jingi and the assemblywoman
must be plotting something, right?

51
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,252
Spouse Yang Sunae.

52
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,169
Then does this give me the right
to bring her out from Banseokwon?

53
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,669
Yes. One's spouse has
the highest level of priority

54
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,134
over parents or children.

55
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,638
This is Han Yihan.

56
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,229
I found out something interesting.

57
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,401
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon will make
a secret visit to Banseokwon soon.

58
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,773
Just like the day we took Nam Junhwan.

59
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,107
Hold on.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,072
Assemblywoman Yoon
is on her way to Banseokwon now.

61
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,199
What?

62
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,786
Can you connect me
to Lim Taemoon right away?

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,513
I doubted it,

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,978
but you really intended
to have both in your hands.

65
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,066
You must be very concerned

66
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,703
about making your daughter fall
into a critical condition.

67
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,831
I am Doh Jinwoo's attorney, Han Yihan.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,870
We will move Ms. Yang Sunae
to New-Hope Medicine Clinic.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,050
Even if it's a guardian's request,

70
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,219
transferring a critical patient
at such late hours is against our policy.

71
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,715
We must think about the patient's safety.

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,894
If you care so much about patients,

73
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,023
why did you move Nam Junhwan here
right after surgery?

74
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,020
You even used violence.

75
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,646
Lead us to Yang Sunae

76
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,855
right now.

77
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:55,087
Fine. However, only her guardian
and her doctor can see the patient.

78
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,798
No.

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,469
I must accompany you and check
if the content of the lawsuit is true.

80
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,594
Isn't that what you want?

81
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,892
Yes.

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,555
Despite your issue
with my daughter's job at Banseok,

83
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,399
it seems to me that you have a lot of ties
to Banseok just as much.

84
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,864
I don't see any point in answering that.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,200
Receiving preferential treatment
and receiving medical treatment

86
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,992
are completely different matters.

87
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,445
We'll find out soon enough

88
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,002
if that's all there's to it.

89
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,174
And you and I need to talk in private.

90
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,021
How much longer
will he make me do this kind of job?

91
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,572
He's indeed my knight.

92
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,871
He penetrated into the core.

93
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,759
<i>Everything is going as planned.</i>

94
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,891
Is it going as planned?

95
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,732
Is it okay that we're not going
to see Ms. Yang right away?

96
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,983
We have no choice.

97
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,694
Now that Lim Taemoon is here,

98
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,484
he won't leave
without talking to him first.

99
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,159
I made it clear that
you must have only one diamond.

100
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,365
It seems to me you didn't take my advice.

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,876
I'm not sure about that. I think
you're also having second thoughts.

102
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,002
Naturally.

103
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,379
I heard the surgeon who was
supposed to operate on my heart

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,966
was a medical criminal who made
a ghost doctor perform his surgeries.

105
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,312
I could put up with you weighing
me and Assemblywoman Yoon.

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,942
But you had me fooled about my surgery
when my life was at stake.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,110
And I could not forgive you for that.

108
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,648
About that…

109
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,074
I'm sorry. I would like to apologize.

110
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:28,362
You think
your mere apology can appease me?

111
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,618
Of course, not.

112
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,239
But even if it doesn't,
what would that change?

113
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,463
-What did you say?
-It's uncomfortable for me to say this.

114
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,290
But you have no choice.

115
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,423
Your political career… No.

116
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,343
The rest of your life

117
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,839
rests in my hands.

118
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,847
You must have been mistaken
about our relationship.

119
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,466
Keep this mind moving forward then.

120
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,225
You had had the upper hand
before you accepted favors from me.

121
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,851
But the moment you accepted them,

122
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,361
I, Gu Jingi, have the upper hand

123
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,072
over you.

124
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,322
You…

125
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,079
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

126
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,541
My gosh. They are the worst.

127
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,747
Why did they come
in the middle of the night?

128
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,512
Only my title is fancy.
I'm always on standby for them.

129
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,262
Exactly.

130
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,051
If she didn't want the treatment,
she should've told me.

131
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,183
Must I be on standby
whenever she comes to see her daughter?

132
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,479
Calm down. Okay?

133
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,687
We have to do whatever they want
just until we buy a building in Gangnam.

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
Well, thanks to her,

135
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,189
we'll get to spend
some quality time together.

136
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,618
Seriously. Your stamina is so robust.

137
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,624
Well, why don't I reap the benefit
of serving the assemblywoman?

138
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,495
Exactly. Come here.

139
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,246
That startled me. Hold on.
Darn it. Why now?

140
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,671
Who is this? It's Chairman Gu.

141
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,716
Yes, sir. I'm listening.

142
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,215
What? What do you want me to do?

143
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,853
I don't have the time to explain.

144
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,465
Put her under deep sedation

145
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,604
right now.

146
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,727
Sir. Hello? Sir?

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,780
What is it?

148
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,659
He just told me
to put more sedatives on Ms. Yang.

149
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,118
What? More on top of everything else? Why?

150
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,029
What is he trying to do?

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,410
Whatever. Let's go now.

152
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,038
Yuna.

153
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,143
This way.

154
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,688
What is this about? You said
you had to talk to me in person right now.

155
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,268
Well…

156
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,026
Why don't you sit first?
I have incredible news.

157
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,868
I'm sorry about this. I know it's late.

158
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,288
I wanted you to be the first one to know.
And I wanted to celebrate with you.

159
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,160
Celebrate?

160
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,004
Are you ready?

161
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,253
I'm going to be the hospital director.

162
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,795
The youngest director of Banseok.

163
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,756
I told my father
that I would start leading the hospital.

164
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,298
It's only the beginning.

165
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,057
I'll be the hospital director,
the chairman,

166
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,100
and the man that surpasses my father.

167
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,775
She'll be okay, right?

168
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,572
I already made a call. He will arrange it.

169
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,198
This better goes well.

170
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,702
Sunae. What is this?

171
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,950
Open this door right now! Do it.

172
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,918
Sunae, can you hear me? Yang Sunae!

173
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,420
Open the door now.

174
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,379
Don't make a scene.

175
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,973
Sunae.

176
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,889
What is this? What happened?

177
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,685
Calm down, Jinwoo. I'll take a look.

178
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,897
You two. What were you doing here?

179
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,025
I was doing my rounds.

180
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,320
I personally look after VIP patients
as I'm the assistant director.

181
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,412
Why… Why is she…

182
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,076
We performed a corrective osteotomy

183
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,373
to treat the side effect
of the limb-lengthening surgery.

184
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,577
But there was a bigger problem.

185
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,343
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

186
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,006
By the time she was admitted,
she was at the terminal stage.

187
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,469
I heard you stayed with her
for more than two years.

188
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,890
Were you really not aware of that?

189
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,427
I mean, Sunae had a weak constitution
by nature. So I just thought--

190
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,564
What a real piece of trash.

191
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,345
My precious daughter is sick
because of you.

192
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,355
But what? You're her guardian and family?

193
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,982
What do you think
someone like you can do for her?

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,070
Had she stayed with me the whole time,

195
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,532
I wouldn't have let her condition
get worse like this.

196
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,243
If you saw what you did to her,
don't make a fuss and leave quietly.

197
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,584
Don't even think about showing your face
around here again.

198
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,749
Anyway, if you try to transfer her now
when she's in critical condition,

199
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,253
the patient's condition could worsen.
And it will be a huge problem for her.

200
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,958
If you truly care for your wife,

201
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,757
you should let her get treated here.

202
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,761
-Sir, we'll get going then.
-Sure.

203
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,474
Wait.

204
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,364
Sunae.

205
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,407
What's going on?

206
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,954
Ms. Yang isn't in a coma.

207
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,865
She's breathing on her own.

208
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,757
Why did you intubate her
when she can breathe on her own?

209
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,153
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,902
I can't do this anymore.

211
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,244
What? What do you mean
you can't do this anymore?

212
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,872
I'll get going now.
Let's talk another time.

213
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,739
Wait. Yuna.

214
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,327
Yuna, hold on.

215
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,368
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,378
But it's quite rude of you to leave
without explaining why you're leaving.

217
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,300
You will find out why.

218
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,881
I'm sorry that I can't celebrate with you.

219
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,029
Why did you intubate her
when she's conscious?

220
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,280
It was for the worst-case scenario.

221
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,454
She could lose consciousness at any minute
due to difficulty in breathing.

222
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,825
So we were preparing ourselves.

223
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,171
-What are you doing? Darn it.
-What are you doing? They're our supplies.

224
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,553
Midazolam.

225
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:16,136
Dr. Lee, you administered sedatives
to forcefully put the patient to sleep.

226
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,889
Well…

227
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,313
That's right.

228
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,769
Until there was a donor
for her lung transplant,

229
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,776
we were planning to sedate her
with the right amount of sedatives.

230
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,570
So what? Is something wrong with that?

231
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,663
Administering sedatives…

232
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,541
with muscle relaxants
is a different story.

233
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,923
If you add this high of a dosage,

234
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,964
it could cause the patient to die.

235
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,548
Are you aware of this?

236
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,386
Chairman Gu, what is he talking about?

237
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,429
I can explain this to you in private.

238
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,678
You were going to stop her
from regaining consciousness

239
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,398
and hold her hostage here.

240
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,481
Just in case.

241
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,068
Why would you jeopardize her health?
This is a hospital.

242
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,157
Dr. Han.

243
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,952
As of this moment,
I'm Ms. Yang Sunae's doctor.

244
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,205
Get ready to transfer the patient.

245
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,090
Director Gu Jingi.

246
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,099
The police plan to review
all of her medical records

247
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,103
regarding hospital admission, surgery,
drug injection, and treatments.

248
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,308
Please cooperate.

249
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,857
Mr. Kwon Yoonseok.

250
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,532
Yes?

251
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,752
I have a few questions regarding
Assemblywoman Yoon's political funds.

252
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,752
I really hope we can talk this time.

253
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,051
And please don't try to harm yourself.

254
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,229
You ended things with Gu Hyunseong?

255
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Yes. I just told him.

256
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,065
But…

257
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,117
you were supposed to end it
after the board meeting.

258
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,582
And you wanted that too.

259
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,830
I did.

260
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,156
But…

261
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,880
I couldn't do it anymore.

262
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,629
I couldn't lie about my feelings
and date a man I didn't like.

263
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,678
Are you disappointed?

264
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,611
No. I'm touched.

265
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,741
I wanted you to end things with him
as soon as possible.

266
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,122
But I couldn't force you.

267
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,294
I knew that your father and Gu Jingi
had a complicated relationship.

268
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,540
From now on, I will not hide
our relationship from anyone.

269
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,547
Thank you for coming to me sooner.

270
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,318
I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore.

271
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,939
Yuna, hold on.

272
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,739
She can't do this anymore?

273
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,951
Why all of a sudden?

274
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,577
Darn it.

275
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,053
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

276
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,623
-Jinwoo, what…
-Sunae.

277
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,036
Sunae… Sunae woke up.

278
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,129
Ms. Yang Sunae.

279
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,717
Can you hear me?

280
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,232
You seem to be in a good condition.

281
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,234
I will remove the tube first.

282
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,541
Try coughing.

283
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,590
Where am I?

284
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,342
You can relax. You are at a hospital.

285
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,466
Mr. Doh Jinwoo is here as well.

286
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,008
Jinwoo.

287
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,064
-Sunae.
-Jinwoo.

288
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,770
Sunae, do you recognize me?

289
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,056
Of course.

290
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,653
I dreamed about you all along.

291
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,487
We will do more checkups,
but she seems to be fully cognitive.

292
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,911
Dr. Han.

293
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,539
Sunae is okay now, right?

294
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,545
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

295
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,178
It took over 90% of the right lung
and 50% of the left lung.

296
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,769
Is that bad?

297
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:31,929
Quite so.

298
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,857
Unlike the case with other organs,
lung damage can't be reversed.

299
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,824
The ECMO machine
will keep the patient alive,

300
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,530
but a lung transplant is
the only way to fix the problem.

301
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,951
A lung transplant?

302
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,488
Here is the problem.
While Sunae is on the waitlist,

303
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,247
she won't be able to receive a transplant
unless the donor has blood type O.

304
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,831
And there are three patients before her,

305
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,337
so she will need to wait
for several months.

306
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,799
Then please give her my lungs.

307
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,587
I have blood type O.
As her husband, I can donate my organ.

308
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,933
It is possible,

309
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,511
but I can't operate
if you are the only donor.

310
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,563
A one-on-one lung transplant
is too taxing for the donor.

311
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,150
We will need to transplant the lungs
from two donors

312
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,402
for a two-on-one lung transplant.

313
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,438
In that case…

314
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,198
We need to find another donor.

315
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,951
The person
who can donate lungs the fastest…

316
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,999
is her family.

317
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,503
Her family.

318
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,763
-A side effect?
-Yes.

319
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,302
As you ordered, the formula
was administered for two more weeks.

320
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,596
Some samples had seizures and convulsions.

321
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,930
-And the clinical patients?
-They haven't shown any anomalies.

322
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,936
Run a thorough checkup
on the clinical patients right now.

323
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,819
-Make sure the words don't get out.
-Yes, ma'am.

324
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,240
How will we report to Chairman Gu?

325
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,860
I will do it myself.

326
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,578
What? Han Yihan, that punk,
came here with Ambassador Lim?

327
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,791
That's right.

328
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,211
They showed up when
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon was visiting.

329
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,131
Why was Ambassador Lim with him?

330
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,379
I think they knew about the tie between
Chairman Gu and Assemblywoman Yoon.

331
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,133
Gosh. In any case,
I got a scare yesterday.

332
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,045
Assemblywoman Yoon, Ambassador Lim,

333
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,644
Han Yihan, and Prosecutor Geum.

334
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,849
Thinking about what happened yesterday
makes my heart bounce.

335
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,024
I ordered Nam Hyukchul to murder someone?

336
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,897
What nonsense is that?

337
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,450
I don't know.

338
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,281
Perhaps this will make you talk.

339
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,996
What's that?

340
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,414
What do you mean? What does it look like?

341
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,248
What kind of a question is that?

342
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,170
I don't know what it is.

343
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,001
You don't know what it is.

344
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,962
I could tell right away.

345
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,671
It's a knife.

346
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,426
It has a handle and a blade.

347
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,930
How could you not know it's a knife?

348
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,467
What I am saying is…

349
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:19,635
So you knew it was a knife,
but you didn't know where it came from.

350
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,346
Is that what you wanted to say?

351
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,062
Yes. That's correct.

352
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Your mind works in a complicated way.

353
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,068
That wasn't the question I asked.

354
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,412
Nam Hyukchul said you gave it to him

355
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,865
so that he would kill Han Yihan.

356
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,293
Listen. Do you honestly believe
the words of a schizophrenic patient?

357
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,503
Well,

358
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,628
we requested a mental health assessment,

359
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,800
so we will soon see
if Nam Hyukchul is schizophrenic or not.

360
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,972
<i>There is another thing
that caught my eyes.</i>

361
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,429
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

362
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,682
Last week, you made a good faith deposit
for an apartment in Apgujeong, Gangnam-gu.

363
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,556
You must make a lot of money.

364
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,942
With my salary as a prosecutor,
I can't even dream of it.

365
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,439
Did you run a background check?

366
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,477
No.

367
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,073
It comes from the police's investigation.

368
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,901
Banseok must have paid you well.

369
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,699
Last month, your wife and two sons
went to Hawaii for their studies.

370
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,872
Did you plan to take the fall
in repayment for your big break?

371
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,915
I won't say a single word
without a lawyer.

372
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,249
Suit yourself. It's your right.

373
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,923
Who will pay for the lawyer?

374
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,302
Will it be Banseok?

375
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,395
INTERROGATION ROOM

376
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,769
Request an arrest warrant
and send him home today.

377
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,897
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,780
Nam Hyukchul will be safe, right?

379
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,322
Of course. Apparently,
the warden is kicking up a fuss.

380
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,870
If another inmate gets hurt or murdered,
he will be sacked.

381
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,368
I am sure you know this,
but keep your guards up for a while.

382
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,206
They will take any measure
when they are cornered.

383
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,923
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

384
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,844
They said there wouldn't be a problem.
For goodness' sake.

385
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,983
Did you wait for me?

386
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,148
I thought you would need

387
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,900
a lawyer.

388
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,445
Here you go.

389
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,499
You are Chairman Gu Jingi's enemy.

390
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,535
Why would you defend me?

391
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,462
The fact you are worried about
the relationship between Gu Jingi and me

392
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,253
tells me that there are ties indeed.

393
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,760
Don't worry.

394
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,799
My goal isn't you, but Gu Jingi.

395
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,387
It's the same
for Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

396
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:12,441
Do you know why the same crimes
lead to different sentences?

397
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,899
Mitigating circumstances.

398
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,525
You might be a first-time offender.
You might be reflecting upon yourself.

399
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,581
You might settle with the victim.
Those factors reduce the sentence.

400
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,083
If you hire me as your lawyer,

401
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,376
I will overlook the fact
that you handed Nam Hyukchul a weapon

402
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,209
in order to kill me.

403
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,048
After all, a lawyer can't increase
his client's sentence.

404
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,968
But it only applies

405
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,680
if you tell me the whole truth.

406
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:01,994
There is one thing

407
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,911
I didn't tell you.

408
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,326
Park Kitae said something before he died.

409
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,718
"Garden, USB."

410
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,545
Mr. Park, can you hear me?

411
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,854
Don't speak. It'll go worse!

412
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,563
Garden.

413
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,520
USB.

414
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,981
Garden.

415
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,195
His pronunciation wasn't clear,

416
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,373
but he said he put
a USB drive in a garden.

417
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,082
Did you tell Gu Jingi about this?

418
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,875
No, I didn't.

419
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,054
I didn't hear it clearly.

420
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,795
<i>Garden?</i>

421
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,430
Perhaps a recording
of his conversation with Gu Jingi

422
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,761
is buried in his garden.

423
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,926
That's nonsense.
Kitae lived in a studio apartment.

424
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,686
He couldn't have hidden it
in someone else's garden.

425
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,939
He couldn't have said
something meaningless before death.

426
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,322
GARDEN?

427
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,989
-Jinwoo.
-<i>Dr. Han, I have something to say.</i>

428
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,533
I will go to the hospital.

429
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,752
-I will be back.
-Okay.

430
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,174
I won't sue Assemblywoman Yoon.

431
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,837
-Is it because of the surgery?
-Yes.

432
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,716
Sunae matters the most to me.

433
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,062
I know how you feel.

434
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,561
But once you drop the charges,
you won't be able

435
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,314
to sue her again for the same issue.

436
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,477
Then you will inadvertently exonerate
Assemblywoman Yoon.

437
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,818
I don't care

438
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,244
as long as Sunae becomes healthy.

439
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,198
Tomorrow, please meet
Assemblywoman Yoon with me.

440
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,617
Please do that.

441
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,328
Okay.

442
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,298
<i>You will drop the charges against me.</i>

443
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,590
Yes, ma'am.
If you donate your lungs to Sunae,

444
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,086
I won't make an issue about the fact

445
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,510
that you tried to kidnap me
and abused Sunae.

446
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,218
That won't be enough.

447
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,060
If she stays with a low life like you,

448
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,364
I would rather see her bedridden
for the rest of her life.

449
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,741
In that case,

450
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,358
what do you want me to do?

451
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,953
Agree to an annulment.

452
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,783
Since you are a lawyer, you would know.

453
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,578
If there were no agreements
between the spouses,

454
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,866
a marriage can be annulled.

455
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,089
There was an agreement,

456
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,764
but Sunae was unconscious
at the time of marriage registration.

457
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,796
So you could sue for annulment.

458
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,893
If you win,

459
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,308
their marriage will be erased
from the records.

460
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,849
Right after the lung transplant,

461
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:20,147
disappear without leaving a single trace
in my daughter's life.

462
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,647
If you agree to that,
I will think about it.

463
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,905
I will do that.

464
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,316
I will annul the marriage.

465
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,788
I won't see her or contact her again.

466
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,792
So please…

467
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,955
donate lungs to Sunae with me.

468
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,628
I am begging you.

469
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,892
Fine.

470
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,466
The surgery will take place at Banseokwon.

471
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,965
I will schedule it as soon as possible.

472
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,387
Even if you pick Banseokwon for security,

473
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,686
I will be in charge of the operation.

474
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,150
Suit yourself.

475
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,192
You were a cardiothoracic surgeon
who represented the hospital,

476
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,742
so you are bound to have skills.

477
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,829
Gong Gukkwang, the boss of Gukkwang Gang.

478
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,083
Five years ago, he was under investigation
for kidnapping, confinement, and assault

479
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,496
before he got acquitted.

480
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,795
Check out what he is up to these days.

481
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,298
If it's Gukkwang Gang, it's the Southern
District Prosecutors' Office's division.

482
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,383
Shall I ask a friend who is
in Criminal Division One?

483
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,144
Yes. You should do that.

484
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:37,019
No. Investigate it yourself
without using any connections.

485
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,516
Don't report to the higher-ups.

486
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,515
Does that include Senior Prosecutor Baek?

487
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,646
Yes. Please do me this favor.

488
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,322
I do whatever you ask me to do.

489
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,491
Same here. Leave it to us.

490
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,659
Gong Gukkwang looks
exactly as his name sounds.

491
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,581
It's hard to pronounce his name.
Gong Gukkwang.

492
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,499
Tomorrow, a special board meeting
for Banseok Foundation will take place.

493
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,133
Then there will be a lung transplant
for Yang Sunae,

494
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,842
an election debate between Ambassador Lim
and Assemblywoman Yoon,

495
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,637
and a Chairman Gu's confirmation hearing
as a minister nominee.

496
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,220
Michael and I will attend
the board meeting as investors.

497
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,518
We must stop Gu Hyunseong
from becoming the director.

498
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,073
I wish Yihan would join us
as a director nominee.

499
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,026
Like I said before, I have no interest
in becoming the director.

500
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,610
Find someone else.

501
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,824
I will assist you properly tomorrow

502
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,275
to pay back for everything
you have given me.

503
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,035
Friendship is a strange thing.

504
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,949
When you first stormed the place,

505
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,958
I never thought we would form
this kind of a connection.

506
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,213
It's so reassuring
to have you on our side.

507
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,804
So don't commit any crimes.

508
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:55,007
Then you won't be scared again.

509
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,259
Noted.

510
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,435
Are you nervous?

511
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,738
No, I am okay.

512
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:20,371
Okay. No matter what anyone says,
you are qualified to become the director.

513
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,082
Show everyone that you are capable.

514
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,834
Okay.

515
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,075
Let's go.

516
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,285
BANSEOK FOUNDATION'S
EXTRAORDINARY BOARD MEETING

517
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,998
<i>I, Gu Jingi,</i>

518
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,248
will resign as the chairman
of Banseok Foundation

519
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,213
and the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

520
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,667
Until the hearing ends, I will keep
the position of the chairman vacant.

521
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,261
But for the smooth management
of Banseok University Medical Center,

522
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,053
I wish to nominate a new director today

523
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,848
and ask for the board members' agreement.

524
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,731
Who do you plan to nominate?

525
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:33,481
I nominate Gu Hyunseong,
Director of Planning and Coordination.

526
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,896
That's ridiculous.

527
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,414
I hoped you wouldn't be so brazen.

528
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,079
You say that you will resign,

529
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,909
but you are putting your son
in your position!

530
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,794
I could never accept such a thing.

531
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,922
I won't.

532
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,379
Why not?

533
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,789
It's not like there is an age restriction.

534
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,298
Director Gu Hyunseong

535
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,169
has worked at this medical center
for over 15 years.

536
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,717
He is more than qualified.

537
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,760
-What nonsense--
-Stop. Please stop.

538
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,845
This isn't a matter
of an emotional quarrel.

539
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,442
If there are differing opinions,
let's decide by vote.

540
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,484
Before we do that,

541
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,614
I'd like to say a few words
as an investor of Banseok Foundation.

542
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,872
It's a rude request.

543
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,244
Nominating and electing a director is
up to the board members.

544
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,164
Even as an investor,

545
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,746
you would be overstepping
if you try to influence the vote.

546
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,670
Overstepping? As things are now,
that could be the case.

547
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,684
But what if the owner of Banseok
changes in a month?

548
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,350
-What?
-Will the owner of Banseok change?

549
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,508
-What is he talking about?
-For goodness' sake.

550
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,845
What nonsense is that?

551
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,806
So it's a private garden
that isn't open to the public.

552
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,234
I see. Thank you.

553
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,784
Okay.

554
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,947
Is it a Korean restaurant?
It's just called Garden.

555
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,490
I see. I am sorry.

556
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,623
We don't have much time until the hearing.

557
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,952
At this rate, we won't find it in a month.

558
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,156
Why are you so busy?

559
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,167
What are you looking for?

560
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,250
In a garden, Kitae put a USB drive
that has a recording of a conversation

561
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,376
between him and Gu Jingi.

562
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,383
-A garden?
-Yes.

563
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,474
But there are countless gardens in Seoul.

564
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,260
There are real gardens
and hundreds of pubs and restaurants

565
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,894
with that name.

566
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,850
It could be a person's name.

567
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,191
Jungwon as in "Garden."
It's often used as a person's name.

568
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,482
You are right.

569
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,566
Perhaps he gave the USB drive
to a person named Jungwon.

570
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,906
If that's the case, who is this person?

571
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,866
<i>Article two of the contract states,</i>

572
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:55,004
"B will give A 300 billion won's worth

573
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,712
of the Banseok R and D Center stocks."

574
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,378
BANSEOK FOUNDATION
2022 EXTRAORDINARY BOARD MEETING

575
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,593
"Should B fail to follow the contract
without justifiable reasons,

576
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:10,005
he will pay A a penal sum
of one billion dollars."

577
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,522
-What?
-One billion dollars?

578
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,270
JANG JUNGTAE

579
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,562
What does that mean?

580
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,864
Did you really sign such a contract?

581
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,980
You didn't discuss the matter
with the board.

582
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,527
Stop keeping silent and say something.

583
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,324
I understand why you are concerned,

584
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,237
but the market capitalization of Banseok
R and D Center is over two trillion won.

585
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,828
Giving 300 billion won's worth of stocks

586
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,004
won't affect the management rights.

587
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,093
That only applies
if the stock price doesn't fall.

588
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,297
The stock return will take place

589
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,262
two weeks after Chairman Gu's hearing.

590
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,967
If he gets rejected
as a nominee after the hearing

591
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,184
or the new cure
for Alzheimer's disease falls through,

592
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,265
the stock price will plummet

593
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,351
and the owner
of Banseok R and D Center will become

594
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,770
Honours Hand.

595
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,106
What nonsense are you spouting?

596
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,935
That won't happen!

597
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,527
I will expand on that matter.

598
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,665
BANSEOK FOUNDATION
2022 EXTRAORDINARY BOARD MEETING

599
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,459
I am Lim Yuna, the director
of Banseok R and D Center.

600
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,923
I have something to share

601
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:27,263
as the person who is in charge
of the new medicine's clinical trials.

602
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,532
<i>Choi Jungwon.</i>

603
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,028
There were only two nurses named Jungwon
at Banseok University Medical Center.

604
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,952
One of them quit
the week after Kitae died.

605
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,782
The timing tells us it's her.

606
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,664
It's strange that she changed her number
and went AWOL.

607
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,615
Thank you.

608
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,745
Yihan, I found out where Choi Jungwon is.

609
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,754
<i>My friend at Banseok University
Medical Center introduced her</i>

610
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,246
<i>to a nursing center in Gyeonggi Province.</i>

611
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,377
<i>Please make a right turn.</i>

612
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,798
EVERGREEN NURSING CENTER

613
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,306
A thorough examination
after the administration revealed

614
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,265
a 5% increase

615
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,308
in cardiovascular diseases.

616
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,101
Let me put it in simple words.

617
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,193
The longer you use the new medicine,

618
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,863
the more you are at risk
for cardiovascular diseases.

619
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,783
Correct.

620
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,861
Thus, as the person who is in charge,

621
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,452
I believe we should cancel
the conditional permission

622
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,743
from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

623
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,871
JAYDEN LEE

624
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,214
LEE DOHYUNG, GU HYUNSEONG

625
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,001
The number is only five out of 100.

626
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,748
Isn't the number too small
to cancel the conditional permission?

627
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,876
Had the number been higher,

628
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,672
the clinical trials
would have been canceled.

629
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,681
As that thankfully isn't the case,
we can cancel the conditional permission

630
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,850
and put more time
into the clinical trials.

631
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,640
You are using it as an excuse

632
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,854
to sell Banseok R and D Center
to Honours Hand.

633
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,484
Banseok Foundation is a medical company
that represents Korea.

634
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,735
We shouldn't let
a foreign company steal it

635
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,318
no matter the case.

636
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,744
Why do you think of it as stealing?

637
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,914
The board members who are here
will gain more.

638
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,093
Imagine Banseok R and D Center
moving beyond this country

639
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,927
and getting listed on Nasdaq.

640
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,931
Then its worth

641
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,893
will increase by tens of times.

642
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:45,728
And the profits will be shared
among the board members.

643
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,315
A typical biopharmaceutical company
that is listed on Nasdaq

644
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,990
has the market capitalization

645
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,702
of over 300 trillion won.

646
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,565
Is it true?

647
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,776
-Did she say 300 trillion won?
-Over 300 trillion won?

648
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,366
If we succeed in developing

649
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:04,042
the first cure for Alzheimer's disease
without any side effects,

650
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,879
it will be
Banseok R and D Center's future.

651
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:12,257
-If we succeed…
-It's better for us.

652
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,631
If the company gets listed…
If you succeed in developing…

653
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,473
That sounds nice.

654
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,893
Thank you for sharing your opinion
as an investor.

655
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,269
But all of these things will happen

656
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:27,019
only if I, Gu Jingi, get rejected
as a nominee at the hearing.

657
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,773
Do you honestly believe that will happen?

658
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,685
Perhaps you are hoping for it.

659
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,362
There must have been a misunderstanding.

660
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,027
Regardless of the stock return,

661
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,405
Gu Hyunseong should never be
the director of the medical center.

662
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,038
Since he is facing prosecution

663
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,211
for a violation of the Medical Service Act
and attempted murder,

664
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,003
-such a move would be too risky.
-What is he talking about?

665
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,955
-Attempted murder?
-Then he can't become the director.

666
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,672
BAE SEOKHO

667
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,968
JANG JUNGTAE

668
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:13,821
What is it?

669
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,111
We are the Medical Crime
Investigation Unit. We are going in.

670
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,735
Search and seize
the medical record department first.

671
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,497
-Okay.
-What is this about?

672
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,213
You should have notified us of your visit.

673
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,843
You prepare too much when we do that.

674
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,836
We prefer to keep things natural.

675
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,719
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

676
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,590
We have a search warrant as well.

677
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,218
If you aren't going to show us the way,
we will enter on our own.

678
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,965
Please give us time
to ask for the members' understanding.

679
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,265
Time to fabricate evidence, you mean.

680
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,019
The prosecution
and Medical Crime Investigation Unit

681
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,896
are incredibly busy.

682
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,862
I am afraid that we don't have time
to meet such demands.

683
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,744
So please move out of the way

684
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,913
before the members become
more uncomfortable.

685
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,120
Guys, aren't you going to work? Let's go.

686
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,576
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

687
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,669
Ma'am, isn't it nice to step outside?

688
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,091
It's nice, but I don't want
to burden you, Jungwon.

689
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,804
Shall we make another round?

690
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,260
Ms. Choi Jungwon?

691
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,096
Ms. Choi Jungwon.

692
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:34,058
I am the late Park Kitae's
friend and lawyer,

693
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,016
Han Yihan.

694
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,031
Dr. Han Yihan?

695
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,776
Yes.

696
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,486
I came here because I want to ask you
something about Kitae.

697
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,258
I will… I will explain.

698
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,089
The attempted murder charge
on Director Gu Hyunseong

699
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,676
is a groundless attack

700
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,432
by a prosecutor
who holds a personal grudge

701
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,314
against Banseok University Medical Center.

702
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,687
I swear on my honor

703
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,477
that he did no such thing.

704
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,653
Shouldn't Director Gu Hyunseong
explain himself?

705
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,396
How could you entrust the future
of Banseok University Medical Center

706
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,736
to someone who hides
behind his father at times like this?

707
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,832
I can't agree with such a decision.

708
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,115
I agree.

709
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,409
Excuse me.

710
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,787
What is it?

711
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,785
We are sorry to interrupt.

712
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,757
We will leave
after we perform our official duty.

713
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,758
Who are you people? How dare you do this?

714
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,721
I told you just now.
We are performing our official duty.

715
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,183
How could you say that
when you appear all the time?

716
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,644
It's an abuse of authority!

717
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,434
Actually, it's a use of authority.

718
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,138
A use of authority.

719
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,018
It aligns with my values as a prosecutor.

720
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:01,315
I look after the weak
and brandish my authority to the powerful.

721
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,244
It's the only way to keep the balance.

722
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,322
If you disobey a subpoena again,

723
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,577
I will summon you
as a suspect the next time.

724
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,450
If you still fail to show up,
I will request an arrest warrant.

725
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,132
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

726
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,470
Me?

727
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,389
Please let go.

728
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,885
Judge wisely.

729
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,935
The Legal Team at Banseok
might no longer be on your side.

730
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,528
Excuse me for the interruption.
Please proceed with the meeting.

731
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,824
-What just happened?
-Seriously.

732
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,407
Goodness.

733
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,878
Now, let's have a vote.

734
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,053
Former Chairman Gu Jingi.

735
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,432
Thank you for making time.

736
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:20,557
Don't mention it.
I knew I would get a visit someday

737
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,978
from you

738
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,942
or Banseok.

739
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,447
What was your relationship with Kitae?

740
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,825
We kept it a secret at the workplace,

741
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,411
but we dated for a long time.

742
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,924
We even thought of marriage.

743
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,995
We met for the last time
before he got arrested.

744
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,297
Why don't you want me
to visit you or go to the trial?

745
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,432
Do you still want to hide
our relationship?

746
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,639
No. It isn't like that, Jungwon.

747
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,849
I don't want

748
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,851
to put you in danger.

749
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,555
What dangers are there?

750
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,975
Please tell me.

751
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,185
You could get arrested tomorrow!

752
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,039
I wanted to propose to you
in the coolest way,

753
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,253
so I made preparations for months.

754
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,589
Who knew it would be so lame?

755
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,630
I am such a fool, right?

756
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,804
I changed my mind.

757
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,343
You know what?

758
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,101
I will put this on your finger

759
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,890
after this situation gets resolved.

760
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,596
Until then,

761
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,104
please hold on to it. Okay?

762
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,481
Afterward, as you already know,
he got arrested

763
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,734
and was murdered in prison.

764
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,696
For a while, I was beside myself.

765
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,452
Then…

766
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,331
I found this.

767
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,984
It was hidden
at the bottom of the ring case.

768
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,979
Did you check the content?

769
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,442
Yes.

770
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,691
As soon as I did, I left Banseok

771
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,613
and came here.

772
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,871
Chairman Gu Jingi ordered a murder, right?

773
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,664
<i>I will announce the result.</i>

774
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,544
The vote was for the appointment
of Mr. Gu Hyunseong as the director

775
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,001
of Banseok University Medical Center.

776
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,915
Five people voted for it
and 11 people voted against it.

777
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,671
Thus, the issue has been rejected.

778
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,296
-Yes!
-We did it!

779
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,761
We did it!

780
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,305
I am glad it got rejected.

781
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,890
I can't believe what he did.

782
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,614
<i>How did Hyunseong get charged
with attempted murder?</i>

783
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,608
What went behind my back?

784
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,367
Please don't drink so quickly.
You already drank quite a bit.

785
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,870
That female prosecutor is

786
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,871
the sister of the boy

787
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,333
who died at our hospital
due to an accident five years ago, right?

788
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,090
-Yes, ma'am.
-It got concluded as the surgeon's fault!

789
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,755
Why is she seeking revenge
after all these years?

790
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,549
Unbelievable.

791
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,562
For a while, stop attending events
and keep a low profile.

792
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,060
Don't go to work at the hospital.

793
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,151
No.

794
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,568
It will look like
I am admitting to the charges.

795
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,729
The attempted murder charge is an utter--

796
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,028
Just… Just do as I say.

797
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,283
None of your actions brought good results!

798
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,156
How is that my fault?

799
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,617
If you hadn't made Han Yihan do
the ghost surgery,

800
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,165
none of this would have happened.

801
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,329
You punk.

802
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,207
You are ashamed of me, right?

803
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,181
I am sick and tired of Han Yihan!

804
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,216
I got compared to him for 20 years
since university.

805
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,772
I wanted to surpass him one day.

806
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,561
But you killed that dream!

807
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:32,112
-Hyunseong.
-You made him my ghost doctor!

808
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,704
Do you know who made me feel the smallest?

809
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,488
Han Yihan? Jayden Lee?

810
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,621
No.

811
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,327
It's you, father.

812
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:50,788
Hyunseong.

813
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,532
<i>Come on in.</i>

814
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,566
<i>Chairman Gu, you called for me.</i>

815
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,409
<i>I want to discuss something with you
for the future</i>

816
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,327
<i>of Banseok University Medical Center's
Cardiothoracic Surgery.</i>

817
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,159
<i>With me? About what?</i>

818
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:32,501
<i>At the trial for Geum Seokju's death,</i>

819
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,304
<i>there is something I want you to do.</i>

820
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,759
As you know,
the process of a lung transplant

821
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,060
is more complex and difficult
than that of a heart transplant.

822
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,982
So cooperation
between the teams is the key.

823
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,519
For smooth extraction and transplantation,

824
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,107
we will open three operating rooms.

825
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,529
In Room One for lung extraction,

826
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,529
<i>we will cut
Mr. Doh Jinwoo's right lower lobe.</i>

827
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,452
<i>In the room for lung transplantation,
I will open Ms. Yang Sunae's chest,</i>

828
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,157
<i>cut her right lung,</i>

829
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,578
<i>and transplant
Mr. Doh Jinwoo's right lower lobe.</i>

830
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,548
<i>While I perfuse
Ms. Yang Sunae's right lung</i>

831
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,170
<i>and cut her left lower lobe,</i>

832
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,677
<i>you will cut Ms. Yoon Miseon's
left lower lobe in Room Two.</i>

833
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,847
In three operating rooms,
the patient and two donors

834
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,391
will go through anesthesia,
pneumonectomy, and transplantation

835
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,516
in a systematic way.

836
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,770
Set aside hard feelings

837
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:40,686
and focus on having
a successful operation.

838
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,922
How fascinating.

839
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,039
Although we were
at each other's throats yesterday,

840
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:01,007
we are hoping for a successful surgery
with one mind today.

841
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,339
It seems like you are entertained.

842
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,215
Of course not.
It's a matter of life and death.

843
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,888
I am simply here
to stop any unpleasant incidents

844
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,644
that might arise,
so don't hate me so much.

845
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,707
Ms. Yang Sunae,
the current time is 11:21 a.m.

846
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,420
We will administer anesthesia.

847
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,129
Okay.

848
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,220
We will administer anesthesia.

849
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,390
Oxygen.

850
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,702
I will relay the information.

851
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,951
Everything has gone smoothly
with the extraction in Room One.

852
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,615
They are done with Mr. Doh Jinwoo,
so we can begin the operation.

853
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,252
Let's begin.

854
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,447
Contact Room One and ask them
to bring lung from Mr. Doh Jinwoo.

855
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,537
Yes, doctor.

856
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,963
Ms. Yang Sunae's operation has begun.
Please deliver the lung.

857
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,221
It's a bit small.

858
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,114
I will extract a lung.

859
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,572
Mr. Doh Jinwoo's left lower lobe
has arrived.

860
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,542
The condition is good,
but the size is a bit small.

861
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,040
Mr. Doh Jinwoo had tuberculosis.

862
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,838
This isn't unexpected, but…
It can't be helped. Let's begin.

863
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,886
I will attach the bronchial tubes first.

864
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:52,798
Forceps.

865
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,858
-Put the head down.
-Okay.

866
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,280
The clamps are coming off.

867
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,028
-Prepare for the bleeding.
-Okay.

868
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,280
-Injecting 500mg of steroids.
-Injecting 500mg of steroids.

869
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,452
Use the Ambu bag.

870
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,200
Using the Ambu bag.

871
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,411
-Suction.
-Okay.

872
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,826
Removing air.

873
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,019
Good.

874
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,228
Tell Room Two to begin extraction.

875
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,483
Yes, doctor.

876
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,824
-We will now work on the left lower lobe.
-Okay.

877
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,157
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

878
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,794
Doctor.

879
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,082
What's the matter?

880
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,662
It's…

881
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,245
Ms. Yoon Miseon refused to donate

882
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,368
right before general anesthesia.

883
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,628
<i>Dr. Han. I detect pulmonary edema.</i>

884
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,052
<i>It will be dangerous
if we don't transplant the lungs now.</i>

885
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,221
Know this.

886
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,429
Your stupidity and greed are
the cause of her death.

887
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,348
<i>My father can never betray
Chairman Gu Jingi.</i>

888
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,101
Is there another reason why
he can't let go of Gu Jingi?

889
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,524
<i>The living authority never gets inspected.</i>

890
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,693
So please become the president.

891
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,519
<i>Take it. It's yours.</i>

892
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,777
<i>Why are you giving this to me?</i>

893
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,318
<i>Think of it as a deposit.</i>

894
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,362
I will buy the tip of your tongue.

895
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,605
<i>This is Kwon Yoonseok.</i>

896
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,157
<i>Please come to the address
in the message. You must be alone.</i>

897
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,658
<i>Is this a trap?</i>

898
