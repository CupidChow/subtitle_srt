1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,890
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,140
That heart…

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,390
Who does it belong to?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,100
The fellow passenger in the car died.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,230
I took the heart out myself.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,190
-That means…
-You're right.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,900
It violates the Medical Service Act.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,030
The passenger isn't
a registered organ donor,

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,910
and I didn't notify the guardian
of my action.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,160
If this gets out,
my license will be revoked.

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,700
I might even be jailed.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,580
Why are you doing this?

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,290
Because it's worth it.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,590
No matter what the consequence is,

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,220
I will save this patient.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,930
So please, do the surgery for me.

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,800
I'll assist you.

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,470
You're going to assist me?

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,140
You're already better than me.

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,850
You're the doctor
who's most likely to save him.

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,320
You have no time to think.

22
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,240
Will you let the patient expire
when you could've saved him?

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,240
You just need
to save the patient as a doctor.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,540
This is the last surgery
I'll ask you to perform.

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,750
After this, you won't have to live
as Hyunseong's ghost.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,880
And I'll spend the rest of my life

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,170
paying this debt back.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,520
Then promise me.

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,060
That after the surgery,

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,820
you'll explain everything
to the patient and the donor's family.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,150
I promise.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,490
I'll take responsibility
for everything that'll happen

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,660
after this surgery.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,670
You have my trust.

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,550
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,350
-That's…
-A Rachmaninoff concerto.

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,020
The patient listens to this very often.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,440
If it hinders the surgery…

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,730
No, it's all right.

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,650
This can help the patient recover.

41
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,530
I'll begin.

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,820
Please cut.

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,910
Cut.

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,870
It has been two hours and 30 minutes.

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,550
Are you all right?

46
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,260
Yes.

47
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,730
SURGICAL TIMER

48
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,190
CURRENT TIME, ANESTHESIA TIMER

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,200
Removing the ACC.

50
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,870
Stop the pump. I'll insert the drain.

51
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,960
Giving the sign for stopping the pump.

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,170
One. Two. Three.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,930
BP, 115 over 80. Heart rate, 110.

54
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,810
The patient is stable.

55
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,230
Wait.

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
The septum isn't beating very well.
What do we do?

57
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,000
-It's taking too long.
-Forty-five seconds elapsed.

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Director Gu.

59
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,090
The surgeon must make the decision.

60
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,390
Epinephrine, two ampules.
Defibrillation, charge to ten joules.

61
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,520
-Charge to ten joules.
-Epinephrine, two ampules.

62
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,980
Ten joules.

63
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,780
-Twenty joules.
-Twenty joules.

64
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Twenty joules.

65
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,580
Epinephrine, one ampule.

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,370
There must be air in the coronary.

67
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,050
Dr. Han, he was just sutured.

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,300
His heart might explode!

69
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Director Gu.

70
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,600
The rhythm is back.

71
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,110
The heart rate is back.

72
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,980
It's going up.

73
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,680
-Great work, everyone.
-Great work.

74
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,770
Great work.

75
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,690
I'll watch him for a moment,
then finish up.

76
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,630
You did well.

77
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,670
Go get a good rest.

78
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,220
I'll talk to the hospital,
so don't worry about it.

79
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,560
-Thank you. Great work.
-Sure.

80
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,990
Director Gu put in a lot of thought.

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,430
I have to go check on Seokju.

82
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,900
EPISODE 2

83
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,250
-Have you seen Dr. Han Yihan?
-No.

84
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,590
Okay. Thank you.

85
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,730
-Hey, Daewoong.
-Yihan, where are you?

86
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,820
Why? What's going on?

87
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,530
We're in trouble. It's Seokju. Seokju is…

88
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,660
-The gel.
-The gel.

89
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,620
-A hundred joules.
-A hundred joules.

90
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,000
Check the rhythm.

91
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,340
Nothing.

92
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,590
-Again, 150 joules.
-To 150 joules.

93
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,430
-Continue to massage his heart.
-Yes.

94
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,520
Yihan, hurry.

95
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,860
What happened? Why is the ECMO here?

96
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,940
He wasn't doing well, so he was put on it.
But the ECMO flow isn't looking great.

97
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,070
How long has it been?

98
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,860
The ECMO line has shaken for a while.
Five minutes into his cardiac arrest.

99
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,410
He might go brain dead
even if his heart went back up.

100
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,870
-Keep massaging.
-Yes.

101
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,330
Give him epinephrine every two minutes.
Give me 200 joules.

102
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,250
-He just--
-Give me 200 joules!

103
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,000
Two hundred joules.

104
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
Move.

105
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,510
You should stop now.

106
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,390
-Seokju.
-Dr. Han, please stop.

107
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,510
Let go! Don't touch me.

108
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,470
Yihan.

109
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,770
Seokju. Seokju!

110
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,350
Yihan.

111
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,910
Seokyeong.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,090
What's… What's going on…

113
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,180
You should declare his death.

114
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,220
His guardian is here too.

115
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,720
You performed his surgery,
so you should do it.

116
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,210
Mr. Geum Seokju.

117
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,000
November 21st, 2016,

118
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,090
at 2:23 P.M.,

119
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,890
he passed away.

120
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
No.

121
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
This can't be true.

122
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,080
No, right? No.

123
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,700
You said the surgery went well.

124
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,250
-Seokyeong.
-You promised.

125
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,380
You said Seokju could go to school
like everyone else

126
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,670
and make friends.

127
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,260
You said he could live

128
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,220
that ordinary and happy life!

129
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Seokyeong.

130
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,930
If you're sorry, bring him back.

131
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,020
Bring back my poor Seokju. Bring him back!

132
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,440
Bring him back alive! Bring him back!

133
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,200
Bring him back.

134
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,450
Bring him back…

135
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,830
Bring him back.

136
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,040
His condition suddenly worsened
from the morning.

137
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,920
I called you many times,
but you wouldn't pick up,

138
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,670
so Director Gu put the ECMO on him,

139
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,300
but his vitals never came back.

140
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,850
The director did it himself?

141
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,220
Yes, he was at Banseokwon.

142
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,140
He knew where I was.

143
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,560
What about at dawn?

144
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,770
How was he at dawn?

145
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,530
I didn't visit him.

146
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,820
Why not?
I asked you to check in on him every hour.

147
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,830
Well, Chief Cho Junghyun
changed the shifts.

148
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,700
Chief Cho? Why?

149
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,330
She said she has to manage
the VIP aseptic area for security.

150
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
You know the system.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,840
The chief nurse always gets her way.

152
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,140
Donation?

153
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,770
You want to take
his heart tissues and eyes?

154
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,480
We must proceed quickly

155
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,360
when we make an attempt
to procure organs--

156
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,980
Even so, how can you ask me so quickly?

157
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,530
This is a consent form for organ donation.

158
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,120
I cannot even fathom

159
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,700
how painful this must be for you.

160
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,620
But even at this moment,
there are patients who are dying,

161
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,790
waiting for their transplant surgery,

162
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,960
just like Seokju did.

163
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,710
Please do not turn
the late patient's noble decision

164
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,970
into a wasted promise.

165
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,300
I ask of you.

166
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,730
-Give it to me.
-Thank you.

167
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,180
Seokyeong.

168
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,730
Transplant Coordinator, why are you here?

169
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,110
Wait, are you here to procure his organs?

170
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,740
-Yes.
-No.

171
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,570
He needs an autopsy first.

172
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,740
Why does he need that?

173
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,620
We need to know
the exact cause of his death.

174
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,160
Do not sign that.

175
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,000
Once they take the heart tissues,

176
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,210
it's tough to find the cause
through autopsy.

177
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,880
What do you mean?

178
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,010
Is there another reason why he died?

179
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,720
You should do the autopsy.

180
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,680
Nice to meet you.

181
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,270
My name is Gu Jingi, the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

182
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,440
You should do the autopsy.

183
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,860
We have a pathologist
who has worked as a forensic pathologist

184
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,860
with the National Forensic Service.

185
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,190
We'll ask her to perform the autopsy

186
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
as we procure his organs.

187
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,700
Then we can disclose the cause of death

188
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,870
and save the lives of many other patients

189
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,540
who suffer just as he did.

190
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,250
Please do that.

191
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,750
Thank you.

192
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,630
We'll do our best
so that his death isn't left

193
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,550
with an inch of doubt.

194
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,480
The deceased passed away
at 2:23 P.M. on November 21st.

195
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,600
He generously agreed to donate
his eyes and heart tissues.

196
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,020
Thank you.

197
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,690
We must procure organs during the autopsy,
so let's move quickly.

198
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,190
Scalpel.

199
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,290
Are you all right?

200
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,340
If this is too hard for you,
I can listen to the result alone.

201
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,930
In my career as a prosecutor,

202
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,640
I've given dozens and dozens
of orders for an autopsy.

203
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,930
I even came and watched a few of them.

204
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,480
But…

205
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,480
this is driving me crazy.

206
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,150
In there, Seokju is…

207
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,950
My brother's body is getting taken apart.

208
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,950
It's too tough to bear.

209
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,300
We finished the autopsy
and organ procurement of the deceased.

210
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,680
His eyes and skin tissues were
good enough to be transplanted.

211
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,890
However, his heart was

212
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,980
extremely damaged
to a point of dysfunction.

213
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,810
What happened to his heart?

214
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,190
It looks like
the hemorrhage of the pulmonary artery

215
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,860
caused cardiac tamponade.

216
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,700
His heart was pressed,

217
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,120
so his cardiac output decreased,
causing a shock.

218
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,950
Then he passed
because he wasn't handled quickly enough.

219
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,210
This is my opinion.

220
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,210
Are you saying Seokju died

221
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,670
because of the surgery?

222
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,090
Yes, the autopsy result says--

223
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,380
There's no way.

224
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,640
That's impossible.

225
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,260
I had to conduct an emergency phlebotomy,

226
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,310
but the measure was taken perfectly.
He was sutured well,

227
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,180
and his vitals were fine too.

228
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm just telling you the truth
as revealed from the autopsy.

229
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,730
Also, I'm sure you already knew
how dangerous it is

230
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,690
to conduct an emergency phlebotomy
immediately after surgery

231
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,700
as a cardiothoracic surgeon.

232
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,320
But the situation was…

233
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,750
Seokyeong.

234
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,090
Seokyeong, no.

235
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,050
Something must have gone wrong.

236
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,640
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

237
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,220
THE LATE GEUM SEOKJU

238
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,730
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

239
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,820
Seokju.

240
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,110
What will you do about Seokju?

241
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,670
What's your plan now?

242
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,680
We should leave him at a children's home.

243
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,560
I'm sure you can manage yourself,

244
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,020
but you won't be able to look after him.

245
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,640
So leave him at a children's home for now,

246
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,770
then come find him when you're--

247
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,360
I won't let him go alone.

248
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,230
Don't be so stubborn.

249
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,110
You're too old to go to a children's home.

250
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,990
Seokju is only five years old now.

251
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,700
Do you feel better now that you say that?

252
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,120
-What?
-You don't want to take him.

253
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,420
But you want to do something
to save your face as an adult.

254
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,210
That's why you said that.

255
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,790
Hey, don't say that.

256
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,590
Seokyeong, that's not the way
to talk to your uncle.

257
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,130
I won't ask for your help.

258
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,300
So don't do anything at all.

259
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,100
I'll protect Seokju
no matter what happens.

260
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,930
Even if I break down,
I'll raise him on my own.

261
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,980
Fine. I get it.

262
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,030
Goodness.

263
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,910
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

264
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,080
I said I'd protect you

265
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,750
at any cost.

266
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,050
Goodness, I feel so bad
for Prosecutor Geum.

267
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,250
Here.

268
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,210
Eat up.

269
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,420
Even if you don't feel like it,
shove it down.

270
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,420
That's the only way to hold out.

271
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,890
The guy you were going to marry
hasn't come yet?

272
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,310
Are you all right?

273
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,940
They said Seokju died…

274
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,940
because of him.

275
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,280
What?

276
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,860
The hospital conducted an autopsy.

277
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,620
They said Seokju died because
he performed a dangerous procedure.

278
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,000
But no matter how hard I think about it,
I don't believe that's true.

279
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,510
He looked after Seokju more than I did.

280
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,430
He assured me that the surgery went well…

281
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,220
and that he would keep monitoring him.

282
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,270
Why…

283
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,850
Why did my dear Seokju…

284
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,650
I'll reveal the truth.

285
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,700
I'll confirm
who is responsible for Seokju's death.

286
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,280
So Seokyeong,

287
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,580
you should only focus on sending off
your brother properly for now.

288
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,500
Okay.

289
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,380
I will. Thank you.

290
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,350
Why can't I?

291
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,270
He was my patient for over five years

292
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,650
and I performed the transplant myself.
You know that, Ms. Kim!

293
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,690
Why can't I look at the surgical record?

294
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,030
The thing is… that I received an order.

295
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,400
Order?

296
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,990
I was told that since you'll be
investigated by the prosecutors,

297
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,200
I must limit your access
to the patient's medical records.

298
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,860
That day, the patient was transferred
using the internal elevator

300
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,990
after the heart transplant.

301
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,870
The patient must still be here.

302
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,420
Already?

303
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,300
Yihan!

304
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,840
Daewoong!

305
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,850
Yihan, what happened?

306
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,510
They circulated an internal announcement

307
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,640
that you'll be dismissed
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department

308
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,390
and a disciplinary committee will be held.

309
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,400
Daewoong, your access card.

310
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,730
Okay. Here you go.

311
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,400
Yihan, why are you doing this?

312
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,200
There is a patient I must find.

313
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,240
He got a heart transplant here
in the middle of the night two days ago,

314
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,910
so he should still be
in an aseptic area or in an ICU.

315
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,910
Heart transplant?
Someone else got one besides Seokju?

316
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,010
I guess everyone saw the announcement.

317
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,050
But still, how can they treat you
so differently overnight?

318
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,150
You stay here
and block people from coming in.

319
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,820
Block them? How?

320
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,740
By doing what you're good at.
I'll be counting on you.

321
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,280
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

322
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,580
What I am good at?

323
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,790
Using my strength?

324
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,130
Gosh, I'm the Crazy Bull of Magok-dong.

325
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,670
I get to use my strength.
It's been a while.

326
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,450
-That's…
-A Rachmaninoff concerto.

327
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,250
The patient listens to this very often.

328
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,710
Rachmaninoff.

329
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,450
I need to find out

330
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,280
who took Seokju's heart.

331
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,700
Dr. Han Yihan!

332
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,120
Dr. Han.

333
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,790
We have the director's order to stop you
from entering Banseokwon starting today.

334
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,960
Please put that down and come this way.

335
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,840
A prosecutor and detectives are
in the lobby.

336
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,090
Don't do anything you'll regret.

337
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,350
Nothing you do will matter anymore.

338
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,890
I already have plenty of regrets.

339
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,590
See? I told you.

340
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,170
There is nothing you can do.

341
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,220
Who is that patient
that you're going this far…

342
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Get him out of here.

343
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,940
Who is that?

344
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,630
I'm Baek Kangho, a prosecutor
from Criminal Division One

345
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,630
of the Seoul Southern District
Prosecutors' Office.

346
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,010
Yes, I was notified.

347
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,300
It's the patient Geum Seokju's
surgical and medical records.

348
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,470
Mr. Han Yihan.

349
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,890
You're under arrest

350
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,140
for special destruction
and damage and trespassing.

351
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,110
I need to check
your medical malpractice charge too.

352
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,230
You have the right to appoint a lawyer
and to remain silent.

353
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,950
Okay, let's go.

354
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,070
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,770
Have the surgery at Banseokwon.

356
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,190
He's the brother of someone
you deeply care about.

357
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,530
Of course, I can.

358
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,200
No need to feel bad. Just accept it.

359
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,700
This is nothing
compared to everything you've done

360
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,990
for my son.

361
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,040
Do you agree?

362
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,090
What did you say?

363
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,340
I asked if you agree

364
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,920
with the autopsy results
and surgical records.

365
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,180
No, I don't agree with them.

366
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,930
I sutured it right after collecting blood.

367
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,760
BP and vital signs were normal,

368
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,890
and the staff also confirmed them with me.

369
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,110
Then, what were your whereabouts

370
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,230
while the victim suffered his death?

371
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,160
I was resting in the hospital.

372
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,700
You were resting
until your morning shift was almost over?

373
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,080
They called for you many times,
but you didn't respond.

374
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,410
You were his attending physician,

375
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,960
yet you never checked the condition
of the patient you operated on…

376
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,590
and didn't even show up
until his life was in danger?

377
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,970
Why did you go
to the medical record library?

378
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,050
Were you trying to tamper
with the surgical records?

379
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,220
You killed him.

380
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,020
If you had fulfilled your duties
as a doctor, Seokju wouldn't have died.

381
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,940
So plead guilty and ask for forgiveness.

382
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,400
That is

383
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,900
the only atonement you can make
for my junior colleague

384
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,490
who lost
the only remaining member of her family.

385
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
No.

386
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,410
I can't do that.

387
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,490
Because I didn't kill Seokju.

388
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,040
Is that so?

389
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,960
Then I'll make you admit…

390
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,460
that you're a murderer.

391
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
PRISONER TRANSPORT

392
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,560
Two lines. Over here.

393
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,990
We'll move now. Please follow me.

394
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,510
RESTRICTED AREA

395
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,280
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER

396
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,990
I used to rule my area.
You'd better stop that.

397
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,450
Seokju!

398
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,170
Stop it!

399
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,680
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

400
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,940
Witness, proceed with the oath.

401
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,740
I solemnly swear

402
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,120
to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth

403
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:16,080
under pains and penalties of perjury.

404
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,340
Our key is the witness.

405
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
If the surgery records
and autopsy report are rigged,

406
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,920
the testimony is the only way
to prove that.

407
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,630
Is there someone you can trust

408
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,510
among the medical staff members
you worked with?

409
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,060
Witness, you could observe the defendant
closest in surgery. Correct?

410
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,810
Yes, that's correct.

411
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,940
According to the surgery records
from the hospital,

412
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,270
during the surgery,

413
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
the defendant drew out the patient's blood
from his heart in an emergency.

414
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,280
And it doesn't say anything
about closing the affected area.

415
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,490
Now, let me ask you.

416
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,910
Witness, did you see
the defendant suture the incision?

417
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,420
I didn't see it.

418
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,970
Actually, I tried to stop him.

419
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,340
I said drawing out blood from a patient
who just had the transplant was risky.

420
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,850
But he ignored my opinion.

421
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,890
He proceeded on his own.

422
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,060
Kitae.

423
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,400
-What are you doing?
-That's the truth.

424
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,490
I definitely told you it was risky.

425
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,370
-But you did it anyway.
-Park Kitae!

426
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,740
Witness, quiet down.

427
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,540
Defendant, you too. Sit down.

428
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,580
If you cause another disturbance,
you'll be removed from the court.

429
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,420
Seriously. This wasn't your first time.

430
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,710
I always told you it was risky

431
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,840
and we shouldn't have done it,
but you did it anyway.

432
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,880
You have no idea how awful that is.

433
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,010
I knew that your stubbornness

434
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,050
would cost a life one day.

435
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,270
WITNESS

436
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,980
I solemnly swear

437
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,730
to tell the truth,

438
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,150
-the whole truth…
-…the whole truth,

439
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,190
and nothing but the truth

440
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,110
-under the pains…
-…under the pains…

441
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,160
…and penalties of perjury.

442
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,240
Witness Cho Junghyun.

443
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,750
I was in charge of filling out the surgery
and medical records of the patient.

444
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,670
I recorded everything truthfully.

445
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,880
Everything you see on the records is true.

446
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,220
Instructions from the lead surgeon
during heart transplants are imperative.

447
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,090
As an anesthesiologist,
I followed the lead surgeon's instructions

448
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,800
and injected the drugs.

449
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,600
He came to my office

450
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,310
and demanded to have access
to the patient's medical records.

451
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,730
I explained to him I couldn't
because of the investigation.

452
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,070
But he kept demanding to see them.

453
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,570
I performed the tissue procurement
with the autopsy,

454
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,820
but I can assure you
I was focused on the autopsy too.

455
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,910
As a forensic pathologist,
I performed many autopsies so far

456
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,700
and am certain
that the autopsy report is accurate.

457
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,380
This is our last witness.

458
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
You were the scrub nurse of the surgery.

459
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,260
So you were there
to observe the defendant's surgery

460
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,300
from the beginning to the end. Correct?

461
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,390
Yes. I saw the surgery with my two eyes
and remember it clearly.

462
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,890
You can speak softly.

463
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,890
I see. Okay.

464
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,020
Did you see Mr. Han Yihan

465
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,690
suture the incision
after he drew out the patient's blood

466
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,190
as an emergency treatment?

467
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Of course. Yihan…

468
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,910
I mean, I put the suture tool
on Dr. Han's hands myself.

469
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,700
Was there any bleeding after he closed up?

470
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,170
No. There was no bleeding at all!

471
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,670
That is all.

472
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,670
Prosecution, your witness.

473
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,510
-Okay. Mr. Kang Daewoong.
-Yes.

474
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,390
What did you call the defendant?

475
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,930
I said, Dr. Han.

476
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,890
No. Before that,
didn't you call him by his first name?

477
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,690
Oh, that. I…

478
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,110
I know

479
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,070
you two went to the same high school

480
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,740
and have a very close friendship.

481
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,200
When the defendant illegally broke
into Banseokwon,

482
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,620
you assaulted the security guards
who tried to stop him

483
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,490
and caused a scene
to buy the defendant time.

484
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,450
Your Honor. This is irrelevant.

485
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,290
How is this irrelevant?

486
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,670
The witness is
the defendant's close friend.

487
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,170
How can we be sure
the witness will not perjure himself?

488
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,760
All right. How about this?

489
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,010
Did you know
the defendant was an ex-convict

490
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,600
who served more than a year in prison
for aggravated assault?

491
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,310
-Your Honor!
-Why are you bringing that up now?

492
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,770
Quiet!

493
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,230
Prosecutor, you must respect the witness.

494
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,820
Yes, Your Honor.

495
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,940
However, when the medical staff members

496
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,700
are giving us contradictory testimonies
just like now,

497
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,410
whose testimony will be more trustworthy?

498
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,160
A licensed cardiothoracic surgeon?

499
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,750
Or a man who's been friends
with the defendant for over ten years…

500
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,300
Fine. A scrub nurse with a prior.

501
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,430
-What is this?
-He was an ex-convict?

502
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,470
-I can't believe he was an ex-convict.
-Unbelievable.

503
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
-Right.
-I can't believe this.

504
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,610
-Goodness.
-This is awful.

505
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,110
-How could he do this?
-Seriously.

506
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,280
-He killed a boy.
-He's a murderer.

507
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,000
-What are you doing?
-Step aside.

508
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,920
Wait. My son didn't do anything wrong!

509
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,220
How dare you barge into my home
and go through my things?

510
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,010
We received a report your son took bribes

511
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,470
from a medical equipment agency,
so we're investigating.

512
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,930
Please cooperate.

513
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,480
There's no way my son did that!

514
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,850
Get out of my house now!

515
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,190
I found it.

516
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,940
It was under his bed.

517
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,990
Where did he get this money?

518
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,990
What's all that?

519
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,330
I have no idea. Why is that in my house?

520
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,160
Since you don't know,
we'll find out for you

521
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,790
and see what kind of crime he committed.

522
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,210
Get the computer hard drive
and his belongings.

523
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,540
Yes, sir.

524
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,230
Hey, come on. Massage it harder.

525
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,570
-You have to do it harder.
-Let me see.

526
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,360
Once I get released…

527
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,530
Hey, Doc!

528
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,090
I heard about you.

529
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,050
You used to be some hotshot doctor.

530
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,260
Gosh. I can't believe
I'm conversing with a smart guy like you.

531
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,850
-What do you want?
-Gosh. You're one grumpy doctor.

532
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,270
Listen.

533
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,020
You see him over there?
My friend hurt his arm.

534
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,270
I want you to take a look at him.

535
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,490
Talk to the guard.
They will move him to the infirmary.

536
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,860
Goodness. You're dense.

537
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,450
Why would I ask you to take a look
if I can just tell the guard about it?

538
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,870
I'm asking you for a reason.

539
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,750
You don't want to?

540
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,670
I don't know how long you'll be here, Doc.

541
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,670
But if you get on my bad side,

542
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
your hands might pay for it.

543
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,610
Hey. Take him.

544
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,620
Let's go.

545
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,090
Where's the patient?

546
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,930
You must've had your nose in a book
all your life.

547
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,340
You are too gullible.

548
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,930
Gosh. Look at that strong doctor.

549
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,930
Come on. Get him to loosen up.

550
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,230
Yes, boss.

551
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,940
Doc.

552
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,610
Don't resent me.

553
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm doing it to survive too.

554
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,080
Do it.

555
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,620
Who…

556
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,800
Director Gu. How did you get in here?

557
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,340
I asked them for a favor.

558
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,720
I wanted to talk to you in private.

559
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,890
Talk?

560
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,010
Isn't it too late for a talk?

561
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,100
Did you buy off
the head of the infirmary too?

562
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Just like all the witnesses in my trial?

563
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,940
Admit that it was medical malpractice.

564
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,320
If you admit
the medical malpractice charge

565
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,150
and show remorse,

566
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,780
you will lose your medical license,

567
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,280
but…

568
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,370
you won't serve time.

569
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,830
It was Seokju's, wasn't it?

570
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,660
The heart the VIP got that night
was from Seokju, wasn't it?

571
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,670
That's why you wanted me

572
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,630
to do the surgery at Banseokwon.

573
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,380
I don't follow you.

574
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,470
Enough with your nonsense.

575
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,090
Whatever you say,
people won't believe you.

576
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,890
And it won't change the result.

577
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,720
Are you afraid?

578
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,810
That I might reveal the truth?
Are you scared?

579
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,480
Yes. You'll be scared.

580
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,820
I'll tell the world that I was your son's
ghost doctor who operated on VIP patients

581
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,700
and did the transplant
for a patient I didn't know

582
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,820
with a heart
I didn't know where it came from!

583
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,490
I'm going to reveal everything in court!

584
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,450
Go ahead

585
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,290
if you want to get killed without a trace.

586
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,250
Getting rid of you here isn't even hard.

587
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,920
But do you think
your mother will survive that?

588
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,010
What did you say?

589
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,970
Your mother is still on her meds, right?

590
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,720
The prosecutor seized your belongings
and found a bundle of cash in your room.

591
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,980
And your mother passed out.

592
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,860
She's fragile when it's been over a decade
since your father's death.

593
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,280
How will she feel
once she loses her only son?

594
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,780
Can she cope with that?

595
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Shut your mouth!

596
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,120
Leave my mother out of this!
If you don't, I'll kill you!

597
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,040
Do you get it now?

598
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm not the one who should be scared.

599
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,330
It's you.

600
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,170
So give up and do what I say.

601
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,460
Then you'll live.

602
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,630
Both you and your mother.

603
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,890
Stop!

604
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,060
You're the one
who took out Seokju's heart!

605
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,350
You killed Seokju!

606
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,190
Gu Jingi!

607
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,920
Will this be enough?

608
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,130
If you want, we can make it certain
that he never talks.

609
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,890
Although he must hate me,

610
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,890
I owe him.

611
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,710
Thank you, Yihan.

612
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,130
I'm sure Dr. Han will do his best.

613
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,890
So don't worry about anything and wait.

614
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,100
I'll come back with a strong new heart.

615
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,890
The heart the VIP got that night
was from Seokju, wasn't it?

616
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,940
That's why you wanted me

617
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,310
to do the surgery at Banseokwon.

618
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,780
Whatever you say,
people won't believe you.

619
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,150
And it won't change the result.

620
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,700
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER
TO RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY

621
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,920
No visitation allowed?

622
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,760
Right.

623
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,630
He had a huge fight with another inmate.
So he's in a solitary cell.

624
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,050
He had a fight? Why?

625
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,680
We don't know because
neither of the parties is willing to talk.

626
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,560
Anyway, I can't let you see him
according to the protocol.

627
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,560
You're not handling his case either.

628
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,740
Gu Jingi.

629
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,870
Do you get it now?

630
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,540
Gu Jingi.

631
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,910
I'm not the one who should be scared.
It's you.

632
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,420
So give up and do what I say.

633
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,340
Then you'll live.

634
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,590
Both you and your mother.

635
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,800
Stop! Gu Jingi!

636
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,780
CASE NUMBER 2016-2735
OF SINGLE JUDGE DIVISION

637
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,530
HAN YIHAN'S SECOND TRIAL

638
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,040
I plead guilty to the charge.

639
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,670
The patient died

640
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,250
because of medical malpractice on my side.

641
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,050
The patient died…

642
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,510
because of me.

643
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,800
I'm sorry.

644
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,390
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
Your Honor.

646
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,600
As you can see,
the defendant admitted his mistake

647
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,980
and is repenting it.

648
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,110
And the defendant performed the surgery
to treat the patient, not to harm him.

649
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,650
As he clearly showed no intention to harm,

650
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,870
I ask that you take this
into consideration for your ruling.

651
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,120
I will announce the sentence.

652
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,840
The defendant admitted his mistake,
albeit late.

653
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,420
As he performed the surgery
to treat the patient,

654
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,180
it is difficult to find the defendant

655
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,760
with a hostile intent to harm the patient.

656
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,850
Thus, his action cannot be seen
as an intentional injury.

657
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,140
However, the defendant proceeded
with the procedure

658
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,980
that could harm the patient
against the advice

659
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,690
of his fellow medical staff
and caused the patient to die.

660
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,110
Therefore, his action must be punished.

661
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,240
Given the money seized at his house
and his confession,

662
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,740
it is acknowledged that the defendant
illegally received 300 million won.

663
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,700
Thus, the court acknowledges

664
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,830
the indictment brought up
by the prosecutor

665
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,670
and sentences the defendant
to two years in prison

666
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,000
with a two-year stay of execution.

667
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,170
Stop!

668
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,800
Why…

669
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,300
Why did you plead guilty?

670
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,310
You didn't do it.

671
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,440
Seokju didn't die because of you.

672
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,690
You told me to believe you.
Why did you suddenly…

673
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,990
Tell me.

674
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,860
Tell me you didn't kill Seokju

675
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,450
and it wasn't your fault.

676
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,870
Tell me. Come on, do it!

677
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,080
No.

678
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,670
I killed him.

679
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,340
So let's put an end to our relationship.

680
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:19,390
If we stay together,
we will only hurt each other.

681
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,600
I am sorry
that I couldn't keep my promise.

682
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,030
Why…

683
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,780
Why did this happen?

684
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,700
Why did all the people I love…

685
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,670
end up like this?

686
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,800
The defendant won't appeal.

687
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,720
He will accept the judgment of the court.

688
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,270
We could appeal,
but the result won't be different.

689
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,060
Is this the end then?

690
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,770
A person died.

691
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:55,110
Someone died. How can you call it
a mistake and leave it at that?

692
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,410
No.

693
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,700
I can't let it end like this.
I will change it.

694
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,750
If doctors don't get punished for murder,

695
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,630
I will make them pay.

696
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,890
All vital signs are stable.

697
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,180
You will be able
to leave the hospital tomorrow.

698
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,400
Congratulations on acquiring
a young and healthy heart.

699
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,190
Now,

700
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,530
it's time for you to uphold your promise.

701
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,410
Today on Monday, February 7th,

702
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,660
the sky will be clear and blue
for the first time in a while.

703
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,620
FIVE YEARS LATER, PRESENT

704
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,290
When the beautiful weather
lifts up the mood,

705
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,880
why don't you contact those
you haven't heard from in years

706
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:56,760
to ask them how they have been
and tell them that you love them?

707
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,130
SEOKJU, REST IN PEACE AT A GOOD PLACE
I LOVE YOU

708
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,610
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SEOKJU

709
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,820
Seokju,

710
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,030
happy 24th birthday.

711
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,380
Today, there will be a trial for
a fatal medical malpractice at Banseok.

712
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,340
This time, I will make sure
there is proper punishment…

713
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,880
for a murderer…

714
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,220
in the guise of a doctor.

715
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,430
SEOKJU, REST IN PEACE AT A GOOD PLACE
I LOVE YOU

716
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,350
-Doctors aren't gods!
-Doctors aren't gods!

717
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,270
Revoke their license to kill!

718
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,980
-Revoke it!
-Revoke it!

719
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,320
Banseok University Medical Center,
an evil group!

720
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,360
-An evil group!
-An evil group!

721
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,570
Apologize to the public!

722
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:44,490
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

723
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:45,910
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

724
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,580
Our nation will collapse!

725
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,200
-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!

726
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,000
We refuse patients!

727
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,830
Gosh, there are so many protesters.

728
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,460
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

729
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,040
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

730
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,550
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

731
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,920
You must be happy that this became a hit.

732
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,010
A hit?

733
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,050
It's rare for the department
that specializes in medical malpractices

734
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,180
to receive the spotlight
on a national scale.

735
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:13,310
This is like a blockbuster.

736
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,480
The prosecution hasn't done much.

737
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,770
It's all
on Banseok University Medical Center.

738
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,360
People were already talking
about the place,

739
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,240
so the unfortunate accident
added fuel to the fire.

740
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,910
Even if it's a blockbuster,

741
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,700
you should know
that it will be meaningless

742
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,370
if it gets pulled from the theaters
right away.

743
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,290
See you in there.

744
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,580
-We refuse patients!
-We refuse patients!

745
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,420
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

746
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,960
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

747
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,710
Our nation will collapse!

748
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,670
-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!

749
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,510
CASE NUMBER 2022-4210
OF THREE-JUDGE-PANEL DIVISION

750
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,180
We admit to all charges
made by the prosecution.

751
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,970
But medical treatments were administered
to heal the patient

752
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,930
and the doctor had no intention to harm.

753
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,230
Please consider those facts
when you make the verdict.

754
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,400
Your Honor,

755
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,490
the defendant denied the charges
throughout the investigation.

756
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,200
He posted the victim's medical information
on social media to plead innocence

757
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,660
without the slightest show of remorse.

758
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,870
The way he admits to the charges
and begs for a light sentence belatedly

759
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:19,380
is an insult to the court
and everyone here.

760
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,210
Defendant, do you admit to the charges?

761
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:24,420
Yes.

762
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,840
As you can see, he is repentant
because he acknowledges his mistakes.

763
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,680
Also, Banseok Foundation promises
an appropriate compensation

764
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,940
as an ethical responsibility
for leaking the victim's information.

765
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,230
Understood.

766
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,060
Defendant. Please rise.

767
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,110
Defendant. Please rise.

768
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,280
DEFENDANT

769
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,950
I will announce the sentence.

770
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,040
It is recognized

771
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:59,000
that the defendant Park Kitae
neglected his duty of care

772
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,750
to his patient as a doctor.

773
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,670
Accordingly, the court acknowledges

774
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,260
that the defendant Park Kitae
caused the death of the young victim

775
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,890
due to professional negligence…

776
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,890
Thus, the court sentences him
to two years…

777
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,940
Defendant. Are you all right?

778
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,780
Defendant.

779
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,500
Defendant! Defendant!

780
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,790
Please check on him.

781
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,460
Mr. Park Kitae. Can you hear me?

782
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,250
Defendant! Mr. Park Kitae!

783
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,300
-There is no heartbeat.
-What in the world…

784
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,260
AED! Please bring a defibrillator now.

785
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,260
Yes, Your Honor.

786
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,130
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

787
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,420
Dang.

788
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,920
-What about the ambulance?
-I called for it already.

789
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,350
-Is he dead?
-There is no hope.

790
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:39,100
Too much time has passed.

791
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,950
Han Yihan.

792
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,290
What on earth are you doing here?

793
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,920
WE THANK NAM KEEAE AND LEE YUNHUI
FOR SPECIAL APPEARANCES

794
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,260
To be honest, I am surprised.
I didn't expect such a change.

795
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,930
Why are you surprised?
Did you think I would be gone forever?

796
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,890
You made a promise that night.

797
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,470
You will uphold that promise.

798
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,060
A lawyer? How could you defend

799
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,940
a doctor
from Banseok University Medical Center?

800
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,060
Let's keep this professional.

801
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,270
We are only a prosecutor and a lawyer
who met for a trial.

802
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,110
Banseok University Medical Center
received approval to proceed Phase Two.

803
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,570
Honours Hand? A lobbyist?

804
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,780
It's where people
with a demon's tongue and fingers gather.

805
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,450
I am the black-haired foreigner
who works there.

806
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:24,660
I am the head of the Asian branch,
Jayden Lee.

807
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,160
Let's be on good terms.

808
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,370
We will be.

809
