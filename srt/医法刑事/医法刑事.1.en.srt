THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,100
DESPERATE STRUGGLE

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,610
Doctors aren't gods!

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,860
-Doctors aren't gods!
-Doctors aren't gods!

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,360
Revoke their license to kill!

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,320
-Revoke it!
-Revoke it!

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,030
-We refuse patients!
-We refuse patients!

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,860
Stop the coercive investigation!

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,530
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,080
Banseok University Medical Center,
an evil group!

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Apologize to the public!

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,910
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,830
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,630
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,380
Our nation will collapse!

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,840
-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,920
The trial for the Hojun Case is about to…

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,680
Seven-year-old Hojun, who was brought
to the emergency room for rhabdomyolysis,

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,010
died of acute renal failure due to
poor medical treatment by the doctor.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
The conflict between civic groups
and the medical association

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,140
is intensifying over the passage
of the "Hojun Act," which will strengthen

22
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,850
criminal penalties
for medical malpractice.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,480
Dr. Park, who has
repeatedly denied the allegations,

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,070
is said to have admitted to the charge
of his poor medical treatment

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,280
at the trial today.

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,030
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of the Medical Crime Department

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,240
at Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,080
asked for a two-year sentence for Dr. Park
of Banseok University Medical Center,

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
who is accused of professional negligence

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,870
and violation of medical law.

31
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,960
Gu Jingi, director
of Banseok University Medical Center

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,120
and chairman of the foundation,

33
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,710
is likely to replace Lee Giljae,
the former Minister of Health and Welfare,

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,170
who recently resigned on bribery charges.

35
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,630
This is expected to cause a stir.

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,970
As it is a case of public interest,
some predict that the outcome of the trial

37
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,180
may affect the appointment of candidates.

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Defendant. Please rise.

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,700
I will announce the sentence.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,330
It is recognized
that the defendant Park Kitae

41
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,750
neglected his duty of care

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,670
to his patient as a doctor.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,210
Accordingly, the court acknowledges

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,840
that the defendant Park Kitae
caused the death of the young victim

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,220
due to professional negligence…

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,900
Thus, the court sentences him
to two years…

47
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,780
Defendant.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,530
Defendant. Are you all right?

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,130
Defendant!
Please check on him immediately.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,710
Mr. Park Kitae. Can you hear me?

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,760
Defendant! Mr. Park Kitae!

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,600
There is no heartbeat.

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,010
What in the world…

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,270
-AED! Please bring a defibrillator now.
-Yes, Your Honor.

55
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,110
Breaking news by Reporter Ban Soohee.

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,030
Dr. Park, who was on trial,

57
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,740
collapsed due to breathing difficulties
during sentencing

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,450
and is in cardiac arrest.

59
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,400
Cardiac arrest?

60
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,820
The court officer
performed CPR on Dr. Park immediately,

61
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,490
but it seems that
he has not yet regained consciousness.

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,620
The cause of his breathing difficulties
is still unknown.

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,000
The trial against him has been suspended.

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,760
-Quickly.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,440
Please step back.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,570
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

67
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,200
Dang.

68
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,200
-What about the ambulance?
-I called for it already.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,850
-Who is that?
-What?

70
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,240
Han Yihan.

71
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,910
What on earth are you doing here?

72
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,840
What are you doing?

73
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,310
You're not a doctor anymore.

74
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,220
Then, should I just leave him to die?

75
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
Please step aside.

76
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,770
-Who are you?
-I'm his lawyer.

77
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,020
Pardon?

78
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,830
He is breathing!

79
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,460
What's happening to him?

80
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
COUNSEL

81
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,690
Anaphylaxis. It's obstructing his airway.

82
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,980
What's the matter with him?

83
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,670
Please hold this.

84
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,530
Please pour the alcohol.

85
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,200
Hold his head and legs down.

86
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,830
Please hold him down tighter.
He'll die if he moves.

87
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,840
The courtroom is like an operating room.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,140
It may end a life,

89
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,140
or provide a fresh start.

90
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,580
FIVE YEARS AGO

91
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,840
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

92
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,930
All good with the vital signs, right?
Let's stop the pump.

93
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,550
-Clamp.
-Okay.

94
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,600
One, two, three.

95
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,560
Anesthesiologist, please check the valve.

96
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,110
Valve leaflets are working fine,

97
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,230
and there is no paravalvular leak.

98
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,740
Well done.

99
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,620
I see that the aorta is a bit thin.

100
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,250
It may bleed, so press it down well.

101
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,480
Gauze.

102
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,900
One, two, three.

103
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Let’s wrap up. Wiring.

104
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,180
Army Navy retractor.

105
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,610
What are you doing?

106
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,910
Focus.

107
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,000
Gosh, you're so awesome.

108
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,420
How do your fingers move
as fast as Usain Bolt?

109
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,460
That surgery would take four hours
at least. How can you finish in two hours?

110
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,460
The longer it takes,
it puts the patient under extra strain.

111
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,180
Hey man, others don’t take longer
on purpose.

112
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,590
You modest, annoying punk.

113
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,430
You must be a god.
The rest of us are mere human doctors.

114
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,890
He's not just quick. He's also precise.

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,980
Yihan, you're off now, right?

116
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,850
Yes. But I'll still be here,

117
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,400
-so call me if any emergency arises.
-Okay.

118
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,150
To the patient, the long-term outcome is
more important than the surgery duration.

119
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,860
-Please check his condition often.
-Yes, I will.

120
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,740
He is handsome and is always right,
so I can't even complain.

121
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,000
He's going to see Seokju now, right?

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Yes.

123
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,120
Gosh, he has amazing stamina.

124
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,580
He performed
three surgeries back to back today.

125
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,590
But it's an important day for Seokju.

126
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,760
Oh, right. It's an important day.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,470
-Dang.
-Life isn't fair. We have to work hard.

128
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,890
Let's go.

129
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,430
What are you doing?
Good hygiene is a must here.

130
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,320

The second period has ended.

133
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,640
Submit your answer sheet.

134
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,240
How is your condition? Are you okay?

135
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,360
Of course. I am totally fine.

136
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't overexert yourself.

137
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,040
Let me know right away
if you feel shortness of breath or pain.

138
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,250
Of course.

139
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,870
By the way, where is my sister?

140
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,420
She said she would take half a day off.
She isn't here yet?

141
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,050
You are right. She is late.

142
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,880
She must be here.

143
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,430
Where are you?

AMBULANCE

145
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,850
Yihan, I need you to operate.

146
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,480
There is someone we need to save.

147
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,280
He got stabbed in the chest.

148
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,320
He is on his way
to Banseok University Medical Center.

149
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,070
Stabbed?

150
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,950
Switch to video call
and show me the wound.

151
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,120
Okay.

152
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,460
Paramedic, please tell me
about the patient's condition.

153
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,460
He has lost a lot of blood
and his vital signs are very low.

154
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,340
So that his blood pressure won't drop,
we found the vein…

155
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,800
and are injecting IV fluids.

156
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,930
Is there a cardiac stimulant?

157
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,590
Yes. We have epinephrine.

158
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,220
We can't let his heart stop.

159
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,260
Please administer
one ampule through the IV line.

160
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,020
This video is being recorded
and I will take full responsibility.

161
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,140
Okay.

162
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,070
Good job.

163
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,200
Please come to the entrance
of the main building. I will be there.

164
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,030
Not the emergency center,
but the main building?

165
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,750
Yes. I will check up on the patient
and operate myself.

166
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,040
Understood.

167
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,460
Seokju.

168
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,630
Go ahead. I am okay.

169
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,800
Call the medical staff
if you feel the slightest pain, okay?

170
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,680
Don't worry.

171
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,390
I know my heart better than you.

172
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,640
Okay. I will be back.

173
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,520
Good luck.

Lift on the count of three.
One, two, three.

What happened?

179
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,470
He was supposed
to be summoned for an investigation.

180
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,430
When I went to him,
he hurt himself with a knife.

181
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
Call his guardian. We will operate now.

182
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,020
-Okay.
-Yihan.

183
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,230
Yosub, check his blood
and call the operating room.

184
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
Okay.

185
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,070
Blood pressure, 80 over 45.
Heart rate, 145bpm.

186
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,200
Oxygen saturation level, 85%.

187
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,870
-Maintain blood volume.
-Yes, doctor.

188
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,160
Let's make a bypass first.

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,210
If it can't keep up with the blood flow,

190
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,210
we will open up his chest
and add a cannula to the aorta.

191
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,630
Okay.

192
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,310
Doctor, the blood bank
has two bags of Blood Type A left.

193
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,020
We won't have enough blood.

194
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,020
Even with a blood transfusion,
the BP will fall below 50.

195
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,240
He is in terrible condition.

196
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,360
Yihan, will he be able to survive
this surgery?

197
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,740
Don't say that
when the patient is still breathing.

198
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,450
He is barely breathing.

199
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,830
Focus. The surgery has begun.

200
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,460
Going in.

201
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,100
-What's the ACT?
-It's going over 320 seconds.

202
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,860
Start the pump.

203
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,400
The flow is at 50%.

204
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,110
Let's open the chest
and insert a drain to the right atrium.

205
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Skin incision.

206
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,830
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

207
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,550
Remove it on the count of three.
Prepare for bleeding.

208
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,840
One, two, three.

209
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,930
His blood pressure will drop soon.

210
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,820
BP, 70 over 30. It's dropping.

211
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,200
-Shoot in one ampule of epinephrine.
-Epinephrine going in.

212
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,320
Shoot.

213
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,410
It's the left ventricle.
How far did the knife go in?

214
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,780
Suction.

215
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,370
BP, 55 over 35.

216
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,000
Oxygen saturation level, 55%.
They keep dropping.

217
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,370
Give him norepinephrine
and keep checking the vital signs.

218
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,080
-How about blood?
-What we have now is all.

219
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,750
Let's use a suction pump.

220
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,210
-Purse-string suture for the right atrium.
-Okay.

221
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,090
-Help me see it clearly.
-Okay.

222
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Hand me the ACC.

223
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,440
Cardioplegia solution going in.

224
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,620
Forceps.

225
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,040
One more.

226
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,000
A cut on the left ventricle.

227
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,960
It's a miracle he made it this far.

228
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,680
I will suture the wound.
Teflon felt strip, Four Zero Prolene.

229
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,550
BP, 120 over 85.

230
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,840
Heart rate, 70bpm.
Oxygen saturation level, 100%.

231
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,300
His vital signs are good.

232
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Gosh.

233
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,270
You are obstructing my view!

234
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,570
-Suction.
-Suction.

235
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,160
The ST segment is too high.

236
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,660
Give me Isoket and prepare
the rapid infusion system.

237
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,120
-Yes.
-Isoket.

238
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,330
Suction! I can't see anything!

239
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,880
Turn off the music.

240
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,510
-Do a gauze count.
-Okay.

241
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,720
-No more epinephrine?
-That was the last ampule.

242
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,760
I told you to prepare them.
Go and bring more.

243
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes, doctor.

244
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,770
For goodness' sake.

245
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,540
The vital signs are stable.

246
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,790
Han Yihan, you are the best.

247
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,000
You are insane.

248
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,920
The patient had almost encountered death,

249
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,590
but you managed to bring him back to life.

250
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,640
What is this? Who brought a cell phone
to the operating room?

251
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,350
-Wrap it up.
-What?

252
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,810
Take over.

253
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,020
Okay.

254
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,520
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

255
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,020
Close the chest and wrap up.

256
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,980
You were so intent on operating.
You should wrap it up.

257
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,190
Gosh, I am anxious.

258
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
Let's do well.
It's all about mental fortitude.

259
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,950
Focus.

260
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,040
Yihan, what happened?

261
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,910
It ended well.
They are closing up his chest.

262
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,250
His chest? Then it hasn't ended yet.

263
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,080
Another emergency came up.

264
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't worry. Dr. Park is in there.

265
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,420
You should go to Seokju.

266
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,550
He is taking the exam,
so you should be by his side.

267
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,930
Okay.

268
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,720
-I will be there when I am done.
-Okay. Good luck.

269
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,070
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

270
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,260
He must be in trouble again.

271
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,770
Come on! It's slippery here.
Wipe the blood.

272
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,940
BP is 65 over 30.

273
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,310
Oxygen saturation level, 85%.

274
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
-I need more blood here.
-This is all we have.

275
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,490
He's Rh-negative. I barely got three bags.

276
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,400
Put an IV fluid on him!

277
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,110
If his blood pressure drops more,
he'll die!

278
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
-Yes, sir.
-Your call, Dr. Gu.

279
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,240
Should I make an announcement?

280
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,410
He might have a cardiac arrest.

281
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,290
You should at least massage his heart.

282
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,420
Dr. Gu. What do we do?

283
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,210
-Dr. Gu.
-Dr. Gu. Tell us what to do.

284
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,550
-Dr. Gu.
-Dr. Gu!

285
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,670
BP is 50 over 30.
He's about to have a cardiac arrest.

286
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,340
Dr. Gu!

287
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,840
-Dr. Gu!
-Dr. Gu.

288
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,420
How's the patient?

289
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,680
BP, 50 over 20.
Oxygen saturation level, 80%.

290
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,640
His sinus is bad.
He might have a cardiac arrest.

291
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
Push two of epinephrine.

292
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,390
Pushing two of epinephrine.

293
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
-Suction, and start the cell saver.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,860
Doctor! I got it.

295
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,570
Water syringe, please.

296
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,740
Walk me through.

297
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,700
Well…

298
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,830
He was performing
a coronary artery bypass graft.

299
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,750
He must have nicked another vessel.

300
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,620
Micro forceps.

301
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,380
-Keep watering it. Blow it.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,260
Keep suctioning.

303
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,870
Given the amount of blood loss,

304
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,920
he should use a coronary shunt.

305
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
Give me a shunt.

306
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,350
Suture, Eight Zero Prolene.

307
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,410
What a monster.

308
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,710
-Cut it short.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,760
His rhythm is good.

310
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,390
Good work. Thanks to you, the patient…

311
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,490
Good work.

312
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,550
Dr. Gu.

313
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,130
Dr. Gu!

314
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,300
You must perform surgery.

315
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,740
I'll close up his chest.

316
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Where's your head at?

317
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,960
Were you plotting together to screw me?

318
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,250
Never.

319
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,090
"Good work"? You little…

320
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,340
Do you know who our patient was?

321
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,600
He's the father-in-law of the Health
and Welfare Committee's chairman.

322
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,470
He's our biggest VIP patient.

323
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,480
The director's son
personally performed the surgery.

324
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,890
Can't you read what's going on?

325
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,480
Dr. Han was a mere ghost doctor.

326
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,810
How dare you compliment him
in front of Dr. Gu?

327
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,110
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

328
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,530
Keep this in mind.

329
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,650
Dr. Han never set foot in this room today.

330
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,410
Dr. Gu Hyunseong did the surgery
from start to finish.

331
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,330
He saved the patient. Got it?

332
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,790
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

333
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,790
-Clean up and go.
-Okay.

334
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,960
Jeez.

335
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,750
You have five minutes left.
Mark your answers.

336
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,810
KOREAN HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES

337
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm sorry.
The surgery ran longer than I thought.

338
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,950
How's Seokju?

339
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,200
He's fine.

340
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,200
Daewoong came and checked
his vital signs during his break.

341
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,870
His exam is about to end soon.

342
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,190
Kid, are you all right?

343
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,730
Can I get a new answer sheet?

344
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,820
Your answer sheet?

345
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,280
You only have three minutes left.
But shouldn't we get a doctor first?

346
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
No.

347
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,910
Give me the answer sheet now.
Hurry, please.

348
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,830
Okay.

349
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Here.

350
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,380
GEUM SEOKJU

351
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,850
Are you sure you're okay?

352
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,520
Gosh. What should I do?

353
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm…

354
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,690
I'm fine.

355
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,530
I can finish the exam.

356
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
Seokju! Geum Seokju!

357
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,460
Don't come in!

358
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,380
Don't.

359
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,630
If they come in now,
my exam won't count. Right?

360
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,800
That's the rule, but…

361
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,550
I'm fine. Don't come in. Just wait.

362
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,260
-It'll be over soon.
-But you…

363
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,310
Don't worry.

364
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,600
This doesn't even hurt that much anymore.

365
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,060
I can do this. No.

366
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,610
I will do this no matter what.

367
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,950
Seokju.

368
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,160
Seokyeong, I'm sure he'll be okay.

369
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,170
Let's believe in him.

370
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,050
It's over.

371
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,550
Seokju.

372
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,810
Seokju. Are you okay?

373
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,020
Yihan. Please do something.

374
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,350
Seokju.

375
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,230
Seriously. You're so fussy.

376
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,070
I told you I was fine.

377
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,990
Come on.

378
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,700
You idiot!

379
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,620
-What were you thinking? Seriously!
-Hey.

380
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,460
Seokyeong, I'm in pain.

381
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,790
I'm still a patient.

382
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,790
Only when you need to get out of trouble?

383
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,210
You couldn't have been okay.
I bet it hurt like crazy.

384
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,180
You'd better get good grades
after what you just pulled.

385
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,340
Otherwise, we're going to…

386
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,890
Good job.

387
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,730
They are relatively prime,
so you add 17 and 6. And you get 26.

388
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,490
Some of you might think why I ended here
when it's a probability question.

389
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,410
Then you will have to study
about conditional probability.

390
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,990
In conditional probability,
the total number of outcomes is the same.

391
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,830
So you have to remember to…

392
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,500
Seokyeong,
can you pull my ear like before?

393
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,210
What? Okay.

394
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,550
Wait. That doesn't hurt.

395
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,970
I must be dreaming. Yes. This is a dream.

396
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,890
-Hey, pull mine.
-Okay.

397
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,600
-Any pain?
-None.

398
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,060
-What?
-We must be dreaming.

399
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,770
Is it really happening?

400
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,700
Oh, my goodness! You got a perfect score!

401
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,450
You did so well!
I'm so proud of you, my baby brother.

402
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,160
I can't believe this!

403
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,540
-Seokyeong, I got a perfect score!
-Yes.

404
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,000
-Hey, your heart.
-My heart?

405
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,420
Calm down. Don't get excited.

406
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,670
-Whatever! Gosh.
-Gosh!

407
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,880
I don't care if my heart stops beating!

408
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,140
How could I not get excited right now?

409
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,100
Seokyeong, didn't I tell you?

410
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,890
I'll be a med student
at Banseok University.

411
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,890
I'll fix patients
with heart problems like me.

412
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,110
I'm going to be the best
cardiothoracic surgeon like Dr. Han!

413
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,490
Okay. I'm so proud of you.
You did so well, Seokju.

414
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,570
Great job. You were amazing.

415
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,950
Well done. My goodness.

416
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,290
A perfect score!

417
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,250
I bet my brother is the first student

418
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,500
to take the exam in the hospital
and get a perfect score in history.

419
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,590
I saw it, but I still can't believe it.

420
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,590
Can you believe it?

421
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,930
I have news that will make you happier
than Seokju's perfect score.

422
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,390
What news? What is it?

423
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,140
Come on, tell me.
What could possibly make me happier…

424
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,110
No way.

425
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,690
Seokju…

426
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,820
will get a new heart.

427
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,780
The transplant center called this morning.

428
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,870
The donor's family is abroad right now.

429
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,540
So we'll procure the organ
and do the transplant in three days.

430
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,080
I wanted to tell you sooner.

431
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,250
But I didn't want to distract him
before the exam.

432
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,800
We…

433
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,300
We waited too long for this.

434
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,510
It was painful even for me.

435
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,850
Seokju must have been
in so much pain and scared all this time.

436
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,440
That means my brother
will be healthy now, right?

437
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,860
Just like other kids, he can go to school

438
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,400
and make friends too.
He can do all of that, right?

439
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,450
Of course.

440
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,370
I will make it my mission
to get him healthy

441
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,580
and ready to start his semester
at Banseok University in March.

442
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,960
And once he does,

443
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,340
we should…

444
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,810
get married.

445
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,280
You, Seokju, my mother,

446
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,870
and me.

447
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,410
The four of us can be happy together.

448
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,090
Thank you.

449
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,130
Let's be happy for the rest of our lives.

450
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,730
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

451
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,450
-Hello.
-Hello.

452
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,000
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

453
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,370
We had a 130-billion-won deficit
over the last three years.

454
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,090
You spent 200 billion won from
the reserve fund for essential business

455
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,710
to set up
a global research and development center.

456
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,630
But for three years,

457
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,130
the center annually wasted
30 billion won on their research.

458
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,680
Technically, it's an investment,
not a waste.

459
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,020
We can't survive just by treating patients
and performing operations

460
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,640
in the future.

461
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,140
To become a global bio-healthcare company

462
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,900
from a general hospital,

463
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,900
we must enter the medical market in the US

464
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,980
and develop our technology.

465
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,900
No. Hospitals must only focus
on treating the patients.

466
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,910
What are you talking about?
A global company?

467
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,830
The reserve fund
for essential business was meant

468
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,080
to be used to train medical personnel

469
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,080
and to set up the infrastructure.

470
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,750
That's why this fund is exempt from taxes.

471
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,380
You can't treat this fund
like it's your personal asset.

472
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,920
Hey, Jungok.

473
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,380
Are you lecturing me?

474
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,180
We're at an official meeting.
Don't call me by my name.

475
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,180
Address me as the chairwoman.

476
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,100
Director Jang Yoontae.

477
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,730
An official meeting?

478
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,730
Jingi, let's be honest here.

479
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,610
You're using the foundation's money

480
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,650
to set up Banseokwon
and the research and development center

481
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,700
because of your inferiority complex.

482
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,660
You were the first work student
our foundation sponsored.

483
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,910
You grew up in a poor family.

484
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,450
As a man from a humble family,
you have an inferiority complex.

485
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,580
You're the one
with the inferiority complex.

486
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,330
-What?
-You know I'm right!

487
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,800
Father sent you abroad,
so you could become a doctor.

488
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,300
But you kept causing trouble
and couldn't even graduate!

489
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,760
So you never became the chairman
nor the hospital director.

490
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,010
How dare you?

491
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,680
Hey, stop it.
There's no point talking about it.

492
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,140
We'll hold you responsible

493
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,180
for your management decisions
at our next board meeting.

494
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,270
We won't provide you with any more funds!

495
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,980
If you can't cover up the deficit,
be ready to resign from your positions!

496
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,160
They only wasted our funds
with their bad investment calls.

497
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,870
Since when were they interested
in managing the hospital?

498
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,750
Don't they know we made Banseok
one of the top five hospitals?

499
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,290
You had to fix politicians

500
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,800
and rich businessmen's hearts
all these years to achieve that.

501
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,840
They couldn't even squeak
when my father was alive.

502
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,470
How dare they?

503
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,470
I'll meet up with other board members
and try to convince them,

504
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,850
but I'm not sure if it will work

505
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,560
since my brothers probably
got to them already.

506
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,020
See you at home.

507
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,350
Okay. See you at home.

508
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,040
The offer you made.

509
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,410
Is it still on the table?

510
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,090
They got us good this time.

511
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,380
They obviously threw him under the bus.

512
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,800
It's obvious, but it's effective.

513
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,590
Given the chief aide's condition,
even if he recovers,

514
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,890
I don't think we can investigate.

515
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,600
What about
Assemblywoman Yoon Misun's illegal fund?

516
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,100
Our hands are tied. We must close it.

517
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,350
We're not giving up.
We're letting it stew.

518
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm sure you know

519
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,820
some things are bound to get out.

520
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,950
That's a new ring.

521
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,870
Did he propose?

522
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,410
Oh, this…

523
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,500
He told me he would make us happy.

524
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,000
Seokju and me.

525
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,960
So I said yes right away.

526
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
Congratulations.

527
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,170
You will get busy with Seokju's surgery
and wedding planning now.

528
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,760
Hand over this case to me.
I'll wrap it up.

529
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,140
No. I was the one who found this case.

530
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,640
So I'll see it through.

531
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,200
Great.

532
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,110
All the test results look good.

533
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,580
You can get your surgery
in two days as we planned.

534
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,170
That's great. I was really worried.

535
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,790
Why would you worry?

536
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,210
You withstood the long battle.

537
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,010
You just need this surgery, and that's it.

538
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:43,180
Well, now that I'm getting the surgery,

539
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,260
I'm even more nervous.

540
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,350
To be honest,
I've been scared all my life.

541
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,610
I never talked about this
because I didn't want to worry Seokyeong.

542
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,780
But I was scared because I didn't know…

543
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,650
when my heart would stop.

544
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,030
I will be grateful for the rest of my life

545
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,490
and become a good doctor
as well as a good adult.

546
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,290
Thank you so much, Dr. Han.

547
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,040
Thank you, Yihan.

548
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,710
Sure.

549
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,430
Be an excellent doctor and give back
to the world for the rest of your life.

550
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,560
Yes, Director Gu.

551
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,230
Dinner?

552
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Okay.

553
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,030
I'll go to your house. Okay.

554
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,000
Good work yesterday.

555
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,460
Because of my lacking son,

556
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,380
I'm always in your debt.

557
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,180
Don't mention it.

558
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,220
I just saved a patient
as any doctor would.

559
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,310
Seokju's heart transplant surgery
is in two days, right?

560
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,190
Yes. He will now have a chance
to get the transplant surgery

561
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,150
thanks to your support.

562
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,400
Have the surgery at Banseokwon.

563
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,700
I'll settle all the bills. Don't worry.

564
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,790
But…

565
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,710
all the medical expenses
you covered for us…

566
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,420
He's the brother of someone
you deeply care about. Of course, I can.

567
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,340
No need to feel bad. Just accept it.

568
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,710
This is nothing
compared to everything you've done

569
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,470
for my son.

570
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,840
Thank you so much.

571
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,850
-Have a drink.
-Yes.

572
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,560
Hey, come here. Join us for a drink.

573
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,900
I'm tired. I'll get some rest.

574
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,860
Come sit.

575
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,490
You should hear it too.

576
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,130
During the next personnel transfer,

577
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm going to appoint you
as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Yihan.

578
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,180
Father. What are you talking about?

579
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,390
That position should be given to me.

580
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,730
Hyunseong.

581
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,440
You know one's skills are most important
in cardiothoracic surgery.

582
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,400
But…

583
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,780
"I think of you as a son.
I treasure you like my own."

584
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,120
I can't say those things to you.

585
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,450
Because that would be a lie.

586
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,330
In return,

587
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,830
I, Gu Jingi, will repay you

588
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,590
for all the help you've given Hyunseong.

589
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
You should have a drink too.

590
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,680
I hope that I could see the two of you…

591
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,390
lead Banseok…

592
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,980
together.

593
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,940
I'll work harder.

594
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,150
Okay.

595
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,890
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

596
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,100
This is from Director Gu.

597
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,180
It's to repay you for all your help.

598
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,850
Oh, I see.

599
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,730
Please tell him I said thank you.

600
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,480
Okay. Goodbye.

601
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,660
Goodness.

602
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,950
Was he embarrassed
to give it to me himself?

603
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,580
You must be happy.

604
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
You got the position you always wanted.

605
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,080
Of course I'm happy.

606
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,090
We have one of the top cardiothoracic
surgery programs in the world.

607
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,260
Right. He must be so happy too.

608
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,300
I'm talking about your dead father.

609
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,180
Imagine how proud he is.

610
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,100
He wanted to become
Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

611
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,430
so he did an impossible surgery
and killed his patient.

612
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,560
Then he got caught taking bribes,
so he killed himself out of embarrassment.

613
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,060
His son managed to fulfill the dream
he couldn't realize.

614
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,570
Should I say this is moving?

615
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,690
Or should I say it's tragic?

616
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,330
Regardless,
I don't think you're one to talk.

617
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,250
If it wasn't for me,

618
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
you would've killed a lot of patients too.

619
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,790
What?

620
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,050
I get you're mad because I've been chosen
as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

621
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,260
but don't express
your inferiority complex like this.

622
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,300
Or get acknowledged with your talent.

623
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,350
Although it won't be easy.

624
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,390
Bye.

625
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,020
Dang.

626
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,160
Dad!

627
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,290
Dad. No.

628
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,040
No.

629
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,590
No, Dad.

630
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,840
-Honey.
-Dad.

631
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,780
Clean water is seen before us.

632
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,080
Hey. You're home late.

633
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
Did you drink?

634
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,090
Yes. I had a drink with the director.

635
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,750
The director? Why?

636
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,760
He gave me permission to do
Seokju's surgery at Banseokwon.

637
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,680
He's even going to cover the cost.

638
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,390
Oh, my gosh. I'm so grateful.

639
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,140
When I heard the surgery was going to cost
over 30 million won,

640
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,230
I thought that I should help pay for it.

641
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,980
My gosh.

642
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,940
You care more about Seokyeong than me.

643
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,160
I have some more good news.

644
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,750
My angel, Madame Kang, your son is

645
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,710
the new Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery
at Banseok University Medical Center.

646
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,750
The youngest one in its history.

647
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,790
Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

648
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,960
How can you become the head
when Hyunseong is there too?

649
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,760
Your skills are most important
in cardiothoracic surgery.

650
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,800
As for Hyunseong…

651
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,100
I'm sure the director
will give him a better position.

652
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,810
What is it? Aren't you happy?

653
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,650
I'm happy. I really am,

654
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,070
but I'm reminded of your father.

655
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,070
If he was still alive,

656
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,320
he'd be so happy with us.

657
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,960
What a terrible man.
How could he leave us like that?

658
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,290
Goodness, Madame Kang.

659
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,500
Why are you acting like this
on such a happy day?

660
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,470
-Did you take your medicine today?
-No.

661
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,010
When I take it,
my stomach feels uncomfortable.

662
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,600
You should still take it.

663
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,180
I know you still have a hard time
when you think about Dad.

664
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:13,400
If it upsets your stomach,
I'll get you a different prescription.

665
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,380
Is it more than one bottle?
Why is it so heavy?

666
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,720
What is this? Is this money?

667
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,600
I, Gu Jingi, will repay you

668
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,900
for all the help you've given Hyunseong.

669
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,690
When he said repay me, did he mean…

670
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,900
Even still, this is wrong.

671
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,620
I should return this to him.

672
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,090
Good luck with your surgery.
I'll be waiting outside.

673
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,970
It's not like I'm doing anything.

674
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,050
I'll be going to sleep once I'm in there.

675
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,800
I'm sure Dr. Han will do his best.

676
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,970
Yihan.

677
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,690
So don't worry about anything and wait.

678
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,020
I'll come back with a strong new heart.

679
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,320
We'll go in now.

680
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,900
-Please take good care of him.
-I will.

681
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,820
-Good luck, Seokju.
-Bye.

682
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,570
Good luck. Don't worry.

683
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,450
-I'll be back!
-Geum Seokju, you can do it!

684
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,500
Yihan.

685
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,540
Take good care of Seokju for me.

686
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,300
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

687
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,220
No. I'll make sure it's successful.
No matter what.

688
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,520
Good luck.

689
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,000
Hand me the ACC.

690
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,250
ACC is on.

691
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,500
The pump flow is good.

692
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,300
-Daewoong, what's the time?
-It's 12:27 p.m.

693
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,180
I will now extract the patient's heart.

694
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,330
The heart has arrived.

695
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,720
It's 1:21 p.m.

696
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,100
CURRENT TIME
SURGICAL TIMER, ANESTHESIA TIMER

697
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,530
I'll start suturing the left atrium.

698
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,750
CENTRAL OPERATING ROOM

699
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,680
CENTRAL OPERATING ROOM
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

700
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,570
SURGERY IN PROGRESS
PATIENT NAME: GEUM, SURGEON: HAN YIHAN

701
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,790
Raise his body temperature.

702
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,170
Turn on the root vent.

703
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,670
The ACC is coming off.

704
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:52,470
When the body temperature goes up,
start weaning the pump.

705
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,840
Full flow is starting.

706
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,890
The root vent and LA vent
are going on together.

707
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,520
Dr. Lee.

708
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,730
Squeeze the Ambu a few times
and inject the cardiac stimulant.

709
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,140
The stimulant? Okay.

710
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,480
The rhythm is coming back.

711
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,900
His body temperature is back up.

712
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,900
I'll start the weaning.

713
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,740
I'll start the ventilation.

714
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,880
Stop the LA vent. What percent are we at?

715
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,510
The LA vent is stopping. We're at 50%.

716
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,300
The root vent is keeping up
with how much is coming out.

717
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,350
Is there any air in the heart?

718
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,520
How's the left ventricle moving?

719
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,350
The LV wall motion is good,
and I don't see any air.

720
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,270
-Stop the root vent.
-Stopping the root vent.

721
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,900
Stop the pump.
I'll check the drainage now.

722
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,650
I'll give you the sign
for stopping the pump.

723
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,240
One, two, three.

724
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,950
You have the tubing line.

725
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,790
Adjust the meds
according to his condition.

726
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,000
Okay.

727
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,870
Let's focus on controlling bleeds.

728
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,330
It'll be hard if he starts bleeding.

729
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,380
Don't worry. The biggest enemy
of heart surgery is bleeding.

730
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:18,180
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

731
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,270
Dr. Han Yihan has added
another successful case

732
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,900
to heart transplants. Good job, Yihan.

733
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,190
Dr. Park, that's upsetting.

734
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,030
It's not like
Dr. Han did the surgery alone.

735
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,870
I know. We're all standing right here.

736
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,700
Don't be like that.

737
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,240
You guys are the mom and dad of Banseok.

738
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,960
You are the dream team in my heart.

739
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,790
It's thanks to all of you guys too. Right?

740
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,420
Yes. Congratulations!

741
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,800
What's wrong? The surgery went well…

742
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,130
Hold on.

743
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,050
Dr. Lee. Can you check
the pulmonary artery pressure?

744
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,340
Okay.

745
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,350
It's 70 over 50. It keeps going up.

746
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,520
-It's too high.
-Too high? What's too high?

747
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,810
If the pressure is too high,

748
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,860
the right ventricle can't handle it,
and the heart will stop.

749
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,770
BP is 90 over 55. Now it's 85 over 50.

750
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,980
Heart rate is 50.

751
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,240
It's dropping.

752
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,950
The left and right ventricular pressures
might get reversed.

753
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,450
The right ventricle is impaired.

754
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,870
Shoot. What went wrong?

755
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,370
Did we give him too much blood?
Or the meds…

756
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,710
What? Is an anesthesiologist
an easy target?

757
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,380
I was precise.

758
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,050
What should we do? Turn the pump on again?

759
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,300
Dang.

760
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,480
Yihan.

761
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,610
Turn on the nitric oxide to 40bpm.

762
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,740
Bring me a 16-gauge needle.

763
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,290
A 16-gauge?
What are you going to do with that?

764
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,160
I'm going to take blood out
of the pulmonary artery. Hurry.

765
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,250
Hey! If something happens to the patient…

766
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,260
-Another one.
-Shoot.

767
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,430
Hey, Yihan. That's enough.

768
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,810
Another one.

769
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,440
This is dangerous.
Something bad could happen!

770
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,160
Another one. Hurry!

771
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,950
How much are you taking out?
It's already over 400ml!

772
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,870
BP is 80 over 35.

773
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,040
Now it's 90 over 40. It's going up.

774
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,380
Keep reading it to me.

775
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,880
It's 95 over 50.

776
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,010
It's 100 over 60.

777
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,470
It's 110 over 70.

778
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,600
The blood pressure is stabilized.

779
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,800
Let's close him up.

780
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,430
Give me Four Zero Prolene.

781
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,500
Seokyeong.

782
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,250
Yihan.

783
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,050
Don't worry. The surgery went well.

784
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,180
How's Seokju?

785
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,010
He's in an aseptic area.

786
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,480
Then when can I see him?

787
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,600
After an organ transplant,
your immunity is compromised.

788
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,900
So you need to avoid any contact
with the outside.

789
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,780
I know you want to see him,
but wait until he wakes up.

790
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,410
I'll watch over him until then.

791
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,160
Thank you so much, Yihan.

792
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,580
Thank you for everything.

793
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,310
Yes, sir.

794
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,150
The operating room?

795
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,030
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

796
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,760
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

797
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,060
Where's Director Gu?

798
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,270
He's inside.

799
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,700
You're here. Come inside.

800
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,520
Who is that person?

801
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,900
You don't need to know.

802
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,230
He came in three hours ago
from a car accident.

803
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,200
He had a bad heart,
so he was waiting for a transplant.

804
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,700
We removed it,
and he's on bypass right now.

805
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,870
Then…

806
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,120
He won't last long.

807
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,290
He needs a transplant right now.

808
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,330
A transplant?

809
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,460
We don't have a heart,
so how could we do the surgery?

810
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,340
We have a heart.

811
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,610
Sir.

812
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,950
That heart…

813
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,830
Who does it belong to?

814
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,040
WE THANK NAM KEEAE
FOR HER SPECIAL APPEARANCE

815
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,920
Do the surgery for me.

816
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:35,840
I'll assist you.

817
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,050
-Why are you doing this?
-Because it's worth it.

818
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,300
Where are you? We're in trouble.

819
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,430
What's going on? Give me 200 joules!

820
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,350
Dr. Han. His heart might explode!

821
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,680
He passed away.

822
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,560
I'm just telling you the truth
as revealed from the autopsy.

823
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,730
There's no way.

824
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,320
Dr. Han Yihan!

825
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,440
Don't do anything you'll regret.

826
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,190
Nothing you do will matter anymore.

827
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,150
I already have plenty of regrets.

828
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,700
Why are you doing this?

829
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,450
There's a patient I must find.

830
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,410
Then I'll make you admit

831
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,240
that you're a murderer.

832
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,370
Who is that patient
that you're going this far…

833
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,120
Who is that?

834
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,710
