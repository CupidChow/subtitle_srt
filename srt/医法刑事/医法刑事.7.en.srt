1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,848
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,808
The doctor changed.

3
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,678
I remember clearly.

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,978
I saw it and heard it myself.

5
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:15,858
The doctor…
The doctor changed during the surgery.

6
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,478
I think we need the head surgeon here.

7
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:21,398
I told you.
The VIP is here, so he can't come.

8
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:28,658
This is too dangerous.

9
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:31,328
The tumor is in an odd location,
so if we cut it here,

10
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:32,668
we might hurt her nerves.

11
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,538
Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us.
So you won't do a thing?

12
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,418
Will you take responsibility?

13
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,088
Assistant Director, is the patient awake?

14
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,848
That was shocking. Her tape came off.

15
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:52,808
I was frightened.

16
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:55,938
I hoped it was just a nightmare.

17
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:01,858
Does Banseok University Medical Center
know that she remembers

18
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,238
the ghost surgery?

19
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,238
No.

20
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,988
They won't even hear us out.

21
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,488
We went a few times to complain,

22
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:10,788
but they wouldn't even let us in.

23
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,288
That's why we came to see you.

24
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:14,868
What a relief.

25
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,338
Sorry?

26
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,208
We can win this case.

27
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:27,348
Soyeon, from today until your trial,

28
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:31,428
you won't remember that
the doctor changed during the surgery.

29
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:37,688
No!

30
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,068
I saw and heard everything!

31
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:42,028
Plaintiff.

32
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,648
The surgeon in charge wasn't there,

33
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:48,278
and a different surgeon did my surgery!

34
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:53,578
Plaintiff. Calm down.

35
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,918
If you cause any more disturbance,
you will be removed.

36
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,098
Then it must've been a ghost.

37
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,068
A ghost? What kind of nonsense?

38
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,108
The victim saw it,

39
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,408
but no other surgeon did the surgery?

40
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,408
Then the only answer
is that it was a ghost.

41
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:33,198
An operation room ghost
that doctors at Banseok

42
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,328
can't see.

43
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:36,578
This is false information.

44
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,038
Please stop speaking.

45
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:39,248
Sustained.

46
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:42,378
Counsel for the plaintiff.
Please stop and take a seat.

47
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,548
I will prove to everyone here

48
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,258
that the operation room ghost does exist.

49
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,638
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,698
Tell me.

51
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:51,908
Do you still not see him?

52
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:54,328
I see him clearly.

53
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,748
Let me introduce

54
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:05,088
the Banseok University Medical Center
ghost who did Ms. Gil's surgery.

55
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,198
Why are you here?

56
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,788
In this world,

57
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,618
proper doctors
still outnumber those who aren't.

58
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:48,088
Of course, an attorney who only defends
despicable ones wouldn't know.

59
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,388
YIHAN

60
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,068
Yihan.

61
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:13,778
How did you find…

62
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:17,778
I came to have a talk
with the junior I adore.

63
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:25,748
EPISODE 6

64
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:27,748
This is…

65
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,588
Yes, it's a hospital. It's not much yet,

66
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,168
but it's cardiothoracic surgery.

67
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:34,968
Cardiothoracic surgery?

68
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,598
Even university hospitals have a hard time
keeping one. How can you do it here?

69
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,678
Thankfully, I got
all the medical equipment.

70
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,938
All I have to do now is
find trustworthy staff,

71
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,188
someone like you, Yosub.

72
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,618
You operated on Gil Soyeon, didn't you?

73
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,658
How did you know that?

74
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,658
The victim remembers.

75
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,378
She remembers that Gu Hyunseong left
during the surgery,

76
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,128
and another doctor came
and performed ghost surgery.

77
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:17,048
The only one who can be a ghost surgeon
for Gu Hyunseong is

78
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:18,718
just you.

79
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,928
As you know, Lee Dohyung and Cho Junghyun

80
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,558
won't spill the truth.

81
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,308
We need your testimony

82
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,978
to resolve the injustice Ms. Gil faced.

83
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:40,908
And what if

84
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:44,118
I can't be a doctor anymore?

85
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,458
I spent 20 years.

86
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,288
I studied hard since middle school
to get into a med school.

87
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,378
Then I did my internship,
residency, and fellowship.

88
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,418
I held out for 20 years
without taking a moment off.

89
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,508
So if this mistake stops my career…

90
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,478
I know how you feel.

91
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:11,268
Just like you,

92
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,648
I was Gu Hyunseong's ghost.

93
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,318
It must feel unfair and frightening

94
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,738
to have your license suspended

95
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,368
and get kicked out of Banseok.

96
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,168
It might feel like a death sentence.

97
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,208
I felt the same way.

98
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,588
However,

99
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,298
this may be one mistake for us,

100
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:44,218
but to our patients, that mistake

101
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:45,808
lingers forever.

102
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,598
We operate on numerous patients,

103
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,098
but to them,

104
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,688
we are their only surgeon.

105
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,488
You told me

106
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,618
that you hope I continue
to be a cardiothoracic surgeon

107
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,038
even if it isn't at Banseok.

108
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,368
I hope the same for you.

109
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,458
Even if it isn't at Banseok,
I hope you continue to remain

110
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,748
as a doctor.

111
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:31,938
WITNESS

112
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:33,938
Let me testify.

113
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:38,028
I'm the ghost doctor
who performed surgery on Ms. Gil

114
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:41,608
instead of the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Gu Hyunseong.

115
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,988
Are you admitting to your violation
of the Medical Service Act?

116
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:00,298
You're right.

117
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,968
I violated the Medical Service Act.

118
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:06,758
But I was threatened in the process.

119
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:09,258
-Your Honor.
-Stay quiet.

120
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,228
Threatened? Who threatened you?

121
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,478
A man who's sitting here in the audience.

122
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,898
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

123
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,988
-By the assistant director?
-He was threatened?

124
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,368
What is going on?

125
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:34,618
-Sorry?
-What are you looking at? Get to it.

126
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,788
But I can't operate on her
without telling her guardians.

127
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,838
Then will they be happy
if she leaves with her body part cut open?

128
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,548
It was either you
or Director Gu Hyunseong anyway.

129
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:47,848
We're already short of staff,
so we have to make do with everything.

130
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:49,098
Just get started.

131
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:01,108
I couldn't turn it down.

132
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,818
I knew it was wrong,
but the surgery wasn't hard.

133
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,108
I thought I just had to perform it well.

134
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,618
But…

135
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:18,998
But…

136
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:24,208
the location of the tumor was unexpected.

137
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,098
This is too dangerous.

138
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:33,178
The tumor is in an odd location,
so if we cut it here,

139
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:34,638
we might hurt her nerves.

140
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:36,518
Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us.
So you won't do a thing?

141
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,398
Will you take responsibility?

142
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:46,448
Assistant Director, is the patient awake?

143
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,658
That was shocking. Her tape came off.

144
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:56,788
What do we do? What if she heard us talk?

145
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,708
She'll think it must've been a dream.

146
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:02,668
But still…

147
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:03,798
All right.

148
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,088
We have no choice now.
You'll have to do this successfully.

149
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,758
Then everything will be fine.

150
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:17,558
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,938
I went into the OR
before checking her CT scan.

152
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:24,398
I saw the danger
once I checked the location of her tumor.

153
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,108
Yet I did not stop.

154
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:33,028
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,458
Witness, did you write yourself down

156
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,708
as the surgeon in charge
on the surgery record?

157
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,458
No, I couldn't.

158
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:46,958
Why couldn't you?

159
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:49,088
The head of the Banseok Legal Team,

160
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:53,638
Attorney Pyo Eunsil over there
gave me an order to stay silent

161
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,718
on the change of surgeons.

162
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,348
This is slander.

163
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:01,268
The witness is slandering me
with his one-sided account.

164
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,028
According to Article 22, Clause 3
of the Medical Service Act,

165
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,488
when medical records are
different from facts,

166
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:21,618
those who are affiliated
must be imprisoned for up to three years.

167
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,128
That's all for my questions.

168
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:33,218
Defense counsel,
do you wish to question him?

169
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,258
No.

170
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:43,308
The accounts of the witnesses
completely disagree.

171
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:47,108
This means
at least one side gave a false witness.

172
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:49,528
This may be a civil case, but perjury is

173
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:52,608
punished in the same way
as a criminal case.

174
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:55,488
The witness accounts all align

175
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,908
for the staff of the OR
other than Choi Yosub's account.

176
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,748
So isn't it obvious to see
which side committed perjury?

177
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,498
And the account of Choi Yosub,
the sole different one,

178
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,208
aligns perfectly
with the victim's statement.

179
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:11,378
In that case, we have
all the reasons to suspect which side is

180
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,838
trying to cover up the truth.

181
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,268
DEFENDANT

182
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,438
We must come to an agreement.

183
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,688
We'll take a break for 30 minutes.

184
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,818
DEFENDANT

185
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:00,218
Man, what will they do?

186
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,768
Both of you have done very well.

187
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,858
Do you think we can win?

188
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:12,148
It's a 50-50 chance.

189
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,528
Banseok is also prepared well,

190
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:15,648
and above all,

191
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,868
the witness accounts completely disagree.

192
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:36,338
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:40,678
No matter what happens,
I will gladly be punished.

194
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,558
If you tell me to quit being a doctor,

195
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:46,268
I will do that.

196
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:47,938
I mean it.

197
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,478
I am very sorry.

198
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:57,738
Why are you the only one
who's apologizing?

199
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,948
The ones who did worse

200
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:04,118
are making up lies and acting shamelessly.

201
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:08,418
Only you took my side today.
Why are you this sorry?

202
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,078
Why do you apologize?
Why are you bowing your head?

203
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,208
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:17,838
I'm… I'm so sorry.

205
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:20,838
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:28,138
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:31,228
I'm so sorry.

208
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,608
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,588
Man, that idiot.

210
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,918
I told him to keep quiet,
but he just took himself down.

211
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:00,178
Why are cardiac surgeons always like this?

212
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,008
Our hospital is a mess.

213
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,428
You don't think we'll lose. Do you?

214
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,728
Don't worry. It's not like
they have hard evidence.

215
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:11,438
The court won't accept ghost surgery.

216
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,148
What about awareness during anesthesia?
Are you saying they'll accept that?

217
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,608
I put her to sleep
and witnessed that there wasn't a problem.

218
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,818
What now? Do I get punished?

219
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,858
You just said it yourself.

220
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,198
In Korea, awareness under anesthesia
has never been considered

221
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:26,988
medical malpractice.

222
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:31,078
No need to worry
and keep your faces straight.

223
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,078
Let's walk in like winners, not losers.

224
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,628
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

225
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,008
I will announce the sentence.

226
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:44,928
In reflection on the account
of Choi Yosub, the witness,

227
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:49,428
it's evident that
the plaintiff remembers the conversation

228
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,848
only those who were

229
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,438
in the operating room could know.

230
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:58,068
Therefore, the medical malpractice

231
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,278
committed against the plaintiff

232
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:05,868
such as awareness during anesthesia
should be acknowledged.

233
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:09,908
However, there isn't
enough evidence to discern

234
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:14,118
if the medical records were fabricated
and if the surgeon was switched,

235
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:15,998
just as the plaintiff presented.

236
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,458
However, the plaintiff suffered
from medical malpractice

237
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:24,218
during the mediastinal tumor resection
and awareness during anesthesia.

238
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:29,848
The defendant must pay
for restoring thyroid cartilage, recovery,

239
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:33,688
and compensation for her mental distress.

240
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:40,188
Sentence.
The defendant must pay the plaintiff

241
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,568
a total amount of 100 million won.

242
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,178
Isn't this enough for us to say
I won by decision?

243
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,968
Lady, don't you know
what winning by decision means?

244
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,018
You were destroyed by us.
Stop making excuses.

245
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:18,268
You can feel that way
since our malpractice was acknowledged.

246
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,318
But that's not the case for him.

247
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,318
You probably worked hard
to get your hands on the witness.

248
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,658
All such trouble for nothing.

249
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,158
I'm not sure.

250
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,198
I don't think the match is over.

251
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,578
You don't think so?
What brings you here, Prosecutor Geum?

252
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:38,878
I came to watch.

253
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,708
As you know,
I am greatly interested in Banseok.

254
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:45,918
And since I came around to watch,
I was thinking…

255
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,928
of indicting this case.

256
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:55,638
My dear junior, you must be oblivious
due to your lack of experience.

257
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,848
Even if he's found guilty
of switching the surgeon,

258
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,978
he only gets fined
up to three million won.

259
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,978
It's not even a fine. Just a penalty.

260
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,698
Your hard work
won't even put a scratch on Banseok.

261
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,608
I didn't say I'll indict him
over switching the surgeon.

262
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:13,238
He'll be indicted for attempted murder.

263
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,908
What? Attempted murder?

264
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:23,378
He opened up his patient's body
with a scalpel and left the OR.

265
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:25,878
Doesn't that mean he left her to die?

266
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:28,338
Then it's attempted murder.

267
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,088
You psycho.

268
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,428
Do you think that'll work?

269
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:34,808
Why are you so worked up?

270
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:39,638
You can admit it and receive a favor
just like Park Kitae's case.

271
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:41,188
Right.

272
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,648
I bet you can't do that this time.

273
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,688
Because this is
Director Gu Hyunseong of Banseok?

274
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,108
Don't be so cheeky.

275
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:53,368
You barged in to arrest an innocent man
with a false report

276
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:55,198
only to get humiliated.

277
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:56,828
Don't be embarrassed again.

278
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:58,458
Don't worry.

279
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,418
I'll also indict him
for violating the Medical Service Act

280
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,128
and professional negligence
resulting in injury.

281
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:07,588
Those are enough for imprisonment
and revocation of his license.

282
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,888
Yes, the trial is over.

283
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:18,888
Mr. Han works like one of us.

284
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:22,978
He quietly turned a witness for their side
and turned the tables at once.

285
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,778
I knew I chose the right man.

286
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,238
Also, Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong was here.

287
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:31,858
They're leaving together.

288
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,448
-Should I follow them?
-No, just come back.

289
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,578
They haven't spent time alone
in a long time.

290
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,288
You shouldn't interrupt them.

291
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,958
You've watched Banseok R and D Center's

292
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,258
activities and achievements up to now.

293
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:52,678
Now, Ms. Lim Yuna, the new director
of Banseok R and D Center,

294
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:56,138
who will be in charge going forward,
will give a speech.

295
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:57,808
Please give a round of applause.

296
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:19,288
Thank you for welcoming me.

297
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:22,038
I'm the new director
of Banseok R and D Center,

298
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:25,288
Lim Yuna.

299
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:26,838
First, I'd like to thank

300
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,378
and express my respect for
Chairman Gu Jingi for developing Banseok

301
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,468
to be the best medical foundation
in Korea over the past 20 years.

302
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:41,178
We're living in a new era.

303
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,688
Now anyone can extend their lives,
maintain their health,

304
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:48,608
and improve their quality of life
by using medical devices.

305
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:52,278
But I'll not be satisfied with that.

306
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:57,028
Going forward, as the center director,
I'll recruit outstanding talents

307
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:00,288
and make the R and D Center
an incubator to lead

308
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:04,208
future medical technology
through proactive exchanges

309
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,418
with both domestic
and global institutions.

310
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:22,808
It's quite good.

311
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,348
-Can you go say hello?
-Sure.

312
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:33,028
Hello. I couldn't make
a proper introduction earlier.

313
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,188
She is a CEO
of a biopharmaceutical company.

314
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:39,198
Congratulations. I was worried hearing
that the new center director is so young.

315
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,328
What a passionate inauguration speech.

316
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,368
At BioValley in Boston,

317
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,618
startups founded by young CEOs
are already recognized

318
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,118
as unicorn companies
worth trillions of wons.

319
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,048
If we don't want to fall behind them,
we'll need more young talent.

320
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:53,458
Yes, of course.

321
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,588
I'm very much looking forward
to your accomplishments going forward.

322
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:57,968
I'll be rooting for you.

323
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,888
Thank you.

324
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:00,048
-Thank you.
-Sure.

325
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,848
Let's go that way.

326
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,478
Now, the only thing

327
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:09,978
that's really left is
for us to become one family.

328
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,188
Well, there is no reason to rush, right?

329
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,238
It hasn't even been a month yet
since she got back to Korea.

330
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:19,988
She is our precious daughter.
Hope you understand.

331
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:22,618
Yes, of course. I completely understand.

332
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,868
He's my precious one and only son as well.

333
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,458
-Hello.
-Hello, how are you?

334
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,958
Pardon me, Chairman Gu.

335
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,168
Oh, did everything finalize well?

336
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,508
Yes. No, actually…

337
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:40,298
I need to speak to you separately
regarding that.

338
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:45,348
Attempted murder?

339
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:49,098
What do you mean, attempted murder?
How did such nonsense come about?

340
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:50,598
I'm sorry, sir.

341
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:54,398
I've never imagined Prosecutor Geum would
side with a guy who killed her brother.

342
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:57,318
That's why you shouldn't have let it go
all the way to trial!

343
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,738
How could you allow one of our doctors
to take the witness stand?

344
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:04,278
You said it wouldn't matter if the victim
testified since she was delusional.

345
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,538
But nothing got taken care of properly!

346
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:09,578
I'm sorry, sir. I'll correct
the situation at all costs--

347
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,828
Ms. Pyo!

348
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,708
Get out. I can't stand the sight of you.

349
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:15,458
Get out!

350
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,048
Han Yihan.

351
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:24,718
You're causing me trouble in the end.

352
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:50,618
This way.

353
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:58,168
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE

354
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,298
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A LAWYER

355
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,718
AN INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR GU JINGI
OF BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

356
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:48,718
INAUGURATION OF GU HYUNSEONG
AND LEE DOHYUNG AT BANSEOKWON

357
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:56,768
AGE 15, MEDIASTINAL TUMOR RESECTION
AWARENESS UNDER ANESTHESIA

358
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,728
You've been doing all of this alone?

359
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:01,978
I have people who are helping me.

360
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,358
SEOKJU, VIP'S HEART

361
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:13,708
CHEON HYUNGU, BAEK KANGHO

362
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:16,668
PROSECUTOR-IN-CHARGE OF SEOKJU'S CASE

363
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,168
Kangho?

364
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:25,258
When I was held in custody
for Seokju's trial,

365
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:28,888
Gu Jingi hired a convict to assault me

366
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,968
and threatened to kill my mother

367
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,138
unless I admit to
breaching the Medical Service Act.

368
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,808
-What?
-If I hadn't admitted that way in court,

369
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,188
I doubt
I would've come out of there alive.

370
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,818
Baek Kangho,
the prosecutor who charged me,

371
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,318
is working with Gu Jingi.

372
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:02,548
It's 300 million won in cash.
We found it in your room.

373
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,588
Your medical license will be revoked
for pocketing the bribe.

374
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:09,088
If you feel even the slightest remorse
for Seokju's death,

375
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:11,098
admit the medical malpractice charge
and ask for forgiveness.

376
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:12,848
You're not even asking

377
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:15,558
why my face is all beaten up.

378
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:18,848
Why are you doing this?

379
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,478
You're not even listening to me.

380
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:26,108
Why are trying to blame me

381
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:29,778
for Seokju's death?

382
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,368
Look, Mr. Han Yihan.

383
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:36,788
Do I look like a lawyer to you?

384
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,498
I'm here to reveal your crime.

385
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,458
Other than the fact
that you're a criminal,

386
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:43,588
it has nothing to do with me
if you get hurt,

387
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:45,878
broken, or killed.

388
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,878
Got that?

389
00:27:58,678 --> 00:27:59,768
No way.

390
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:06,028
Kangho would never do that. I know so.

391
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:10,318
If someone who would never do
such a thing actually did so,

392
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,068
there must be another reason.

393
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,828
But why?

394
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:19,618
I don't understand it
no matter how hard I think about it.

395
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,458
Why would Gu Jingi
go out of his way to put a blame on you

396
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,168
and kill Seokju to take away his heart?

397
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:32,638
Answer me.

398
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,508
You promised to be honest
and tell me everything.

399
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,058
Why? Why in the world did he do that?

400
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:42,098
Explain so that
I can understand and believe it!

401
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,698
I said in court there is a ghost doctor at
Banseok University Medical Center, right?

402
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,538
Five years ago,

403
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:00,868
that was me.

404
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:05,588
-What?
-For many years,

405
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,708
I performed surgeries
on numerous patients as a substitute.

406
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:12,678
In order for Gu Hyunseong to become
the next director of the hospital,

407
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:16,348
he needed performance records
of operating on VIP patients.

408
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19,098
And as a part of the compensation,

409
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:24,848
I got to operate on Seokju at Banseokwon.

410
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:40,118
The night that I performed
the heart transplant on Seokju,

411
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:45,918
a VIP with a concealed identity
was rushed over to Banseokwon.

412
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:52,128
The patient's heart was already removed,
so a transplant was needed immediately…

413
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:57,798
and Gu Jingi brought a heart.

414
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:07,978
Then, that heart was…

415
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:14,698
You're right. I was deceived by Gu Jingi…

416
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:21,288
and transplanted
Seokju's heart on the VIP patient.

417
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:31,628
How could he…

418
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:34,878
How could he do that…

419
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:37,588
as a human being?

420
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:45,768
You're lying, right?

421
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:47,898
How could a doctor…

422
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:52,108
I mean, a human being…

423
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,238
A human being shouldn't do such a thing.

424
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,698
It just doesn't make sense!

425
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,538
I am sorry.

426
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:05,498
Had I known…

427
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,288
Had I stopped the surgery,

428
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,048
Seokju and my mom…

429
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,468
would still be by our sides.

430
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,468
I am sorry.

431
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:24,888
I am sorry.

432
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,278
Why are you looking at me like that?

433
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:18,818
You are wearing the earrings.

434
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:21,318
I promised to wear them
for the inauguration.

435
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:23,198
And the other side?

436
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,158
The other one?

437
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:29,788
-What do you mean?
-The other earring.

438
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:31,328
Are you wearing it?

439
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:35,378
Of course. Who wears one earring?

440
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,258
Then show me the other one.

441
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,968
Can't you do it?

442
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:00,988
Why are you being scary?

443
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:05,408
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

444
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,198
I behaved strangely, right?

445
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,908
Yes. Very strangely.

446
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,128
But I will forgive you
since today is a good day.

447
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:18,088
You should cool off.
I will change my hairstyle

448
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,588
so that both earrings show.

449
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:22,338
Okay. Thank you.

450
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,098
That punk. How dare he toy with me?

451
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,698
Thank you.

452
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,028
Thank you.

453
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:30,408
Why didn't you tell me?

454
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,538
When you got out of the detention center
five years ago,

455
00:34:35,788 --> 00:34:38,128
you should have told me the truth.

456
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:42,128
You wouldn't have believed me then.

457
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:46,088
Besides, I couldn't give an excuse.

458
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:49,138
It's true that Seokju died

459
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,138
because of my wrong decision.

460
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,018
I don't ask for forgiveness.

461
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:58,808
I will also pay my dues
once everything is done.

462
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,958
Welcome.

463
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:38,228
I am sorry
that I wasn't at the inauguration.

464
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:42,308
I didn't want
to make the situation messier.

465
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:45,778
How did Gu Hyunseong react?

466
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:47,948
You were right.

467
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,198
He asked to see the other one,

468
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,368
so I let him do that.

469
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:00,668
A prosecutor was here.

470
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,378
A prosecutor? What do you mean?

471
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,838
Gu Hyunseong was here with a prosecutor.

472
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:09,758
I think he figured out
that we were together.

473
00:36:10,678 --> 00:36:11,508
How…

474
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:14,718
Don't worry.

475
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:18,728
If you do as I say, nothing will happen.

476
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,898
Actually, he will come to trust you more.

477
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:24,188
How did you prepare it?

478
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,398
Neither one of us knew
that Hyunseong would show up.

479
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:30,648
How did you prepare the earrings?

480
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:32,408
I didn't prepare them.

481
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:34,868
Things simply worked out.

482
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,188
My goodness.

483
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:09,988
I thought hard about
which presents would be meaningful to you,

484
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:11,528
the woman who has all.

485
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:14,568
I never imagined such a thing.

486
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:19,498
I bought the same earrings
as the ones Gu Hyunseong gave you.

487
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,328
I didn't want
to see you wearing a present from him

488
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,208
when you were with me.

489
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,008
You always exceed my expectations

490
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:41,348
and amaze me.

491
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:05,038
Don't take action
no matter how he provokes you.

492
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:07,328
I understand.

493
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:17,008
Only the two of you can go in.

494
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:20,178
Okay. Wait at the door.

495
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:21,848
Yes, sir.

496
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,548
-What are you doing?
-Hold on.

497
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,048
We will be done soon.

498
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:22,948
Michael started the Queen's Gambit.

499
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,248
It's daring and sharp.

500
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:29,208
It's the gambit
that is best suited for the king.

501
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,208
However…

502
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:49,268
When the gamble fails,
you must pay the price.

503
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:56,398
How should we pay the price?

504
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:07,158
Restore Han Yihan's medical license.

505
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:12,288
If you decline, Honours Hand will sue.

506
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:14,748
The terms of the stock return
we agreed upon

507
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:17,258
will be called off as well.

508
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,678
It's a simple matter,
but I am curious about the reason.

509
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,388
Why do you ask for such a thing?

510
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:26,218
The reason.

511
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:30,938
Use your imagination

512
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,308
until we meet again.

513
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:42,448
We can't do as he says!
Yihan shouldn't hold the scalpel again!

514
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:43,818
No need to make a fuss.

515
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:48,078
What he asked for was unexpected,

516
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:50,248
but it's a cheap price to pay.

517
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:52,038
-But--
-Don't worry.

518
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:55,038
Han Yihan will never become a doctor

519
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,798
again.

520
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:06,638
Why did you do that?

521
00:41:08,138 --> 00:41:10,058
You could have asked for something bigger

522
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,848
after a performance like this.

523
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:15,148
The piece that determines the game
is the king.

524
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,228
But why is the queen stronger?

525
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:20,528
Because the king needs someone
to fight for him.

526
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,318
Let me get this straight. That lawyer guy

527
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:27,198
will be your queen?

528
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,658
No.

529
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,248
Yuna is the queen.

530
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:35,708
My lovely partner
who will support me by my side.

531
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:38,168
Han Yihan is my knight.

532
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:42,258
And a curveball
you don't know where it will go.

533
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:44,258
Doesn't this look fun?

534
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,598
The man Chairman Gu Jingi feels
the most threatened by

535
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:48,718
will be my black knight.

536
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,578
Prosecutor Geum.

537
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:13,908
Nam Hyukchul is waiting
in the interrogation room.

538
00:42:14,038 --> 00:42:16,288
Oh, right. Yes.

539
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:17,918
Let's go.

540
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:21,918
Lawyer Han Yihan.

541
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,628
If you want to talk to me,
bring him to me.

542
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:27,678
Why do you want a lawyer all of a sudden?

543
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,768
You said you killed him
because you didn't want to go down alone.

544
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,178
I thought I did.

545
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,058
But I changed my mind.

546
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:38,188
The murder case six years ago.

547
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:39,768
I'll file an appeal.

548
00:42:40,478 --> 00:42:41,478
File an appeal?

549
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:43,488
But why do you want Han Yihan?

550
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:45,398
I may be locked up, but I still have ears.

551
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:48,318
He won the trial against Banseok.

552
00:42:48,658 --> 00:42:50,578
I can only trust
competent lawyers like him.

553
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:55,578
What? This isn't bad news to you either.

554
00:42:56,668 --> 00:42:58,168
Once my appeal goes through,

555
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:01,628
you will get to hear all the dirty laundry
Banseok is hiding.

556
00:43:06,048 --> 00:43:07,548
I don't think I can do that.

557
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:11,008
You're a death-row convict
who killed two doctors from Banseok.

558
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,308
Why would I bring in a lawyer
who used to be a doctor at Banseok?

559
00:43:15,098 --> 00:43:17,018
What if he becomes the third victim?

560
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,518
Who will take responsibility?

561
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:19,938
I won't kill him!

562
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,438
I want to put an end
to this sickening prison life I have.

563
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,398
You can talk all you want,
but you're not getting him.

564
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:30,618
So tell me if there's any truth
you've been holding back.

565
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:33,078
Or you can get a public defender.

566
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:38,418
What are you doing?

567
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,578
You're crazy.

568
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,918
-Get me Han Yihan!
-Hey, get your hands off her!

569
00:43:47,218 --> 00:43:48,428
Or I'll kill you too!

570
00:43:48,508 --> 00:43:51,008
I'll kill you and myself next. Okay?

571
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:53,758
Go ahead if you can.

572
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:58,058
Get your hands off her!

573
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,058
-Darn it.
-Prosecutor Geum.

574
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:02,228
Are you okay?

575
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:04,728
I'm fine. Call an ambulance first.

576
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:08,738
And keep an eye on him,
so he doesn't try anything stupid thing.

577
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:10,158
-Yes, ma'am.
-Darn it.

578
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:12,448
I…

579
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:19,118
Are you okay?
You should go to the hospital.

580
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,628
I'm good. This is nothing.

581
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,748
That crazy punk. He wants to appeal now?

582
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,838
So he wanted Han Yihan?

583
00:44:29,048 --> 00:44:32,178
Yes. He said he wouldn't talk
without Han Yihan.

584
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:37,428
We have no choice. Give him what he wants.

585
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,808
Han Yihan will decide
if he wants the case or not.

586
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:42,148
He needs a lawyer anyway.

587
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:48,278
What? Is it uncomfortable to talk to him?

588
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,318
No.

589
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:53,238
I'll talk to him.

590
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:00,958
Jayden Lee.

591
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:03,378
He was the first Korean American to become

592
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,378
the head of the Asian branch
at Honours Hand five years ago.

593
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,878
When Banseok Foundation
acquired a hospital in California

594
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,508
and set up the R and D Center,

595
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:11,508
Honours Hand invested 300 billion won.

596
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:13,888
Three hundred billion?
How do they have that much money?

597
00:45:13,968 --> 00:45:16,678
The company manages enough funds
that could run an entire country.

598
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,308
He invests aggressively.
His mergers and acquisitions are hostile.

599
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:21,688
He does whatever it takes
to lobby his cause.

600
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:24,518
He's known as a notorious lobbyist
in the industry.

601
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:27,188
It's the biggest private equity firm
in the world.

602
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:28,318
No way.

603
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:30,278
Yihan, we should ask a lot for our fee.

604
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,358
How about 100 million won?
No. A billion won?

605
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:34,448
No. I won't ask for money.

606
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:36,198
What? Why not?

607
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:39,618
He promised to restore my medical license

608
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,448
and provide us with medical equipment.

609
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:44,498
He will give us what I need the most.

610
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,838
-Restore your license?
-But how is that possible?

611
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:48,838
Gu Jingi of all people is stopping it.

612
00:45:49,048 --> 00:45:50,128
We'll see.

613
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:54,508
We also need to check
how competent they are.

614
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:58,718
If he can't get that from Gu Jingi,
we don't need to work with him.

615
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:01,598
Gosh.

616
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,098
Lim Yuna.

617
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:06,478
She's the only child of Im Taemoon,
the former ambassador to the US

618
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,518
who will run for president next.

619
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:10,028
She's gorgeous.

620
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:13,278
Her mother is Kim Sunhee.
She's currently a diplomat.

621
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,908
She chairs the UN Human Rights Council
and is an ambassador to Geneva.

622
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:22,328
Lim Yuna majored in medical engineering
at Johns Hopkins University.

623
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:25,168
And last year, she worked
as the youngest senior researcher

624
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:27,668
at a global biotech company
at BioValley in Boston.

625
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:30,338
She was recently scouted as the director
of Banseok R and D Center.

626
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:33,088
As the director?
Isn't she too young for that position?

627
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:36,338
She can if she plans to marry his son.

628
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:40,058
She's dating Gu Hyunseong
with marriage in the future.

629
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:42,138
I guess some people already know.

630
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:44,848
Rumor has it that they will announce
their engagement soon.

631
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:48,398
But this lady is seeing Jayden too?

632
00:46:48,518 --> 00:46:51,268
What is this?
The fiancée of Bankseok's heir

633
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:55,028
is having a secret affair
with Banseok's business partner?

634
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:58,618
Gosh. This is
a crazy soap opera in action.

635
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:08,918
What? Hey.

636
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:13,588
We need to meet now.

637
00:47:13,668 --> 00:47:15,588
I need to talk to you about Nam Hyukchul.

638
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:17,628
I'll go to your office.

639
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:21,758
I'm not alone here.

640
00:47:21,848 --> 00:47:23,218
Then come to my house.

641
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:25,888
-Your house?
-Yes.

642
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:27,938
Hurry. It's important.

643
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:29,308
Okay.

644
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:32,318
Is it Seokyeong?

645
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:35,488
Yes.

646
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:37,448
She needs to talk to me
about Nam Hyukchul.

647
00:47:37,528 --> 00:47:38,778
I'll be back.

648
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:27,158
Seokyeong.

649
00:48:27,498 --> 00:48:28,908
Ta-da!

650
00:48:29,538 --> 00:48:30,998
You startled me.

651
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:34,748
Here.

652
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:36,588
What? Are they for me?

653
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,088
Thank you.

654
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,228
I'll make a wish.

655
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:58,188
Let's blow them out together.
One, two, three.

656
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:01,778
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

657
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:03,408
Happy birthday.

658
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:10,498
What are you doing?

659
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:14,378
Come in. It's fine.

660
00:49:15,628 --> 00:49:16,588
Okay.

661
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:24,338
Do you want coffee? I have tea too.

662
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:26,758
I'm fine with anything.
I'll have what you're having.

663
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:09,638
I took it out yesterday.

664
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,308
I had a lot on my mind
after hearing about Seokju.

665
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,598
I found it
when I was going through my stuff.

666
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:26,028
Nam Hyukchul asked to hire you
as his lawyer.

667
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:30,198
He wants to appeal against the sentence
of the murder case from six years ago.

668
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,248
-Appeal?
-Yes.

669
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:37,498
He said he wouldn't hire anyone else.

670
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,498
He said it had to be you.

671
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:42,048
He bit up his hand
and created a scene by harming himself.

672
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:45,338
Well, I'm suspicious of his intention.

673
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:47,178
But I thought I should tell you at least.

674
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:49,598
Could this be a trap?

675
00:50:51,638 --> 00:50:53,888
Even if it's a trap, I can't avoid it.

676
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:58,858
Don't worry. I won't jump in recklessly.

677
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,438
Even a murderer

678
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:05,818
must cherish his family.

679
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,538
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE
RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS

680
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,958
-Is this a photoshoot?
-Pardon?

681
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:24,628
Why are you trying to look pretty?
It's not a photoshoot.

682
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:28,678
Since it's a dummy, not a real patient,
you think you can just pretend to do it?

683
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:30,888
-I'll deduct a point.
-Wait.

684
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:33,808
And what kind of nurse would stop
compression while performing CPR?

685
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:35,428
I'll deduct three points.

686
00:51:35,518 --> 00:51:38,188
Wait, Professor! I can keep going.

687
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:41,478
What's the point?

688
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:43,358
The patient already has a cardiac arrest.

689
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:45,608
To recover your points,

690
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:48,738
you should have used a defibrillator
instead of continuing with CPR.

691
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,198
-Professor, I have a question.
-Okay.

692
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:55,408
When the patient has a cardiac arrest,

693
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:59,288
if you compress harder,
wouldn't the heart start beating again?

694
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,748
You must watch a lot of TV shows.

695
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:04,548
What? Should we punch the heart
with our fist next?

696
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,588
Like this. Like some cool doctor?

697
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:09,088
It's not impossible.

698
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:14,558
Shocking the heart is
also a part of Advanced Life Support.

699
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:18,308
Then have you done it yourself too?

700
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:20,348
Several times.

701
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:23,108
In the field, it's very common

702
00:52:23,188 --> 00:52:25,608
to break the patient's ribs during CPR.

703
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:29,068
Sometimes, you can feel their hearts
with your fingertips.

704
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:31,408
But despite that,
if you fail to save the patient,

705
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:32,778
you will feel hopeless.

706
00:52:33,368 --> 00:52:35,618
And you'll never get used to it
no matter how many times you feel it.

707
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:40,248
This process may traumatize
some of you here.

708
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:43,878
But remember
that we're medical professionals.

709
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,508
If there's even a one-percent chance
that their hearts can beat again,

710
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,968
we never give up on our patients.

711
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:24,128
Who is it?
We're in the middle of our lecture.

712
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,458
Turn off your cell phone.

713
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:42,478
You…

714
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:45,978
Let me ask you a question too.

715
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:48,648
Have you ever done a surgery

716
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:51,858
where you implant a heart
that was implanted in someone else?

717
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:55,368
You must know better than anyone

718
00:53:56,618 --> 00:53:58,528
that it's not possible.

719
00:54:02,328 --> 00:54:05,998
We did it together five years ago
with Seokju's heart.

720
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,508
Should we continue here? It's fine by me.

721
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:26,478
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY IN NURSING DEPARTMENT
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

722
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:27,858
Should I congratulate you?

723
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:31,108
You became a professor after becoming
the head of the nursing department.

724
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:34,198
You achieved everything
you could as a nurse

725
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:36,448
as a reward for killing a patient.

726
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:39,738
You killed him.

727
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:43,828
You're a criminal who lost your license
for violating the Medical Service Act.

728
00:54:43,908 --> 00:54:45,038
How dare you come here?

729
00:54:50,878 --> 00:54:51,838
Don't come near me.

730
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:54,218
Stop. I said stop!

731
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:58,338
Couples become more alike.
You act just like your husband.

732
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,218
-What?
-I'm sure you know

733
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:03,098
your ex-husband, Nam Hyukchul,

734
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,808
killed Park Kitae on Gu Jingi's order.

735
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,598
I know nothing about this.

736
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:11,818
I already ended things with my husband.

737
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:13,898
I never knew anything about it,
and I still don't.

738
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:16,318
-I don't know anything!
-Nam Junhwan.

739
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:22,948
A 19-year-old boy.

740
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:26,788
He had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
at the age of 11.

741
00:55:27,078 --> 00:55:29,748
He was treated by an internist
with medication at Banseok for years.

742
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:34,958
Gu Jingi gave him

743
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:38,428
expensive new drugs that weren't
covered by the insurance for free.

744
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,258
So his symptoms improved
without any transplant surgery.

745
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:49,848
And I looked into the new drugs.

746
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:52,818
Patients show great improvement
in the beginning.

747
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:56,438
But once they develop tolerance,
when they relapse, the symptoms get worse.

748
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,658
Your son who had to be
readmitted to the VIP room

749
00:56:01,948 --> 00:56:03,368
makes a good example.

750
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:06,498
So what? Are you here to gloat?

751
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,158
That I deserved it?

752
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:11,878
No. You will have to face
the consequence of killing Seokju.

753
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,628
Not your innocent son.

754
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,298
Then what do you want from me?

755
00:56:17,008 --> 00:56:18,718
I'm interviewing Nam Hyukchul tomorrow

756
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:20,468
at the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

757
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:25,388
Persuade him to tell the truth.

758
00:56:25,638 --> 00:56:27,018
Then I will

759
00:56:28,728 --> 00:56:30,018
save your son.

760
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:50,708
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

761
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:15,358
It's been a while, Mr. Han.

762
00:57:18,398 --> 00:57:21,778
If you're my lawyer,
shouldn't you sit next to me?

763
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:23,818
I'm not your lawyer yet.

764
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:25,908
You haven't signed any contract yet.

765
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:28,118
You're hurting my feelings.

766
00:57:28,288 --> 00:57:30,368
I was going to share
some stories with you.

767
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:35,418
Do prosecutors attend
the meetings with my lawyer?

768
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:38,458
This breaks the confidentiality clause.

769
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:41,968
-I want you to leave us in private.
-I'm not falling for that.

770
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,548
Why would I leave you alone with him?

771
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:48,178
Did you forget this crazy stunt
you pulled on me?

772
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:51,098
Suit yourself.

773
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:54,438
I'm demanding my rights as the defendant.

774
00:57:56,648 --> 00:57:57,938
With you here,

775
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:02,318
I won't tell you anything.

776
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:06,988
It's fine.

777
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:08,698
Leave us in private.

778
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:12,748
-But--
-He said it's fine. Okay?

779
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:16,708
Do you think I'd kill him like this?

780
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,588
Be careful. I'll be right outside.

781
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:44,448
Now, talk.

782
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,948
What do you want to say to me
about the case from six years ago?

783
00:58:55,038 --> 00:58:55,958
Sorry.

784
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:59,288
I didn't want to do this to you.

785
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:01,628
What?

786
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:12,348
VIDEO RECORDING ROOM

787
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,728
Nam Junhwan.

788
00:59:21,148 --> 00:59:24,028
If you stab me now, your son will die too.

789
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:26,238
How did you…

790
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:28,528
Nam Hyukchul.

791
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:30,698
Drop your weapon.

792
00:59:31,778 --> 00:59:34,538
Answer me. How did you know about my son?

793
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:36,038
How could I not?

794
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:38,828
He's the only child
between you and your wife.

795
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:41,748
Three years.

796
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:45,258
That's how long it took
for Seokju to find a donor.

797
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:49,178
Do you think
your son could wait that long?

798
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:53,008
I can save

799
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:55,268
Nam Junhwan.

800
00:59:58,058 --> 00:59:58,978
Nam Hyukchul.

801
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:02,358
Three years?

802
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:05,188
-He doesn't have that much time.
-Nam Hyukchul!

803
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:06,488
That's why

804
01:00:07,488 --> 01:00:10,198
-I have to kill you!
-Nam Hyukchul!

805
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:57,238
Do you think
Nam Hyukchul will do what we want?

806
01:00:57,328 --> 01:00:58,408
We should hope so.

807
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:00,408
The man I want to spend
the rest of my life with

808
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:02,958
isn't the Director
of Planning and Coordination.

809
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,878
Are you asking me to become
the chairman of the foundation?

810
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,668
I'm asking you to surpass that position.

811
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:08,128
Surpass even your father.

812
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,338
I found something interesting.

813
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:11,928
Where did you find this?

814
01:01:12,008 --> 01:01:14,888
I didn't expect much.
But I hit the jackpot.

815
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:17,848
Then does it mean
this person took Seokju's heart?

816
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:19,928
You and the deputy chairman
will meet again at last.

817
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:21,438
I'm getting excited for you.

818
01:01:21,938 --> 01:01:24,148
It's your turn to empty it out.

819
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:26,568
I knew it. I can never predict his moves.

820
