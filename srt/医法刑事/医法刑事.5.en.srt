1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,884
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,108
I knew you'd come.

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,279
Han Yihan!

4
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,301
You needed a doctor, not a lawyer.

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,636
A doctor who would never speak
of what happened to anyone.

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,959
Mr. Han. Hurry.

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,919
I'm fine,
so please take care of her first.

8
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,499
She hit her head on the table as she fell…

9
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,667
Which drug was it?

10
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,758
I was going to enjoy it just a little,

11
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,847
but it was different from my usual one,
I couldn't control it.

12
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,806
What's the patient's name?

13
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,270
Yuna. Lim Yuna.

14
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,153
I'll leave the rest in your hands.

15
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,618
Ms. Lim Yuna, if you can hear me,
please squeeze my hand.

16
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,704
You can feel my hand.

17
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,334
This time, can you squeeze it
a little harder so that I can feel it?

18
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,625
Can you do it?

19
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,917
Great. Good job.

20
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,842
Then now, can you look at me?

21
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,014
Look at me. Look me in the eye.

22
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,849
Good. Don't worry and rest now.
Everything will be fine.

23
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,072
Is she all right?

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,780
I need a few things.
Please get them for me right away.

25
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,195
EPISODE 5

26
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,037
My beautiful,
your hands are full of blisters.

27
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,286
I told you not to give massages yourself.
Ask your subordinates!

28
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,339
But the VIPs only ask for me.
What can I do?

29
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,842
-Jeez.
-So when will you open my own shop for me?

30
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,264
Gosh, wait just a few more months.
Okay, my beautiful?

31
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,934
Once the new drug is approved,

32
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,266
I'll become a rich man too
with tens of billions of won in stocks.

33
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,689
-One second.
-Who is it? Your wife?

34
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,806
I said, don't pick it up
when you're with me.

35
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,227
Hush.

36
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,818
It's a VVIP.

37
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,907
This is Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

38
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,491
Hemodialysis machines?

39
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,115
Right here.

40
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,831
Why do you suddenly need
hemodialysis machines?

41
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,250
You may go now.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,996
Don't you need a nurse?
Do you know how to use it?

43
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,257
I'll be fine.

44
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,299
And you can never ever tell anyone
about this.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,432
It sounds more suspicious
now that he tells me not to tell anyone.

46
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,269
Cho Junghyun,
the head of the nursing department.

47
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,648
She's a veteran who has worked
only at Banseok for almost 30 years.

48
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,441
She must be a remarkable nurse for sure

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,196
given that she's worked together with
Director Gu Jingi for almost 20 years.

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,073
What about Nam Hyukchul's
visitation records?

51
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,315
There is none.

52
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,486
He's an only child
and his parents passed away already.

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,615
No one has visited him
for the past few years.

54
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,157
That's very convenient.

55
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,417
Pardon? What's convenient?

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,170
He's got nothing to lose.

57
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,420
He has the perfect profile
to be hired as a contract killer.

58
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,094
Contract killer?

59
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,171
Who would've done such a thing?

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,889
Hello. Geum Seokyeong speaking.

61
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,434
<i>Is this Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of Medical Crime Department</i>

62
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,518
<i>at Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?</i>

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,645
Yes, this is she. How may I help you?

64
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,065
<i>I'd like to report something.</i>

65
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,985
<i>Someone is doing drugs at Banseok.</i>

66
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,784
NO CALLER ID

67
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,825
Did you say "drugs"?

68
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,078
<i>Please go to the penthouse of Banseokwon.</i>

69
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,964
<i>You will find a young man
and a woman wasted on drugs.</i>

70
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,075
<i>Please hurry.
Someone's life depends on it.</i>

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,790
Hello?

72
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,297
What? Drugs?

73
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,796
It happens to be Banseok again.

74
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,721
Do you think it's really happening?

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,050
What nonsense. It's clearly a prank call.

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,796
-I need to go check.
-But, Prosecutor Geum,

77
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,677
why would you go there at this late hour?

78
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,224
What if it's a false report?

79
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,058
So what if it’s false or a prank?

80
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,563
I was about to force myself
in there anyway.

81
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,147
It's a perfect excuse.

82
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,477
Gosh, seriously. This is ridiculous.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,777
-He asked for hemodialysis machines?
-Yes.

84
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,201
He asked for syringes, IV fluids,

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,030
naloxone, and even dopamine
to be sent to the penthouse.

86
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,275
But naloxone is an antagonist.

87
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,699
You use it to counter opioid poisoning.

88
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,195
I know. I'm not the only one
who thinks this is odd, right?

89
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,338
I brought them to him since he's our VVIP,

90
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,838
but I thought I should tell you.

91
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,420
One second.

92
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,845
What? What's going on?

93
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,683
What? For what?

94
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,476
What's the matter?

95
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,555
Stay on the line and wait.

96
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,570
The Central District Prosecutors Office's
prosecutor is at the main entrance.

97
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,693
Prosecutor? For what?

98
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,908
She received a tip that
someone is doing drugs in the penthouse.

99
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,155
Drugs?

100
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,333
That's why that punk…

101
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,564
What are you doing?

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,267
I'll get rid of the drug substance
by doing the hemodialysis.

103
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,988
It'll take some time
since it's not the central vein.

104
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,204
But it'll certainly be effective.

105
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,487
That's very creative, Mr. Han.

106
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,517
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

107
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,936
Can we go in just briefly?

108
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,985
We're only going to check inside briefly.

109
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,239
Please bring a warrant.

110
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,910
You're abusing your governmental power.

111
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,449
Gosh, please don't exaggerate, okay?

112
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,374
Let's abuse it then.

113
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,156
Mr. Park, let's push our way in.

114
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,366
Prosecutor Geum, but that's a bit--

115
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,246
The source said,
someone's life depends on it.

116
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,964
We're civil servants.

117
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,756
If someone is in danger,
shouldn't we save that person?

118
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,434
I'll take full responsibility
for any disciplinary action.

119
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,680
If that's what you really want to do,
we have no choice.

120
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,142
We'll push our way in.

121
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,682
Hey, make way.

122
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,845
-What are you…
-Let us in.

123
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,063
-Step aside.
-Gosh.

124
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,563
-This is…
-Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

125
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,685
-Sir, how did you--
-It's fine. I'm briefed already.

126
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,399
Nice to meet you.
So you received a tip about drugs?

127
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,935
Yes. And you are?

128
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,818
I'm Gu Hyunseong,
the director of Banseokwon.

129
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,777
Please come with me
to the penthouse exclusive entrance

130
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,083
so that we don't inconvenience
other patients.

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,470
Hello?

132
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,270
Mr. Han! We're in trouble.

133
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,885
You have to wake them up immediately.

134
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,556
-What's going on?
-I got a call from security.

135
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,521
A prosecutor came after receiving a tip.

136
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,734
Please wake them up
as quickly as possible.

137
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,186
I'll go out there
and try to buy some time.

138
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,788
This is strange.

139
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,906
I thought you'd stop me for sure.

140
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,366
I watched the last trial.

141
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,040
You already despise Banseok so much.

142
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,093
I don't want you to hate it even more.

143
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,510
Who is staying at the penthouse?

144
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,430
The source said that I'd find
a young man and woman together.

145
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,801
Jayden Lee.

146
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,103
He is a Korean American investor.

147
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,769
I'm not sure who the woman might be.

148
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,299
We're from the prosecutors' office.
Please open the door.

149
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,671
We're from the prosecutors' office.
Open it.

150
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,641
We're from the prosecutors' office.
Open the door now!

151
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,265
-Please open the door.
-I can't open it either.

152
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,693
Only the guest of this room has the key.

153
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,188
No, there is another one.

154
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,318
Go get the master key
from the security office.

155
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,988
Sir, the master key
should be used only in an emergency--

156
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,899
This is an emergency!

157
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,407
-Go get it right away.
-Yes, sir.

158
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,629
Is the mediastinal tumor resection
the only one that went to trial?

159
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,796
Yes, sir. We will surely win the trial,

160
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,643
but Director Gu Hyunseong was
in charge of the surgery.

161
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,190
The timing is bad.
Handle it as quietly as possible.

162
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,858
Yes, sir. But please watch this.

163
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,859
<i>I am suffering due to medical malpractice
at Banseok University Medical Center.</i>

164
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,066
<i>My voice became this way,</i>

165
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,913
<i>but the hospital claims
that they have no responsibility.</i>

166
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,002
<i>I definitely gained consciousness
during the surgery.</i>

167
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>The anesthesia wore off</i>

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,130
<i>and I felt the knife cut through my body.
There was--</i>

169
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,632
Because she was training
to be an idol singer,

170
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,336
she has a lot of followers.

171
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,514
The reporters are keeping quiet so far,

172
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,303
but once we go to trial…

173
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,597
Offer one billion won.

174
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,640
A billion won?

175
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,520
That would set a bad precedent.

176
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,311
There is a saying,

177
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,858
"You could lose a hand
for trying to save a finger."

178
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,740
Make her go quiet
with a large sum of money.

179
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,279
In return, make sure

180
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,780
Hyunseong's name doesn't come up.

181
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,282
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,825
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR LEE DOHYUNG

183
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,753
-What is it?
-<i>Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong</i>

184
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,995
<i>is at Banseokwon.</i>

185
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,256
She received a report
about drugs at the penthouse.

186
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,258
Drugs?

187
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,510
<i>I am not sure about the veracity.</i>

188
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,431
The security team
went to get the master key.

189
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,930
No. Don't let them pass through.

190
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,852
I want to do that,

191
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,391
but Director Gu Hyunseong is adamant.

192
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,604
Put him on the phone right now!

193
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,321
It's about time they wake up.

194
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,622
It's the master key.

195
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,000
It's the chairman. Answer it.

196
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,754
Father?

197
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,625
I am sorry. I called him.

198
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,802
-He is furious. Hurry up.
-Hey!

199
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,051
For goodness' sake.

200
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,427
Director Gu.

201
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,345
If you hand over the master key,
you won't be able to undo your mistake.

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,020
We will never overlook the fact
that you betrayed your partner.

203
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,481
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

204
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,907
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

205
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,996
Director Gu.

206
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,341
I am the one who makes decisions here,

207
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,593
not my father.

208
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,358
What?

209
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,572
What? What are you doing here?

210
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,618
What's the matter?

211
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,448
Who are you guys?

212
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,293
I am Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong

213
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,877
of Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

214
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,837
I received a report on drugs.

215
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,628
Never.

216
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,350
I was receiving a legal consultation.

217
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,561
And you took a shower
during a legal consultation?

218
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,731
What's wrong with it?
Is that illegal here?

219
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,438
I got refreshed
because I had a lot on my mind.

220
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,148
By the way,

221
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,030
how did you get in?

222
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,704
I told Michael not to let anyone in.

223
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,743
I got them in here.

224
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,905
I didn't want there to be
any useless suspicions.

225
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,042
Director Gu Hyunseong, I didn't know
you trusted me so much.

226
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,586
If I had actually been doing drugs,

227
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,918
both of us would have gotten in trouble.

228
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,063
May we look inside?

229
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,278
Go ahead.

230
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,240
All right.

231
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,909
How is this room so big?

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,879
I wondered why you needed
hemodialysis machines so late at night.

233
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,501
A rat had gotten in.

234
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,672
A quack without a medical license is here
for a house call.

235
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,138
Isn't this
a serious breach of medical law?

236
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,934
Like I said, I was

237
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,219
receiving a legal consultation.

238
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,942
With hemodialysis machines,
dopamine, and naloxone?

239
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,727
You covered it up somehow,

240
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,822
but don't think you can fool me,
the director of this place.

241
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,074
This is already the third breach
of medical law.

242
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,702
I overlooked what you did to Park Kitae
since it was an emergency.

243
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,038
I'll make sure

244
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,286
you end up in prison this time.

245
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,717
NALOXONE

246
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,512
This is…

247
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,942
This is an injection

248
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,151
that is used in hospitals.

249
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,494
Answer me. Are you the one…

250
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,370
who used it?

251
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,262
Did you find anything?

252
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,722
Well, we are still looking.

253
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,222
If we don't find anything,

254
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,234
Prosecutor Geum will have
a major headache.

255
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,381
Did you receive permission?

256
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,641
Permission?

257
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,218
Chairman Gu Jingi isn't the type
to allow such rash behaviors.

258
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,483
Your father.

259
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,274
I wondered if you received permission.

260
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,113
If you stop now, I'll let this slide.

261
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,817
I will explain the situation well
to Chairman Gu Jingi.

262
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,706
That's right.

263
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,674
I used it.

264
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,545
I can't explain right now,

265
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,005
but I had no choice.

266
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,184
I am begging you.
Take Gu Hyunseong and leave.

267
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,760
Pardon?

268
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,056
What are you saying?

269
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,685
Why would I do that?

270
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,608
Right. You don't explain things.

271
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,027
Not even now. Not even then.

272
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,988
Seokju didn't die…

273
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,407
because of the surgery.

274
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,623
He was murdered.

275
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,219
Director Gu Jingi,

276
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,509
Head of Anesthesiology Lee Dohyung,

277
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,932
and Perfusionist Cho Junghyun.
The three of them

278
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,930
took out Seokju's heart

279
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,019
while he was recovering at Banseokwon.

280
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,688
You got on my nerves from the start.

281
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,360
You look down on people
in an arrogant manner.

282
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,157
You must have brought up my father
because you are scared.

283
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,999
Too bad for you.
I won't waste this chance.

284
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,129
It's the perfect chance to bring you

285
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,252
and Han Yihan down together.

286
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,970
Wait.

287
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,354
Don't give me that nonsense.

288
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,056
Do you expect me to believe that now?

289
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,435
I know it's a ploy
to get out of this situation.

290
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,068
You had better not talk about
my brother again.

291
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,281
I won't forgive you then.

292
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,294
Right.

293
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,079
Don't.

294
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,293
You can resent me
for the rest of your life.

295
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,292
But if I get arrested
for violating medical law,

296
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,378
all the plans I prepared
for the last five years will go to waste.

297
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,335
You prepared what?

298
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,345
Plans? What are you talking about?

299
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,348
Once I walk out of here,
I'll tell you everything.

300
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,891
Those punks are responsible
for killing my mom and Seokju.

301
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,437
After I make them pay for what they did,

302
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,226
I'll face my punishment then.

303
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,820
Please trust me.

304
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,165
That…

305
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,650
-Why do you have this?
-Why do you think?

306
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,572
If you're curious, open it and see.

307
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,408
-You punk--
-I wonder if you have the guts to do that.

308
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,122
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
and Mr. Han Yihan

309
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,910
who have it out for Banseok are both here.

310
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,621
If everyone finds out
that your fiancée is sleeping in there,

311
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,714
will you be able

312
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,046
to handle the consequence?

313
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,768
So tell me. Did you find any drugs?

314
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,854
No. I didn't find anything.

315
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,435
I apologize for the inconvenience
at this hour.

316
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,824
That's all right.

317
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,610
I guess this is one way
to get to know how things are done here.

318
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,609
Thanks to you, I found out
how scary prosecutors in Korea can be.

319
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,826
Thank you for your understanding.

320
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,659
All right. Can I ask you all to leave now?

321
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,081
My meeting with my lawyer isn't over yet.

322
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,630
Sure.

323
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,967
Director Gu Hyunseong.

324
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,182
Could you escort us to the entrance?

325
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,154
Director Gu Hyunseong.

326
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,608
We'll meet again.

327
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,525
With your father.

328
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,053
Darn it.

329
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,748
You have no idea

330
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,588
how badly I tried to understand you.

331
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,212
How desperately I tried not to resent you
and tried to trust you.

332
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,388
Don't fool yourself I have forgiven you.

333
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,231
If there is an ounce of deception
in what you just told me,

334
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,404
I won't stop here.

335
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,083
Prosecutor Geum.

336
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,161
-Shouldn't we get going?
-Right. Let's go.

337
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,321
Thank you.

338
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,991
They would have caught me
if you hadn't come.

339
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,870
Well, it looks like
I'm the one who got played.

340
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,139
You reported to the prosecutor
about the drugs, didn't you?

341
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,063
I don't follow you.

342
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,600
You set up everything

343
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,852
that happened here today.

344
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,817
You were having a secret affair
while doing drugs

345
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,742
with Gu Hyunseong's fiancée
in Banseokwon's penthouse of all places.

346
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,831
Freedom.

347
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,515
The moment I was about
to inject naloxone again,

348
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,819
you stopped me,
pretending to have regained consciousness.

349
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,783
And the prosecutor who got the tip…

350
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,288
<i>Is this Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of Medical Crime Department</i>

351
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,960
<i>at Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?</i>

352
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,496
I'd like to report something.

353
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,962
Someone is doing drugs at Banseok.

354
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,843
<i>She has a bad history with Banseok.</i>

355
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,760
Please hurry.
Someone's life depends on it.

356
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,182
What?

357
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,886
What are you doing here?

358
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,271
What's the matter?

359
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,062
Who are you guys?

360
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,857
By the way, how did you get in?

361
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,565
I got them in here.

362
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,026
I didn't want there to be
any useless suspicions.

363
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,372
Director Gu Hyunseong, I didn't know
you trusted me so much.

364
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,834
If I had actually been doing drugs,

365
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,038
both of us would have gotten in trouble.

366
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,542
<i>And lastly,</i>

367
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,840
you called me here.

368
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,592
You probably thought I would cooperate
as I had lawsuits against Banseok.

369
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,717
You created a crisis

370
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,264
and controlled it to have an upper hand.

371
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:07,308
You came up with all of this.

372
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,779
Excellent.

373
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,536
But even if you are right,
you can't disclose that.

374
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,578
You're my lawyer.

375
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,538
You are subject

376
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,207
to confidentiality obligations.

377
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,209
I apologize if I offended you.

378
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,046
I needed to check your talent for myself.

379
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,973
"Check"?

380
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,433
Mr. Han.

381
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,755
I want you

382
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,473
to work for me.

383
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:57,896
<i>Darn it!</i>

384
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,318
Die!

385
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,371
That punk, Jayden. He played me.

386
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,130
I'll kill him.

387
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,047
I'm going to kill you with my two hands.

388
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,723
<i>The person you reached is not available.</i>

389
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,858
-Father. I can explain.
-You fool!

390
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,618
How could you think about handing over
our partner to the prosecutor?

391
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,198
I did it to have an upper hand.

392
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,368
He's arrogant.
I needed to teach him a lesson.

393
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,464
Then you should've succeeded!

394
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,504
He has the upper hand now.

395
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,592
Han Yihan was with Jayden Lee
in the penthouse!

396
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,010
What? What was he doing there?

397
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,299
He was there for legal counseling.
But isn't it obvious?

398
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,183
I'm sure something fishy was going on.

399
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,553
No. I must go back upstairs now.

400
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,268
No. You will pretend this never happened.

401
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,519
-But--
-Whatever they did,

402
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,559
it happened in Banseokwon.

403
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,225
And it's Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

404
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,532
We would have a bigger problem
if anyone gets indicted.

405
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,704
Han Yihan already filed lawsuits
against us. Making a scene won't help.

406
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,609
Why would we be scared
of mere civil lawsuits?

407
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,407
Right. Those are mere civil lawsuits.

408
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,374
But do you think he will end there?

409
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,118
Han Yihan is…

410
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,286
coming after you.

411
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,464
So you need to keep a low profile for now.

412
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,588
Don't provoke Jayden either.

413
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,759
Got it?

414
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,006
All right.

415
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,741
<i>I want you as my lawyer.</i>

416
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,615
I need a lawyer
who will advise me regarding Korean law

417
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,707
during my time here.

418
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,378
Having you as my lawyer who knows a lot
about Banseok

419
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,962
and Chairman Gu Jingi

420
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,260
will be the best option.

421
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,724
Why should I help you?
After all, you lied to me

422
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,853
and put me in danger.

423
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,517
Because you will get
what you want the most…

424
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,522
as a reward for helping me.

425
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,438
Restoring your medical license.

426
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,034
Chairman Gu Jingi is stopping it. Right?

427
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,152
I can help you with that.

428
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,198
Under the condition of letting this slide,

429
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,622
he won't say no to that.

430
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,328
What do you think?

431
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,956
This should be enough reward
for the risk you took today. Right?

432
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,298
-I have conditions.
-Go ahead.

433
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,391
If you take illegal drugs again
during your time in Korea,

434
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,719
our contract
will be nullified immediately.

435
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,635
I'm a doctor before a lawyer.
So I can't condone that.

436
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,480
Fine. I'll keep that in mind.

437
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,606
And unless you want to pass out again,

438
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,282
don't drink alcohol today.

439
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,239
And I'm advising you as a doctor.

440
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,040
I thought I hired a lawyer.

441
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,996
But I have my personal doctor now too.

442
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,248
Keep up the good work.

443
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,251
Doctor Lawyer.

444
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,124
<i>Seokju didn't die</i>

445
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,918
<i>because of the surgery. He was murdered.</i>

446
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,086
Director Gu Jingi,
Head of Anesthesiology Lee Dohyung,

447
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,472
and Perfusionist Cho Junghyun.
The three of them

448
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,760
took out Seokju's heart

449
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,307
while he was recovering at the hospital.

450
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,465
Why…

451
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,559
Why now?

452
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,788
Look at this building.

453
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,040
You want to settle?

454
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,955
Let's not be so cold.
This is only a civil suit.

455
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,511
Please think of it
as our olive branch, ma'am.

456
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,761
Olive branch?

457
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,967
When we went to you,
you said it wasn't malpractice.

458
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,311
So tell me. What do you plan to do now?

459
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,350
We will give you one billion won.

460
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,935
What?

461
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,449
What do you think about our offer?

462
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,124
Now that you see the cash in person,

463
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,963
it's different
from just hearing the number. Right?

464
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,671
Are you going to give us
all of that money?

465
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,303
I'm sure there are conditions.

466
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,854
-Let's hear them first before we proceed.
-Right.

467
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,218
And the victim,
Soyeon's opinion is important too.

468
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,477
Right. I'll do that.

469
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,269
What are the conditions?

470
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,977
We only have standard conditions.

471
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,609
We will settle
without taking this to court.

472
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,827
You will not bring up any issues
about this in the future.

473
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,369
And it states we're offering it
as consolation, not compensation.

474
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,334
Consolation?

475
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,463
And this condition is
the most important one.

476
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,000
Delete this video right away.

477
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,007
And you must upload a video,
clarifying that everything was a lie.

478
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,225
<i>I definitely gained consciousness
during the surgery.</i>

479
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,731
<i>But they dismissed me like I'm crazy.</i>

480
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,364
<i>The anesthesia wore off</i>

481
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,153
<i>and I felt the knife cut through my body.</i>

482
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,357
<i>There was a problem during the surgery.</i>

483
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,116
SUBPOENA TO APPEAR IN COURT TO TESTIFY

484
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,382
Did she really wake up during the surgery?

485
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,046
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

486
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,221
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why would I say that I did?

487
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,800
Banseok University Medical Center

488
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,295
doesn't acknowledge
that you woke up during the surgery.

489
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,306
We don't acknowledge malpractice.

490
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,810
We are only offering this money
based on our ethical standards.

491
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,019
So we need you to explain what you did
that is in line with our acknowledgment.

492
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,031
No.

493
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,656
They want me to say I lied.

494
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,317
It was…

495
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,002
really scary and awful.

496
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,921
And you won't even acknowledge
your mistake.

497
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,791
How is this consoling me?

498
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,877
You just want to pay me to keep me quiet!

499
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,513
Right. I can understand where
you're coming from. You're still young.

500
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:29,099
Ma'am, you ought to look out
for her future at times like this.

501
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,517
She can't make a debut now.

502
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,270
You know that this kind of money
will be very helpful

503
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,363
to you and her future.

504
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,111
Mom, don't take it.

505
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,448
Don't take it!

506
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,320
Soyeon.

507
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,866
You're acting like an immature kid.
Don't you feel bad for your mom?

508
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,157
She worked hard
to support your dream all by herself.

509
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,462
Don't you think she deserves a break?

510
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,924
You can't throw us money
to keep my daughter quiet.

511
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,720
What?

512
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,602
Don't make her feel guilty,

513
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,639
so you can silence her.

514
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,135
You people… No.

515
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,064
No one gets to say that to my daughter.

516
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,435
I apologize if I offended you. But--

517
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,902
We won't take your money.

518
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,784
Please reconsider.

519
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,065
You'll be ruining your daughter's life.

520
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,235
No. This money will ruin her life
if I take it.

521
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,445
So get that out of our sight right now.

522
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,076
That dirty money.

523
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,586
Go ahead.

524
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,796
Put it back in.

525
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,861
I truly hope
you won't regret your decision.

526
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,080
-Mom!
-Are you all right?

527
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,394
She turned down one billion won?

528
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,767
-Go ahead.
<i>-I emailed you the investigation report</i>

529
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,355
<i>on Gil Soyeon.</i>

530
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,573
Okay. I'll check it.

531
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,789
Come on. Seriously?

532
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,421
We would have wasted one billion won.

533
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,304
I'm ready.

534
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,089
You should've taken it when you could.

535
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,640
I hate to make your life miserable.

536
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,926
Drive already.

537
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,899
Thank you for treating me too.

538
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,490
It's okay. You made a hard decision.

539
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,159
Even if we win the trial,

540
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,580
you won't be able to get half…

541
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,868
No, not even a quarter of the money
you were just offered.

542
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,209
But if we can prove that
your anesthesia wore off during surgery,

543
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,671
we will use that as evidence
to start a criminal case.

544
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,383
They offered you so much money
to prevent that from happening.

545
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,755
Mom, I don't regret it.

546
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,929
And thank you so much
for not accepting that money.

547
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,345
Leave the rest to me.

548
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,976
That's why I'm here.

549
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,163
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

550
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,701
I need you to testify as witnesses.

551
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,405
-Will that be okay?
-Of course.

552
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,666
Honestly, what do we have to be afraid of?

553
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,458
All we did
was do our best during the surgery.

554
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,495
All right.

555
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:32,256
As for you, Dr. Choi, you will be
at a conference outside of Seoul

556
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,341
as of today until the trial ends.

557
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,677
What?

558
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,143
But I received a subpoena
from the court to testify.

559
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,353
Don't worry about that.

560
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,888
The legal team will send in
a non-attendance statement.

561
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,611
So whether you get a call from the court
or from Han Yihan,

562
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,229
don't answer it no matter who calls.

563
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,858
Understood?

564
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,119
That's nice and clean.

565
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,619
Don't worry. We'll come up with a story.

566
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,252
Please do so.

567
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,499
You know what to do.

568
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,921
Right.

569
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,086
I can't do that.
If we admit it now and apologize,

570
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,092
the patient will understand too.

571
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,843
So you should join me as a witness…

572
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,965
Darn it, Choi Yosub! Come to your senses!

573
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,640
If you lose your license
and get kicked out as a third-year fellow,

574
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,635
are you going to open a law firm too?

575
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,685
Why would I?
I'm not doing this because I want to.

576
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,519
Who would understand that?

577
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,646
Do you think this is the first time?

578
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,989
If we make one mistake,
we could end up like Park Kitae…

579
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,580
"Like Park Kitae"? What do you mean…

580
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,448
Hey. Forget it. Listen to me carefully.

581
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,003
At Banseok University Medical Center
Cardiothoracic Surgery Department,

582
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,922
you come after Gu Hyunseong.

583
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,961
He will become
the director of the hospital,

584
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,205
so you need to get rewarded as well.

585
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,339
The next Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

586
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,641
Got it?

587
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,061
What did he mean by "like Kitae"?

588
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,240
YIHAN

589
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,359
It's Yihan.

590
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,513
Defense counsel.

591
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,215
Plaintiff's counsel.

592
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,928
Defense counsel.

593
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,734
Gu Hyunseong and Choi Yosub,
the witnesses the plaintiff requested,

594
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,600
have submitted a non-attendance statement.

595
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,984
Yes. They were scheduled to attend
a conference outside of Seoul,

596
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,315
so they couldn't make it today.

597
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,403
Are the other witnesses here?

598
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,777
-Yes.
-Yes.

599
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,833
All right then.
We'll get started right away.

600
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,546
Are you serious? How could you go to
Banseokwon without discussing it with me?

601
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,841
The Banseok Legal Team

602
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,094
filed suit against you
for obstruction of business and assault.

603
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,546
They even filed it at our office!

604
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,216
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

605
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,175
But Director Gu Hyunseong was the one
who showed me--

606
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,347
If you're sorry,

607
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,515
don't get involved with Banseok for now.

608
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,272
I'll assign Nam Hyukchul's case
to someone else.

609
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,146
That's not fair.

610
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,903
He killed my suspect.

611
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,275
I know!

612
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,112
If you wanted to investigate,
you shouldn't have been reckless.

613
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,330
Seokyeong,

614
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,118
stop worrying me. Okay?

615
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,462
Just lie low

616
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,377
until the case gets dismissed.

617
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,681
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

618
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,942
<i>I have a trial against Banseok
at Seoul Central District Court.</i>

619
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,856
<i>Come watch the case.</i>

620
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,408
<i>After it's over, I'll keep my promise
and tell you everything.</i>

621
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,164
<i>Awareness under anesthesia.</i>

622
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,328
It's when the anesthesia wears off
during surgery and a patient wakes up,

623
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,963
but they cannot move their bodies.

624
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,343
If the anesthesia has worn off,
why can't they move their body?

625
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,298
I'll explain with the slides.

626
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,168
AWARENESS UNDER ANESTHESIA

627
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,255
Many people think…

628
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,260
that the given anesthetic shot
will put you under general anesthesia.

629
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,053
But the shot given before the surgery

630
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,676
is a type of sleep agent
given to prepare for the anesthesia.

631
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,684
It only lasts for a few minutes.

632
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:56,608
For general anesthesia, you must block
three conditions for the patient.

633
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,032
For this,
the necessary drugs are injected.

634
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,530
First, in order to block
the patient's consciousness,

635
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,573
they make the patient sleep
using an anesthetic agent.

636
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,743
Then they inject a muscle relaxant

637
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,288
to block
the patient's movements and reflexes,

638
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,372
<i>and prevent the patient from moving.</i>

639
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,381
Just like how we move unconsciously
while we're asleep,

640
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,631
it is done to prevent the patient from
moving while under general anesthesia.

641
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,215
<i>Lastly, through intubation,</i>

642
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,680
the patient is given oxygen
mixed with anesthetic gas.

643
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,813
<i>This blocks out pain
and stops brain functions.</i>

644
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,481
<i>That is when the patient is fully under
anesthesia and ready for surgery.</i>

645
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,018
In other words, even if a patient
wakes up during surgery,

646
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,897
they cannot move
because of the muscle relaxants.

647
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,782
Even if they can feel the scalpel
cutting through their skin and muscles,

648
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,581
they can't express the pain they feel.

649
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,238
That's awareness under anesthesia.

650
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,764
That's an interesting idea.

651
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,795
Your Honor. The counsel for the plaintiff

652
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,768
is a criminal of medical malpractice
who lost his license

653
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,311
five years ago.

654
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,313
Since his claims lack credibility,

655
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,647
would you give me permission
to ask Dr. Lee Dohyung,

656
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,614
an anesthesiologist
about awareness under anesthesia?

657
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,867
That would be good.

658
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,239
Witness, please prepare to testify.

659
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,835
Awareness under anesthesia
has never been considered

660
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,380
medical malpractice in Korea.

661
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,763
In other words, it's a hypothesis
that has yet to be proven.

662
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,508
I've worked as an anesthesiologist
for 20 years

663
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,724
and have never seen it myself.

664
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:55,523
No, Your Honor.
Korea acknowledges the phenomenon.

665
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,479
According to a survey done in the US,
one out of 1,000 patients

666
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,770
experienced awareness under anesthesia.

667
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,774
There were cases where it was acknowledged
as malpractice through a lawsuit.

668
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,937
You shouldn't compare us to the US.

669
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:10,823
They file lawsuits left and right there.
I even heard someone sued God.

670
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,738
Furthermore, even if
awareness under anesthesia existed,

671
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:18,536
that's no proof that the plaintiff's
anesthesia wore off during her surgery.

672
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,119
That's correct.

673
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,004
Your Honor. In order to prove
that there was awareness under anesthesia,

674
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:28,336
I would like the victim, Ms. Gil,
to tell you what happened that day.

675
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,429
Plaintiff, while receiving
a mediastinal tumor resection at Banseok,

676
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,562
did you experience
awareness under anesthesia?

677
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,774
WITNESS

678
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,889
Yes.

679
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,942
Could you tell us what happened?

680
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,106
I couldn't move my body,

681
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,408
but I was awake and could feel everything.

682
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,322
I felt everything.

683
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:40,198
I felt them cut me from here to here.

684
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,786
I remember everything clearly.

685
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,090
Even though I want to forget it,
I can't get it out of my mind.

686
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,514
Every couple of days,
I have a nightmare about getting surgery.

687
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,129
I dream of dark shadows hovering over me

688
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,176
and cutting and ripping apart my body.

689
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,971
You had awareness under anesthesia,

690
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,807
and because of that, you're suffering from
severe post-traumatic stress disorder.

691
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,771
Did you tell that to the hospital?

692
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,904
Yes. I did.

693
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,112
How did they react?

694
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,692
At first, they didn't listen to me.

695
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,160
When I filed the lawsuit,
they tried to pay me off to stay silent.

696
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,699
They offered me one billion won.

697
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,326
-One billion won?
-One billion won?

698
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,551
One billion won is a lot of money.

699
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,419
Why didn't you take it?

700
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,176
They wanted me to drop the lawsuit
in return for the money,

701
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,298
and they wanted me to admit
that I spread false information.

702
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,676
They wanted me to say that I was lying.

703
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,644
That's why I didn't accept it.

704
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,984
Because I didn't lie about anything.

705
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,233
I'm sure it's hard to recollect this.

706
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,185
Thank you for answering my questions.

707
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,692
That's all.

708
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,454
Plaintiff, can you continue?

709
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,247
Yes. I can.

710
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,634
Counsel for the defense.
Please ask your questions.

711
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,880
Okay.

712
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,260
WITNESS

713
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,853
First, I would like to apologize on behalf
of Banseok University Medical Center

714
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,387
for the incident
you had to go through, Ms. Gil.

715
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,398
Seven years ago, at the age of 19,

716
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,858
you were accepted as a trainee
to become an idol singer,

717
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,244
and you've been trained there
until recently. Right?

718
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,777
Yes.

719
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,695
I assume that for nearly half your life,

720
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:47,414
you had to endure
a long and difficult time.

721
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:52,134
Both physically and mentally.
Am I correct?

722
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,131
Yes, but why do you ask?

723
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,883
For many years,
you were treated as a patient

724
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,047
with a severe delusional disorder. Right?

725
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,933
Objection. She's insulting the plaintiff.
Please stop her.

726
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,925
If it were any other disorders,
I wouldn't have mentioned it.

727
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,612
But a delusional disorder
is an important factor

728
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,399
in determining her credibility.

729
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:17,322
That is why I had no choice
but to mention it in this trial.

730
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,409
I understand.

731
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,372
Please continue.

732
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,159
Thank you.

733
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,372
<i>Today?</i>

734
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:36,087
<i>I went to the practice room after school
and worked on choreography.</i>

735
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,168
<i>I had vocal training today,</i>

736
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,925
<i>but I wasn't feeling well, so I came home.</i>

737
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,640
<i>I haven't been feeling well these days.</i>

738
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,853
<i>When am I debuting?</i>

739
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,727
<i>I'd like to know too.</i>

740
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,518
<i>Can you ask my CEO for me…</i>

741
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,767
<i>What is that?</i>

742
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,942
<i>Oh, my gosh! I'm scared!</i>

743
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,653
<i>Oh, my gosh! Who are you?
Don't come close!</i>

744
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,446
<i>Mom, are you outside? Help me!</i>

745
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,908
HOW NOISY. DID SHE SEE A GHOST?

746
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,294
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

747
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,541
YOU LOOK UNSTABLE

748
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,789
She's crazy.

749
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,510
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

750
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,216
<i>I keep seeing weird things these days.</i>

751
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,339
<i>I hear things too.</i>

752
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,473
<i>I'm sorry. I'm going to go now.</i>

753
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,604
THE LIVE BROADCAST IS OVER

754
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,604
The video you just watched

755
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,766
was a live broadcast
filmed by Ms. Gil last May.

756
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,646
During her hour-long live broadcast,

757
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,950
Ms. Gil portrayed symptoms
of a delusional disorder

758
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,864
including hallucinations three times.

759
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,714
Ms. Gil. Let me ask you again.

760
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,963
Have you been treated
for a delusional disorder?

761
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,840
Yes, but I've been fully cured.

762
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,722
After I was set to debut,

763
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,892
I've never seen or heard anything!

764
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,810
Then what about now,
when your debut has faced a setback?

765
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,023
Could your delusions recur?

766
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,483
Your Honor. This is a leading question.

767
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:21,904
No. This is reasonable speculation
based on fact.

768
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,072
Let's hear her out. Please continue.

769
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,700
Thank you.

770
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,202
According to a consultation
with a psychiatrist,

771
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,286
curing delusional disorders
is very difficult,

772
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,589
and it can relapse whenever
the patient is under severe stress.

773
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:43,417
The delusional disorder developed from
being exhausted by her days as a trainee

774
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:47,716
and relapsed due to the stress of
the surgery she received before her debut.

775
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,432
PLAINTIFF

776
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,466
Isn't this reasonable speculation?

777
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,811
DEFENDANT

778
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,276
Of course, I'm not denying

779
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,860
that Ms. Gil had an unfortunate incident.

780
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,581
What Ms. Gil needs right now
isn't a trial.

781
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,790
It's psychiatric treatment.

782
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,671
Banseok University Medical Center
promises to provide Ms. Gil

783
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,997
with the best medical personnel

784
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,877
to receive psychiatric help.

785
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,094
"Director! A VIP is coming in!"

786
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,822
Plaintiff, what did you just say?

787
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,990
I'm not delusional. I heard them.

788
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,539
They said a VIP was there,
so he had to leave right away!

789
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,553
Director! A VIP is coming in!

790
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,721
A VIP? Who is it?

791
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,183
That's…

792
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,930
-Tell them I'll be right there.
-Yes.

793
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,103
Darn it.

794
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,146
What about the surgery?

795
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,901
I'm sure someone else is available.

796
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,533
Anyone can do this kind of surgery.

797
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,859
Don't worry about it and go.
We'll take care of it.

798
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,913
<i>This is all a delusion.</i>

799
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,910
As you saw before, there is no credibility
to her statement.

800
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,754
There are cases when nightmares while
under anesthesia are mistaken for a real…

801
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,751
No!

802
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,169
I saw and heard everything!

803
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,342
-Plaintiff.
-The surgeon in charge wasn't there,

804
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,304
and a different surgeon did my surgery!

805
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,604
Plaintiff. Calm down.

806
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,929
If you cause any more disturbance,
you will be removed.

807
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,527
PLAINTIFF

808
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,278
Then it must've been a ghost.

809
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,746
A ghost? What kind of nonsense?

810
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,338
The victim saw it,

811
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,422
but no other surgeon did the surgery?

812
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,684
Then the only answer
is that it was a ghost.

813
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,468
An operation room ghost
that doctors at Banseok

814
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,521
can't see.

815
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,769
This is false information.

816
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,061
-Please stop speaking.
-Sustained.

817
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,015
Counsel for the plaintiff.
Please stop and take a seat.

818
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,066
I will prove to everyone here

819
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:54,157
that the operation room ghost does exist.

820
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,279
What are you talking about?

821
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,630
Tell me.

822
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,839
Do you still not see him?

823
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,796
I see him clearly.

824
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,226
Let me introduce

825
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,644
the Banseok University
Medical Center ghost

826
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,858
who did Ms. Gil's surgery.

827
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,011
I'm the ghost doctor
who performed surgery on Ms. Gil

828
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,465
instead of the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Gu Hyunseong.

829
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,305
-Your Honor.
-You don't think we'll lose. Do you?

830
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,102
It's a 50-50 chance.

831
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,805
I'm the new director
of Banseok R and D Center,

832
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,816
Lim Yuna.

833
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,479
You are wearing the earrings.

834
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,317
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-And the other side?

835
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,070
<i>Yuna is the queen.</i>

836
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,034
<i>My lovely partner
who will support me by my side.</i>

837
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,866
<i>Have you ever done a surgery</i>

838
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,871
where you implant a heart
that was implanted in someone else?

839
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,914
Lawyer Han Yihan. Bring him to me.

840
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,537
Do you think I'd kill him like this?

841
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,631
