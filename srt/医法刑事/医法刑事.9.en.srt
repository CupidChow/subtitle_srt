EPISODE 9

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,688
Hey, I'm ready.

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,242
-Yosub.
-Yihan.

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,123
Please let me join you too.

6
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,009
Thank you for coming.
It couldn't have been easy.

7
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,431
Let's go and operate.

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,636
<i>Go to New-Hope Medicine Clinic.</i>

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,858
Go and operate with Han Yihan.

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,899
Why do you want me…

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,148
Could it be…

12
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,365
that you want me to kill the patient?

13
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,717
Was everything to your satisfaction?

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,049
It was nice. Good work.

15
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,804
It was an honor to serve you.

16
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,017
1 HOUR 30 MINUTES BEFORE TRIAL
1 HOUR INTO OPERATION

17
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,521
Inject the cardioplegia solution.
The body temperature is 30°C.

18
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,733
Cardioplegia solution entering.

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,863
Cardioplegia solution has been injected.

20
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,571
Let's cut the aorta.

21
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,629
What was that lawyer's name, Han Yihan?
Will you let him be?

22
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,552
The Legal Team is preparing
to press charges.

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,591
Things will quiet down,
so please don't be concerned.

24
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,216
Make sure to shake him off.

25
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,556
The last minister had
a dishonorable discharge.

26
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,715
If you fail at the hearing
due to a scandal,

27
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,428
I would lose face as someone
who recommended you.

28
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,518
Don't worry.

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,815
Would you like to step inside?

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,025
No. I have somewhere to be.

31
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,867
Now that I am old,
it's hard to wait endlessly.

32
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,873
Prosecutor Geum, I don't think we need
photos of her leaving. Shall we go?

33
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,327
You should go.

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,588
You're of no help anyway.
Why do you want to stay?

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,630
I am not complaining because I am tired.

36
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,304
I don't want her to enter the trial
without a wink of sleep.

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,644
Wait. She is coming out.

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,257
What? She is coming out.

39
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,057
That took her long enough.

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,570
I wonder what kind of treatments
she received,

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,650
but her face is glowing.

42
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,776
Seriously.

43
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,912
Who would think
that she is close to hitting 60?

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,870
Thank you for today.

45
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,869
I will head straight to the court,
so wrap up and get off work.

46
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,156
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

47
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,581
30 MINUTES BEFORE TRIAL
2 HOURS INTO OPERATION

48
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,785
We have a visual.

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,455
Scalpel number 11.

50
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,492
Yihan, are you okay?

51
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,321
I am okay.

52
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,868
Would it be necessary to go?

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,503
There will be reporters.

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,085
I agree with him.

55
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,924
I am sure it won't happen,
but if Nam Hyukchul tries something…

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,336
"If you seek revenge,

57
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,045
you should dig two graves."

58
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,848
-Pardon?
-He dug his own grave for revenge,

59
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,063
so I should put my heart into this.

60
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,446
It's time.

61
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,457

PROSECUTION

63
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,141
DEFENDANT

64
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,980
What brings you here?

65
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,234
I am here to see

66
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,650
how my investment comes to fruition.

67
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,816
You have stopped hiding your intention.

68
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,367
Fine. In that case,

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,790
I will let go of manners for an investor.

70
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,964
You should, Father.

71
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,209
That brat has neither honor nor class.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,171
We should have never associated with him.

73
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,463
Class?

74
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,344
Someone who hasn't achieved anything
other than being a chairman's son

75
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,634
would say such things.

76
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,138
But once Bankseok falls,

77
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,024
you won't have anything left.

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,680
Not wealth and honor.

79
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,770
-Not even Yuna.
-You little…

80
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,114
Nonsense.

81
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,685
Banseok will never fall.

82
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,403
Do you know why?

83
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,201
I won't let that happen.

84
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,792
The weather is nice.

SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,101
Are you all right, Yihan?

87
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,481
-Please wrap it up.
-Okay.

88
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,833
Cut.

89
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,932
Taking off ACC.

90
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,702
The vital signs seem to be stable,
so let's reduce the pump.

91
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,871
Please reduce it.

92
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,791
Okay. Reducing the drainage.

93
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,041
Pump flow 70.

94
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,463
Reduce it further.

95
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,250
Pump flow 30.

96
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,717
Clamp.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,970
Stop the pump.

98
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,726
Stopping the pump.

99
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,638
One, two, three.

100
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,858
We stopped the drainage.

101
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,775
-Check the ventricular septum.
-Yes.

102
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,280
The ventricular septum is 160mm.

103
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,067
The pulse pressure is 57mmHg.

104
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,489
The pulse pressure is still…

SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

106
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,512
Let's stop the heart again.

107
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,129
Start the pump.

108
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,181
Start the pump.

109
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,347
Starting the pump.

110
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,352
One, two, three.
The pump has been started.

111
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,266
Aorta clamp.

112
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,744
Inject the cardioplegia solution.
Give me 700ml.

113
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,525
Cardioplegia solution entering.

114
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,367
Yihan, will you stop the heart again?

115
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,792
His problems will return soon.

116
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,040
Another open-heart surgery
will be more dangerous.

117
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,872
Still, the trial…

118
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,706
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

119
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,420
Right now, we should focus
on saving the patient.

120
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,017
Cardioplegia solution has been injected.

121
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,887
Removing the suture. Scalpel.

122
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,520
Yihan.

123
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,227
Your hand…

124
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,237
Hurry up and give me a scalpel.

125
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,915
I'll do it.

126
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,021
Your arm isn't in the right state.

127
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,400
Let me operate.

128
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,232
Have you done
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surgery?

129
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,027
"If you fear the first,
you can't be a good doctor."

130
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,865
You told me those words.

131
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,534
I know it's a difficult surgery, but…

132
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,037
But I will do it.

133
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,748
It's a surgery you must succeed in…

134
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,089
on time.

135
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,222
We'll switch places. Come to my side.

136
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,184
Okay.

137
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,408
Don't be nervous. I will assist you.

138
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,583
Okay.

139
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,789
Scalpel.

140
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,705
I will begin.

141
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,515
All rise.

142
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,523
Please sit down.

143
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,229
The attorney isn't here. What happened?

144
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,397
The defendant's attorney is absent.

145
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,027
Absent? Without notice?

146
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,735
Yes, your Honor.

147
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,655
He scaled up the situation
and went out of contact.

148
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,922
Defendant, did you hear anything
from your attorney?

149
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,334
PROSECUTION

150
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,087
COUNSEL

151
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,721
COUNSEL

152
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,221
It can't be helped.

153
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,893
As the attorney is absent, the trial--

154
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,353
Your Honor.

155
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,346
The defendant's attorney
contacted me before the trial.

156
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,650
Did he contact you? What did he say?

157
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,691
He has to run an operation
on an emergency patient at his hospital,

158
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,816
so he wanted permission
on delaying the trial to the afternoon.

159
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,124
Since he couldn't contact
the justice department,

160
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,989
he had no choice
but to relay the information to me.

161
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:06,906
An operation?

162
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,748
That doesn't excuse his absence.

163
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,251
He told me that
defending the accused is as important

164
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,207
as operating on the patient.

165
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,006
So if the justice department
doesn't allow the delay,

166
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,640
he will halt the operation and come.

167
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,311
In my 30 years as a judge,

168
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,154
it's my first time
seeing an attorney run an operation.

169
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,401
The current time is 10:15 a.m.

170
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,404
The trial will resume in an hour.

171
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,487
If he can't come until then,
he should choose between the two jobs.

172
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,948
All rise.

173
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,129
You are doing well.

174
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,465
So that it doesn't become thick,

175
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,351
cut the inside.

176
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,429
Okay.

177
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,635
What's wrong?

178
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,149
I think there's a tear in the heart wall.

179
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,317
What happened? Did something go wrong?

180
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,356
-For how long has the pump been going?
-It has been going for 45 minutes.

181
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,914
It's okay. The heart is on arrest,
so there won't be bleeding. We have time.

182
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,163
-But…
-We can suture the damaged area.

183
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,369
So keep going.

184
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,419
Believe in yourself.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,378
Okay.

186
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,929
-Is it done?
-Yes.

187
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,268
Further inside.

188
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,736
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

189
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,576
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

190
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,800
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

191
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,559
Is the defendant's attorney still absent?

192
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,138
Yes, your Honor.

193
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,313
The trial isn't a joke.

194
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,154
If the attorney doesn't show up right now,

195
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,940
the trial won't take place today.

196
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,493
What is it?

197
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,536
Your Honor, my name is Pyo Eunsil
and I am a lawyer.

198
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,672
If the accused wishes, could I provide
my legal service to the defendant?

199
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,882
No.

200
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,045
Ms. Pyo Eunsil is
the Head of the Legal Team at Banseok,

201
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,262
the hospital
where the murdered doctors worked at.

202
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,143
Their interests overlap.

203
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,810
We also can't rule out the possibility
of her becoming the witness.

204
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,934
Thus, she can't defend him.

205
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,637
Banseok Foundation?

206
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,363
Are her words true?

207
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,112
Yes, your Honor.

208
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,820
However, all Korean citizens
have the right to be assisted

209
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,493
by the attorney of their choice
in order to protect themselves.

210
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:37,292
Thus, the defendant should have
a chance to choose a new attorney.

211
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,882
Defendant, do you have the intention
to change the attorney?

212
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,880
COUNSEL

213
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,178
I will think about it.

214
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,432
Understood.

215
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,848
It's unprecedented,

216
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,104
but we have no right to disallow
what the defendant wants.

217
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,606
We will adjourn for ten minutes.

218
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,110
Ms. Pyo, talk to the defendant
and get his consent.

219
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,034
Thank you, your Honor.

220
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,661
All rise.

221
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,424
That was unexpected.

222
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,707
The Head of Banseok's Legal Team
stepped forward to defend the accused.

223
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,586
They want to silence him,

224
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,841
but he won't turn that easily

225
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,143
because his son's life is at stake.

226
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,557
Are you telling me
Dr. Han will kill the boy

227
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,968
if Nam Hyukchul
doesn't do what he promised?

228
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,398
No. He would never kill a patient.

229
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,899
A hostage you can never kill.

230
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,105
Such a hostage has no value.

231
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,442
You are right. However,

232
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,858
Nam Hyukchul wouldn't think that.

233
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,157
He is a murderer, so he will think as one.

234
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,792
You are right.
He killed two people for his gain.

235
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,576
In any case, Dr. Han is the only one…

236
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,000
It's him.

237
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,551
Hey. How did it go?

238
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,591
The surgery went well.

239
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,219
I am on my way to the court.
Please buy me some time.

240
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,885
Okay.

241
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,348
But Pyo Eunsil is having a meeting
with Nam Hyukchul.

242
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,145
Pyo Eunsil? Why?

243
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,936
<i>She wants to defend him.</i>

244
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,074
The court will allow it
if Nam Hyukchul agrees.

245
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,409
Okay. I will be there as soon as possible.

246
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,947
How did it go?

247
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,914
The surgery was successful.
He is on his way to the court.

248
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,586
What is this?
Why do you want to represent me?

249
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,886
You don't understand the situation fully
because you are locked up.

250
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,181
You don't want to hurt your son
by making the wrong decision, do you?

251
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,136
After using me as you saw fit,

252
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,903
you threaten me about my son.

253
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,073
If I think about the way
you toyed with me,

254
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,820
I want to reveal everything in court.

255
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,034
Shall I do that?

256
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,032
Get your facts straight.
You toyed with us.

257
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,491
You are the one who betrayed the chairman

258
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,997
and sided with Han Yihan.

259
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,328
You should have saved my son
from the start!

260
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,876
I killed two people.

261
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,843
But you kept pushing things off
and refused to take action!

262
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,219
Calm down. I am not here to fight.

263
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,763
What is it?

264
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,178
Check it yourself. We'll talk then.

265
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,166
Defendant, did you make up your mind?

266
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,088
Yes, your Honor.

267
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,255
I won't change the attorney.

268
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,637
He won't change the attorney?

269
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,505
Understood.

270
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,885
Then we will decide on a new trial date.

271
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,307
Your Honor.

272
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,151
The defendant's attorney is
on his way to the court.

273
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,649
If you give him more time…

274
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,360
No. We have waited for too long.

275
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,903
Besides, in this situation,

276
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,356
he should have sent another attorney.

277
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,157
Why does he keep contacting you?

278
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,785
We are scheduled for other trials
in the afternoon too. We will end…

279
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,125
Your Honor!

280
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,718
I'm the defendant's counsel, Han Yihan.

281
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,676
There was a patient I had to save
with this surgery,

282
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
so I couldn't make it on time.

283
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,474
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,765
So did you save the patient?

285
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,315
Yes, your Honor. I did.

286
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,407
I was able to finish the surgery
thanks to your patience.

287
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,409
Thank you.

288
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,504
Great. Then we will begin
the trial right away.

289
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,128
-You may take your seat, counsel.
-Thank you.

290
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,330
WITNESS WAITING ROOM

291
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,161
Han Yihan is in the courtroom now.

292
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,633
It's not too late to refuse to testify.

293
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,999
No.

294
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,712
We'll stick to our plan.

295
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,589
The prosecution indicted the defendant
for murder. Correct?

296
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,047
Yes.

297
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,096
The defendant pleads guilty to the charge.

298
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,020
But he's arguing that it was
involuntary manslaughter due to insanity.

299
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,560
-Yes.
-Your Honor.

300
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,773
Can I elaborate regarding my investigation
to obtain evidence?

301
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,815
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

302
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,910
I'd like to present evidence number 20,
the victim's visitation log from prison.

303
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:53,082
During the three months the victim,
Park Kitae, was incarcerated,

304
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,673
the defendant had never contacted
the victim.

305
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,300
But the defendant's counsel
was changed for the trial

306
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,169
regarding Lee Hojun's death.

307
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,971
The night before
the ruling was to be announced,

308
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,350
the defendant attacked the victim
and killed him in the end

309
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,928
as if he was trying to stop the victim
from getting released

310
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,894
after the ruling the next day.

311
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,354
Your Honor, the last claim is

312
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,305
subjective speculation
from the prosecutor.

313
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,516
Sustained.

314
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,148
Do you have evidence
to support your claim?

315
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,940
Yes, I do.

316
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,744
This is the defendant's medical record in
the detention center, evidence number 19.

317
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:32,036
The defendant visited the infirmary
once a month

318
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,659
ever since he was incarcerated
six years ago.

319
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,213
But at the point
of the victim's incarceration,

320
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,460
the number of visits increased notably.
Ten visits a month.

321
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,509
Is that relevant to your claim
that the defendant was instigated

322
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,050
to commit murder?

323
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,633
Yes, it is.

324
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,595
The person who delivered Chairman Gu's
murder request to the defendant

325
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,774
was the medical director
at the detention center.

326
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,281
Objection.

327
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,236
The prosecutor's claim is not true.
She's making a one-sided claim.

328
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,615
<i>Who was it?</i>

329
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,543
Not everyone can get their hands
on a knife made of obsidian.

330
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,086
Who gave it to you?

331
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,625
Answer it.

332
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,085
We must know so we can trust you
and at least come up with a plan.

333
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,761
The medical director
from the detention center.

334
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,271
I got the order from Gu Jingi
to kill Park Kitae

335
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,522
and heard
that my son's condition got worse

336
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,899
all from him.

337
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,243
I'll have a reporter cover the suspicion
of Chairman Gu's instigation of murder.

338
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,834
And I will defend you for
involuntary manslaughter due to insanity.

339
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,119
Due to insanity?

340
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,209
Why? That won't work. I'm on death row.

341
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,513
Even a death-row inmate deserves counsel.

342
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,878
As your attorney, I'm going to do my best.

343
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,389
Prosecution, will you be able to take
responsibility for what you just said?

344
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,312
Of course.

345
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,690
To prove my claim, I would like to
question Chairman Gu Jingi as my witness.

346
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,976
I'll add that once I finish investigating
the witness for instigation of murder,

347
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,525
and I'll indict him accordingly and alter
the charge on the arraignment as well.

348
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,452
Okay then.

349
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,664
Guard, bring in the witness.

350
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,831
Okay.

351
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,813
<i>CHAIRMAN GU JINGI OF BANSEOK FOUNDATION
HAD A DOCTOR MURDERED</i>

352
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,772
Witness, you are asked to testify.

353
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,689
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

354
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,199
Witness, proceed with the oath.

355
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,905
I solemnly swear

356
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:27,456
to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth

357
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,724
under pains and penalties of perjury.

358
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,878
Witness Gu Jingi.

359
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,182
Witness, you may refuse any questions

360
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,484
relevant to your criminal case.

361
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,149
Prosecution, question the witness.

362
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,648
Yes, your Honor.

363
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,243
You are Director

364
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,235
of Banseok University Medical Center and
Chairman of Banseok Foundation. Correct?

365
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,328
Yes, correct.

366
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,746
The defendant used to supply
medical equipment to your hospital.

367
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,342
And he murdered two of your doctors.

368
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,918
What do you think about this?

369
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,843
As the director of the hospital,
I feel ethically responsible.

370
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,554
Ethical responsibility. Is that all?

371
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,466
That's correct.

372
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,603
Let me ask you again. Witness.

373
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,772
Did you order the defendant,
Nam Hyukchul, to commit murder?

374
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,988
Hold on.

375
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,700
Witness, I already informed you
that you can refuse to answer

376
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,702
any questions
relevant to your criminal case.

377
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,946
Think carefully before you answer that.

378
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,922
I did

379
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,340
no such thing.

380
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,335
I'm here today to quash

381
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:02,466
an absurd suspicion
a certain news agency wrote about.

382
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,935
I did not have any sort of business
with the defendant.

383
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,443
Your Honor,
may I question the defendant to see

384
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,028
if the witness is telling the truth?

385
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,164
-Right now?
-Yes.

386
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,161
I believe this is the surest way
to judge if the suspicion

387
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,124
about the witness is true or not.

388
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,004
Let us discuss that.

389
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,749
We kept our side of the bargain.

390
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,168
It's your turn now.

391
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,048
WITNESS

392
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,385
All right. We'll check now.

393
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,518
Defendant.

394
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,652
Do you agree with the claim
the witness just made?

395
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,067
Let me ask you again.

396
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:07,657
Is it true that the witness
ordered you to commit murder?

397
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,428
Yes.

398
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,268
I was told to kill him.

399
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,935
DEFENDANT

400
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,204
I…

401
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,749
I said I didn't want to do it.

402
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,090
But he kept whispering to me.

403
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,432
I was told to kill the devil.
Only then I would be saved!

404
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,273
I was told to kill the devil
with my own hands!

405
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,648
Defendant, what is this nonsense?

406
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,323
I saved Hojun's soul!

407
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,702
I will be saved too!

408
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,069
I brought justice to that devil!

409
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,156
Defendant, calm down.

410
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,622
If you disrupt the court again,
you will be escorted out!

411
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,584
He kept mumbling to my ears.
Stop screaming at me!

412
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,036
I'm so sick of it!

413
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,377
It won't be easy, as expected.

414
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,881
What was that?

415
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,510
Guard! Take him out!

416
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,385
I did what I was told!
Get your hands off me, you devils!

417
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,637
Get off me!

418
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,851
I will be saved!

419
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,940
I will be saved!

420
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,190
Get off me! I'll be saved!

421
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,857
All right.

422
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,823
We'll end today's trial here.

423
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,740
If you have
any additional evidence to submit,

424
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,164
you can do so in writing.

425
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,242
All rise.

426
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,587
Hey, Daewoong.

427
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,604
Yihan! Mr. Cheon is here
with security guards.

428
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,268
I'm trying to stop them, but I don't think
I can hold out much longer.

429
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,649
Come at me, you punks!

430
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,241
YIHAN

431
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,880
Congratulations.

432
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,302
So you aced your first surgery
after five years.

433
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,885
I knew you could do it.

434
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,345
What's that look?

435
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,095
You should be thanking me.

436
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,596
I sent you Dr. Choi
right when you needed him.

437
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,855
So you saved the patient.

438
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,896
You sent Yosub to me?

439
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,073
Hostages are valuable when they are alive.

440
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,163
So I told him to go and save my hostage.

441
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,408
Could it be
that you want me to kill the patient?

442
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,126
Kill the patient?
What are you talking about?

443
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,665
Go and do your best
to save the patient as a doctor.

444
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,220
Call me once the surgery is over.

445
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,433
Why should I call you?

446
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,523
Yosub. Don't think about anything.

447
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,600
Just focus on your surgery as a doctor.

448
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,943
Okay.

449
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,985
-You punk.
-Stop!

450
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,945
You never said you would hurt him.

451
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,793
Come on.

452
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,422
That's enough. Move the patient now.

453
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,378
Doctor.

454
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,128
Proceed.

455
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,274
PATIENT ROOMS 1-3, OPERATING ROOM

456
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,437
So you kidnapped the patient?

457
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,695
You kidnapped a patient who's recovering
from surgery. And a minor at that.

458
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,985
This is beyond violating
the Medical Service Act.

459
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,526
Kidnap?

460
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,407
I got the parent's consent
and transferred him.

461
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,995
If you don't believe it,
you can check it yourself.

462
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,545
I felt ethically responsible
for your brother's death.

463
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,881
So I've been very lenient with you.

464
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,046
But if you come after my son
and Banseok again,

465
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,426
you must be ready to face the consequence.

466
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,888
Do you see it now?

467
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,233
Even if you dig two graves,
I won't be joining you.

468
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,056
So give up.

469
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,438
Unless you want to end up like your dad.

470
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,132
The plan fell through, right?

471
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,336
What will you do next?

472
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,721
You're on bad terms with Gu Jingi now.

473
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,483
They caught my knight.
So I must move my queen.

474
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,355
Lim Yuna?

475
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,364
In the hypothetical matchup against
Candidate Yoon Miseon of Daehan Party,

476
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,527
the gap was 4%.

477
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,615
But the gap in the ratings went up to 7%

478
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,254
in a four-person matchup
with the ruling party's candidate.

479
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,369
Various media outlets covered Ms. Lim
being the youngest director

480
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,167
of the R and D Center.

481
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,461
But Assemblywoman Yoon

482
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,554
raised suspicions if she had received
preferential treatment.

483
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,303
Due to the series of recent lawsuits
against Banseok Foundation,

484
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,258
its reputation has been damaged.

485
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,968
And it may possibly affect your ratings
to drop again in the future.

486
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,934
Do you think
I made you my campaign adviser,

487
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,398
so you could tell me what I already know?

488
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,478
If there's a problem,
bring me an alternative plan.

489
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,395
To make a crisis into an opportunity.

490
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,943
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll come up with a counterplan soon.

491
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,203
What brings you here?

492
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,196
I invited him.

493
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,290
I thought the ratings
might be giving you a headache.

494
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,883
I'm here to offer my help.

495
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,631
You want to help me? How?

496
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,054
Howard L. Junior,
the Republican presidential candidate.

497
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,257
How about a meeting with him?

498
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,143
The US and Korea.

499
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,720
A meeting between two
presidential candidates from two countries

500
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,062
would mean a lot, wouldn't it?

501
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:27,979
This is offensive.

502
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,061
I'm sure you know

503
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,361
about the bad blood between him and me
since my post as an ambassador in the US.

504
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,741
That's why I would like to help you.

505
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,445
I will set up a meeting so you two
can sort out the misunderstanding.

506
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,115
With the influence of Honours Hand.

507
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,909
I'm curious to know

508
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,788
why you are offering your help.

509
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,373
I would like to show you

510
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,038
that I will be more useful in helping you

511
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,501
become the president

512
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,420
than Chairman Gu Jingi.

513
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,182
He also knows

514
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,523
that Chairman Gu Jingi is weighing you

515
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,810
and Assemblywoman Yoon.

516
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,153
When someone tries
to have diamonds in both hands,

517
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,355
then you can

518
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,781
just break one of the diamonds.

519
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,793
I'm not sure
if this golf club will suit you.

520
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,958
Would you like to take a swing?

521
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,474
There's a similar proverb in Korean too.

522
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,095
An artisan doesn't blame his tools.

523
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,420
DR. HAN YIHAN

524
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,165
Dr. Han.

525
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,589
Was this your plan all along?

526
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,432
No. I…

527
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,304
Come to New-Hope right now.

528
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,733
It's all right. I wasn't wrong.

529
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,821
I got it! Stop talking to me!

530
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,152
<i>Stop whispering to me!</i>

531
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,856
Shut it! Shut your mouth!

532
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,832
Gosh. It only took a couple of days
for him to lose it.

533
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,620
He's a total nutcase now.

534
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,417
No. The gut of an investigator
with 30 years of experience tells me

535
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,379
that he's putting on an act.

536
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,299
If that's an act,
he should win the Grand Award.

537
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,878
He's been at it for 30 minutes.

538
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,928
<i>-I'll be saved.
</i>-Prosecutor Geum, tough case.

539
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,683
Can you give me some privacy?

540
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,006
-What?
-What?

541
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,596
I need to find out

542
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,314
why he's screwing us now.

543
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,225
INTERROGATION ROOM

544
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,268
I'll be saved.

545
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,574
Stop it! I did everything you asked me!

546
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,037
<i>Stop whispering to me.</i>

547
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,082
Stop talking to me. Just stop.

548
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,753
Stop whispering to me.

549
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,464
<i>Stop whispering to me.</i>

550
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,632
Stop it.

551
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,760
What? Keep acting crazy.

552
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,270
Cut your act. We need to talk.

553
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,073
I turned off the cameras.
I told everyone to leave the room.

554
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,819
If you don't trust me,
go and check it yourself.

555
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,412
I don't stab people
in the back unlike you.

556
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,713
I'm sorry…

557
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,923
for not keeping my promise.

558
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,720
You're sorry?

559
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,388
An apology won't cut it!

560
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,853
I had no choice.

561
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,978
That lawyer threatened me with my son.

562
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,273
<i>A transfer request?</i>

563
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:47,613
Yes. If you sign it,
we'll move your son back to Banseokwon.

564
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,235
You think I'm crazy?

565
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,907
Why would I let you
hold my son hostage again?

566
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,326
That's right.
He's a valuable hostage to us.

567
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,541
That's why when someone else has him,

568
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,671
it's better to get rid of him.

569
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,433
What are you implying?

570
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,850
Come on. Don't glare at me like that.
This is nothing new to you.

571
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,016
You killed Dr. Park too.

572
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,567
Wouldn't it be easier to kill your son
since he's not even conscious now?

573
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,863
If you do that, I will…

574
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,823
What? What are you going to do?

575
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,486
You're on death row.
You'll never get out of prison.

576
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,615
Are you going to stay
by his side or something?

577
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,080
If you still can't make up your mind,
let me tell you one more thing.

578
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,126
Prosecutor Geum's supervisor,

579
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,340
the senior prosecutor of Medical Crime
Department is on our side too.

580
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,756
This was a losing game from the get-go.

581
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,431
What if something were to happen to him?

582
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,768
You don't have to worry about that.

583
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,400
The people from New-Hope Medicine Clinic

584
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,863
aren't the type to harm a patient
in any circumstances.

585
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,801
I wanted to keep my promise. I mean it.

586
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,394
But my son is still unconscious.

587
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,388
If they were to do something to my son…

588
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,439
Right.

589
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,612
Mr. Han Yihan would never hurt a patient.

590
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,492
But I'm different.

591
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,493
I'm sure your wife must have told you.

592
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,615
I may not be able to kill your son,

593
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,003
but I can make him live in hell.

594
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,956
So you will have to do your best

595
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,302
to tell me all the secrets
between you and Gu Jingi.

596
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,917
If I don't get anything useful from you,

597
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,761
I don't know what I will do.

598
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,604
<i>I was in the dark too.</i>

599
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,442
I didn't even think
that he would request a transfer.

600
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,613
I'm sorry.

601
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,941
You saved my son's life.

602
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,485
I need you to testify then.

603
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,244
Not now.

604
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,118
He has my son again.

605
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,252
If I testify…

606
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,624
So…

607
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,670
-will you join hands with him again?
-No.

608
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,835
I have no intention of doing that.

609
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,509
It tormented me too.

610
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,256
If it weren't for my son,

611
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,473
I would've walked away long ago.

612
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,353
As soon as he wakes up,

613
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,520
I'll get him discharged right away.
And I'll testify to everything.

614
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,095
If I testify, my husband will do the same.

615
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,904
I don't want

616
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,940
to be forced to commit crimes
by the chairman any longer.

617
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,107
How can I trust you again?

618
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,664
You already betrayed me once.

619
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,818
Right. It won't be easy to trust me again.

620
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,155
So…

621
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,673
I want to tell you
one more crime I committed.

622
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,800
It's about Dr. Han Jihyuk.

623
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,510
Who?

624
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,178
Dr. Han Jihyuk…

625
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,062
didn't commit suicide.

626
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,941
He was forced to commit suicide.

627
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,740
Dad!

628
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,905
-Honey…
-No! Dad.

629
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,332
What do you mean?

630
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,616
My father

631
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,090
was forced to commit suicide?

632
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,255
<i>I killed him.</i>

633
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,969
What do you mean?

634
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,259
-I heard Yihan's father committed suicide.
-Right.

635
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,680
He hanged himself at his house.

636
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,808
And Director Gu Jingi

637
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,477
and I made him kill himself.

638
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,347
The late doctor and Director Gu Jingi

639
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,607
did compete for the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery position.

640
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,941
But they got along

641
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,155
until that incident.

642
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,072
"That incident?"

643
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,327
The former director of Banseok,
Jang Taejun.

644
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,332
You know him, right?

645
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,495
He was the founder of Banseok Foundation.

646
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,841
Your dad performed emergency surgery
on him for the aortic dissection.

647
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,919
But he died in the end.

648
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,376
How can I forget?

649
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,297
That surgery

650
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,681
ruined my family.

651
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,307
I was

652
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,644
on his surgery team.

653
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,193
And so was Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

654
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,074
<i>I'll stop the heart.</i>

655
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,532
After that, I'll run
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

656
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,363
And I'll operate
using the brain perfusion method.

657
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,528
That way, his heart will keep functioning,

658
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,198
and we can avoid brain damage.

659
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,406
No. It's too risky.

660
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,706
There have been only two cases.

661
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,457
I can't perform
an unverified surgery technique.

662
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,962
There were only two cases,
but their post-ops were excellent.

663
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,375
And the recent experimental research paper
had good results as well.

664
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,970
No.

665
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,643
I see him as my father-in-law first
before the chairman.

666
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,515
I can't let my family member
take such a huge risk like that.

667
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,768
Trust me, and let me do this. Okay?

668
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,980
I'll perform the surgery
and take full responsibility.

669
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,975
This technique will give him
a better chance of recovering.

670
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,402
I can't give up without even trying first.

671
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,698
The brain perfusion method
with the cardiopulmonary bypass machine…

672
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,319
is widely practiced now.

673
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,155
But 20 years ago,
no one tried that technique.

674
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,452
Even a major hospital like Banseok

675
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:14,036
didn't have a proper curriculum
for extracorporeal circulation back then.

676
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,915
But…

677
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,997
-my father…
-Yes.

678
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,296
But there was a problem.

679
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,221
His BP is dropping.

680
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,219
His BP keeps dropping. At this rate…

681
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,261
Pump. Keep his vitals stable.

682
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,305
What about his head? Cerebral oximeter.

683
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,719
It's at 12. It keeps dropping.

684
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,267
-Increase the pump flow.
-I can't. Not enough drainage.

685
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,652
He might have a cardiac arrest.

686
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,361
Raise it!

687
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,572
Oddly, the bleeding was severe.

688
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,858
Back then, I wasn't as experienced.

689
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,026
So I couldn't handle
this type of emergency situation.

690
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,448
To be honest, there was something
I couldn't understand even more.

691
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,623
The late chairman's health condition

692
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,129
couldn't be disclosed to the public,

693
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,919
so I understood the minimum number
of staff was on the surgical team.

694
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,839
And I knew it was an emergency surgery.

695
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:07,432
But Dr. Lee Dohyung
had just gotten his medical license.

696
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,048
And making him the anesthesiologist…

697
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,388
Who put together the team?

698
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,443
Chairman Gu Jingi.

699
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,557
<i>He was never going
to save the late chairman.</i>

700
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,275
That's why he put Lee Dohyung on the team.
An inexperienced anesthesiologist

701
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,239
who doesn't deserve to be called a doctor.

702
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,660
So they wanted the patient to die
from the beginning?

703
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,776
Why?

704
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,197
Because Jang Taejun

705
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,575
had chosen to appoint Dr. Han Jihyuk
the next director of the hospital.

706
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,962
He thought
if Gu Jingi became the director,

707
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,341
his sons, Jang Jungtae and Jang Yoontae,

708
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,375
wouldn't be able to survive in Banseok.

709
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,797
A father was looking out
for his incompetent sons.

710
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,509
But still.
How could he kill his father-in-law?

711
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,555
He was his wife's father.

712
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,519
Think about everything he did so far.

713
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,023
You know
he's more than capable of doing so.

714
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,402
Look who's talking, right?

715
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,274
I'm the one

716
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,817
who framed Dr. Han Jihyuk for bribery
under Director Gu Jingi's order.

717
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,660
Just like

718
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,160
how Han Yihan was framed five years ago.

719
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,712
INTERROGATION ROOM

720
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,521
You said my father was
forced to commit suicide.

721
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,902
How did Gu Jingi

722
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,525
drive my father to death?

723
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,986
Back then,

724
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,122
it was before the computer system
was implemented.

725
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,754
So we had to write
the surgery records manually.

726
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,337
But…

727
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,376
You want me to change the record

728
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,336
about administering hemostatics?

729
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,261
But why…

730
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,717
He said he would take full responsibility.

731
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,015
So we must give him what he wants.

732
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,019
But that's a crime.

733
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,611
I'm sorry.

734
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,728
I'll pretend I didn't hear…

735
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,147
Then will you take responsibility?

736
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,202
Pardon?

737
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,030
If Han Jihyuk doesn't take responsibility,
you will be next

738
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,621
to blame for operating
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

739
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,248
Wouldn't that be unfair?

740
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,827
If he didn't insist
on the brain profusion method,

741
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,591
this wouldn't have happened.

742
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,665
Just this once.

743
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,548
If you turn a blind eye just this once,
I'll promise you

744
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,385
that a lot of things will change.

745
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,143
<i>Just once.</i>

746
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,557
I was only going to do that just once.

747
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,403
Back then, I was young too.

748
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,231
And I was scared.

749
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,109
I regretted what I did
after your father left the hospital.

750
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,855
But not my husband.

751
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,622
It took years for him to invent
a surgical device, Contentor.

752
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,621
And Chairman Gu Jingi
approved the purchase.

753
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,245
So he was barely able
to avoid going bankrupt.

754
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,125
I was against this,
but I couldn't reason with him.

755
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,499
He said it was too late to pull out

756
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,264
and we were on the same boat with him.

757
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,377
So…

758
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,724
after framing my father for everything,

759
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,217
the hospital shamelessly filed a lawsuit,

760
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,234
demanding an astronomical sum of money
for the damage.

761
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,478
That was all

762
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,015
to corner my father to death.

763
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,650
It was Gu Jingi.

764
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,407
I'm sorry.

765
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:07,462
I didn't expect
Dr. Han Jihyuk to die like that.

766
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,165
It didn't even cross my mind.

767
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,843
I continued to regret it.

768
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,878
But then Junhwan was born,
and I found out about his weak heart.

769
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,100
Since then, I had no choice
but to obey him.

770
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,722
I'm sorry.

771
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,064
I'm… I'm so sorry.

772
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,162
You've done well.

773
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,498
You successfully finished
that tough surgery,

774
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,294
so I could end everything smoothly.

775
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,463
Don't mention it.

776
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,511
You won't face any problems

777
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,053
at tomorrow's heart transplant
if you perform like today.

778
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,262
It should even be easier.

779
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,522
It's much less dangerous than
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surgery.

780
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,021
And you'll be with an experienced senior.

781
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,937
Hyunseong, you should leave
the past behind.

782
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:19,235
You two should trust each other and
lead the Cardiothoracic Surgery together.

783
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,528
Dr. Choi is a talent
we cannot live without

784
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,786
in this hospital.

785
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,786
I should do that.

786
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,126
Let's have a good run, Dr. Choi.

787
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,668
Yes.

788
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,933
All right. Have a drink.

789
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,163
What a loss.

790
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,832
That was expensive liquor.

791
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,705
I feel bad for Han Yihan.

792
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,918
He keeps getting betrayed
by the ones he trusted.

793
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,678
Anyway, welcome aboard.
Let's make things work together.

794
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,404
Thank you.

795
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,148
You don't have to thank me.

796
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,938
Just throw it out after.

797
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,687
And wipe that too.

798
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,178
<i>Father, it has been days.</i>

799
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,600
Enough is enough.

800
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,432
I'm sorry, my son.

801
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,937
I'm…

802
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,693
I'm sorry.

803
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,650
You always say you're sorry,
but it's just words!

804
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,532
Don't you see this?

805
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,784
We're about to lose our home
because of your malpractice.

806
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,282
You aren't the only one who's in distress.

807
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,870
Mom is out preparing for the lawsuit.

808
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,370
You can't sit here and drink.

809
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,004
I'll take responsibility.

810
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,796
I'll take care of everything.

811
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,012
I'll make sure our family doesn't suffer.

812
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,506
I'll take responsibility.

813
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,217
I'll do it.

814
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,011
I'm sorry.

815
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,224
I receive a lot of help from you,
but your plan didn't go through.

816
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,470
It's all right.

817
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,061
Not all investments lead to success.

818
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:40,146
However, this time,
I need you two to cooperate with my plan.

819
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,110
What's the plan?

820
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:46,395
There's an extraordinary board meeting
for Banseok Foundation next week.

821
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,908
THE FOUNDER OF BANSEOK FOUNDATION
JANG TAEJUN

822
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,529
Jang Yoontae and Jang Jungtae.

823
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,736
The sons of Jang Taejun,
the founder of Banseok Foundation.

824
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,502
They're both directors of the foundation.

825
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,207
Five years ago, the princes' coup failed,

826
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,080
and they've kept low profiles since then.

827
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,961
But apparently, they've been meeting
other directors in secret

828
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,666
before this extraordinary board meeting.

829
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,297
Our plan is to make the chairman
out of the older son, Jang Yoontae,

830
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,255
to minimize the influence
Chairman Gu Jingi has over the board.

831
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,386
This is our only timing.

832
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,186
Chairman Gu Jingi will put down

833
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,686
every title related to Banseok Foundation
before his hearing for the ministership.

834
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,989
2022 THE 3RD EXTRAORDINARY
BOARD MEETING ITEMS

835
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,825
Directors Jang Yoontae and Jang Jungtae

836
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,372
will take the lead
in suggesting your dismissal

837
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,326
of the titles you hold at the foundation
before your appointment.

838
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,963
It'll be tough to fight.
That's the custom.

839
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:51,092
But I cannot let those two
have the chairmanship.

840
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:55,808
Once your wife returns, she can take
the chairmanship of the foundation.

841
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,556
But do leave the hospital director open
until you find an adequate candidate.

842
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,938
I'll do it.

843
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,766
Yuna is much younger than I am,
but she's the director of a center.

844
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,975
I don't see why not.

845
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,156
Please trust me and leave it to me.

846
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,160
I'll prove myself.

847
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,448
<i>And the hospital director?</i>

848
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,373
The director of Banseok University
Medical Center will be left open soon.

849
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,123
Do you have anyone in your mind?

850
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,503
Of course.

851
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,249
I see him right before me.

852
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,343
If Honours Hand takes
Banseok Foundation over as planned,

853
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,846
I'll have Dr. Han appointed
as the director of the hospital.

854
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,182
Thank you for your offer,

855
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,270
but I am not interested.

856
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,773
Are you sure?

857
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,268
If you become
the director of the hospital,

858
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,687
it'll be the best revenge you can have
against Chairman Gu Jingi.

859
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,360
We still have time, so give it a thought.

860
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,992
If you do not take
what your enemy cherishes the most,

861
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,661
no matter what your revenge is,

862
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,330
how can that be any meaningful?

863
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,502
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

864
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,964
It's not like Honours Hand
already has enough shares.

865
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,170
You don't know
if the directors will do as you like.

866
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,921
That's why I prepared

867
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,088
the best card to convince the board.

868
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,205
I heard the story.

869
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,377
That you are
the best cardiac surgeon in Korea

870
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:54,012
who stood in for Director Gu Hyunseong.

871
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,046
Is this true?

872
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,513
Please give me an answer.

873
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,135
Have you been operating

874
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,152
on the hearts of Banseokwon's VIPs

875
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,268
in Gu Hyunseong's place?

876
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,201
That's correct.

877
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,411
I'm the doctor
who operated in Gu Hyunseong's place.

878
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,583
I'm his ghost doctor, Han Yihan.

879
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,132
WE THANK LEE JUNGYEOL
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

880
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,520
Can you be in charge of my heart?

881
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,639
Have you ever received heart surgery?

882
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,442
<i>Did you put a tail on us?</i>

883
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,231
What do you mean?

884
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,533
<i>Let's talk for a moment.</i>

885
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,359
<i>I'm not with them. I'm an attorney.</i>
