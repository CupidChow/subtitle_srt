1
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,458
Thank you.

2
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,653
Wow, you're so hardworking.

3
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,326
Hey, wait.

4
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,618
Are you done with your tasks
for the restaurant expansion?

5
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:12,951
Of course.

6
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:14,451
Deck?

7
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:16,118
All done.

8
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:19,143
Don't you have any deliverables
left for your clients?

9
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,168
They're all for approval.

10
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:25,451
Are you sure? I don't want you
to get scolded.

11
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,679
Wow, are we having a feast?
Did you help cook these?

12
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,148
What's for dinner?

13
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:35,672
Wow, braised pork! My favorite.

14
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,680
Ubel.

15
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,171
I've seen your grades.

16
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:46,993
Congratulations.

17
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,916
You're a consistent dean's lister.

18
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,271
It seems like being a medical
student is so easy for you.

19
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:55,994
Thank you.

20
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:01,269
You are the perfect daughter that
every parent will love.

21
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:04,875
You don't waste opportunities
that come to you.

22
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Agatha.

23
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:10,034
Have you forwarded the proposal
for Mr. Cruz?

24
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:11,856
- Yes, Dad.
- Very good.

25
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,743
Is the file in PDF format?
You know Mr. Cruz,

26
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:17,951
he gets irritated if
it's not in PDF format.

27
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,243
He accidentally edits a document
if it's not in PDF format.

28
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:23,911
Hey.

29
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:25,786
What's happening to you?

30
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:28,262
I think it wasn't a PDF file.

31
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,495
My goodness.

32
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:34,743
I was so sleepy
so I sent it right away.

33
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:37,786
Not in a PDF format? Agatha.

34
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:40,879
You are the marketing head
of expansion.

35
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:44,419
You've always done it. Why does
it seem like you're clueless?

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,408
- I'll just call--
- Don't.

37
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:51,940
I'll do it. Do I have to check
on your every move?

38
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,079
You can't even do a simple task!

39
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,424
Hello, Mr. Cruz?

40
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:10,034
How are you?

41
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:14,294
Do you want some ice cream?
To calm you down.

42
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:17,502
Are you okay?

43
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:22,563
My dessert is Dad's scolding.
Do you think I'd want that?

44
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:29,856
I'm not your enemy.
I don't want to fight you.

45
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:37,062
My anxiety level whenever
I see Dad...

46
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:38,962
I feel like I'm going to die.

47
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,376
He always sees my mistakes.

48
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,455
Why is Dad like that?

49
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:49,039
He treats me like
I'm not his daughter.

50
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,255
He treats you like his own.
He's prouder of you than me.

51
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,963
I'm glad we knew each other.

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,572
When I was a kid,

53
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:05,451
I was happy that Sir June chose
to sponsor me in the orphanage.

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,755
He paid for my studies.

55
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:14,743
He even paid for my apartment.

56
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:16,826
You were like a superhero
back then.

57
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,243
When I was being bullied,

58
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,826
you stood up for me,
that's why Dad liked you.

59
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,326
We're great, aren't we?

60
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:28,118
Best friends turned into lovers.

61
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,451
When did we meet again?

62
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,618
When was it?

63
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,243
Happy friendship anniversary!

64
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:45,243
Today is the day we met.

65
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,826
It was the day that
changed my life.

66
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:52,743
That's beautiful.

67
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,743
Sorry, I didn't get you a gift.

68
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:05,326
It slipped my mind because of Dad.

69
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,826
It's okay.

70
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,118
I'm used to it.

71
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,534
Kidding.

72
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,243
Ever since I met you,

73
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:20,618
I never felt that I was alone.

74
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:23,743
What's our BFF promise again?

75
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:25,618
Hey, you're too harsh!

76
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,534
Of course, I won't forget that.

77
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:30,534
Leave no one behind.

78
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,951
Always.

79
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,743
How do you do that?

80
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,534
Do what?

81
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:42,594
Being top of your class
as a medical student,

82
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:46,034
while working as a
part-time virtual assistant.

83
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:47,951
Even though Dad supports you.

84
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,205
Well, I have no other
options in life.

85
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,927
You're the only one I have.

86
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,410
And my dream of
becoming a doctor.

87
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,294
If I don't do my best,

88
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,195
I might lose you.

89
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,429
In being a virtual assistant,

90
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:10,411
I want to show your dad that

91
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,247
I am resourceful.

92
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,948
I can provide for you.

93
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,743
So that when the time comes

94
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:20,034
that we will come out to him,

95
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,755
he can entrust you to me.

96
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,786
Are you okay?

97
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm okay. I was just...

98
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,142
...surprised with what you said.

99
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,476
Let's just enjoy the present.

100
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,500
Let's not think too far ahead.

101
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,939
Alright.

102
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,505
Okay, team.

103
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,325
Make sure all the deliverables
that we have are ready.

104
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,058
Let's show our investors

105
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,292
that they were right in
choosing us.

106
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:36,608
We are going to be the biggest
restaurant in the Philippines.

107
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,744
Sir.

108
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:40,236
Oh?

109
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,513
No mistakes.

110
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:44,659
No excuses.

111
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:46,576
Enjoy your weekend.

112
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:47,896
Okay.

113
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,904
Okay, I have to go.
I'm so sorry, I'll go ahead.

114
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,554
Ma'am is in a hurry.
Maybe she has a date.

115
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,368
- She has a date.
- Ooh, a date.

116
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,659
You have a date?

117
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,868
Go on, so you can
give me a grandchild.

118
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:02,868
And make up for
your shortcomings.

119
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,504
Oh?

120
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,974
Meeting adjourned.

121
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,049
Oh?

122
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,784
What happened?

123
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,451
It’s just a movie and chill
kind of date,

124
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,451
but it seems like you’re not
in the mood for it.

125
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,576
It's because of Daddy.

126
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,284
Why?

127
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:47,868
What is it this time?

128
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:50,935
You're still not used to him?

129
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,951
If you always let him get to you,

130
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,650
you won't achieve anything.

131
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,076
I was teased by the people
at the restaurant earlier.

132
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:09,289
Then Dad suddenly said he wants
to have a grandchild.

133
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,336
So I can make up for my failures.

134
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,411
Then?

135
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,328
What if Daddy finds out
about us?

136
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,076
What will happen to me?

137
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,427
What will happen to us?

138
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,065
I don't know!

139
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:45,368
When will we come out?

140
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,028
Do you want us to just
hide forever?

141
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,951
That's not what I meant.

142
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,595
But...

143
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:05,868
But what?

144
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,458
I'm waiting for the right timing.

145
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Hey.

146
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,190
Don't be mad.

147
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,951
It's always like this.

148
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,951
This is the first time I'm
seeing you like that.

149
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,559
It's scary.

150
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,743
Hey.

151
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,784
Don't be mad.

152
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:50,284
Here's your coffee, sir.

153
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:51,576
Thank you, Manang.

154
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,417
Why are you still standing there?

155
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:07,734
Are you okay?

156
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,099
I'm okay, sir.

157
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,942
It's just that...

158
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:16,513
I find Agatha and Ubel indecent.

159
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,859
Why is that?

160
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:23,938
They're too old to act like that.

161
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,076
It seems...

162
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:27,713
Like...

163
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,622
Maybe they're also like that
outside the house.

164
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,091
People might think of that
as inappropriate.

165
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,784
Manang...

166
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:42,266
You've seen them
grow up, haven't you?

167
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,244
When I sponsored Ubel,

168
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:47,493
those two have become
like sisters to each other.

169
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,493
I am just confused.

170
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,836
They are both...

171
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,784
- ...beautiful
- Oh.

172
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:55,505
- and educated.
- Oh.

173
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,591
But...

174
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,437
It seems like...

175
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:04,114
They never had boyfriends.

176
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:05,576
Manang.

177
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:08,005
I think they're looking for you
in the kitchen.

178
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,688
You're just making up
rumors about them.

179
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,930
Maybe they're just picky.

180
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:16,635
- Thank you.
- Alright, sir.

181
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,005
Agatha.

183
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,229
I have a Zoom meeting later.

184
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,643
You'll attend in my place. Okay?

185
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:36,189
Okay, Dad.

186
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:39,201
Ubel, did you sleep here?

187
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:41,601
I didn't notice you.

188
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,653
Ah... yes.

189
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,312
Do you have a problem
with your apartment?

190
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,922
It's fine.

191
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,868
Thank you.

192
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:55,476
I just noticed that
you're always here

193
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:59,293
even though you are
busy with school.

194
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,734
And I heard you're also
a virtual assistant?

195
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:07,427
Well, I don't have a problem
with you staying here.

196
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:10,361
I want you to tell me if there's
any problem with your apartment

197
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:12,469
so we can find you another one.

198
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:16,559
Alright.

199
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,701
I'm going out later.

200
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,935
I'm going to the wake of
my high school classmate.

201
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,576
You know,

202
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:28,201
I feel sorry for my classmate.

203
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:29,784
She died...

204
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:34,284
...a spinster. No husband,
no child.

205
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,076
No one cared for her.

206
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,627
Alright, Dad. We'll go
upstairs and get dressed.

207
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:43,701
Wait.

208
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:45,935
I want to ask you something.

209
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,993
Haven't you two been in
any romantic relationships?

210
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,784
You know...

211
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,868
It's hard to live alone.

212
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,323
You need to find a man

213
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,348
who's responsible and
who will love you.

214
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:11,868
I'm in a relationship but
it's complicated.

215
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:14,868
What's complicated about

216
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,868
a relationship between a
man and a woman?

217
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:26,368
I'm busy with medical school
so I can't fully commit.

218
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,284
Well, that makes sense.

219
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,993
How about you, Agatha?

220
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,076
I don't have a boyfriend
yet, Dad.

221
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:34,711
You know...

222
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,711
You need to find a man
who can provide for you.

223
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,195
Who can give everything
you want.

224
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,211
Someone who can give you a child.

225
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,211
So someone can take care
of you when you're old.

226
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,090
Right?

227
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:05,857
It's like a hotel function room...

228
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,161
Agatha. Are you busy?

229
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,395
Not so much. I'm just
finishing something.

230
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Well...

231
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:18,505
Lawrence, I'd like you to meet
my daughter, Agatha.

232
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,180
Lawrence is a businessman.

233
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:24,205
He is the supplier of
livestock products

234
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,938
to major restaurants in
the Philippines.

235
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:29,701
Lawrence, this is Agatha.

236
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,784
Hi, I'm Lawrence.

237
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,203
Agatha.

238
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,426
You know what?

239
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:39,951
Neither of you wants
to get married yet.

240
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,101
You're too focused on
your life goals.

241
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:46,107
So your dad and I agreed that...

242
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:50,356
You two would click. You know?

243
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,898
You're both workaholics.

244
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,406
Problems at work?

245
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:19,181
I don't want to talk about it,
I'm not in the mood.

246
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,205
What's the problem?

247
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:25,122
Why?

248
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,701
Hey.

249
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:35,059
Earlier, Dad...

250
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
He introduced me to a man.

251
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,993
It's awkward. So annoying.

252
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,493
This is what I'm afraid of.

253
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,576
What's your plan for us?

254
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:50,493
You'll keep me hidden in
a box forever?

255
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:51,893
I know you're struggling.

256
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,701
But I'm having a hard time too.

257
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,993
Have you ever thought about
what could happen?

258
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,122
What could happen?

259
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:05,576
Here we go again.
Over and over.

260
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:07,701
Do you want the truth?

261
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:11,989
What's the truth? Come on.

262
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,076
My dad won't accept us.

263
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,868
The people around us
won't accept us.

264
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,701
You're smart.
You should know that.

265
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,368
You're scared that people
won't accept you?

266
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:25,201
Or maybe you're scared
that you can't accept yourself?

267
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,076
What are you doing here?

268
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,284
How long have you been here?

269
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,368
No, I just got here.

270
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:11,868
I brought you food.

271
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:14,076
It's delicious. My mom made it.

272
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,544
I'm sorry for what
happened last time.

273
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,781
I was forced to go because
your dad picked me up.

274
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,639
It would be embarrassing if...

275
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:26,956
I didn't go.

276
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:30,442
I was surprised too.

277
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,175
He just suddenly introduced you.

278
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,784
He didn't give me a heads-up.

279
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:35,076
It's annoying.

280
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,201
They still treat us like kids

281
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,868
even though we're old
enough to decide.

282
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,703
They still want to be in control.

283
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,228
Dad is pressuring me to
start a family.

284
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,201
He thinks what he's
asking is easy to do.

285
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,701
Same with me.

286
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,701
Don't get me wrong.

287
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,201
You're beautiful.

288
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:55,868
And I know we can get along.

289
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:59,493
But I still have personal goals

290
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:01,143
that I want to achieve.

291
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:03,076
I don't want to rush.

292
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:07,076
I wish they had thought
of that too.

293
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,898
I wish they're thinking of
what we want,

294
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,131
and not what they want for us.

295
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:16,576
Thank God we're on
the same page.

296
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,701
So what are we going to do?

297
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,076
Well.

298
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,993
All they want is for us to talk.

299
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,333
So let's give them what they want.

300
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,312
Let's talk.

301
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,784
As early as now, I'm warning you.

302
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:36,201
My dad is stubborn.

303
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:39,201
He's a bit pushy
to get what he wants.

304
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,681
Is there anyone more
stubborn than my dad?

305
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:44,701
What if...

306
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,993
We get your dad

307
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,364
and my dad to get married?

308
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:52,493
After all, they're already
getting along, right?

309
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,493
Are you both okay?

310
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,836
Agatha, you haven't introduced
me to your friend yet.

311
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,446
I'm Lawrence.

312
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:56,697
I'm Ubel. Agatha's girlfriend.

313
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,284
Girlfriend?

314
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:04,576
Yes, girlfriend.

315
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,705
Female friend.

316
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:09,493
Girl best friend.

317
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:10,993
That's why...

318
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:14,076
It seems like there is a
screening committee.

319
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:16,758
But it's a good trait for a best friend.

320
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,383
Protective.

321
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:21,919
Come on. Let's eat.

322
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,784
I'm sorry, but...

323
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:29,953
Agatha doesn't eat
high-calorie food.

324
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:33,371
We're starting to do
calorie deficit.

325
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,443
She doesn't want high-calorie food.

326
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,344
Yes? Do you have a problem?

327
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,180
Nothing.

328
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,391
It has mayonnaise dressing...

329
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,213
It's high in calories.

330
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,637
You're a know-it-all, aren't you?

331
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:55,399
I'm not. Why are you so grumpy?

332
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,493
You're too protective of Agatha.

333
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:01,784
It's good that you've told me
you're best friends

334
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:02,993
because if not,

335
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,493
I would think you're
in a relationship.

336
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,697
I guess

337
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:11,265
we can both eat that?

338
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,229
Let's eat.

339
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,189
Okay.

340
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,958
Uhm...

341
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,453
You can eat.

342
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,705
What was your problem?

343
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:49,701
What's your problem?

344
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,784
Huh?

345
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,205
I'm not blind.

346
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,281
I saw you laughing with him.

347
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,368
He's just nice.

348
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,284
What do you want me
to do? Ignore him?

349
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,076
What will I say to Daddy?

350
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,076
Are you blind?

351
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,201
It's obvious that he likes you.

352
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:12,284
So?

353
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:13,368
You're acting stupid?

354
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,576
Lawrence is a good man.

355
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:19,368
Like me, his parents are also
forcing him to get married.

356
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:22,504
He's also in a bind.

357
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:25,029
Why do I feel like I have a rival?

358
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:29,201
You can't prevent me from
getting worried and jealous.

359
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,635
You have nothing to
be jealous of.

360
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:37,576
He doesn't like me either.

361
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:41,784
You shouldn't have
disrespected him.

362
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,076
He's not doing anything wrong.

363
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,359
He's just following orders.

364
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,576
So you're defending him now?

365
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,284
It's not like that.

366
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,869
I just want you to treat him well.

367
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,868
If only you would
talk to him seriously,

368
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,868
I'm sure you won't
feel that way.

369
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:06,701
Why does it seem like you
know him well already?

370
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,701
Huh?

371
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,284
You're difficult to talk to.

372
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:13,201
We don't understand each other.

373
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,076
What if I'm the one talking
to someone like Lawrence?

374
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:18,701
Would you feel happy?

375
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,997
I won't get angry because
I'm not narrow-minded.

376
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:25,868
We are not the only people
in the world.

377
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,993
Isn't it weird that...

378
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,220
We're still here...

379
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,329
even if your daddy went
upstairs already?

380
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,828
He said I should entertain you.

381
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,993
How will you entertain me?

382
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:52,076
Are you an entertainer?

383
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,576
You're silly.

384
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,493
But, seriously.

385
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:00,493
Won't your dad get angry that
we're both still here?

386
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:04,076
He likes you a lot so
he won't get angry.

387
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:06,213
Now...

388
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:10,145
I know why Ubel is so
protective of you.

389
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,099
She owes your family a lot.

390
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:21,868
Are you okay?

391
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,005
Don't be pressured.

392
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:29,493
We don't need to please our parents.

393
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,201
If...

394
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,701
You want us to be just friends...

395
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,244
It's okay.

396
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:38,835
If...

397
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,821
That's what you want.

398
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,076
You know...

399
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:49,701
For the first time,

400
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:53,868
my dad was really happy
because of you.

401
00:29:58,368 --> 00:29:59,784
Maybe...

402
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,617
He would be happier
if we'd end up together.

403
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:16,297
Do you think you'll like me?

404
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,493
Why not?

405
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,493
I like your company.

406
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,005
I think we'll get along.

407
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:36,993
What if...

408
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,868
We become a couple?

409
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,076
A couple?

410
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:56,493
Are we a couple now?

411
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:57,518
Yes.

412
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:10,697
Wow, someone's making up to me.

413
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,583
How's Lawrence?

414
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:26,400
Is he still bothering you?

415
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,701
Let's not talk about him.

416
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,793
What's the problem?

417
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Is Sir June bothering you?

418
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,951
Lawrence is already my boyfriend.

419
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:22,603
I thought we were okay.

420
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:25,955
What did we just do?

421
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,034
Goodbye sex?

422
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:31,070
Let me explain.

423
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:33,887
What lie will you tell me this time?

424
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,192
I'm trying to understand you
because I love you.

425
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:40,794
You fooled me!

426
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:45,243
How about our promise
to each other?

427
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:46,743
Tell me.

428
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:49,326
That we'll be together forever.

429
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,534
What?!

430
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:58,159
Say something!

431
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:00,659
You're not gonna say anything?

432
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:04,159
Say everything you want to say!

433
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:08,243
Do you want to hurt me? Do it!

434
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:14,826
How dare you act like that.

435
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,951
You're shameless.

436
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:23,951
After you lied to me?

437
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,821
You treat me this way?

438
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:40,451
I did this...

439
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,659
So Daddy will be proud of me.

440
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,034
Even if he doesn't say it...

441
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,326
My whole life, he made me feel like

442
00:35:55,326 --> 00:35:58,826
Mom's death was my fault.

443
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,326
Lawrence...

444
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:06,826
He's the reason why Daddy
is pleased with me.

445
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,095
Can you blame me for doing this?

446
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,326
I've been waiting my whole life

447
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,326
for the day to come

448
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:25,392
that I would feel like
I am my Dad's daughter.

449
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:29,677
But do we need to
make a sacrifice?

450
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:36,617
Sorry.

451
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:42,002
But we need to break up.

452
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,451
It's delicious.

453
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:06,369
Dad. Lawrence and I
are now dating.

454
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:14,951
Are you guys serious?

455
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:20,093
Oh my god. I'm so happy.

456
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,659
I'm so proud of you.

457
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,612
Should I welcome you
to the family?

458
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,951
Uhm... sir.

459
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:36,451
I promise that...

460
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:39,730
I'll love and take care of
your daughter.

461
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:41,263
More than my life.

462
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:43,788
You know, I'm friends with your dad.

463
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:47,230
He's a good man.
I know he raised you right.

464
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,743
You don't have to promise me.

465
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:52,951
I know you'll care for Agatha
and treat her right.

466
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:00,564
Congrats.

467
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,951
You deserve each other.

468
00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:08,747
How about you, Ubel?

469
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:12,555
When will you introduce
your partner to us?

470
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,496
So you can have a double
date with your best friend!

471
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,617
He broke up with me.

472
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,159
What happened?

473
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,747
He was ashamed of me.
Maybe because...

474
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,689
I am an orphan.

475
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:32,659
You know,

476
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,743
you will also find the
right person for you.

477
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:37,268
You're lucky, Lawrence.

478
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:39,876
My partner and Agatha
are very different.

479
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:42,159
Right, Agatha?

480
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,826
I'll say my goodbyes now.

481
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,088
I'm leaving.

482
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:57,159
I might be gone for a week.

483
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:59,534
And will not be able
to visit here.

484
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:02,731
I have a lot to do at school.

485
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,173
Also...

486
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,916
My part-time job's schedule
got changed.

487
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:12,375
Anyway, when you need anything,

488
00:39:13,455 --> 00:39:14,747
just call us.

489
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,762
I'll go upstairs first.

490
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,002
Okay.

491
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:39,864
Congrats.

492
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:40,889
Thank you.

493
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:47,534
Baby.

494
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:50,951
I have a friend who is
looking for a date,

495
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,159
Maybe we can refer Ubel?

496
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:55,743
- Why her?
- No reason.

497
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:59,326
I just remembered what
she said before

498
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:00,826
that her boyfriend broke up
with her, right?

499
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,034
So maybe...

500
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:04,080
I thought she might
be available.

501
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:05,897
I don't know if she'd want to.

502
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:09,478
We haven't talked to each
other for weeks.

503
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,826
Did you two fight?

504
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,159
We didn't.

505
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:17,034
Maybe she's just busy at
work and school.

506
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:19,326
You didn't fight because of me?

507
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:20,951
Not at all.

508
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,326
I'll just check my phone
for messages.

509
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:36,993
How are you?

510
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:41,409
I'm okay.

511
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:45,784
You've been gone for a long time.

512
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,493
Should I even answer that?

513
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,118
- Isn't it obvious?
- Sorry.

514
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,820
I was really hurt by what you did.

515
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:06,596
So I decided to leave for a while.

516
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,875
But something happened.

517
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:16,493
Why? What happened?

518
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,701
I have a classmate

519
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:25,658
who wanted to court me
for a long time.

520
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:28,701
But I rejected him.

521
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:33,812
He messed around my apartment.

522
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:37,681
He wanted to get in.

523
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,415
When did that start?

524
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:43,070
It's been a while.

525
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:46,383
I just didn't tell you earlier.

526
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,008
I didn't want to...

527
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,153
...add to your problems.

528
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:54,261
You should have told me that.

529
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:59,409
I filed a report but...

530
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:02,201
I'm still scared to stay alone
in that apartment.

531
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:07,122
So I want to move somewhere
near the school.

532
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:08,493
But...

533
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:11,197
I haven't found a place yet.

534
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:13,883
Maybe it's better for you
to stay here in the meantime.

535
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,408
I won't have to worry.

536
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:51,763
Why are you studying here?

537
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,719
You and Lawrence were too noisy.

538
00:44:56,744 --> 00:45:00,034
I can't focus. So I moved here.

539
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,947
Sorry.

540
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:19,797
Is Lawrence good?

541
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:30,534
Which of us is better in bed?

542
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:39,368
Do you love him more than me?

543
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,341
Does he make you happy...

544
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:50,609
...as much as I did?

545
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:39,921
Good morning.

546
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,492
What's up? Where's Lawrence?

547
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,625
Are you going to tell him?

548
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,995
Lawrence left earlier.

549
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:56,011
Try the breakfast I made for you.

550
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,542
Tell him what?

551
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,695
Wait.

552
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:03,625
Why did you make an effort?

553
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,150
Here you go again.

554
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,417
Acting like you have no idea.

555
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,042
Sorry, but I really don't
understand.

556
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,250
Something happened to
us last night, right?

557
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:18,542
So, that means...

558
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,750
We're back together.

559
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,333
Are you going to break
up with Lawrence?

560
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,250
What?

561
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:28,833
Last night was just a
one-time thing.

562
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,542
I missed you, but...

563
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,833
That doesn't mean
I'll break up with him.

564
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,625
So you just used me last night?

565
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,125
You just used me to finish?

566
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,750
Or we just misunderstood
each other--

567
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,750
Wait.

568
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,542
A misunderstanding?

569
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:50,625
What am I to you?

570
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,333
Do you think so little of me?

571
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:56,833
I'm sorry if you thought we could
return to how we were.

572
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,333
What am I to you?

573
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:01,833
An object that you'd throw away

574
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:03,774
when you don't need me anymore?

575
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,188
You know,

576
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,370
in my whole life,

577
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,625
I've never felt like this.

578
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,417
I've never felt worse than trash.

579
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,333
I will never forget this.

580
00:50:27,144 --> 00:50:28,641
Give us a few more minutes.

581
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:30,583
She should be here.

582
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,583
She just messaged me.

583
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,500
Anyway, once you see
the presentations,

584
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
it's gonna blow your--

585
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,583
Great.

586
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,792
- Finally.
- Hey. I'm sorry, I'm late.

587
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:42,000
That's okay.

588
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,708
So...

589
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,000
We will now present our
marketing ideas

590
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,083
for our business expansion.

591
00:50:57,938 --> 00:50:59,938
This is gonna be exciting.

592
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,917
- Will that take long?
- I'm sorry.

593
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:12,792
I can't open it.

594
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:15,583
Please give me a minute.

595
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,222
Trying to fix it.

596
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:27,083
What's missing? Anything I can do?

597
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,417
June.

598
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:29,859
We should reschedule.

599
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,513
Mr. Ligot.

600
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,583
I'm sorry.

601
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,917
I'm really sorry.

602
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,708
We can't fix this now.

603
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:41,708
I'll go ahead.

604
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:44,292
I'll have my secretary call you

605
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:46,708
for our next meeting.

606
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:48,406
Thank you very much.

607
00:51:48,544 --> 00:51:49,878
Be safe.

608
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,500
You're so stupid!

609
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:05,331
You know that Mr. Ligot
is an important investor, right?

610
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,708
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Sorry?

611
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,524
What's going on with you?

612
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:13,286
I sent you to a good school.

613
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:15,520
And this is what you give me?

614
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,250
Huh?

615
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:20,042
What's going on with your head?

616
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,833
You know.

617
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,333
Your mom.

618
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,542
My wife.

619
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,333
Died!

620
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:32,667
Giving birth...

621
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,458
To you.

622
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:41,000
Agatha, you are such a
disappointment.

623
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,542
I've decided to

624
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,333
hire you for our business.

625
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,857
We need a sharp mind
like yours.

626
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:49,257
We'll train you until you
can be head of marketing.

627
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,458
Like me, Dad?

628
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,042
But...

629
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:55,958
Let's stop the failures
in the restaurant.

630
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:00,125
You'll accept it, won't you?

631
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:11,333
I will accept it, sir.

632
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,458
Good decision.

633
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,333
I'll just do something.

634
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,958
Can we talk?

635
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,458
I said, can we talk?

636
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,125
What do you want us
to talk about?

637
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:04,950
Answer me.

638
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,625
What do you want
to talk about first?

639
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,458
Your filthy act with Lawrence?

640
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:13,458
Or stealing my job?

641
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,958
I don't want to steal
anything from you.

642
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,542
Your job?

643
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:20,125
It's yours!

644
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,958
How about Lawrence?

645
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,856
Why did you do that?

646
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:25,542
Revenge?

647
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,125
I don't want any trouble.

648
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,458
But you already started it!

649
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:32,458
If I knew we would
come to this,

650
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,750
I wish I hadn't met you.

651
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:37,517
I wish...

652
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:39,625
You just rotted in the orphanage.

653
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:42,250
I know you're saying that
because you're angry.

654
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:44,864
But what you said...

655
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:47,573
That's foul.

656
00:57:55,302 --> 00:57:57,511
Our sales are good now.

657
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:58,952
Good job.

658
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:02,042
Do you have the report
for tomorrow?

659
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:04,958
Where?

660
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,542
Oh, this?

661
00:58:06,542 --> 00:58:07,625
Okay.

662
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,125
What I want you to do...

663
00:58:10,164 --> 00:58:13,039
Why does it smell like
a freeloading snake here?

664
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:18,294
Oh no. Be careful.

665
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,833
Maybe someday,

666
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,250
you'd get bitten by a
freeloading snake.

667
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:27,542
Especially those ungrateful ones.

668
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:36,872
You're too much.

669
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:38,833
Too much?

670
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,333
I'm going too much?

671
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,333
I'm still holding myself together.

672
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,542
Let me go.

673
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:46,472
Let me go.

674
00:58:46,992 --> 00:58:48,625
Let me go!

675
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,125
Aren't you ashamed?

676
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,250
Ma'am, that's enough.

677
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,542
That's enough.

678
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,125
Are you okay?

679
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,125
I'm tired.

680
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,500
Dad and I fought again.

681
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:21,833
You'll get along eventually.

682
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:24,129
It's just the two of you.

683
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,417
He can't resist you.

684
00:59:30,762 --> 00:59:32,762
Thank you for being here.

685
00:59:32,787 --> 00:59:34,370
Thank you so much.

686
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:07,320
Can we talk?

687
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,667
Oh, please.

688
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,167
I don't want to fight.

689
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,292
Relax.

690
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm not here to fight you.
I've thought about what I did.

691
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,583
You don't deserve what I did.

692
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,000
I hurt you first.

693
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,875
So I should be the first
to apologize.

694
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,792
I'm sorry too because...

695
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:52,583
I didn't want us to be like this.

696
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,000
You are the only family
that I have.

697
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,500
What if...

698
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,583
Let's go on a road trip
and camping?

699
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,375
Like the old times.

700
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:07,292
Just the two of us.

701
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:10,500
To destress.

702
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:14,667
Like what we do when our lives
become too toxic, right?

703
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,333
Even though a lot has happened,

704
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:20,833
we're able to do this again.

705
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,708
Is this a new campsite?

706
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,208
We've never been here before.

707
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:33,542
There's no one else.

708
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,833
Is it safe here?

709
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:39,917
Of course.

710
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:44,917
I really looked for a secluded place.

711
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:49,625
I want to disconnect
from everything.

712
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:55,042
So we can restore our
friendship like before.

713
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:57,833
You know what?

714
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:00,708
We should do this weekly.

715
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,625
Until we grow old.

716
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:11,747
Wait. We're running out of beer.

717
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,708
I'll get some.

718
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:14,708
No.

719
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,208
Let me.

720
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,708
I'm making up to you.

721
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,417
Let me serve you.

722
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:28,684
You've always served me
ever since.

723
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:30,709
So now, I'll do it.

724
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,542
Stay there.

725
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,458
What took you so long?

726
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:41,021
You missed me already?

727
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,958
You know what?

728
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:48,042
We should do this weekly.

729
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:51,797
Until we grow old.

730
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,696
Until then.

731
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,747
I'm having trouble breathing.

732
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:35,542
It's stressful being a bride.

733
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,187
There's a lot to plan
and organize.

734
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:42,625
Just relax. That's why we're
going to the campsite

735
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,625
to get away from people.

736
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,463
We're getting close.
You can breathe now.

737
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:53,542
It's exhausting, but...

738
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,125
I am so happy that
I am marrying you.

739
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,750
Too bad Ubel's not here.

740
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,750
She could help you in
planning everything.

741
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:10,250
She's gone for a year now.

742
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,250
I hope we find her.

743
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,542
Let's not talk about her.

744
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:22,042
My trauma about what happened
to her hasn't gone away.

745
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:26,042
Huh?

746
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,388
- What happened?
- The brakes stopped working.

747
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,958
There are no brakes?

748
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,750
How are you feeling?

749
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,958
How are you alive?

750
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:42,435
Where am I?

751
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,333
Where's Lawrence?

752
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,458
Don't worry.

753
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,958
I won't do what you did to me.

754
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,250
But Lawrence?

755
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,750
He's dead.

756
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,125
You animal!

757
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,958
You even involved Lawrence!

758
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,458
How can you do this to me?

759
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,458
How can you do this to me?

760
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,042
I planned everything.

761
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:04,042
<i>I broke your laptop</i>

762
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:06,250
<i>that made you fail the presentation.</i>

763
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,600
<i>Lawrence and I's dirty little secret?</i>

764
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,458
<i>I set that up.</i>

765
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:12,542
<i>I charmed him.</i>

766
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,333
<i>I also charmed your dad</i>

767
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,750
<i>so I can get your job.</i>

768
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,542
<i>I also destroyed your brakes.</i>

769
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:21,497
How did you survive?

770
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,625
You died!

771
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,542
You should be dead!

772
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,750
<i>I've known you since</i>
<i>we were young.</i>

773
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,750
<i>I know you were  planning something.</i>

774
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,333
We promised each other

775
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:36,250
to be together forever, right?

776
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:44,823
Ubel! Ubel!

777
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:46,372
Ubel!
