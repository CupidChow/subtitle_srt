1
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:02,124
Gosh!

2
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:14,104
Bongsoon...

3
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:16,892
Why did Mr. An come? What did he say?

4
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,590
Mom, I want to be alone.

5
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,604
Why did he come all the way here?

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,090
Mom! I don't know!

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,688
Stop referring to him like he's my fiancé!

8
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,291
What is he going to think of me
if he hears you call him that?

9
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:29,688
You're embarrassing me!

10
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:33,199
Can you ask him his
date and hour of birth,

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,302
so I can ask a fortune-teller,
if you're a good match?

12
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,410
Mom, stop!

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,198
-How old is he?
-I don't know!

14
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:41,407
Would it be impolite, if I asked him?

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,821
Please, don't. I mean it.
I'm going to get mad.

16
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,323
Go to bed. Go and sleep!

17
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,136
-I'm going to bed.
-Can you ask him how old he is?

18
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:53,017
-I don't know. Just go to bed!
-Okay!

19
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,815
What's wrong with me?

20
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,521
-Your heart is racing, right?
-Yes.

21
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:04,038
Mom, please! Stop it and go!

22
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,027
How old is he? I just need his birthday.

23
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,736
Don't ask me! I don't know!

24
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,115
Go to bed. Please go!

25
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,261
I think,

26
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,072
I like you.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,574
I've never had anyone say this to me.

28
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,793
I need time to think.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,899
Time to think about what?

30
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,606
Well...

31
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:54,913
I need time to look into...

32
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:59,290
...my feelings and see.

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:06,287
I should go inside. It's really late. Bye!

34
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:13,181
She's so cute!

35
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,285
Geez.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,451
Are you sleeping, Bongsoon?

37
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,081
Gee, Do Bongsoon.

38
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,380
Calm down.

39
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,889
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,793
Time to think about what?

41
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:14,296
I need time to look into...

42
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:18,889
...my feelings and see.

43
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:24,796
Okay.

44
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,503
But I can't give you a lot of time.

45
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,193
Figure it out quickly and look only at me.

46
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:31,487
Geez!

47
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,483
I need to sleep.

48
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,481
Let's go to the movies tomorrow.

49
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,393
Let's go to the movies tomorrow.

50
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,798
-Let's go to the movies tomorrow!
-Let's go to the movies tomorrow!

51
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:00,394
How is this happening to me?

52
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,493
What do I do?

53
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:13,537
What do I do?

54
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,132
-Juliet.
-Romeo!

55
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:17,734
-Juliet...
-Romeo.

56
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,628
-Oh, my!
-Who says he's Romeo?

57
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:25,925
What?

58
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:31,016
-You're not Romeo. I am Romeo!
-You're kidding me. Prove it!

59
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,215
Proof number one,
our families hate each other.

60
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,496
Proof number two,

61
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:36,902
the man she truly loves...

62
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,013
...is me!

63
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:40,502
Don't make me laugh.

64
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,118
-I'm Romeo!
-I am!

65
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,597
Juliet, say it. Who's Romeo?

66
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,899
I am Romeo!

67
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:48,714
Oh, my goodness.

68
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,699
I'll report you to the police!

69
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,492
-Mr. Oh.
-Romeo.

70
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,996
Who the heck is he?

71
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,290
What's this tofu around your neck?

72
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,194
Get away from him! Get away!

73
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,995
Get away from him! Get away from him!

74
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,701
What are you doing?

75
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:09,479
No!

76
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:14,177
I'll report you to the police!

77
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:18,278
I deserve an explanation.

78
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,572
It's fishy no matter how I see it.

79
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,275
Oh, it hurts.

80
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,770
What do you mean an explanation?

81
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,966
Yesterday, you pushed the table!

82
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,466
Did you really push it?
If not, then what was it?

83
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,411
Was it an earthquake, then?

84
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,770
I'm not sure, I don't know.

85
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,981
You're suspicious.

86
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:42,576
You wicked thing.

87
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,965
You caged me in and left!

88
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,461
I hate girls like you.

89
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,167
Mr. Oh, stop bullying me.

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,076
Why? I will put all my heart
and soul into bullying you.

91
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:57,869
-Why?
-Because you're detestable.

92
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:01,074
Oh, come on. Don't be so mean.

93
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,772
I don't see anything nice about you.

94
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:06,458
Anyway, go and get me some coffee.

95
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:13,056
How dare you roll your eyes?

96
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,246
Look down!

97
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,748
I want it sweet! Sweet!
Very sweet like me!

98
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,248
Got it. Sweet.

99
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:38,975
Quickly, quickly.
Since he doesn't like it bitter...

100
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:41,987
Since he likes it sweet...

101
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,884
I love the color.

102
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,283
Mr. Oh, here's your coffee.

103
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,168
You have a sip first.

104
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,978
I don't like my coffee sweet.

105
00:06:58,392 --> 00:06:59,785
You spat in it, right?

106
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,141
It's too sweet.

107
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,225
It's perfect.

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,408
I'm glad you like it.

109
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,314
-Don't try to outsmart me.
-Okay.

110
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,410
Then...

111
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,211
-Stop right there.
-Yes.

112
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,101
I want that report ready tomorrow.

113
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,414
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

114
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,208
-You should have said so earlier.
-I should have?

115
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,708
I'm the boss here!

116
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:45,609
Bring ten boxes of A4
paper from the supply room.

117
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,411
Ten boxes?

118
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,115
Don't tell me you can't
because you're a weak woman.

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,814
I have to finish the report,
so if the A4 paper isn't urgent...

120
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,409
Hey!

121
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:01,124
I decide what's urgent and what's not!

122
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,616
I said don't try to outsmart me.

123
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:08,034
-Okay...
-Geez, this is choking me.

124
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:16,203
Already getting on my nerves
first thing in the morning.

125
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,592
Darn it!

126
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,584
He pisses me off.

127
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,761
Do I leave them here?

128
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,364
Now if you'll excuse me...

129
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,020
"Let's go to the movies tomorrow."

130
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:49,313
Gosh...

131
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,575
Mr. An has a seminar to attend.
I'm going to pick him up now.

132
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,363
He'll be here later.

133
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,364
-I see.
-The developers...

134
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,072
...will give a presentation
for a new game this afternoon.

135
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,900
He wants you to attend that meeting.

136
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,392
What? Can I? Really?

137
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,005
-Yes.
-Thanks.

138
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,686
What should I say when I see him?

139
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:24,887
Do I pretend nothing happened?
Smile casually like usual...

140
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:29,395
No, that's not who I am.

141
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,693
-Why won't you respond?
-Why won't you respond?

142
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:41,095
Are they twins or something?

143
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:42,887
Did they plan this?

144
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,489
Why are they doing this to me?

145
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,885
Gosh!

146
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,463
No, don't! No!

147
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:54,971
No, don't do that! No!

148
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,372
It was a dream.

149
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,571
Water is flowing in my veins.

150
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:16,588
Impossible!

151
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,780
Why am I feeling so well?

152
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:25,694
No way!

153
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,192
Impossible. No way.

154
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,049
Poop...

155
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:44,646
Poop...

156
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:45,765
You drank it.

157
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,471
You drank it, you drank it.

158
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,892
-I wish I didn't have to go.
-You should, Sir.

159
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:04,003
To do some networking
and exchange information.

160
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,509
They're just too much of a hassle.

161
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:08,398
"Young Businessmen of the 21st Century."

162
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,890
"Fostering Creative Talents
of the 21st Century."

163
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,891
Why is everything of the 21st century,

164
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:17,089
when they'll talk about
items of the 20th century?

165
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:26,110
I'm busy today, buddy.
I don't think I can.

166
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,204
-Sorry.
-She's suddenly talking down to me?

167
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,772
I'm busy today, sir.
I don't think I can go.

168
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,970
Sir? Why is she calling me sir?

169
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:48,759
Oh, she wants us to get closer?

170
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,366
-I'm getting excited.
-What is it, Sir?

171
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,575
Someone who used to call me "sir"
is suddenly talking down to me.

172
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,777
It feels quite provocative.
Quite thrilling, actually.

173
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,084
I didn't know you liked that.
Why didn't you tell me?

174
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,975
I'm busy today, buddy.
I don't think I can. Sorry.

175
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,592
My heart is fluttering.

176
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,493
What? What is this?

177
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:30,499
Why did they reject this one?
It's so original.

178
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,796
So creative.

179
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,691
Next!

180
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,507
"Be Strong Pork Cutlet"!

181
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:42,806
What's this?

182
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,513
Beef Cutlet conquers
the land of Pork Cutlet?

183
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:49,819
You need a sauce item to
go to the land of Pork...

184
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,017
What the heck?

185
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,423
Someone who came up with this
is on the development team,

186
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,733
and I'm an intern?

187
00:13:56,818 --> 00:14:01,237
My game is a hundred times better.

188
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:02,927
A thousand times better.

189
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,945
Something's definitely not right with me.

190
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,350
I'm not in my right mind.

191
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:19,453
I need to catch Janghyeon.

192
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:23,341
He said he'll make me a female warrior,

193
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:27,142
and he keeps me locked in an office?

194
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:31,429
Did he get frightened
because he got stabbed?

195
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,038
Right.

196
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:39,323
He'll only get hurt,
if he stays around me.

197
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,577
I'm too dangerous for him.

198
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,773
I should just quietly work
on developing my game.

199
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,573
No, I should catch Kim Janghyeon first.

200
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,875
Then I need to take days off.

201
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:05,165
Right, but he asked me out.
I should settle that first.

202
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:10,274
Is that something you can settle?
And what about Gukdoo?

203
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,378
What do I do?

204
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,887
Oh, your face.

205
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:25,583
Can you say, "Ah"?

206
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,179
You can't?

207
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,584
Your cheekbone isn't healed yet.
Don't try to smile too much.

208
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,477
Doctor, he's not stupid.

209
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:36,381
He can't smile in this condition!

210
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,574
-I'm warning you.
-Don't smile.

211
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:43,074
You shouldn't smile.
Don't smile!

212
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:44,985
You shouldn't smile!

213
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,683
Did you go to the bathroom?

214
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,390
I'm completely backed up.

215
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:52,391
I don't know where the food goes.
Am I absorbing it all?

216
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,486
-You should get an enema.
-No, thanks.

217
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,589
I have dignity.
I want to handle it myself.

218
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,281
I'll let your bed down.

219
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,077
It's okay. Hang in there.

220
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,379
It's almost done.

221
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,085
But...

222
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,293
Where did he go?

223
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,881
He went out for a walk.

224
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,274
Is that bottle leaking?

225
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,602
He drank it.

226
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:20,980
He had it. He had it.

227
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,802
"Pre-development Team"

228
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,888
What are you doing?

229
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,086
What?

230
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:11,394
Oh, no. I'm crazy.

231
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,119
I got the texts mixed up.

232
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,103
So stupid.

233
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,008
What do I do?

234
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,015
How about this one?

235
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:33,525
This necklace means,
"Make a wish to the moon."

236
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,517
Really?

237
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,514
Isn't it too large?

238
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,106
-It's a pretty size.
-I'm giving it to...

239
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:49,420
...a very cute friend.
I don't know if she'd like it.

240
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,722
Don't worry. She'll like it.

241
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,402
Okay, I'll take it.

242
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:07,317
Nice Gukdoo

243
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:13,611
-Hello?
-It's me. Are you busy today?

244
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:17,815
Yes, I've been transferred
to the development team.

245
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,514
-So I'm a little busy.
-Really?

246
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,731
I intentionally asked for
a day off today to meet you.

247
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:31,316
If you can't go to the movies,
let's just meet up later at night.

248
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:35,711
I think I'll be working until late.

249
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,012
Then I'll go to your office.

250
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:40,095
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

251
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,714
I don't want you to meet
your boss outside of work.

252
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:46,206
If you got transferred,
you're not his bodyguard anymore.

253
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,818
And he's back home,
so he doesn't need your help either.

254
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:50,207
Well,

255
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:55,621
-you're right...
-I'm telling you as a friend.

256
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,515
And this will be...

257
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,115
...my last advice...

258
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,830
...as a friend.

259
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,045
I'll call you when I get there.
See you later.

260
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,286
"For Do Bongsoon's future."

261
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,881
Is it from your boyfriend?

262
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,866
-No, it's not.
-"For Do Bongsoon's Future."

263
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,666
Then why does he send you flowers?

264
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,258
Oh, my.

265
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:44,648
-Are you an easy catch?
-Why do you hate me so much?

266
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:45,854
Seriously!

267
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:49,746
Anyway.

268
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:53,261
How did you move those boxes?

269
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:55,362
I saw it with my own eyes.

270
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,656
What did you do? Who are you? Tell me!

271
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,362
Reveal your identity!

272
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,158
I am...

273
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:06,744
...Do Bongsoon from
Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu.

274
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:13,567
Who are you?
You pushed the table, didn't you?

275
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,065
What are you? Who are you?

276
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,265
Actually...

277
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,161
I'm an alien.

278
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:41,838
Did you see that on the social network?

279
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:45,225
Mr. An went to the seminar and came out.

280
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,431
-Oh, my. Really?
-Yes.

281
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:51,818
But not as gay, he officially
announced in public that,

282
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,618
he likes women.

283
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:55,506
Do you know what's more shocking?

284
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,608
The woman that he likes
works for this company.

285
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:00,798
Really?

286
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:03,503
Who is it?

287
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:06,201
I'd have seduced him if I knew.
What a waste!

288
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:07,129
Now that I think about it,

289
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:10,431
the female staff's
welfare improved suddenly.

290
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:14,011
But who is she? I'm so curious.

291
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,924
-We should find that out.
-Yes, immediately.

292
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,971
Good job. We can do this.

293
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:40,368
-One, two, three. Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

294
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,359
Do Bongsoon!

295
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:28,747
Let's go.

296
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,731
My hands, please.

297
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:41,623
-No.
-Don't do this at work.

298
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,543
No!

299
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,042
Let's go.

300
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,844
-Come with me.
-Is it her?

301
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:50,534
No way.

302
00:24:01,115 --> 00:24:03,198
Is this the game you wanted to develop?

303
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:05,405
-Yes.
-Okay.

304
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:07,498
Let's have it developed, then.
We'll work together.

305
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,906
You're not joking, are you?

306
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,795
Of course I'm not. Why would I be?

307
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,988
You have to really make it work.

308
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:17,797
So you can go to the development team,

309
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,805
and do what you want
to do with confidence.

310
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:22,999
So don't miss the meeting after lunch.

311
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,115
Pay attention to the presentation.

312
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:28,423
You'll soon get a chance
to give your own presentation.

313
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:29,840
-Okay.
-Good.

314
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:34,608
-Let's go and grab lunch.
-Wasn't it one meal a day?

315
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,298
-Not anymore.
-Why?

316
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,108
You eat three meals a day.

317
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,005
I can't eat only one.

318
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:43,196
Let's go.

319
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:13,905
Hi, Heeji.

320
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:17,000
I know a famous Indian food
restaurant in Daehangno.

321
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:19,095
Do you want to have some Indian food?

322
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,306
-Later at six.
-Okay, I'll pick you up.

323
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,789
Where will you be?

324
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,100
I think I'll be in my studio.

325
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:30,691
-Okay, I'll go there.
-Okay. See you later.

326
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:32,389
Bye.

327
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,354
Are you not going to mix it?

328
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:02,765
Yes? Oh, right.

329
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,687
Hello.

330
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,679
Enjoy your meal.

331
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:19,962
Is it good, buddy?

332
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:22,868
Are you asking me?
No, I'm asking Minhyuk.

333
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,959
You said you were hungry. Is it good?

334
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,066
Yes, it's good.

335
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,061
Is yours good?

336
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:39,672
I haven't started yet.

337
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:48,389
-Have you lost it, Mr. Kong?
-No. Why?

338
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,369
Then why do you call Mr. An "buddy"?

339
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,981
He said he likes it.

340
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:02,771
Not when you say it, so don't.

341
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:08,986
Sorry, sir.

342
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:18,462
I have something important to say.

343
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:21,271
You need to know who this woman is.

344
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:24,856
She is very dangerous.

345
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:30,165
She moved ten boxes
of A4 papers at once. Ten boxes!

346
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,354
It's so freaky.

347
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:37,758
And I got stuck behind
the table because of Do Bongsoon!

348
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,564
Yes, I know you find it hard to believe.

349
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,175
I couldn't believe what I saw either.

350
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:52,142
But...

351
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:56,363
Do you know what she said to me?

352
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,561
She said... She's an alien.

353
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,767
She said she's an alien! An alien!

354
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,148
You like this dish.

355
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,149
Eat up.

356
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:19,434
Why don't you believe me?

357
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,141
She said she's an alien!

358
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,339
She said she's super strong,
and lives in Dobong-dong!

359
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,450
The strong woman, Do Bongsoon!

360
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,942
I'm not lying!

361
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,641
She get stronger every Friday
and Saturday at 11  PM!

362
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:38,154
Stop eating and listen to me.

363
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,648
She's a really scary woman!

364
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,798
Mr. Oh.

365
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,315
Can I give you a present?
An accessory.

366
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,614
What? What do you know about accessories?

367
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,202
Give me your wrist.

368
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,614
Here.

369
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:05,995
Bracelet!

370
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,986
Next time, I'll give you a necklace.

371
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:13,916
What happened to what we talked about?

372
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:41,798
No, that's fine.

373
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:43,599
Okay.

374
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:05,098
I never believed those rumors,

375
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,534
but knowing that he likes women...

376
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,830
...makes me really sad.

377
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:14,630
I really loved him!

378
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,122
I see.

379
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,028
Did you know?

380
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:22,822
I never really believed it.

381
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:26,124
But he didn't deny it,
so I thought maybe yes.

382
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,014
But,

383
00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:31,522
I think the woman that
he likes is Do Bongsoon.

384
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,827
Do Bongsoon?

385
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:37,831
Do Bongsoon?

386
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:40,108
Hey, hey.

387
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:43,106
Calm down. You'll meet someone better.

388
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,614
Don't do this.

389
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:52,812
I'm very picky.

390
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,019
Don't count your chickens.

391
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,709
No, it's not what it looks like.

392
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,304
No. Where...

393
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,296
Get up! Get up!

394
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:04,503
Come here.

395
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:07,106
You got a lot better.

396
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:10,020
-No wonder she's our Sis.
-Good!

397
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:13,813
Hey, did you hear?
Sis beat up 30 mobsters alone.

398
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,492
-What?
-So?

399
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,706
I don't know. They're all
hospitalized at Hanse Hospital.

400
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:20,507
-Are you serious?
-That's why we couldn't reach her.

401
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:23,600
Brutes! They outnumbered her!

402
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,402
We're looking into which mob it was.

403
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,196
-So we shouldn't be rash and...
-We have to be rash!

404
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:29,411
-We should!
-We should teach them!

405
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:32,712
-We should.
-Let's go!

406
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,798
Darn!

407
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,241
Why won't you come in?

408
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:48,646
It's cold outside.
Are you waiting for someone?

409
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,432
What?

410
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:51,852
I see that you're hungry.

411
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,744
I'm going to have lunch.

412
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:55,652
-Do you want to join me?
-What?

413
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,239
-Who are you?
-You don't want to?

414
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:02,746
Then I'll go alone.
But don't you follow me.

415
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,425
Or I'll call the police!

416
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,419
What the heck?

417
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:12,415
What?

418
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:18,143
The trend in the gaming industry
is moving to the exploring type...

419
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:19,453
...from the battling types.

420
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:23,548
That means games are syncing
reality and virtual reality.

421
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:28,246
Some players even break
into military zones to find...

422
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,954
...the characters of a game.
So it's not all positive.

423
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,146
We've seen this character before.

424
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:35,156
-Yes.
-Right.

425
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:39,453
Yes. He's Baro, the twin brother
of our iconic character Gina.

426
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:43,538
It's about rescuing him.

427
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,943
Search for Baro!

428
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,143
The aphorism of this game...

429
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:52,140
I shouldn't use this kind of
sophisticated terminology.

430
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:54,751
This game can be defined
in two words, which are,

431
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,045
family affection.

432
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,334
Any questions?

433
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:04,565
Yes, Mr. Oh.

434
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,041
That was so cool.

435
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,832
"Bongssuni Project"

436
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:41,541
-Oh, wow.
-Have some coffee.

437
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,025
Thank you.

438
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:47,131
If you have any questions about work,
let me know and...

439
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:51,133
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Okay.

440
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:54,324
-Hello?
-Bongsoon, it's me.

441
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,831
Hi, Gukdoo.

442
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,339
Can you come out? Just for ten minutes.

443
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:01,333
I'll be waiting in the
cafe, so take your time.

444
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,427
Okay, I'll be there.

445
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,245
Bye.

446
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,936
Sir, the report.

447
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:18,130
Looking at the main users of mobile games,

448
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:23,019
we should create a platform
where users can play at home.

449
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,288
-Yes, sir.
-Gukdoo.

450
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:40,486
-Yes.
-He's after a woman in...

451
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,488
Hannam-dong 345-9. It's a practice studio.

452
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:45,998
Her name is Jo Heeji.

453
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,479
-What?
-She's a cellist.

454
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,577
That son of a gun.

455
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,558
"Gukdoo"

456
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:16,963
Why is she not picking up?

457
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:21,355
Heeji, where are you? Stay where you are.

458
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:22,474
You're in danger.

459
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,817
Where is she?

460
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:55,110
Mr. Kong!

461
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,505
-Yes, Sir?
-Where's Do Bongsoon?

462
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,616
She left after,
she got a call from a friend.

463
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,513
-She'll be in the cafe.
-A friend? Who?

464
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,107
-A male friend, I think.
-A male friend?

465
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:12,219
Yes. Who was it? Kang... Kangdoo?

466
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:16,004
Kang-doo? It was some kind
of "doo." Doo... Doo...

467
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:18,909
-Gukdoo.
-Right! Gukdoo.

468
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:20,590
-Okay, now leave.
-Yes, Sir.

469
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,390
In Gukdoo.

470
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,889
I need you to locate Jo Heeji.

471
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:58,365
Here's Jo Heeji's current location.
It's Hannam-dong 345-9.

472
00:37:58,459 --> 00:37:59,865
That's her studio.

473
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:12,065
-How was your practice?
-Good.

474
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,358
I have a solo part,
so I have to practice hard.

475
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:18,557
Let's get some food and...

476
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:23,548
-Oh, Gukdoo.
-Hey.

477
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:31,133
Heeji, I think the kidnapper
of Dobong-dong is after you.

478
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:32,022
What?

479
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,359
What's that face?

480
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,675
Like you've been stood
up by a not-so-good guy,

481
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:04,660
but are moved to meet someone much better.

482
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:09,864
You're...

483
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:12,378
...easy to read.

484
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:16,473
So, you're too busy
and can't go to the movies?

485
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,808
-Right.
-That's not a good workplace.

486
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:23,989
-Isn't that against the Labor Law?
-I'm working because I want to.

487
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:27,285
-Let's get out.
-I can't. I have to work.

488
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:32,174
Then let's take the work home
and work on it together.

489
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:34,869
No, I want to do it alone.

490
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,369
I want to finish it today at work.

491
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:42,256
I don't want to abuse my power like this,

492
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:45,362
but if you keep this up,
I'll cancel that presentation.

493
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,068
-Don't be like that!
-Bongsoon.

494
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,269
What?

495
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:54,563
Won't you please like me?

496
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:10,783
Do you think,

497
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,294
you can work in this condition? You can't.

498
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,779
Stay with me today.

499
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:36,088
I'm not like everyone else.

500
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:39,582
You know that.

501
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,675
Are you okay with that?

502
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,574
Why does that matter?

503
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:56,611
Since when did you walk so fast?

504
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,516
I don't know. How am I supposed
to work here now? Gosh.

505
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:02,015
What? Are you afraid
that you'll get fired?

506
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,017
Gosh, stop it!

507
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:09,211
-Where are you going?
-To the office.

508
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,812
You're going to work?
After what happened between us?

509
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:15,804
I need to get my bag.

510
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:20,103
My bag. Stay here. Don't come in!

511
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,016
-Don't...
-Geez.

512
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:27,908
I'm going crazy.

513
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:37,315
Oh, right. She said stay here.

514
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:32,293
Let's go.

515
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,161
"Nice Gukdoo"

516
00:44:58,694 --> 00:44:59,295
What?

517
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:11,336
The number you dialed is not available...

518
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:52,916
Go inside.

519
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:55,019
Go.

520
00:45:56,908 --> 00:45:57,924
You go inside first.

521
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:00,518
Okay.

522
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,006
Bongsoon!

523
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,101
-You can't revert this tomorrow.
-What?

524
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:17,491
I hope tomorrow will be different for us.

525
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:21,387
Okay.

526
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,180
I'm off now.

527
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,670
Bongbong! Tell me right now.
What happened there?

528
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:52,157
-Something's going on.
-Hey.

529
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,372
I told you to not walk around alone.

530
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:55,758
Why are you out alone?

531
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,047
I told you to not go out at night!
They didn't catch the criminal!

532
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:01,258
I was suffocating inside.

533
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:03,347
But I'm wearing the alert device.

534
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,142
The alert device...

535
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:09,749
I guess that's why he kept saying
I shouldn't walk around alone.

536
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:10,539
What?

537
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,436
-Never mind. Let's get inside.
-What are you saying?

538
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,625
Gee...

539
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:19,165
You have to tell me what happened.

540
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:24,843
Something felt really
strange between you two.

541
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:30,132
The air feels different,
when a man and a woman like each other.

542
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:35,237
And today, I sensed that air.

543
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:37,709
What air?

544
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:41,505
Hey, it's Gukdoo.

545
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,100
-Gukdoo?
-Yes.

546
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,499
-Hello?
-Do you know where Bongsoon is?

547
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:51,015
I think she left her office,

548
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,835
but she's not picking up so I'm worried.

549
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,318
She's with me at home.

550
00:47:55,717 --> 00:47:57,616
Okay. Bye.

551
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:11,668
Bongsoon.

552
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:12,976
Hi.

553
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,768
Why didn't you pick up?

554
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,271
I got worried.

555
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:22,871
Did something happen again?

556
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:24,673
I waited for you.

557
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,095
I'm sorry, Bongsoon.

558
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,182
Something happened along the way.

559
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:31,984
Sorry.

560
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,180
-The criminal is after Heeji.
-What?

561
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:40,274
And she doesn't even live here.

562
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:43,079
I think he wants to take it out on me.

563
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:45,674
What? So you're saying...

564
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:49,871
Did he check your background?

565
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:51,561
I think he did.

566
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:54,165
Some things happened between us.

567
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,059
You shouldn't be here with me.
You should be with Heeji.

568
00:48:58,676 --> 00:49:00,760
She's with Bonggi.

569
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,173
In her studio.

570
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:07,480
Did you know?

571
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:10,977
Yes.

572
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:14,581
Are you okay?

573
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,873
I'm fine.

574
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:36,205
Now,

575
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:39,307
I know...

576
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:41,822
...my true feelings.

577
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:46,408
I...

578
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:49,611
...don't want us to be
just friends anymore.

579
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,413
-I...
-Gukdoo!

580
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:54,914
I...

581
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:01,245
I always felt reassured
because you're my friend.

582
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,500
I don't want to...

583
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,595
...lose my friend.

584
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:22,673
I think,

585
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,793
I've liked someone for a long time.

586
00:51:27,992 --> 00:51:29,288
And I've found out...

587
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:31,598
...about that just now.

588
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:36,891
I nagged at her all the time.
I've been so harsh on her.

589
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,606
She does such stupid things.

590
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,321
And that made me feel upset.

591
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:47,504
Do you know how hard it was
for me to let you stay with him?

592
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,393
Do you want to stay with him?

593
00:51:54,498 --> 00:51:56,312
You don't have to do this.

594
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:01,088
I have to. I think I should.

595
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:04,294
Chin up. Don't skip your meals.

596
00:52:04,903 --> 00:52:06,302
You're my friend.

597
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:07,198
Why...

598
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,397
...are we friends?

599
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,397
It's always like this between us.

600
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:15,006
-Like what?
-Our timing...

601
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:16,809
...is always off.

602
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:20,602
I always felt reassured
because you're my friend.

603
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:23,492
I don't want to...

604
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,699
...lose my friend.

605
00:52:57,384 --> 00:52:59,084
I'm going to Busan tomorrow.

606
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:00,170
Okay.

607
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:03,762
-Enjoy your trip.
-What did you talk about with Gukdoo?

608
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:07,169
-Kyungshim.
-Yes?

609
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,556
I think a crush...

610
00:53:12,762 --> 00:53:14,977
...has an expiration date.

611
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:32,943
Gukdoo.

612
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:47,113
So you're saying the
kidnapper is after me?

613
00:53:47,816 --> 00:53:48,613
Yes.

614
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:51,808
My team will stay very
close to you from today.

615
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:54,514
Why is he after me?

616
00:53:57,197 --> 00:54:00,607
You know who the kidnapper is.
Why don't you catch him?

617
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:03,195
Well...

618
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,895
It's not our case.

619
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,485
Another team is investigating it.

620
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:13,597
Don't worry.

621
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:15,788
I won't allow anything to happen to you.

622
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:17,786
Just in case,

623
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:19,588
remember his face.

624
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,683
It's him.

625
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,279
"Bongssuni Project"

626
00:54:45,274 --> 00:54:48,579
-Good morning!
-Oh, Mr. An.

627
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:53,984
The presentation is in two days,
so we should finish this today.

628
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,794
In two days? That fast?

629
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,476
I like things done fast.
Let's get it done quickly.

630
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:00,674
-Shall we start the meeting?
-Yes!

631
00:55:08,728 --> 00:55:12,240
Once the draft is approved,
they'll work on the graphics.

632
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:14,240
Don't waste too much energy on that.

633
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:15,533
Okay, got it.

634
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:20,125
Okay.

635
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,522
How about we do this?

636
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,542
-Who's Bongsoon rescuing?
-The prince.

637
00:55:40,646 --> 00:55:42,225
A prince that lives alone in a castle.

638
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,637
-The prince?
-Yes.

639
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:46,345
It's a very lonely prince.

640
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:55,354
Then she should rescue him!

641
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,844
Then instead of crushing
the enemies with this weapon,

642
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,446
let her use a nut-cracking hammer.

643
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:02,938
-So she crushes everything.
-Hammer...

644
00:56:03,338 --> 00:56:05,136
Good? Okay.

645
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,934
She'll crush the enemies with this hammer.

646
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:21,492
Enjoy.

647
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,096
You, too.

648
00:56:27,883 --> 00:56:29,077
It's good.

649
00:56:30,078 --> 00:56:32,580
Eat up. A lot.

650
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,169
What's going on?

651
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:48,701
Calm down.

652
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:51,487
Eat up.

653
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:00,365
It's not what it looks like!

654
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,000
It's not!

655
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:08,993
We're just colleagues.

656
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:11,701
Gosh.

657
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,614
Slow down.

658
00:57:20,822 --> 00:57:22,433
Where are you going, sir?

659
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:27,520
I wrote you a letter during the night.

660
00:57:29,008 --> 00:57:31,603
Read it when I'm gone.

661
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:34,912
And this.

662
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,019
Sir.

663
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:45,633
-Take it.
-But...

664
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:48,824
The passcode.

665
00:57:51,545 --> 00:57:53,232
1818.

666
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,476
Let's go.

667
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,674
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

668
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:22,976
What's the destination of our lives?

669
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,767
What do we become?

670
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:28,674
What do we gain eventually?

671
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:39,197
We consider poop
the dirtiest thing in the world.

672
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,392
Are we any better than that?

673
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,602
I don't understand a thing.

674
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:47,901
So he's saying we're worse than poop?

675
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,299
I think so.

676
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:55,198
Ultimately, we're only a piece of poop.

677
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,001
We are poop.

678
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,794
Poop?

679
00:59:14,696 --> 00:59:17,109
Who's the boss here?

680
00:59:21,913 --> 00:59:23,005
Who are you?

681
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,219
No, it's not you.

682
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,917
He's out, he's out.

683
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:29,519
Out for a walk.

684
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:32,832
Who's the boss?

685
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:39,428
Like Wonhyo found enlightenment
after drinking skull water,

686
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:44,842
I have found enlightenment,
and thus, I am leaving.

687
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,334
The truth in life...

688
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:58,028
...is like a bottle of poop wine.

689
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:05,838
-You're the boss!
-I'm not the boss!

690
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:08,734
-Come here!
-I'm not the boss!

691
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:12,225
Darn, where's their boss?

692
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:19,651
We should ask forensics to analyze this.

693
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:23,555
In a science magazine I read,
I saw an article about...

694
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,841
...a new drug.

695
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:28,253
The color of that drug in
water looked just like this.

696
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:33,852
-Drug?
-Mobsters drink this like water.

697
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:36,442
-You sure it's a science magazine?
-You jerk!

698
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:37,847
You think I'm stupid?

699
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,033
You want a piece of me?

700
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:43,446
Listen carefully!
I'm level six in science!

701
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:45,040
That's awesome.

702
01:00:45,632 --> 01:00:49,536
We'll stake out this area,
and follow them. They'll move.

703
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:51,838
Right, they said,
they have to go to their boss.

704
01:00:51,933 --> 01:00:55,938
Yes! So we'll catch their boss ourselves.

705
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:59,738
-We'll catch him!
-Catch him!

706
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:23,860
Where are you going?

707
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:25,963
Home.

708
01:02:26,165 --> 01:02:29,658
I'll take you home.
We should have dinner first.

709
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:31,245
-Dinner?
-Yes.

710
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,666
I'm not sure.

711
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,261
You're playing hard to get?

712
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:39,959
Let's go. I know a good noodle restaurant.

713
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:41,871
Their noodles are great. Let's go.

714
01:02:42,164 --> 01:02:44,768
-No holding hands.
-Okay, no holding hands.

715
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:46,354
Then this instead.
Let's go.

716
01:02:47,645 --> 01:02:48,764
Let's go.

717
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:50,050
-You should go.
-Okay.

718
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,971
"Dobong Walnut"

719
01:02:52,056 --> 01:02:53,169
Hi, ma'am.

720
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:55,462
-Are you going home now?
-Yes.

721
01:02:55,549 --> 01:02:57,446
The streets are dark. Get home safely.

722
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:00,150
-I'm off then.
-Good work today.

723
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:04,341
Hosoon lives far from here. You should
come earlier, so she can leave earlier.

724
01:03:04,436 --> 01:03:07,645
There's nothing to worry about.
She's not skinny.

725
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,224
-My goodness.
-Money.

726
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:12,232
-Why isn't Bongsoon home yet?
-Don't worry about her.

727
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,720
-Is this it?
-My goodness.

728
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,331
There you go.

729
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:36,422
Did he know we were coming?

730
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:38,507
Something's not right.

731
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:42,315
He went in this morning,
and hasn't come out once.

732
01:03:56,389 --> 01:03:58,784
-They think he's gone already.
-I don't get it.

733
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:01,100
The junkyard must have another exit.

734
01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:02,499
I think so, too.

735
01:04:02,783 --> 01:04:05,697
You said he told you to not follow him.

736
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:07,706
He's outsmarting us.

737
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:10,684
-Is Knockboy with Heeji?
-Yes.

738
01:04:10,988 --> 01:04:11,985
Then...

739
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:17,265
You, Brown Bear, will walk
behind Heeji from here.

740
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:21,272
And then you see this alley?
You lure him here.

741
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,161
The rest of us will be standing up here.

742
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,851
-Yes, sir.
-He's very smart.

743
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,057
Get your heads on straight.

744
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,065
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

745
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:42,898
She's approaching zone A.

746
01:04:56,294 --> 01:04:57,914
Zone B clear.

747
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,615
She's approaching zone C.

748
01:05:17,307 --> 01:05:19,443
-He's after her.
-I'll catch him!

749
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:34,906
Where is he? He got it! This jerk!

750
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:48,797
"Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"

751
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,894
You may be very strong and special,

752
01:06:50,986 --> 01:06:52,792
but to me, you're just a
woman I want to protect.

753
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:54,689
Protecting is my expertise.

754
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,793
They caught the criminal,
but I'm still worried.

755
01:06:57,902 --> 01:07:00,099
You thought your friend saved you?

756
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:02,702
Why are you here?
You can't come here alone!

757
01:07:02,787 --> 01:07:05,995
Don't call the police.
If you do, everyone dies.

758
01:07:06,087 --> 01:07:08,793
If he touches even one strand of
hair, he'll see what I can do!

759
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,690
I miss you so much...

760
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:13,491
But sometimes, I can't remember
you when I close my eyes.

761
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:16,202
And that makes me so sad.

762
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:17,777
So let me see you now.

763
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,376
I need your help.
