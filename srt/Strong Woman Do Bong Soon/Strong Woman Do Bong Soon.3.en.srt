1
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:07,404
What gives you the right to take her?
Because you're a policeman?

2
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,224
-Do you have a warrant?
-She's my friend.

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,958
I won't let her spend
the night with a stranger.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,860
-Then you can stay with us.
-No!

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
You can't stay here. Let's go home.

6
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:20,585
-Stay!
-Come on...

7
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:22,411
-Let's go, Bongsoon.
-Okay.

8
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:23,556
Secretary Do!

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,430
Business is business.

10
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:27,958
You're the one who's mixing things.

11
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,997
According to the Labor Standard Act
Chapter 4 Article 50,

12
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,773
maximum working hours
is 40 weekly or 209 monthly.

13
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:35,071
Meaning she shouldn't work more than
eight hours a day till late night.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,346
What business can she have late at night,
at the owner's house?

15
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,191
Can you give me a convincing reason?

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,219
A reason? There's no reason.

17
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:46,562
According to the Labor Standard Act
Article 100, you may be sentenced up to,

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,049
two years imprisonment
or fined up to 10 million won.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,831
Arrest me, then.

20
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,319
Gukdoo.

21
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,811
It's confidential...

22
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,186
...and I can't tell you...

23
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,413
...but there's something I have to do.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,581
What is it?

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,228
Well, it's confidential...

26
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,222
That makes me even more curious.
What is it?

27
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,342
-She told you she can't tell.
-Do Bongsoon.

28
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,511
You were like this at school
and you haven't changed at work.

29
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:14,946
You slept all day long during exams
and studied at the library at night.

30
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,254
How can I comply with
the Labor Standard Act...

31
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,888
...when I'm working with
someone like that?

32
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,450
Did you call your mom?

33
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,710
No, I was about to call her.

34
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,864
I'll talk to her mother.
If she doesn't approve...

35
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,071
...I will take her no matter
how urgent this matter may be.

36
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:33,020
Help yourself.

37
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,955
-Hello?
-Hello, this is Gukdoo.

38
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:43,699
Hi, Gukdoo. What's going on?

39
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:45,995
I'm at Bongsoon's boss's house.

40
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:50,056
She's going to spend the night here,
working with her boss.

41
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,656
I thought we would need your permission.

42
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:57,443
So she's going to sleep there
with her boss?

43
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:59,757
I mean stay up all night with him, right?

44
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,590
-Yes, ma'am.
-I see.

45
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:04,256
She must be overly motivated
with her new job.

46
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,578
That's good.

47
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:08,358
Anyway. Forget about her.
What are you doing there?

48
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,035
Work only as much as you're paid.
Go home now.

49
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:12,560
Aren't you busy?

50
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,946
You have cases to solve
but you have time for Bongsoon's roman...

51
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,623
I mean, to worry about her work?

52
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,652
-Put her on the phone.
-Okay.

53
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,178
-Hello, mom.
-You.

54
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,452
Good luck with that.

55
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,143
Good luck with what?

56
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:37,344
I shouldn't say this to my own daughter,
but no matter what you do there...

57
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,511
...regardless of what you have in mind,
it's all your own destiny.

58
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,730
Don't spare yourself.

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,697
Mom!

60
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,790
Tell Gukdoo to go home.

61
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:47,974
Why did he go there in the first place?

62
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:49,620
It's not his turf.

63
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:50,589
Mom.

64
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:52,539
Okay. Don't worry.

65
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:55,201
Gosh, I'm just working.

66
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:59,405
Yes, mom. Don't worry. Goodnight.

67
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:03,000
Was that Bongsoon?

68
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,578
She'll stay the whole night with her boss.

69
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,679
Why are you so happy?

70
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:12,379
I can't hide my feelings.
Do you want more noodles, Bonggi?

71
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,507
No, I'm fine.

72
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,173
Why is she staying with her boss?

73
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:19,193
-Tell her to come right away!
-You're so unprofessional.

74
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,857
She could have ended up unemployed.

75
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:23,003
But she found the motivation
to work all night.

76
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:27,144
You'll be standing in her way
if you ask her to come home.

77
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,596
Why does she have to work all night?
She's a bodyguard.

78
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:34,222
You know, in life,
history is always made at night.

79
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:39,777
-Oh, it's so tasty.
-It really is good.

80
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:41,421
I want more noodles.

81
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,944
You had enough. You'll poo too much.

82
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,005
Just a little.

83
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,479
-It's good.
-Jeez.

84
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:55,967
What exactly does she do?

85
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,034
Another reason I don't like the police.

86
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,556
They always interrogate.

87
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:05,849
This is ridiculous.

88
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:08,615
I think our encounter
deserves an introduction.

89
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,992
-We met at the police station.
-I know.

90
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,533
We met before. Don't be so defensive.

91
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,233
You're a policeman.
You can check my background.

92
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,157
You checked it
when I was there as a witness.

93
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,122
There have been recurrent incidents
in my jurisdiction.

94
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,898
Bongsoon heard the offender's voice.
And he saw her face.

95
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:27,322
The officer that was
protecting her was attacked.

96
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,359
-And in broad daylight.
-I know that already.

97
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:30,812
In such circumstances,

98
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,121
I can't let her stay with someone
that was in the crime scene.

99
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,356
Gukdoo, that case and the officer
being attacked aren't connected.

100
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:42,181
That man is bearing Mr. An a grudge.

101
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,305
Are you the police?

102
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,451
Did you investigate it?

103
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,947
No, but...

104
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,156
They aren't connected.
That's for sure.

105
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,260
Then you shouldn't be here.

106
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,004
Will you come with me?

107
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,213
-Why?
-To interrogate you as a witness.

108
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,041
Have some manners.

109
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,642
Is this how you exercise
your official duties?

110
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:04,541
What comes around goes around.

111
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,752
That officer leaves the hospital tomorrow.
I'll testify once he does.

112
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,711
Then please come tomorrow to testify.

113
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:12,758
Okay.

114
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:14,614
-Bongsoon, let's get some sleep.
-What?

115
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:18,110
To comply with the Labor Standard Act.
Let's abide by the law.

116
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,506
Though we live in a country,

117
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:21,816
where the police can break in
at night without a warrant.

118
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,089
So, we, at least...

119
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,675
...should abide by the law.

120
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,293
I'm going to bed.

121
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:29,015
The bathroom's over there.

122
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,486
Wash up before you go to bed.

123
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:36,011
You can stay here, too.

124
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,308
Why would you have a female bodyguard?

125
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:51,389
He actually likes men,
so to prevent any scandals...

126
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:56,890
He's a freak.

127
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,623
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

128
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,176
I don't understand you.

129
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,610
I'm his secretary, you see.

130
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:06,616
And I have some reasons.

131
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,557
Why does a secretary stay up all night
with her boss outside of working hours?

132
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:12,914
Don't worry, Gukdoo. I'm not so naive.

133
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,398
Let's go. Come on.

134
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,213
Okay, okay.

135
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:18,461
I'm leaving.

136
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,676
-Okay.
-Give me your hand.

137
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:21,619
My hand?

138
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,481
Wear this.

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,789
It's a wearable alert device.

140
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,663
Do you see this button?

141
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:33,253
Press it and the nearest patrol
will come within five minutes.

142
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:34,794
-Okay?
-Okay.

143
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:38,264
And come to the station tomorrow with him.

144
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,656
Okay.

145
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,845
Press it if he does anything to you, okay?

146
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:48,756
-Okay.
-All men are dogs!

147
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,022
Don't insult dogs like that.

148
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:54,779
I'm off.

149
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,159
He's gone!

150
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,561
Where is he?

151
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:22,876
Wow!

152
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,580
Wow, what's all this?

153
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,745
Wow...

154
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,844
Where are you?

155
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:38,211
I don't feel like playing hide and seek.

156
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:41,227
Gosh...

157
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,196
Are you not here?

158
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,311
What's this?

159
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,231
What is that painting doing there?

160
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,277
Oh, it opens.

161
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,489
Wow!

162
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:58,845
Wow!

163
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,921
Wow, what's this?
Is this a secret passage?

164
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,150
Wow, it's going down!

165
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,621
Wow!

166
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,635
Whoa... Wait a second.

167
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:13,145
What's this?

168
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,306
Whoa...

169
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:22,090
What kind of place is this?

170
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:25,638
An underground dungeon.

171
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,873
It's where my game characters
come to life.

172
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:30,509
Welcome to my playground.

173
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,112
The things you can do when you're rich.

174
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,689
What did you say?
Did you criticize me?

175
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,617
No. Why would I?

176
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,157
Feeling so victimized.

177
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:41,083
Name, Jung Juntae.

178
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:44,352
Address, Seoul Seongdong-gu,
Seongsu-dong 1-Ga 164,

179
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,937
Chowon Apartment 103.

180
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,122
The info of the owner of that bike.

181
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:51,601
-Let's go there now!
-Tonight, let's just...

182
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:55,623
Let's protect each other
as promised and stay here.

183
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,811
That's what we promised.

184
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:58,332
Let's go in the morning.

185
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,579
Okay. If that's what you want.

186
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:04,931
Your friend was very worried about you.

187
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,791
When he's not going to date you anyway.

188
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:10,650
Did that jerk, I mean that cop
give you that necklace?

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,417
No, my dad got it for me
for my graduation.

190
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:16,988
Stop asking about my private life.

191
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:17,961
Okay.

192
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,355
-Let's sleep.
-What?

193
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:22,577
I meant just sleeping in the same room.

194
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:27,433
-I told you to not get ideas.
-But we can't sleep in the same room.

195
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,403
-That's not the life I've led.
-Are you kidding me?

196
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,906
Listen, I'm scared tonight!

197
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,222
-Come here.
-Come on.

198
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:42,745
You have a bedroom, a living room,
and a guest room and you sleep here? Why?

199
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:45,921
Have you ever received
blackmail calls as a wake-up call?

200
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,886
I guess not.

201
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:52,691
Your life is too simple to understand
a complicated life like mine.

202
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,871
You sleep on the couch.

203
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,717
I'll sleep here in my sleeping bag.

204
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,253
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to sleep.

205
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,830
This is so annoying.

206
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,106
Sleeping on the couch.

207
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,779
It's an expensive couch.

208
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,279
Good night.

209
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:48,874
Good night.

210
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:58,791
Wow!

211
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,040
A fairy tale I read
when I was a kid said...

212
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,699
...people become stars when they die.

213
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:09,968
And I believed in that.

214
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:15,212
In the fairy tales I read,
when people die, they become ghosts.

215
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,463
How can people become stars?

216
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,549
So I can see my mom every night.

217
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,896
Did your mom pass away?

218
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,622
Before she died when I was six...

219
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,270
...she took me to my father.

220
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:39,013
My older brothers locked me in a wardrobe
and bullied me back then.

221
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,877
So my father gave them a good beating.

222
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,702
Then why did you make the wardrobe
the entrance to your dungeon?

223
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,543
Though they locked me in the wardrobe...

224
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:52,055
...I felt more comfortable in there.

225
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,819
Nobody was bullying me.

226
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,150
I could sleep better, and...

227
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,483
...and it's fun.

228
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,777
The bad guy and the police
can't find me here.

229
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:05,525
I think you dislike the police
more than the bad guy.

230
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,595
My father was a gangster.

231
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:14,765
He made money in his gang
and bought the police off with that money.

232
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:17,694
He even made friends with prosecutors.

233
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,834
He surely did a lot of bad things,

234
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,096
but he never went to jail.

235
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,620
He never met a good cop.

236
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,285
There are many good cops.

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,057
Why do you like cops?

238
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,854
Sorry. Wrong question.

239
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,371
What do you like about that cop?

240
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:40,917
Gukdoo?

241
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:41,995
Yes.

242
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:44,284
Well, he's...

243
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,412
Forget it.

244
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:49,573
When did you start having a crush on him?

245
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:56,503
I met Gukdoo for the first time
when I was in the sixth grade.

246
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,167
Break time's over.

247
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,886
He's a transfer student from Gangnam.

248
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,352
Gukdoo, say hello to your classmates.

249
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,623
Hello, I'm In Gukdoo.

250
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:11,766
I hope we get along well.

251
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:18,364
He used to be the best student
in his previous school.

252
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:23,108
There. There's a seat next to Bongsoon.
You can take that seat, Gukdoo.

253
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,482
Excuse me.

254
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,151
You're drooling.

255
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:40,787
Drooling.

256
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,101
What are you doing?

257
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,676
Get out of the way.

258
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:30,888
Let me see.

259
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,105
Gukdoo!

260
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,129
He's the only person
that makes me powerless.

261
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,231
In Gukdoo...

262
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,300
He's a bad guy.

263
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,845
He didn't ask for your love.

264
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,047
You fell in love with him. Why blame him?

265
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,499
Hey, wake up!

266
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,476
Let's do it.

267
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:04,871
What?

268
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:10,143
Die!

269
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,911
-What?
-Oh, yeah!

270
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,639
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

271
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,617
You're a loser.

272
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,270
Hey!

273
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:23,864
Hey.

274
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,034
I enjoyed the game.
I'm going to bed now.

275
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:29,944
The couch is mine. Don't say anything
more and go to your sleeping bag.

276
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,050
Just one more game.

277
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,390
No, thanks.

278
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,098
Hey...

279
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:52,518
Are you asleep?

280
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,789
Wow, that's quick.

281
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:12,238
What are you doing?
Why are you here?

282
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,218
What on earth?

283
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,651
Keep dreaming.

284
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,390
The floor was too cold.
I thought my face was going numb.

285
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,511
-I was so scared all night long.
-Scared of what?

286
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,957
Scared that you would attack me.

287
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:26,352
Make me breakfast!
One meal a day, remember?

288
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,197
-Make a proper breakfast.
-Gosh.

289
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,907
-What?
-I'm on my way.

290
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:31,878
You're crazy.

291
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:39,345
Don't be so impressed.

292
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:44,611
My mom is such a princess...

293
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:48,013
...that she made me cook everything
since I was little.

294
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,176
So I know how to cook.

295
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:52,119
I'm not impressed.

296
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,555
The dishes are all carbohydrates.

297
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,544
Sauteed potatoes,
sugar coated sweet potatoes...

298
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,370
...no whole grains. Only white rice.

299
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,978
Look at this rice. It's as white as milk.

300
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,382
So white it hurts my eyes.

301
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,795
But I'll take your effort
into consideration and eat.

302
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,633
-I'll eat it.
-You know what? Don't!

303
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:12,289
What a temper.

304
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,777
When you get married,
you'll make your wife's life so miser...

305
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:21,215
Well, I shouldn't worry about that. Right?

306
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,155
Your friend keeps coming to my mind.

307
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,384
Especially his butt.

308
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:34,083
He's got a nice butt.
Apple butt. Nice!

309
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,334
You're very raunchy.

310
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,674
I like guys with pretty butts.

311
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,407
You talk too much.

312
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,343
What will you do if you catch him?

313
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,568
I'll find out who's behind him.
I'll make him talk.

314
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:07,092
Do I have to make him talk?

315
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,421
You'll ask for extra pay if I ask.

316
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:10,879
Of course.

317
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:11,979
Then I'll do it.

318
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,679
Then all I have to do is catch him?

319
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:16,619
Yes.

320
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:22,449
Will you report it to the police
once you find out who's behind it?

321
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,536
No, I'll take care of it.

322
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,758
You're lawless.
You're the center of the universe.

323
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,089
That's up to me.

324
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:33,289
Then, what are you going to tell
the police when we get there?

325
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,811
I don't have to report private matters.

326
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,348
You'll end up mentioning it
when you start testifying.

327
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,330
I'll only tell them about that officer
getting assaulted.

328
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:48,212
Then you'll mislead their investigation
towards the Dobong-dong murder suspect.

329
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,663
The police will be misled.

330
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,884
-I'm going to keep an eye on him.
-What?

331
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,304
I mean your friend.
I'll see how he directs the investigation.

332
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:56,437
Gosh.

333
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,461
Poor Gukdoo.

334
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,911
He's not good with knives.

335
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,791
He was very clumsy.

336
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,021
It's clear that
he didn't want to kill her.

337
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,690
He used a stationary cutter.

338
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:11,964
He slit once and ran away surprised.

339
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,818
Did you see his face?

340
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,207
Yes, I remember it clearly.

341
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:25,915
It's not him.

342
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,822
He was much older than this guy.

343
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,323
This man is wearing a mask.
How do you know?

344
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,661
His face was very rough.

345
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:38,483
Hello. I live next door.

346
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,367
Did you run the washing
machine last night?

347
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:43,677
It was so noisy I couldn't sleep.

348
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:47,201
I didn't.
I don't wash my clothes.

349
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:53,611
Then why do you think it was so noisy?

350
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,128
Who are you?

351
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:01,387
Can I see if you have a washing machine?

352
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:05,077
-You're crazy.
-Excuse me.

353
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,818
Who are you?

354
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,819
She just breaks in.

355
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,764
Hey, hey.

356
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:16,615
Who are you?

357
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:18,764
Do you really live next door?

358
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,841
Oh, no.

359
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:25,845
Hello, sir. I'm actually Do Bongsoon
and I live in Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu.

360
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:30,478
License plate, "Cha 4458".
It's your bike, right?

361
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:31,852
Are you Jung Juntae?

362
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,766
-Who are you?
-You are.

363
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,108
-Can you come with me?
-What?

364
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,931
I need to talk to you about your bike.

365
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,621
You break in my house and
what's this rubbish you're talking about?

366
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:43,601
I should just...

367
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:44,643
Rubbish?

368
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:48,556
It'll only take a minute.

369
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:49,642
Who are you?

370
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,372
Coming in a single man's house...

371
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:55,267
-You're quite a daring woman.
-What the heck?

372
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,068
Huh?
Huh?

373
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,111
Hey!

374
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:04,897
Mister!

375
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:08,501
Mister! Mister! Mister!

376
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:11,971
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

377
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,178
What do I do?

378
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,020
Mister?

379
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:37,384
I didn't even hit him.
He hit himself.

380
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,301
Please, understand.

381
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,201
You should pay me more.

382
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:45,284
I never intended this.

383
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:48,940
What are you doing? Start the car!

384
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,114
Huh?

385
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,882
Are we going to the dungeon?

386
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:53,273
Oh, okay...

387
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,949
Yes, so her belly...

388
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:01,227
Geez. Hands off.

389
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:01,932
Who is it?

390
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,357
They're so good.

391
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,434
Mr. An.

392
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,896
She lives there. You should come.

393
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:20,321
There.

394
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,921
You didn't kill him, did you?

395
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,357
No, he's breathing.

396
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,456
I don't think he's breathing.

397
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,519
He is. He is.

398
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:27,306
His face is swollen.

399
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,447
Did you beat him?

400
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:30,043
What? No.

401
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,674
You did. Look at his face.

402
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:34,522
I didn't beat him. He beat himself.

403
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:37,623
He hurt himself with his own hands?

404
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:40,215
Why? There must be a reason.

405
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:44,163
Well, he didn't exactly hurt himself...

406
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:45,778
Oh! He's awake now!

407
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,947
Hey, I need him to be conscious
to ask him questions.

408
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:51,034
-Stop hitting him.
-I didn't hit him!

409
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:52,472
Who are you?

410
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:56,220
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:57,706
What did I do?

412
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,813
Mister, let me tie your hands.

413
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,650
-What are you doing?
-Just a minute.

414
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:06,379
Don't just stand there.
Find a chair or something.

415
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,888
I have to do all the work.

416
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,197
-My cousin is a cop.
-Oh, is he?

417
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:15,871
And a friend of my ex-girlfriend's uncle
works in the prosecutor's office.

418
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:20,886
-And...
-Mister, please hold this a minute.

419
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:24,395
And close your legs, okay?
Just a minute.

420
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:29,312
It hurts!

421
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:39,316
-Oh!
-What? What happened?

422
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:43,251
No, no, no. I didn't do anything!

423
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,452
He did that to himself.

424
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,541
What's wrong with him?

425
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,336
You really make things better.

426
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:51,570
Are we doing it well?

427
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,015
Did that sound like a compliment?

428
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,612
-Hey!
-But he was like...

429
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,208
-Hey, wake up.
-That's powerful.

430
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,210
I think I should go home now.

431
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:12,288
I worked too much today.

432
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:15,087
-Goodbye, then.
-What the heck? Hey!

433
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:19,725
Come here.

434
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:32,717
Who sent you?

435
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:47,955
Someone stole my bike
so I reported it to the police.

436
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,811
But the police didn't get back to me.

437
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:52,378
That's why I don't like the police.

438
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:56,644
-So your bike was stolen?
-Yes...

439
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:02,167
I worked the night shift for six months...

440
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:05,911
...in a restaurant to buy that bike!

441
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:08,899
Oh no.

442
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,845
Oh, I'm sorry.

443
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm sorry, Mister.
I'll untie this for you.

444
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,418
I'm sorry, Mister.

445
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:20,119
I'm sorry.

446
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,121
Darn it!

447
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:26,366
What will you do now?
You got the wrong man!

448
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:31,088
Do you know what happens
when I misuse my strength?

449
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:33,031
We're in trouble now!

450
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:35,945
I'm so sorry.

451
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,410
-Please, leave. Please.
-Okay.

452
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:42,777
Shoot!

453
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:53,878
Poor man!

454
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:58,011
He's barefooted.

455
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,325
Okay! Stop whining.

456
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:05,158
-What's your relationship with Kim Jiwon?
-He's Kim Jiwon's fiancé.

457
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:07,328
It's not him.

458
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:11,345
We investigated and he has a motive.

459
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:13,801
They had a big fight
the day before she got kidnapped...

460
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,932
...and she said she would
cancel the wedding.

461
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:17,560
Are we recording his voice?

462
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:18,811
What? Yes.

463
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,611
It's not him. I'm sure.

464
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,312
The footprints that we found
are the size of his feet.

465
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:27,080
Hey, it's not his feet. Look at his eyes.

466
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,273
He's worried about his fiancé.

467
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:33,392
That's why the other team said
it's not the same guy...

468
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:36,084
...that murdered Jung Hyangsook.

469
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,055
I think it's the same guy.

470
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:42,976
It was in the same crime scene,
but we found two different footprints.

471
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,639
He's playing with us!

472
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,912
He disguised himself as a doctor to sneak
into the victim's room in the hospital.

473
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:50,489
-He can do more than that!
-It's not him.

474
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,379
His motives aren't strong enough.

475
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:53,868
And Kim Jiwon...

476
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:56,148
She's alive.

477
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:00,624
Lieutenant In.

478
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:02,988
Yes.

479
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:14,919
So you're saying the kidnapping
in Dobong-dong is not connected...

480
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,086
...to the attack of the police officer?

481
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:22,473
-Exactly.
-Then why was the officer attacked?

482
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:25,538
The police must investigate it.

483
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:29,729
The police must provide security
and protect the citizen, right?

484
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,716
But the citizen has the right
to solve his own problems.

485
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:37,234
So let me solve my problems on my own.

486
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,111
-Look.
-I'm looking.

487
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,752
I will be in charge of protecting
Do Bongsoon from now on.

488
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:51,269
-As you please.
-Gukdoo, let me explain as his secretary.

489
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:55,819
As you can already tell,
he's a little craz...

490
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,937
I mean, he's a little peculiar.

491
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:01,919
So I think he has many enemies.

492
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:05,344
Ms. Do, you're making me
look like a psycho.

493
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,819
I'm not making you look like a psycho.

494
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:12,685
Anyway, so someone mistakenly thought
the officer was his bodyguard.

495
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,116
That's why he got attacked.

496
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:15,806
A surprise attack. Sudden attack!

497
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,187
Then you should have hired
a proper bodyguard.

498
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:20,199
I did. She's my body...

499
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,251
-What's wrong?
-Gukdoo.

500
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:26,584
I'm really fine. Don't be so worried.

501
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:27,940
I'm not worried about you.

502
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,229
I'm worried about the witness
of this case.

503
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:34,346
Anyway, I'm in charge of
protecting Ms. Do Bongsoon.

504
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,611
In case she's exposed to
dangerous situations at work...

505
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,852
...or in case she goes anywhere
where security is lax...

506
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:41,881
...someone must accompany her.

507
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,125
Your company must provide all necessary
security measures to protect her.

508
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:49,197
To protect her?

509
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:51,918
-I should be the one to be protected.
-By the way, Gukdoo.

510
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:55,184
Did you find any clues about the murderer?

511
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:57,678
-No, not yet.
-Okay, got it.

512
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:58,674
Lieutenant In!

513
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,017
Doctor Jo is off tonight.
We should go to the hospital.

514
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:01,790
Okay.

515
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:03,116
911.

516
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:04,772
911.

517
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,749
-Oh, it hurts.
-What's wrong?

518
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:09,682
It hurts!

519
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:14,232
I think I broke my toe.
I can't feel it.

520
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,211
What?

521
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,649
I'm so sorry. Does it hurt a lot?

522
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,721
It not only hurts. It's embarrassing.

523
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,486
Should I take you to the hospital?

524
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,070
Whatever you touch with your hands
or feet get hurt. Get out of my way!

525
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,173
I'm sorry! But I never meant to hurt you!

526
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,585
It's not hard to know my schedule.

527
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:48,453
All they have to do is call
the outpatient department and ask.

528
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,372
My schedule is shared
in the database system.

529
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,767
It's not hard for the criminal
to disguise himself as a doctor.

530
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,176
It's the footage of all the CCTVs
in the operation rooms...

531
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:58,699
...and night duty rooms of that day.

532
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,439
Oh, thanks.

533
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,133
Thank you for cooperating.

534
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,658
Take it. Let's go.

535
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:14,612
Detective, I'll go and check on my friend.

536
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:16,004
Your friend?

537
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,432
Okay.

538
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:23,295
Here. You have a really fine crack.

539
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:24,415
My goodness.

540
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:26,807
It's cracked?

541
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,766
You'll have to wear pads for a while
and don't strain your foot.

542
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:31,571
And apply ice packs often.

543
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:41,807
Hey, Bongsoon.

544
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,456
Oh. He's my boss, Bonggi.

545
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,266
Oh! How are you?

546
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,482
As you can see, not very well.

547
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:55,087
-Did you stomp on him?
-Yes, just a little. Very gently.

548
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:57,456
But why?

549
00:30:58,371 --> 00:30:59,824
I need to be hospitalized.

550
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,171
What? It's just a fine crack.

551
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,529
Oh, because it's not your toe, right?

552
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,419
It hurts like hell!

553
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:09,786
You want me to walk with a limp
and look like an idiot?

554
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,404
Would you like a room in the VIP ward?

555
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,038
No, that's boring.

556
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,774
Is Mr. Kong's tailbone fine now?

557
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,192
Hey.

558
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,863
It's been a while.

559
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:27,319
Sorry, Heeji.

560
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,588
It's this way.

561
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:34,426
Let's go on a lot of dates
once this case is solved.

562
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:35,753
Okay.

563
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,396
My friend is a resident in this hospital.

564
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,660
I made an appointment with
the orthopedist. I'll come with you.

565
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:41,583
Okay.

566
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,627
You want a wheelchair just
because you hurt your toe?

567
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:52,219
The toe is very important.

568
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,308
Then wear a patient gown.

569
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:57,664
I don't want to be a fashion terrorist.
What kind of style is that?

570
00:31:57,753 --> 00:31:59,614
Mr. Kong's room is this way.

571
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:06,316
Mr. Kong, it's me.

572
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:08,976
Mr. An! What brought you here?

573
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,075
Huh?
You’re on a wheelchair?

574
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,666
I have a crack in my toe.
I can't believe it's happening.

575
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:16,067
What happened?

576
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:17,713
Bongsoon stomped on me.

577
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,844
Yum. Come on. Try.

578
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,779
You have to chew. Yum.

579
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:33,872
You have to eat to get well!

580
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:35,829
Say ah. Come on. Ah!

581
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:38,196
Ah! Ah! Wider!

582
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:40,040
Ah! There.

583
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,896
Now chew. Chew.

584
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:42,858
Yum.

585
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:44,729
Yum.

586
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:47,070
-Yum.
-Boss!

587
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:50,257
-Hey!
-She's here!

588
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:52,485
-Who?
-Do Bongsoon!

589
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:54,329
Do Bongsoon?

590
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,544
Do Bongsoon is here!

591
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,636
-What are you doing? Call the police!
-Oh, yes. The police.

592
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,247
Oh no! Why is she here?!

593
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:03,485
Call the police quick.

594
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,685
-Boss, are you okay?
-Oh, no. Boss!

595
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,719
When can you sit up properly?

596
00:33:06,808 --> 00:33:09,316
It's getting better.

597
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,490
I might lie on my side tomorrow.

598
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,291
Does it still hurt?

599
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:18,672
I feel the pain all over my butt
just by coughing.

600
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,966
Gosh, I feel bad for you.

601
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,429
The human body is so mysterious.

602
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:30,761
Mr. An, those thugs that Bongsoon beat
that day are in the next room.

603
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:37,040
What's more surprising is that
her twin brother is a resident here.

604
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:40,443
It feels like Bongsoon is at
the center of the universe.

605
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:42,729
The sister gives you the pain,
the brother offers the medicine.

606
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:44,722
A fantastic combination.

607
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:47,143
What's wrong with you lately?

608
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,710
Do you know how many people are
hospitalized here after you beat them?

609
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:53,353
Be more careful.
Why did you get so reckless?

610
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:58,236
Gosh, don't get me started.
I'm trying my best.

611
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:01,052
But lately I can't control my strength.

612
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:02,503
Geez...

613
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,386
I have to go.
Gukdoo's girlfriend is here.

614
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,941
What?
Gukdoo's girlfriend?

615
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,325
-It hurts!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

616
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:13,005
Hey, but where?

617
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,921
-Hey, Gukdoo.
-Oh, hi.

618
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,729
-Hello.
-Hello.

619
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:21,860
You have to wait 30 more minutes
to consult with the professor.

620
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,129
You can leave her with me if you're busy.

621
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:25,269
No, I'll wait.

622
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,529
Hey, what are you doing here?

623
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:33,471
What?

624
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:36,785
Mr. An Minhyuk...

625
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,384
Well, he hurt his toe so I came with him.

626
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,853
Say hello. She's my friend Bongsoon.
She's his twin sister.

627
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:48,085
Hello, I'm Jo Heeji.
I've heard a lot about you.

628
00:34:48,184 --> 00:34:49,918
Oh. Hi.

629
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,643
I'll take you to his room.

630
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:54,529
I think we better take your x-ray
before he gets to his room.

631
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:55,463
Okay.

632
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,267
You come with me.

633
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,618
What are your symptoms?

634
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:08,208
I'm having a concert very soon, so
I've been practicing a little too much.

635
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:10,308
My wrist and fingers hurt.

636
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:15,847
I feel the pain up to my elbow
and I can't even lift anything.

637
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:19,626
-Do you play the cello?
-Yes.

638
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:21,947
It could be a problem
with your finger extensor muscle.

639
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,720
An inflammation in the extensor
for overusing your finger muscles.

640
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:29,499
We could give a definite diagnosis
after an x-ray and a blood test.

641
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,729
Which wrist is it?

642
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:33,674
-It's my left wrist.
-Let me see.

643
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,007
Is it here?

644
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:38,981
Or here?

645
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:40,872
Yes, there.

646
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:51,776
Oh, okay.

647
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:58,248
Make your job description clear.

648
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:01,036
Why are you so ambiguous about yes or no?

649
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,911
Why does a secretary have to
take care of him 24 hours a day?

650
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,848
You're not his nurse.

651
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:07,758
Well, right now he doesn't have
a secretary so...

652
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,367
Why?

653
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,859
I told you his secretary
hurt his tailbone.

654
00:36:13,948 --> 00:36:15,218
After the one-legged fight...

655
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,651
What's wrong with his employees?

656
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,461
Bongsoon, don't trust men so easily.

657
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,571
Kind men are womanizers,
rude men are crooks.

658
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,283
That's what men are!

659
00:36:25,823 --> 00:36:28,713
Anyway, I think your boss is weird.

660
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:32,582
Why are you doing this to me?

661
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:34,225
What?

662
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:35,972
You have a girlfriend.

663
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,906
So why are you so nice to me?

664
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:41,733
What are you talking about?

665
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,166
I'll take you to radiology.

666
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:55,213
Hey!

667
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:57,382
What are you doing there?

668
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,584
I've been looking for you everywhere.

669
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,420
Do you have to make me come here?

670
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,673
You're back?

671
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,470
Why do you look so sad?

672
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:29,147
As if you've met
the girlfriend of your crush.

673
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,650
I can tell.

674
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,921
Everything is so obvious about you.

675
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,010
My goodness!

676
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,467
She...

677
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:51,655
She...

678
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,688
Do Bongsoon. Do Bongsoon...

679
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:55,249
Keep quiet.

680
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,210
Keep quiet.

681
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:03,508
Am I wrong?

682
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,770
Why won't you answer?

683
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,842
-Why won't you answer?
-No, but...

684
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,359
-Are you ignoring me?
-No, sir.

685
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:13,253
-Hey!
-Yes?

686
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:15,152
Where is she?

687
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,464
Stay still.

688
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:24,569
She's a cellist and her finger hurts.
Please take good care of her.

689
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:27,451
We'll take the x-ray. Don't move.

690
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:33,370
Choonshim! Mom didn't feed you?

691
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:35,847
Gosh!
Eat up.

692
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,689
Mom, where are you going?
You go around everywhere. Where to?

693
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,190
Did you sleep with him?

694
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:48,324
Did you?

695
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,633
-I did.
-Really?

696
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:53,386
Yes, I slept really well.

697
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:56,519
So you mean you only slept?

698
00:38:56,608 --> 00:39:01,431
Mom! He doesn't like women.
I told you already.

699
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,587
I used to hate dogs until I met Choonshim.

700
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,775
Now I love dogs.

701
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:10,511
People change.

702
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,267
People and dogs are different.
Stop talking nonsense!

703
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,156
-You're so pathetic.
-Mom.

704
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:21,969
We might be poor,
but let's keep our pride.

705
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:24,852
You think you can keep it
when you're poor?

706
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:27,718
You're a fool and a stupid girl.

707
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:31,834
I marinated dried corvina.
Cook that for Bonggi for dinner.

708
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,207
And make radish soup with lots of perilla.

709
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:36,330
I need to wash up and go out again.

710
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:37,962
I don't know! You do it.

711
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:39,407
My goodness.

712
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:42,482
She could just attack him.

713
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,353
She's strong but useless.

714
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,442
Gosh, how frustrating.

715
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,758
"Rude Boss"

716
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,095
What now?

717
00:39:58,644 --> 00:39:59,487
Hi.

718
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:02,429
You can't disappear without telling me.

719
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:04,952
What if an assassin storms in here?

720
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:06,985
I came home to get changed.

721
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:10,074
You have an attitude issue.

722
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,885
You don't understand
the concept of office regulations.

723
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:16,582
I need to wash myself, too.
It's about my personal hygiene.

724
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:21,026
Your boss is worried about his safety
and you care about your personal hygiene?

725
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:23,110
Okay. I'm sorry.

726
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:25,007
I'm sorry I cared about
my personal hygiene.

727
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:26,691
Come here as soon as you're done.

728
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:29,069
Don't even dry your hair. Got it?

729
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,028
But...

730
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,432
What a jerk.

731
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,374
Gosh.

732
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,603
What should I do to have fun?

733
00:41:08,964 --> 00:41:10,016
Big Boss!

734
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,604
-Big boss.
-Welcome.

735
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:18,987
How are you, sir?

736
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:19,943
Trap...

737
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:22,564
...is everyone here?

738
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,558
That's quite serious.

739
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:48,205
He lost four teeth.

740
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:53,327
I heard a woman beat you up.

741
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:56,781
-Is that correct?
-W-Well... t-that’s...

742
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,076
That's true.

743
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:00,496
We're so ashamed.

744
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:05,086
We couldn't tell you because we felt
we caused you a lot of trouble.

745
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:08,742
It's hard to believe, but that's true.

746
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:11,777
And she's not even from our industry.
Is that true?

747
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,787
We checked on that.

748
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:15,678
Her name is Do Bongsoon.

749
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,268
Her parents run a walnut shop.

750
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:20,930
She's working in Ainsoft as a secretary.

751
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:22,173
Ainsoft?

752
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,298
What a coincidence.

753
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:30,982
Meet her and make her
an offer if she's really good.

754
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:34,585
Or get rid of her!

755
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:42,505
I will get rid of her, Sir.
Let me take care of it!

756
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:46,030
Don't blow on my ears!

757
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:49,020
You shut up!

758
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:52,036
You let yourself get beaten up by a woman?

759
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:55,621
The rumors spread across
the mountains and the oceans!

760
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,475
This is humiliating!

761
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,237
You disgraced my name!

762
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,019
Shut up!

763
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:12,471
-I didn't say anything, sir.
-Him, not you!

764
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:19,831
Boss.

765
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:25,585
He bit his tongue.

766
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,584
Bring her to me.

767
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,614
If I find out it's not true,

768
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,995
I will kill you myself!

769
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,484
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

770
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,796
It's getting hard to control my power.

771
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:04,489
I think it all started that day.

772
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,820
Are you drying your hair?

773
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,191
I said come right away!

774
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:19,183
We need to go somewhere.

775
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,765
I'm scared that I might kill him.

776
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:24,822
I'm coming.

777
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,427
She's no joke.

778
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:38,055
How old does she look like?

779
00:44:38,144 --> 00:44:39,711
-She's old.
-What?

780
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:41,901
-Like a college student?
-No, just a woman.

781
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,785
-You idiot! Just die!
-Hey, hey.

782
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,445
Hurry up. I want to go home.

783
00:44:52,534 --> 00:44:54,902
-Gosh. Not again.
-I'm bored.

784
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:57,948
Hello, ma'am.
Hi.

785
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,902
Oh...

786
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:09,774
Okay, okay.

787
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:18,849
Hey. Did you really do this?

788
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:20,807
Oh.

789
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,280
I think so.

790
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:24,889
Really?

791
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:28,426
Fix it! Or I'll rip you!

792
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:31,437
You can't fix what's already ripped.

793
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:34,551
-I can't do that.
-Are you crazy?

794
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:36,212
Let's take that from you.

795
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:42,940
Search her bag. Fix it or pay.

796
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,943
You're looking for trouble.

797
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:52,503
Are you broke? You have no money?
Money is competence, you see.

798
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:53,520
Sorry.

799
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,382
Life has been hard on me lately.

800
00:45:56,883 --> 00:45:59,061
There should be 30,000 won.
Is there not?

801
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,752
There's only 3,000 won, you idiot.

802
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:03,119
It's only full of receipts.

803
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:05,475
Really?

804
00:46:06,284 --> 00:46:07,918
Then a beating instead, okay?

805
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:11,260
A good beating, okay?

806
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:17,460
Hey, I hate to be hit on the head.
I also hate it when my stuff is touched.

807
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,977
You did both of them one after another.

808
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:21,934
You'd better not.

809
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:26,909
Oh, how scary!

810
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:28,906
Gosh, I'm terrified!

811
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,349
So what will you do, huh?

812
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:33,818
What will you do?

813
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:35,174
You little punk.

814
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:47,484
Hey! Didn't I warn you?

815
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:49,640
-Please don't.
-There's a lot of fine dust in the air.

816
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:52,363
Do you want some air up here?

817
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:53,791
-Huh?
-Please don't hurt me.

818
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,263
People should lead a good life.

819
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:01,197
They didn't teach you that in school?

820
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,788
-I'll behave!
-Seriously!

821
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:07,077
You! Get in there.

822
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:09,214
Ride that!

823
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:12,286
-Come here.
-Go, go!

824
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:18,231
Hold the handle tight.
It gets dangerous.

825
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:23,618
I'll take you to Hong Kong, China. Here we go!

826
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:35,886
Are you having fun?

827
00:47:44,852 --> 00:47:47,052
Do you want to visit America, too?

828
00:47:47,151 --> 00:47:48,652
-No!
-No!

829
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:49,981
Everyone gather.

830
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,152
Move faster.

831
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,937
Come on!

832
00:47:56,132 --> 00:48:00,302
I'll give you one hour...

833
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:04,228
...to collect one kilogram of trash
around this area.

834
00:48:04,317 --> 00:48:08,351
Only garbage you find on the ground.
Then I'll let you go.

835
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,886
Or you can take another ride.

836
00:48:10,984 --> 00:48:12,518
-You choose.
-We'll collect trash!

837
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:15,149
-We will!
-Yeah, I think that's better.

838
00:48:16,387 --> 00:48:20,097
And be nice, okay? Study hard.

839
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:29,324
Buy yourself something with those money.

840
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:33,619
-Bye.
-Thank you! Bye, sister!

841
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,312
-Bye!
-Bye!

842
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:39,834
-And about Mr. Kim...
-Postpone it to next week.

843
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,660
Great job.

844
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,190
Move faster.

845
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,190
Come with me.

846
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:54,740
-Help me.
-See you tomorrow, Sir!

847
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:56,294
-Okay.
-Don't catch a cold!

848
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:59,318
-The cold in the chest is bad!
-Try to lie on your side.

849
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:06,718
It's her.

850
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:11,053
-Can we go a little slowly?
-We are.

851
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,724
This makes no sense.

852
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:18,945
It makes no sense at all.

853
00:49:20,886 --> 00:49:21,926
What's that?

854
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:23,441
Big Boss!

855
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,428
He just peed!

856
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,167
Oh, no.

857
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,293
How could you do that?

858
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,172
Let's go.

859
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,885
I'm keeping record of your overtime,
so stop complaining.

860
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,935
But what's wrong with my attudite?

861
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:58,152
I can't tolerate being treated like this
and getting that kind of appreciation.

862
00:49:58,251 --> 00:49:59,685
-And...
-It's attitude.

863
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:03,581
-What?
-Repeat after me. Attitude.

864
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,696
No. You understood. That's the point.

865
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:11,587
You didn't study at school, did you?

866
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:14,310
Jeez.

867
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,550
Let's go.

868
00:50:15,984 --> 00:50:17,100
So uncomfortable.

869
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:19,034
So uncomfortable.

870
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:25,484
Oh, I feel good in mind and body.

871
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,491
Don't talk to me. I want some rest.

872
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:31,929
But where are we going?

873
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,389
Shut up and go.

874
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:40,509
Here we go.

875
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,121
"White Day
March 14th"

876
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,558
I'll take that one.

877
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:16,106
Sorry. Did I make you wait?

878
00:51:16,518 --> 00:51:17,975
No, I just got here.

879
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:23,385
-Did you get your wrist checked?
-Yes, your friend was very kind.

880
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:24,386
Really?

881
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,126
I got this...

882
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:35,604
-What's this?
-It's just for White Day.

883
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:38,935
You'll be on duty on White Day, right?

884
00:51:40,255 --> 00:51:41,116
Yeah.

885
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,533
Try it.

886
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,110
It's soft and sweet.

887
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:56,972
When will we get as sweet as this?

888
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:29,496
We'll meet three suspects tonight.

889
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:32,171
Be alert and find
who the prime suspect is.

890
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:34,485
Come in.

891
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,950
We've been waiting for you.

892
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,106
Oh, she's my personal secretary.

893
00:52:40,518 --> 00:52:42,895
Hello, I'm Do Bongsoon.

894
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:44,128
I see.

895
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:46,649
It's a family meeting,
please wait outside...

896
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:48,335
She's my secretary. It's okay.

897
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,406
She knows we're just acting as family.

898
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:02,513
That looks so good.

899
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:15,036
Don't just eat and find the suspect.

900
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:21,031
I asked you to gather today...

901
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:22,823
...to announce unofficially...

902
00:53:23,851 --> 00:53:26,293
...the heir of my company.

903
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:29,740
I didn't call the lawyer because...

904
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,497
...it's not about inheritance
or handing over my shares.

905
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:41,277
It's about deciding who will be the heir
and announcing it to everyone here.

906
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:43,093
Because I'll resign soon.

907
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:46,710
-Honey, what are you talking about?
-Father.

908
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,452
I started the business
as Osung Constructions...

909
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:53,073
...and expanded it to Osung Foods.

910
00:53:53,385 --> 00:53:54,511
I was only very lucky.

911
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,874
The company is at a crossroad.

912
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:01,682
Will we remain as a mediocre
medium-size constructor...

913
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:05,209
...or will we grow into a big corporation?

914
00:54:05,518 --> 00:54:08,563
The next CEO can ignore
the hierarchy at home.

915
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:10,180
Forget about hierarchy!

916
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,041
I will hand it over to the best manager.

917
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:16,561
You do it, Minhyuk.

918
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:23,521
You made the right choice, Father.

919
00:54:24,134 --> 00:54:27,062
Minhyuk will do a good job.

920
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,515
How can you decide this
without discussing it with us?

921
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:34,255
Because it's his business.
He can do whatever he wants.

922
00:54:34,344 --> 00:54:35,439
Okay.

923
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:38,310
I'm running my own company.

924
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:42,087
I'll see if we can merge both businesses
on amicable terms.

925
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:43,749
What? Who are you?

926
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,005
Who are you to merge on amicable terms?

927
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:51,274
The game market is a blue ocean.

928
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:54,389
If Ainsoft becomes
an affiliate of Osung Group...

929
00:54:54,536 --> 00:54:56,627
...the company's image will change.

930
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:01,818
It's just a game company.

931
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:07,271
He makes money from children that gamble.
And you want to leave it to him?

932
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:14,411
Yes! It's just a game company...

933
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,563
"Attack
Defense"

934
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:18,486
And made operating profits of 180 billion.

935
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:21,599
I am impressed with his performance.

936
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:25,186
Did you ever do anything like that?

937
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:27,318
No, honey! Please!

938
00:55:30,919 --> 00:55:33,027
Please, honey.

939
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:35,036
Please, sit down.

940
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:42,139
No matter which way I look at it,

941
00:55:42,296 --> 00:55:44,117
I think your father is the one.

942
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:45,930
Yes.

943
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,371
Why would my father try to hurt me?

944
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:52,955
Why did I think you could ever help? Jeez.

945
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:57,385
He has the typical face of a suspect.

946
00:55:57,573 --> 00:55:59,006
Shut it and go to Dobong-dong.

947
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:00,994
What? What about you?

948
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:02,602
I'll drive home.

949
00:56:02,888 --> 00:56:05,719
I hurt one toe,
but it doesn't mean I can't drive.

950
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:10,915
After all the fuss you made for your toe.

951
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:12,135
I can hear you.

952
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:14,204
Okay.

953
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:17,919
Should I play some music?

954
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,619
-No, just go.
-Okay...

955
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:23,823
-What?
-What? I didn't say anything.

956
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:28,745
-You said something.
-No.We're heading to Dobong-dong, sir.

957
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:51,319
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

958
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:58,818
Hey, you!

959
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:04,442
Did you ask for a designated driver?

960
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:05,873
Oh, yes.

961
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,319
I'm getting off here.

962
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,469
It's not your house.

963
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:32,916
I'm so stressed out that...

964
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:34,904
Because of you, jerk.

965
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,323
I need a painkiller.
I'm going to the pharmacy.

966
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:41,391
Bye, Mr. An!

967
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:45,326
Secretary Do!

968
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,539
Come to my house tomorrow.
Early in the morning.

969
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,199
Are you not going to the hospital?

970
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:52,738
It's just a cracked toe, why?

971
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:55,497
That's what I want to say, you jerk.

972
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:57,107
Go.

973
00:57:58,088 --> 00:57:59,242
-Bye.
-Okay.

974
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:06,850
-Hey!
-You scared me.

975
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:09,253
Did he give you a ride again?

976
00:58:09,342 --> 00:58:13,233
Are you on the guard here?
You're everywhere.

977
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:16,006
Your boss must have nothing better to do.

978
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:17,242
Is that why he's giving you rides?

979
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,565
Yes. He's someone who really
has nothing better to do.

980
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:26,185
You're my daughter, but you know
that you lack many things, don't you?

981
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:28,531
Then you should try harder.

982
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,454
Try harder on what?

983
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:33,798
Try to look sexy.

984
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,521
Look at me. See?

985
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:39,834
Women should never give up trying
to be sexy no matter their age.

986
00:58:39,923 --> 00:58:45,859
Anyway, if you keep this up, you'll end up
with a miserable life. Do you get it?

987
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:47,376
I'm going to the pharmacy.
You go home.

988
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:49,544
You're so clueless.

989
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:51,999
-I'm coming with you!
-What seems to be the problem?

990
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:57,416
I've been having headaches lately.
It's because I'm so stressed out.

991
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:00,805
-Can I get a painkiller, please?
-Okay.

992
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:02,806
I need this.

993
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:05,262
-Hey, look.
-Mom!

994
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,941
Stop! Stop! Mom, stop!

995
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,797
My dear daughter...

996
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:14,366
-Hello.
-Hey, the spray is good.

997
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:15,927
-Bandages and antiseptics.
-Stop it!

998
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:18,254
What's wrong? Let's buy this one.

999
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:19,743
Go.

1000
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:21,599
-No!
-I faked it.

1001
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,126
I didn't spray it.

1002
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:26,055
Thank you.

1003
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:27,842
We'll take this one, too.

1004
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,454
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1005
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,063
How is my daughter doing at work?

1006
00:59:58,152 --> 01:00:00,180
-Do you like your job?
-Like it?  It's so-so.

1007
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:03,287
-Is your boss pushy?
-Of course, that's his job.

1008
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:07,804
Does he harass you sexually
and give you strange looks?

1009
01:00:08,889 --> 01:00:12,489
You should clean your ears.
How many times did I tell you?

1010
01:00:12,578 --> 01:00:16,079
Her boss likes men.
I'm still disappointed.

1011
01:00:16,966 --> 01:00:18,582
Are you sure he likes men?

1012
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:20,717
Yes, I'm sure.

1013
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:24,447
I think he likes Gukdoo.

1014
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:28,176
-Who? Gukdoo?
-What? Your boss is really handsome.

1015
01:00:28,265 --> 01:00:29,718
Tell me about it.

1016
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:32,775
His face is as shiny as Choonshim's bowl.

1017
01:00:32,864 --> 01:00:36,299
If he were not gay,
he'd be so promiscuous.

1018
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:39,205
Gukdoo is standing in your way, then?

1019
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:41,021
Mom stop it. Keep your pride.

1020
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:45,755
But you should never give up.
What do you lack compared to Gukdoo?

1021
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:52,632
Anyway, her boss is peculiar.

1022
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,055
He gets hospitalized for nothing
and also leaves as he pleases.

1023
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:56,545
-Hospitalized?
-Yes.

1024
01:00:56,634 --> 01:00:58,120
She trampled on his foot
and he hurt his toe.

1025
01:00:58,209 --> 01:01:01,472
Why did you trample on his foot?
When you should be washing his feet.

1026
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:06,175
-Hello?
-I'm Heeji.

1027
01:01:06,264 --> 01:01:09,712
-Oh, hi.
-Thank you for everything at the hospital.

1028
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,695
I'd like to treat you to a meal.
When are you available?

1029
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:14,867
Oh, but you don't have to.

1030
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,502
Please, don't refuse.

1031
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:21,402
Okay. Tomorrow I'm on night duty,
so lunch will be fine.

1032
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:24,569
Okay. I'll call you when I get there.

1033
01:01:24,658 --> 01:01:25,560
Okay.

1034
01:01:27,158 --> 01:01:28,039
Who was that?

1035
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:29,780
Gukdoo's girlfriend.

1036
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:31,449
And why does Gukdoo's girlfriend call you?

1037
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:34,392
She wants to have lunch together.

1038
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,045
Don't have lunch with just any girl.

1039
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:39,042
She has a boyfriend, doesn't she?

1040
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:40,336
And she's not even pretty.

1041
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:42,502
-She's really pretty.
-Yeah, right.

1042
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:44,167
Flirting by making eyes.

1043
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:45,716
You should do that, too.

1044
01:01:46,057 --> 01:01:48,353
Is that illegal? Will you be fined?

1045
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:50,909
You should also flirt with your boss
by making eyes at him.

1046
01:01:51,024 --> 01:01:53,301
-Don't trample on his feet.
-Will you stop it?

1047
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,825
Are you going to meet her?

1048
01:01:54,914 --> 01:01:58,569
It'll be weird if I refuse.
She could come with Gukdoo.

1049
01:01:58,658 --> 01:02:00,284
No! Don't meet her.

1050
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,884
Mom, you told me to sleep
in my boss's house...

1051
01:02:03,984 --> 01:02:06,100
...and you won't let him
have lunch with a girl?

1052
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,858
He's not like you. One is for import
and the other for export.

1053
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,692
You sell at a high price
and buy at a low price.

1054
01:02:11,825 --> 01:02:13,225
My goodness!

1055
01:02:13,324 --> 01:02:15,457
Who are we exporting
and who are we importing?

1056
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:16,952
I don't know!

1057
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:19,723
We drank all the beer.
Go and get some beer.

1058
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:21,687
-Okay, I'm going.
-Should I go?

1059
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:23,073
No, I'll go.

1060
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,093
Let me out.

1061
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,095
Excuse me. Open the door.

1062
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:48,359
Please let me out!

1063
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:10,947
I had an uneasy hunch that
I would soon have to use my strength.

1064
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:32,336
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

1065
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,025
Boss, the world is so dark
and you are the light!

1066
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:36,379
-You're the hope!
-The hope! Be our boss!

1067
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:39,105
I like women that are as light
and soft as the cosmos.

1068
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:41,692
Someone you want to protect.
Do Bongsoon, we're friends.

1069
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:44,825
I also get mad and hurt!

1070
01:04:44,957 --> 01:04:48,057
You're so weird.
Rice! I want rice!

1071
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:50,591
I don't know what I'll do if I get mad.

1072
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:54,437
-It hurts!
-I'm going to take your butt away!

1073
01:04:54,525 --> 01:04:56,226
She's extremely cute.

1074
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:00,219
She's having fun.
She seems to be very cheerful.

1075
01:05:00,425 --> 01:05:02,659
Follow her. Smoothly.

1076
01:05:02,924 --> 01:05:04,353
I've been blackmailed.

1077
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:06,459
-Mr. An!
-It's the same guy.

1078
01:05:06,558 --> 01:05:08,092
If I catch them, I'll kill them.

1079
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,024
-I think I should hold you.
-Is this the voice you heard?

1080
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:12,914
-Sorry.
-We have a report of a missing person.

1081
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:14,532
I think it's connected.
