1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,038
Romeo.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,103
Juliet.

3
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:59,127
-My goodness!
-My foot! Do something!

4
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:01,028
Sorry!

5
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:02,706
Romeo!

6
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,866
Romeo! Romeo, stop! Please! Romeo! Romeo!

7
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,786
No! No! No!

8
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,132
Gosh. What a crazy dream.

9
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:26,887
Shoot. No water.

10
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,269
Gosh.

11
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,533
What happened?

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,725
Who are you?

13
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,355
Hey!

14
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:35,870
Get up right now.

15
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:45,417
Okay.

16
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,689
No.

17
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,618
Hey, don't. Do...

18
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,556
Sir, why do you always play golf at dawn?

19
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:04,865
Play and you'll understand why.

20
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,005
I see.

21
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,869
We have to take care of Do Bongsoon's
and An Minhyuk's cases at once.

22
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,780
I wonder how they're handling it.

23
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:15,394
Those two are the best in our company.

24
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,596
They trained overseas.

25
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,816
They were trained in Muay Thai
by Ong-Bak's master in Thailand.

26
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,444
You didn't have to send them both.
It's waste of manpower.

27
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,340
I don't know why, but I'm nervous.

28
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:31,755
There's something extraordinary
about that woman.

29
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,514
I have a bad feeling about this.

30
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,643
Goodness. Don't worry.

31
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:49,860
Isn't this Oh Hyunjoong?

32
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,299
It is. The guy who shot me
and stabbed the cop.

33
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:58,742
Their faces will get numb
if they sleep on the cold floor.

34
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,697
Excuse me.

35
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,760
Yes. You'll feel more comfortable now.

36
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,152
Poor thing. I'm sorry.

37
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,638
This charm will help
them achieve unity of love.

38
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:58,069
It will ignite the flames of love!

39
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:00,513
-Sparks will fly!
-Sparks?

40
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:03,703
Yes, sparks will fly!

41
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,387
Fire

42
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:40,953
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

43
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,089
I hate the police.

44
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:47,542
I'll question them myself
in the morning when I wake up.

45
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:48,635
Okay.

46
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:55,634
I finally caught the blackmailer!

47
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,334
Yay!

48
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,588
Hello?

49
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,605
Is everything alright?

50
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,024
Yes.

51
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,057
Good.

52
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,881
-I was worried, so I called.
-Okay.

53
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:44,738
"Boss"

54
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,703
Has it been taken care of?

55
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,335
The shareholders' meeting is today.

56
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,151
Make sure to keep him there
so he can't go.

57
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,253
That was great.

58
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,424
By the way, did you catch Do Bongsoon?

59
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,820
-She's more important.
-Why is she more important?

60
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,429
Who are you?

61
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,035
What's wrong? Are you surprised
that I picked up?

62
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:19,149
Your men tried to do their job but...

63
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,541
...unfortunately, my employee caught them.

64
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,521
I won't call the police
if you tell me who's behind this.

65
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:27,129
I'll call the police if you don't.

66
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,901
It's better if you talk to me
instead of the police.

67
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:34,396
The police would want
to know a lot about you...

68
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,391
...but I only want to know
who's behind this.

69
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,958
I can't give you much time.

70
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,613
My goodness.

71
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:57,860
One lacks strength,
the other lacks intelligence.

72
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:02,349
Each one of the twins inherited
one ability instead of both.

73
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,117
My goodness.

74
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,146
Have you called Bongsoon?

75
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,696
I really hope something
happened last night.

76
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,479
-What?
-I want to see her.

77
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,355
Tell her to come.
I should see her before I leave.

78
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,395
-Okay, Mom.
-What should I feed you?

79
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,032
Grandma, stay longer.

80
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,119
-Stay for ten days.
-Okay, my sweetie.

81
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:30,210
By the way, what kind of job
did Bongsoon get?

82
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,467
Hello?

83
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,238
Wake up.

84
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,078
Have some water.

85
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,768
"Osung Group Shareholder Meeting"

86
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,902
Come here.

87
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,391
Where is Minhyuk?

88
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,092
Well, we couldn't reach him.

89
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,510
How on earth...

90
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:17,550
We can't make the shareholders
wait any longer.

91
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,321
-Wrap it up.
-Yes, father.

92
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,769
We are tremendously sorry
for making you wait.

93
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:29,351
As previously informed,
today's agenda was validating...

94
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:34,834
...An Minhyuk's qualifications
as the successor of Osung Group.

95
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:41,499
But unfortunately, he couldn't
make it to the meeting.

96
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,578
He should've come here today
to clarify the rumors.

97
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:50,240
By not showing up, he's telling us
that he doesn't want to take over.

98
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,715
Sorry I'm late!

99
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:05,567
Sorry. I had to take care of
an unwanted guest in the morning.

100
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:09,265
A guest showed up unexpectedly
at my house early in the morning.

101
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,205
I had to offer them hospitality.
I apologize.

102
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:14,381
I have something to show you.

103
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,745
That's my house right now.

104
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,402
-Hello?
-Do Bongsoon, do you hear me?

105
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,731
You can't hear me?
Can you see me?

106
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,212
I can see you too clearly.
Move your face away.

107
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,968
-Show us the guests we had.
-Can you see me?

108
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,324
Hold on.

109
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:46,093
These two assailants broke
into my house last night.

110
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,834
What's that?

111
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:55,893
Actually, for the last six months,
I've received all sorts of threats...

112
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,346
...to give up my position as heir.

113
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,237
I was tailed constantly.

114
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,690
I was even shot at with metal beads.

115
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:05,673
Who on earth would do that?

116
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,900
Who would do that?

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,376
It must've been someone who doesn't
want me to take over Osung Group.

118
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:17,026
And that someone spread
groundless and malicious rumors...

119
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,778
...to tarnish the image of Osung Group.

120
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,231
Who would do that?

121
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:25,783
As you know, I've successfully
led and managed Ainsoft...

122
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,061
...an online gaming company
for the last six years.

123
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,685
So I didn't have the ambition
to succeed my father in Osung.

124
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:35,737
However, I cannot let Osung be
fooled around by someone...

125
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,122
...who plays childish blackmailing games.

126
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,934
And that someone
who is trying to stop me...

127
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,834
...is here right in this room.

128
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,511
-Here?
-Who?

129
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,457
He knows what I'm talking about.

130
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:57,035
I'm afraid we'll have to
postpone this meeting.

131
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:59,549
First, I must find the blackmailer.

132
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,744
I will hold another meeting
when I have him here.

133
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,085
If you're against this,
please raise your hand.

134
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,167
My goodness. What's going on?

135
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,528
What is this?

136
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:24,429
By the way, I'm a healthy man
that likes women very much...

137
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,795
...and I assure you that I keep
my personal life quite clean.

138
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:32,999
Though I'm actually concerned
about my overly ascetic lifestyle.

139
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:36,505
I will find out who is blackmailing me
as soon as possible.

140
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:40,186
I ask for your understanding.

141
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,055
How could you mess this up?

142
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:51,054
That's why you can only be a mobster!
Get it, jerk?

143
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:55,340
If you were paid to do a job,
you should do it properly.

144
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,170
Answer me, you scum!

145
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,304
This little brat. How dare he!

146
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:00,636
Why I ought to...!

147
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:06,662
Sir, three of our men who were
on voluntary patrol in Dobong-dong...

148
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:07,747
...ended up in the hospital.

149
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,233
-How?
-They got beaten up.

150
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:12,010
Who beat them?
Which prick is it this time?

151
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:12,990
It's not a prick.

152
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,021
Apparently, it was a granny.

153
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,024
What? A granny?

154
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,593
Yes, a granny.

155
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:22,594
An old lady?

156
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,119
An old lady.

157
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,697
Anyone you have in mind?

158
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:30,586
Baek Tak must have given the orders.

159
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,467
-It was his men.
-What?

160
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:34,533
One of my brothers must be behind him.

161
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:35,887
He's close to my brothers.

162
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,783
Then I'll bring in Baek Tak and ask him.
Tell him to come right now!

163
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:42,937
Father, don't. People will say you
can't even control your children.

164
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,773
I'll take care of it quietly.
Leave it to me.

165
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:54,092
This is humiliating!

166
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,634
It wasn't enough that you got
beaten up by a tiny girl...

167
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:00,250
...and now what? A granny?

168
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,991
And the ones we sent to his house
armed with weapons...

169
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,237
...got caught and confined!

170
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,082
Do all of you lack tenacity?

171
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,429
Or are you actually working
for our competitor?

172
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,390
I can't stand the sight of you! Get out!

173
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:14,037
I should hire new men
or move to another country!

174
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,300
Darn, my blood pressure!

175
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,326
-Help me...
-Sir!

176
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,964
This is the file that you asked for.

177
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,383
- I'll give you some side dishes.
- I want braised beef.

178
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,545
-That one. That one.
-Okay.

179
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,342
That's enough.

180
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,727
You'll want to go to the bathroom
if you eat too much.

181
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,947
-No.
-Miss.

182
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:09,864
-Yes?
-Well...

183
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,470
...I need to take a leak.

184
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,122
-What?
-A leak.

185
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,315
What? Why did you feed them?
They were up to no good.

186
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,712
Come in.

187
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,995
You have a guest, sir.

188
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:56,382
We do anything for money.

189
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,660
But this is a family affair.
You deal with it.

190
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:01,588
Mr. Baek.

191
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:06,614
Your business is doing quite well.
Why take this dirty job?

192
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,646
Out of loyalty and friendship.

193
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,354
The goal was to scare you.

194
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,998
He didn't want his brother to get hurt.

195
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:19,115
A promise is a promise,
so I'll let it slide this time.

196
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,125
But only this time.

197
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,943
I have to go.

198
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,440
Will you let me hire Do Bongsoon...?

199
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:32,523
Well...

200
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,592
...I guess not.

201
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:39,335
How do you know her?

202
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,960
My men were...

203
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,582
Anyway...

204
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,309
Recently, I was...

205
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,317
...humiliated by her.

206
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,204
How did you hire her?

207
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,299
How much is her salary?
Is she expensive?

208
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,054
That's enough for today.

209
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,785
How could you mess this up?

210
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,803
That's why you can only be a mobster!
Get it, jerk?

211
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,117
If you were paid to do a job,
you should do it properly.

212
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:56,031
Answer me, you scum!

213
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,405
I want it done properly.

214
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:36,823
Mr. An.

215
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:40,728
My bodyguard is here.

216
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,404
Are you okay?

217
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,280
No,

218
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,373
I'm not okay.

219
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:54,040
Who was it?

220
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,147
Your stepmother?

221
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,108
No.

222
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,862
-Your eldest brother?
-No.

223
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,038
-Your third brother?
-No.

224
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,669
I knew it! It was your father!

225
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:15,741
You didn't expect this either.

226
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:32,234
No way. Seriously?
Is it really your second brother?

227
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,307
He should've just told me.

228
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:39,614
I could have helped him.

229
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,780
If he wanted to be chairman...

230
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,125
...he could have just asked me.

231
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,281
What should I do now?

232
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,469
Who should I trust?

233
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:07,636
Mr. An!

234
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:10,052
How about if we go out for a change?

235
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:13,265
We can roam around
from place to place like maniacs.

236
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:17,717
-What?
-Come on. We should go.

237
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:20,857
-Let's go.
-Don't push me too hard.

238
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:31,705
You haven't had your one meal yet, right?

239
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,071
I'm so hungry.

240
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:40,644
There's a good tteokbokki place
over there. Let's have tteokbokki!

241
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:45,791
One plate of Soondae
with liver and lungs.

242
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,421
And soybean paste dip.

243
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,962
We'll also have tteokbokki,
gimbap, jjolmyeon, dumplings...

244
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,796
...and rice topped with squid.
We'll have all those.

245
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,412
-Okay.
-Thanks.

246
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:57,925
You'll eat all that?

247
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:58,934
Yes.

248
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:04,434
You used a lot of energy, huh?
You know what you want.

249
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:10,063
Well, whenever my mom kicked me out,
I came here and wandered around.

250
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,986
Why did she kick you out?

251
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,939
Because I do nothing for a living.

252
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:17,934
Was she hard on you because you didn't
make it to college when your brother did?

253
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,095
No.

254
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,306
She has been hard on me
ever since I can remember.

255
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,586
For being strong like a brute.

256
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,865
Wow, thank you!

257
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:33,603
This is it! Soybean paste.
Have you tried this before?

258
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,940
No, and I don't want to.

259
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:39,155
Soondae dipped in
this sauce tastes like heaven.

260
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,982
Try some.

261
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:43,349
Ah.

262
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,051
Ah!

263
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:54,994
Wow, it's good!

264
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,151
You have to taste it to know.

265
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:58,482
How did you know?

266
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,287
How did you know
it tastes good with this sauce?

267
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:02,533
My family eats it like this.

268
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,331
Where's your hometown?

269
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:05,494
Dobong-dong.

270
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:09,154
Did they name you Do Bongsoon
because you were born in Dobong-dong?

271
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,075
I don't know.

272
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,496
She came here from Daegu
when she was ten years old.

273
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,609
-She stayed here since then.
-I got it!

274
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,849
She has three older brothers.

275
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:26,906
The eldest was appointed
Chief of Daegu Public Prosecution Office.

276
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:30,586
So I went back to Daegu
and lived there for ten years.

277
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:33,797
Her second brother lives in Canada.

278
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,534
-My goodness.
-Her third brother...

279
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:37,763
...teaches in a school in Songdo.

280
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,211
Jinyi, you have a prosecutor brother?

281
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:43,818
Oh, my goodness.
Why didn't you tell us?

282
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:47,513
What for? Every family has
a judge or a prosecutor.

283
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,851
Yes, I have five birds!

284
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:54,244
Oh, my goodness! What's going on?

285
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,301
-Is it an earthquake?
-It's an earthquake!

286
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:58,361
It's not an earthquake.
What are you talking about?

287
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:01,438
-Those fell down!
-Let's see.

288
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,051
-I have five birds.
-Go or stop?

289
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,779
Stop, of course.

290
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:19,446
Hey!

291
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:44,337
Don't cry. You can't eat if you cry.

292
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:45,701
Mom!

293
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,348
I said don't cry!

294
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,045
The bride must be beautiful.

295
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,881
You're my third bride.

296
00:26:56,516 --> 00:27:00,497
I'll have a wedding with seven brides.

297
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,883
You need to lose
two kilograms before then.

298
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,211
You're beautiful...

299
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,122
...but your calves are a little thick.

300
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:31,350
Mom...

301
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:52,667
Anyone there? Can anyone hear me?

302
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:57,296
Do you hear me? Are you there?

303
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,302
I was also kidnapped.

304
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,731
Tap on the wall if you hear me.

305
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,952
-We have to work together.
-I'm scared.

306
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:09,241
I'm terrified.

307
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:14,879
It's okay. He won't kill you.
Pretend to do as he says.

308
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:17,229
Then he'll release your arms and legs
like how he did for me.

309
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,098
Do you understand what I'm saying?

310
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,251
Smell of petrol.

311
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,177
Gasoline... Asphalt?

312
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:33,585
Hey! Let's go to a sauna.

313
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,814
-Okay.
-Let's go.

314
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:39,241
Where's the Crime Squad?

315
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:40,836
That way.

316
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:46,089
Detective. My daughter went
to the dawn prayer session...

317
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,195
...and disappeared.

318
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,113
What?

319
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,852
It's been awhile
since I've taken the bus.

320
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:01,830
The bus reminds me of someone.

321
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:07,609
About eight years ago,
I was on my way to see my mom.

322
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:11,486
The bus almost fell off
a cliff, but then...

323
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:13,698
...someone miraculously saved us.

324
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,167
I thought...

325
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:19,435
...she was an angel my mom
sent to me from heaven.

326
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,073
Oops, excuse me.

327
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,275
Hello?

328
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,110
Oh! Granny!

329
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:46,918
Yes. I'm on my way home now.

330
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,576
Yes, I miss you too.

331
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:54,475
Okay. See you.

332
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,851
"See you."

333
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:59,103
-Was that your grandmother?
-Yes.

334
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,370
My grandma is in town.

335
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:03,420
Oh, yeah.

336
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,012
When can I start working
for the development team?

337
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:12,361
When else? After you finish training.

338
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:13,279
What?

339
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,782
That wasn't the deal.

340
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:19,745
Gosh, how long do I have to train?

341
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,599
Until you can disguise yourself
perfectly in the crowd...

342
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:25,500
...and stand against any kind of threat.

343
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:28,894
When your offense
and defense levels are full.

344
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,093
Promise me.

345
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:35,495
I promise.

346
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:43,440
I wish I could stay with you,
but I have to go and see my grandma.

347
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:46,477
Can you stay alone?

348
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:49,245
You're worried about me?

349
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:53,218
Okay.

350
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,399
We'll spend the night
at our own houses tonight.

351
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:59,313
I'll go to my parents.

352
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:01,597
I need to confront him.

353
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:05,212
Wow, that's cool.

354
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,071
Hey, I'm your boss.

355
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,910
Mr. An, cheer up.

356
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,776
If the world fools you,
just smile and say...

357
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:18,830
..."that was well played"!

358
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:19,748
Okay?

359
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,543
Okay.

360
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:28,409
You! Don't walk around the alleys
of Dobong-dong alone.

361
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,580
Okay.

362
00:31:30,984 --> 00:31:34,754
Don't cry feeling sad alone, okay?

363
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:37,848
Promise.

364
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:41,299
Sealed.

365
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,079
-Gosh.
-What?

366
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,137
Delicious.

367
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:57,815
Mom, be honest with me.
How much money did you make?

368
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,423
-Why do you ask?
-Oh, come on.

369
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:02,806
Gosh, you always ask...

370
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,293
Oh my Buddha. It's my son-in-law!

371
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:06,885
Bongsoon!

372
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,529
Grandma!

373
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,957
Hi, mom!

374
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:13,632
Oh, my little girl.

375
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:18,598
Mom. I want him to be mine.

376
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,362
What do you mean by you want him?

377
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,466
I want him as my son-in-law.
Isn't he just gorgeous?

378
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,576
I want to take him home.

379
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:29,742
My goodness. He is a good-looking fellow.

380
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,208
So he's my grandson-in-law?

381
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:32,684
- Yes.
- Mom!

382
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:34,627
Granny.

383
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:39,832
She's my grandma.

384
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:44,720
How are you? I'm An Minhyuk.
I'm a colleague of Bongsoon's.

385
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:48,710
Oh, I see. My grandson-in-law.

386
00:32:58,949 --> 00:32:59,806
Bye!

387
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:00,815
Bye, ma'am.

388
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,196
He's so charming.

389
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:07,695
Mom!

390
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:10,489
Mom! Why did you call him your son-in-law?

391
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,288
I'm so embarrassed
that I can't go to work.

392
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:14,684
It's okay. What about it?

393
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:18,212
This is all your fault, mom.
You went overboard.

394
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,378
Tell me, did you sleep with him or not?

395
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:22,735
Mom, I'm going to get mad!

396
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,733
When I was young, you told me
not to trust men because...

397
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:28,985
...they're all after the same thing
and they're like animals.

398
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,308
You told me to not even
hold hands with men.

399
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:34,511
How am I supposed to react to this?

400
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,046
You should have let me be
more carefree then.

401
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,219
What's the point of doing it now?

402
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:45,229
Everything has a timing.
And now is the right time.

403
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:46,598
It's him.

404
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:51,391
Give that man everything
you kept until now.

405
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:55,050
The things you teach your own daughter.

406
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,020
Right, granny?

407
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:57,039
Granny.

408
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,582
Drink this.

409
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,383
Tell us what happened.

410
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:01,568
My daughter...

411
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:04,955
...went to the prayer meeting on the 21st.

412
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,412
She left home at 4:30 AM.

413
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:11,516
I told her that the neighborhood
is dangerous these days.

414
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,055
I asked her to pray at home, but...

415
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,658
I told her to do that but...

416
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,123
If you're born a daughter,
you grow up to be a wife.

417
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,968
And if the wife...

418
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:36,049
...gives birth to a daughter
with the blessings of heaven...

419
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,362
...she becomes a mother.

420
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:44,895
The mother raises the daughter...

421
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,613
...and when that daughter
gets married and has a child...

422
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:55,574
...the mother becomes a granny.

423
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,568
Then...

424
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:03,335
...the mother of the mother
who now is the granny...

425
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:09,711
...fulfills her life and returns to dust.

426
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:15,661
Then that daughter
becomes a mother again...

427
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,421
..and a granny later.

428
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:19,923
That's right.

429
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:27,310
That's the life
that was passed down to us.

430
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,328
We were destined to pass down...

431
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:36,088
...our strength to our daughters.

432
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:42,774
So, we must follow what heaven decreed.

433
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:46,071
Granny, I want to ask something.

434
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:51,379
If we lose the strength that was
passed down to us like mom did...

435
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:53,775
...can we gain it back again?

436
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,325
I'm not sure about that.

437
00:35:56,141 --> 00:36:00,741
That's also decided by heaven, I guess.

438
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:05,221
I tried everything I could,
but nothing worked.

439
00:36:06,252 --> 00:36:09,224
But I'm happy about my life.

440
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:15,161
My strength was passed down
to you, so I'm fine.

441
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:20,109
Bongsoon, I hope you have a daughter.

442
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:38,316
I used to think this
when I looked at Gukdoo.

443
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:43,145
I don't remember if it was during
junior high or high school.

444
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:47,763
I dreamt of marrying him
and having only three sons.

445
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:50,980
That dream won't come true...

446
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:56,114
...but I used to hate the idea
of having a girl just like me.

447
00:36:56,371 --> 00:37:02,527
But now I think having a daughter
wouldn't be a bad idea.

448
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:14,799
I'm glad it's you.

449
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:18,002
-I'm sorry.
-This is what I told myself.

450
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,895
"I'll kill him if I catch him."

451
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,003
But he was so childish.

452
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,819
Shooting metal beads.
Blackmailing me over the phone.

453
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:32,354
I couldn't understand how someone
that wanted to own a company...

454
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:35,384
...could be so childish.

455
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:39,980
You've always been faint at heart.
I had to protect you all the time.

456
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:44,953
My memory is stuck back
to when you were a coward.

457
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:49,033
You stopped whenever I scared you.

458
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:52,661
So I only wanted to scare you.

459
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,712
Let's keep this between us.

460
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:03,748
You helped me when I was a kid.
Let's call it even.

461
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,001
But don't ever...

462
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,530
...do that again.

463
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:13,637
If you do, I'll be mad. Very mad.

464
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:16,678
I'm sorry.

465
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:41,127
Alright!

466
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,171
What's this?

467
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:03,999
This is a serial case!

468
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:05,641
Did you think the press
wouldn't find out...

469
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,339
...if you investigate behind closed doors?

470
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,639
You were supposed to
collaborate with Team B...

471
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,378
...and not look out for your own interest.

472
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:14,586
-I'm sorry, sir.
-We already have three victims!

473
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:18,549
We've been searching
everywhere to track him down...

474
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,173
...but we didn't find anyone
that fits the description.

475
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,462
What have you been doing?

476
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:30,094
-When I go to headquarters...
-Yes, sir.

477
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:32,536
...what am I supposed
to tell my superiors?

478
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,685
Move!

479
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,691
I'll take care of it, sir.

480
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,843
Salute!

481
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:49,618
-Boss!
-Boss!

482
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:51,451
-How are you?
-How are you?

483
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,842
Are you going to school now?

484
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,496
What do you mean?

485
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:57,425
-We're on our way from school.
-What?

486
00:39:57,509 --> 00:39:59,591
We ditched school.

487
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:02,384
So you left without notice.

488
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,816
-Yes!
-Get back there now.

489
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,426
But there's nothing more
to learn in school.

490
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,407
Then I guess I won't see you anymore.

491
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,314
Will you go back or not?

492
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,305
-We'll go back!
-We'll go back!

493
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:18,187
Then go back! Now!

494
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:19,871
Let's go. Let's go.

495
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:21,383
Hurry up so I can see you go in.

496
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,254
-We're going back!
-We are.

497
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:25,265
-Bye, boss!
-Bye!

498
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:29,567
Go up.

499
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:31,637
Don't break the rope.

500
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:32,555
Okay.

501
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,132
Okay, go!

502
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,605
I'm up. What now?

503
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:41,958
Do I go down?

504
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,875
Come down!

505
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:56,661
Strength can be used properly
only when you can control it.

506
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:57,597
You lack control.

507
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,869
From now on, you'll train
to control your strength. Got it?

508
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,609
-Got it.
-Louder. Got it?

509
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,587
Yes!

510
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:12,170
You must be able to control your
strength to make it truly yours.

511
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:13,628
Understood?

512
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,208
- Yes.
- Now look.

513
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:17,542
Hit this thinking that
you're only aiming at me.

514
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,781
-The sandbag?
-Yes, do it.

515
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:28,315
Just a gentle tap trying
to control you strength.

516
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:42,767
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

517
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:44,891
Oh, dear.

518
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,339
Oh, no. No!

519
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:51,709
It's alright.

520
00:41:56,191 --> 00:42:00,366
That wasn't your best, right?
You tried to restrain it, right?

521
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:04,341
This time I'll hold this.

522
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:05,743
Since I'll be holding it...

523
00:42:07,396 --> 00:42:09,136
...so don't use much energy
and tap it very gently.

524
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,679
-Very gently?
-As gently as you can.

525
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:14,599
-Okay.
-I'm holding it, okay?

526
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:16,786
Tap it.

527
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:22,182
See? You did it!

528
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:36,528
Oh, no.

529
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:37,903
Oh, no. Don't.

530
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:46,110
Duck down!

531
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:50,876
One, two, one, two!
Duck down! Duck down!

532
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:52,353
One, two.

533
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,342
-Sorry.
-Not again.

534
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,232
-I told you to control yourself.
-Yes.

535
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:02,016
Give me your hand.

536
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:06,656
I'll hold it tight,
so try to remove it gently.

537
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,993
-You can do it, right?
-Yes.

538
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:13,938
Harder. There. Right.

539
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:17,477
You can do it now.

540
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:29,858
Don't get any ideas.
This is just training.

541
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:35,513
Try to break free
from me without hurting me.

542
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:37,255
Without hurting you?

543
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,363
Yes, that's the most
important part. Do it.

544
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:41,209
-Like this?
-No, wait.

545
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:43,421
-No, wait. Don't do that!
-Like this?

546
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:46,991
-Don't tickle me.
-Like this? Like this?

547
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:48,104
How?

548
00:43:49,939 --> 00:43:53,256
Does that hurt? Don't tease me.

549
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:16,768
Don't use your strength. Stay still.

550
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:20,049
Oh, okay.

551
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,132
Let's keep it...

552
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:32,092
...a secret.

553
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:34,774
What?

554
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,293
Your strength.

555
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:40,044
And us.

556
00:44:40,882 --> 00:44:43,348
What about us?

557
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,524
What else? About our training.

558
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:57,049
Now one last hurdle to clear.

559
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:01,299
We'll test your concentration
and your strength combined.

560
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:04,759
Get ready.

561
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,858
Stone flicking.

562
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:18,611
Try flicking.

563
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:19,671
Okay.

564
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,105
You hit it gently, right?

565
00:45:43,384 --> 00:45:44,884
Take a deep breath.

566
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:50,114
Take away 30 percent
of the energy from your hands.

567
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,885
Not this way.
You want to hit me?

568
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:56,945
Do you want to kill me?

569
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,916
You don't think, do you?
Come this way.

570
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:05,532
Now do it. 30 percent less, okay?

571
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:19,348
Make it 50 percent.

572
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:26,572
90 percent less.

573
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:35,198
There!

574
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:38,323
Congratulations on making it
to Ainsoft's development team.

575
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:41,647
Oh, yes! Yes!

576
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:45,079
Yes! Yes! Yes!

577
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:49,476
I'll take that back.

578
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,139
Wait, no! Mr. An!

579
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:53,644
-No!
-I'll fix it

580
00:46:54,482 --> 00:46:56,380
Sir, you went through a hard time.

581
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,458
-What's this?
-What brought you here, sir?

582
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,945
Clean it up!

583
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,863
Yes, sir!

584
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:22,638
What will you do about it?

585
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,612
I will take revenge.

586
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,179
Leave it to me, boss.

587
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:31,175
That is disgusting.

588
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,849
Why did you put it here?

589
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:35,088
Darn it.

590
00:47:35,882 --> 00:47:37,293
It's alright.

591
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:39,766
It'll be clean after I wash it.

592
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,158
What? Don't put it...

593
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,464
-Gosh.
-You'll just put it in like that?

594
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,325
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

595
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:50,718
Do what you can.

596
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,363
Where are the others?

597
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:56,282
I put them right next door
so you don't have to walk far.

598
00:47:58,121 --> 00:47:59,944
Let me escort you, sir.

599
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:03,395
Don't come! Stay there. It's fine.

600
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:07,882
Let me escort... Let go of me!

601
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:09,198
Sir!

602
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:13,432
This is the supply room.

603
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,306
-Sir! Sir, let me escort you.
-This way.

604
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:19,129
-Gosh...
-Let's just go.

605
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:20,644
Let me escort you.

606
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,734
Careful, sir.

607
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,827
-Hey, hold him!
-I am holding him!

608
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:28,099
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

609
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:29,155
Welcome, sir.

610
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:33,071
-Hey, Trap.
-Yes, sir.

611
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:35,192
-They were beaten by a granny?
-Yes, sir.

612
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:38,949
You're going through a lot
getting beaten up by a granny.

613
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:42,049
This may sound like an excuse,
but she really had a nuclear fist.

614
00:48:42,301 --> 00:48:46,069
I've never been punched
with so much force in my life.

615
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:47,886
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

616
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,701
-Shut your trap...!
-Yes, sir?

617
00:48:49,955 --> 00:48:52,016
I wasn't calling you.
I'm talking to them.

618
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:53,716
Just shut your traps.

619
00:48:55,872 --> 00:48:58,699
- Anyone else?
- The ones we hired for Osung...

620
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,711
Oh. Do Bongsoon and frying pan.

621
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,442
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, sir.

622
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:09,452
Thank you, sir.

623
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:22,453
What are they doing?

624
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:25,904
They got a little weird
after they got beaten up.

625
00:49:25,988 --> 00:49:30,243
I don't know how to explain it.
They just lost their sanity.

626
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:34,103
Dog Legs is very smart,
but he can't remember anything...

627
00:49:34,582 --> 00:49:36,816
...after the three times table.

628
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,141
Three times table is good enough.

629
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,954
-Anyone else?
-That's all for today.

630
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:45,716
What did you just say?!

631
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:49,863
Do you mean there'll be
more tomorrow? Get a grip!

632
00:49:50,468 --> 00:49:51,301
What the heck?

633
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,611
Go away! Get rid of him!

634
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,253
Sir, let me escort you.

635
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:59,152
Goodness. You see...

636
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,457
We convinced the landowners,
so they're with us.

637
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,443
I don't know who persuaded them...

638
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:08,749
...but the public officers
and people from the borough

639
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:11,810
...are likely to approve
the commercial building.

640
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:17,463
I told you! I'm an expert.

641
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,240
I said get the one that holds the handle.

642
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:23,712
But is there any way we can defeat
the one that holds the handle?

643
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:27,444
I think we should get rid of him first.

644
00:50:27,563 --> 00:50:30,427
Well, let me see. Let me see.

645
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:33,050
It's time for my fee now.

646
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:37,477
If you pay more, I might tell you.

647
00:50:37,562 --> 00:50:39,270
Okay. I'll give it to you.

648
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:42,887
I might remember.
Oh, the spirits are waiting.

649
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,814
Okay, okay.

650
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:08,500
I am...

651
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:12,587
Your grandmother!

652
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,707
-It's the Japanese soldiers!
-Oh, my. Oh, my!

653
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:21,145
We're in Haengju! Die!

654
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,514
Die! Die!

655
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:27,469
-No! No!
-Not this.

656
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:38,363
Do you know how many
Japanese I crushed with rocks...

657
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,798
...here in Haengju Fortress?

658
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:48,706
Follow me!

659
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:53,909
No matter how strong you are...

660
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:59,283
...you can't beat someone
who wields a blade.

661
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:01,651
Watch out for the blade!

662
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:03,776
Another Japanese!

663
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:06,384
Did you see his eyes?

664
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:09,664
He was so possessed.
I got really scared.

665
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:13,323
-But possessed by who?
-By a female warrior, right?

666
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:19,277
Why sigh so deeply?

667
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:22,808
By the way, Jinyi.
I saw Bongsoon this morning.

668
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:26,958
Some high school students gathered
around her and bowed down to her.

669
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,585
-Oh, my.
-What is she doing?

670
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:31,630
-What are you talking about?
-She looked like a gang leader.

671
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:32,977
Oh, my gosh.

672
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,894
Natural shampoo?

673
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:48,890
Aromatherapy?

674
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:53,270
It's good.

675
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:57,055
Excuse me, I'll take these two.

676
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,035
Okay.

677
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:30,007
Bongsoon! Where are you?

678
00:53:30,612 --> 00:53:32,242
What now?

679
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:37,475
What is it now?

680
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:40,033
Are you taking money
from high school students?

681
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:42,436
Myeongsoo's mom told me
she saw you this morning.

682
00:53:42,521 --> 00:53:45,023
Can't you be just half as good as Bonggi?

683
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:48,625
You never do anything right,
and you always get in trouble.

684
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:51,313
What did I do?

685
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,150
I didn't take money from anyone!

686
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:56,148
Did you see me doing it?

687
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:58,202
I'm not you!

688
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:00,755
You don't know anything!

689
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,435
You always say I'm wrong,
and you hit me for no reason!

690
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,053
Do you think it doesn't hurt me
when you push me and hit me?

691
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:11,048
I get hurt, too.

692
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:15,183
My body might not ache,
but my heart does!

693
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,393
I might be stronger than everyone else...

694
00:54:18,136 --> 00:54:21,671
...but my heart hurts
10, 20 times more! Do you know that?

695
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:28,192
Why... Why do you always think
about Bonggi only?

696
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:33,632
Whenever there's beef,
you only give it to him!

697
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:35,304
You give me chicken instead!

698
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:39,676
When there's something good,
you hide it for Bonggi!

699
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:41,694
It's the same with fruit!

700
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:43,616
You feed me the bad ones!

701
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:46,383
The good and new ones
are always for Bonggi!

702
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,211
You've favored him always!

703
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:53,849
I didn't choose to be born like this!

704
00:54:54,816 --> 00:54:56,317
Why do you...

705
00:54:57,686 --> 00:55:00,700
Why do you hate me so much?

706
00:55:01,347 --> 00:55:03,723
Why do you treat me so badly?

707
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:07,304
I'm your child, too!
Why do you favor him?

708
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,291
You're a woman like me!

709
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:14,812
You're a woman like me!
Why are you so harsh on me? Why?

710
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:26,625
We have online and offline stores.

711
00:55:26,709 --> 00:55:28,693
We don't have a list
for the offline store...

712
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:31,929
...but we do for the online store.

713
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:37,984
Only three customers
ordered this shoe in size 290.

714
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:40,181
-Thank you.
-Hey, Loose.

715
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,963
Get me a background check
on this name and ID number.

716
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:48,767
Mr. Jung Youngbok?

717
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:49,685
Yes, that's me.

718
00:55:49,873 --> 00:55:51,868
Hello, we're the police.

719
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,484
Mr. Kim Youngdae?

720
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:00,457
- Yes?
- Is that you?

721
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:03,347
-Yes.
-Hello, we're the police.

722
00:56:17,557 --> 00:56:18,821
What's that for?

723
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:23,675
I'm taking some soup
to Kyungsim and Bonggi.

724
00:56:25,024 --> 00:56:27,558
He hasn't been eating well.

725
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,321
I like you, Bonggi.

726
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,159
Gukdoo and I are friends.
This isn't right.

727
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:04,009
I know. I gave it a lot of thought.

728
00:57:06,264 --> 00:57:08,058
But I can't control my feelings.

729
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,579
I have a twin sister.

730
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:17,469
-I know.
-She's...

731
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:21,888
She's liked Gukdoo for a long time.

732
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:29,913
Bonggi!

733
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:31,656
Hey, Bongsoon.

734
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:38,823
I think I should go. See you later.

735
00:57:38,908 --> 00:57:40,931
-Okay.
-Wait.

736
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,353
What's going on between you two?

737
00:57:45,893 --> 00:57:49,344
Aren't you dating Gukdoo?

738
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:56,464
I'm Gukdoo's friend.

739
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:59,626
And I'm also Bonggi's sister.

740
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,056
I think I can have a say,
so let me tell you something.

741
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:08,056
I know you can't control your feelings...

742
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,817
...but shouldn't you also think about
those that can get hurt...

743
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,678
...because of
your uncontrollable feelings?

744
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:19,207
Bonggi, you shouldn't do this.

745
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:22,193
Why do you meet with her
when she has a boyfriend?

746
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:25,002
You're making her have false hope.

747
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:27,883
Mom asked me to bring this.

748
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,590
I know it's none of my business.

749
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:38,181
But someone has to step in
so that others don't get hurt.

750
00:58:39,588 --> 00:58:41,516
Don't hurt Gukdoo.

751
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:44,398
And don't make my brother get confused.

752
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,186
Bye.

753
00:58:54,553 --> 00:58:56,542
This guy is an actor.

754
00:58:56,627 --> 00:58:59,845
His name is Song Wongeun
and he signed up last May.

755
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,569
-A play actor?
-Yes.

756
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:03,540
-In this play?
-Yes.

757
00:59:06,183 --> 00:59:08,200
"Bluebeard and His Seven Brides"?

758
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:14,384
"Bluebeard and His Seven Brides"

759
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:43,418
Help!

760
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:46,831
Help!

761
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:48,535
-Help!
-Come here!

762
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,810
You're my seventh bride.

763
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:05,792
You will forever be my immortal bride.

764
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:09,836
Where are those shoes?

765
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:11,695
I lost them.

766
01:00:12,537 --> 01:00:15,881
Only actors come in
and out of the dressing room.

767
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,516
But I lost them here.

768
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:29,016
I'm afraid you have to
come with us to testify.

769
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:32,451
Am I being investigated?

770
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:36,111
Okay, the play ends this month.

771
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:39,435
I'm available in the mornings.
I'll be there.

772
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,606
Do you usually perform at night?

773
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,643
Yes.

774
01:00:44,177 --> 01:00:45,597
Most of our audiences
are working adults...

775
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:47,978
...so we do perform day and night
on the weekends.

776
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:51,281
...but during the weekdays,
we only perform at night.

777
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:57,456
Where were you on the night of the 12th?

778
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,658
I think I was performing here.

779
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:10,133
The day of the murder and play coincide.

780
01:01:10,888 --> 01:01:12,136
He's not the killer.

781
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:16,439
I'll send Bongsoon
his voice recording just in case.

782
01:01:16,582 --> 01:01:17,415
Okay.

783
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,461
There are no CCTVs in the dressing room.

784
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:23,280
Does this killer work for a CCTV company?

785
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:27,126
How can he avoid every camera?

786
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,054
"Hansei 50 Ward"

787
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,584
-Fire!
-Fire! Fire!

788
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:41,983
-The fire extinguisher!
-Oh, no!

789
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:44,034
Fire! Fire!

790
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,762
Quickly!

791
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,173
She just had an injection.

792
01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:01,685
What's that shot for?

793
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,040
You're not a doctor, are you?

794
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,471
The criminal is here!

795
01:02:30,236 --> 01:02:31,395
There!

796
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:32,602
No!

797
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:39,807
Stop!

798
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:52,435
Go the other way!

799
01:03:20,452 --> 01:03:21,931
Come closer.

800
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,901
Are you kidding me?

801
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:28,448
I'm scared someone
will find out about this!

802
01:03:28,532 --> 01:03:31,189
And it's the second time
in this hospital!

803
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:37,082
If the boss finds out,
we'll lose our jobs! We're out!

804
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:40,850
Do you want to end up
selling food in carts?

805
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:42,999
Gukdoo.

806
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:46,081
Do Bongsoon!
Why did you chase him?

807
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:49,401
Did you plan to catch him or what?
Are you out of your mind?

808
01:03:49,485 --> 01:03:51,220
Why are you getting angry at me?

809
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:53,473
Don't worry about me,
worry about yourself!

810
01:03:53,557 --> 01:03:54,971
Worry about your girlfriend!

811
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:58,332
Hey, the killer was in my room...

812
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,970
...but you don't ask if I'm okay,
and now you're fighting again?

813
01:04:04,452 --> 01:04:07,825
Bongsoon, go home.
They're on the guard.

814
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,062
They were when he came in.

815
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,122
Aren't you staying at Minhyuk's house?

816
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,860
I'm not. Grandma's home.

817
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:18,917
What? Why don't you listen?
I told you to stay at his house!

818
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:23,357
Do you know how difficult it was
for me to ask you to stay there?

819
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:27,163
Will you two stop it?
You're fighting again.

820
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:30,507
Go home. I'll take you home.

821
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:33,404
No! I'm going on my own.

822
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:36,288
Hey! Hey, Do Bongsoon!

823
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,743
"Dobong Walnuts"

824
01:04:49,497 --> 01:04:52,456
Do you have egg tarts?

825
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,440
They're sold out.

826
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:56,358
I see.

827
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,022
What about walnut pies?

828
01:04:58,107 --> 01:04:59,339
All sold out, too.

829
01:05:00,566 --> 01:05:02,132
I guess I came too late.

830
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:04,215
Hold on.

831
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:13,136
Walnut buns are our specialty.

832
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,807
You should try these.

833
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:21,070
Here, try this.

834
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:22,857
Thanks.

835
01:05:24,437 --> 01:05:25,834
No, that's fine.

836
01:05:25,918 --> 01:05:27,590
-But...
-That's fine.

837
01:05:30,368 --> 01:05:33,873
Please take good care of my Bongsoon.

838
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:36,699
-I will.
-She's...

839
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,536
...the most precious person to me
in this world.

840
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:41,750
I know that, sir.

841
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,374
Sir.

842
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:51,757
I care a lot about her too.

843
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:54,084
You can trust that I do.

844
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:03,860
Okay, then. I'll trust you.

845
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,066
Thank you.

846
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:09,629
Wait, wait.

847
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:12,060
We got new walnuts.

848
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:14,866
-They're very good.
-No, that's fine.

849
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:16,380
You gave me a lot already.

850
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:19,833
I want you to take it.
We share it with our staff.

851
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,041
They're good. Try some.

852
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:28,194
She's here.

853
01:06:31,129 --> 01:06:32,474
What's your plan?

854
01:06:33,986 --> 01:06:37,310
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

855
01:06:40,373 --> 01:06:41,641
You take care of it.

856
01:06:42,823 --> 01:06:43,800
Yes, sir.

857
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:54,611
Do you think he'll be fine?

858
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,712
Did he take his weapon?

859
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:01,871
He's not a child. I'm sure he did.

860
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:23,087
Hey, Do Bongsoon.

861
01:07:26,483 --> 01:07:27,615
Who are you?

862
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:31,201
Huh?

863
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:38,620
How dare you touch her!

864
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:43,802
How dare you touch her!

865
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,145
Are you crazy?

866
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:50,700
Gukdoo!

867
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,320
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

868
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,587
Are you okay? I pushed you.

869
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:34,189
You worry too much, little one.

870
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:37,460
Do Bongsoon is not a woman.

871
01:08:37,544 --> 01:08:40,950
Lie low from now on, okay?
You make me worry.

872
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,782
Love changes.

873
01:08:42,866 --> 01:08:45,027
I always had someone else in my heart.

874
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:49,749
Having you as a friend is very difficult.
Especially if you're a man.

875
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,164
I got beaten all over my body.

876
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:55,260
Why does she stand in our way?
How do we crush her?

877
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:59,256
Hello, I'm Charles Go.
There is a way.

878
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,168
The last resort!

879
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:03,199
No wonder he was trained abroad.

880
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:04,723
-Mom!
-Where are you?

881
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,896
My mom got kidnapped.

882
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:07,815
Do Bongsoon.

883
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,862
Mom!

884
01:09:08,947 --> 01:09:09,780
Bongsoon!
