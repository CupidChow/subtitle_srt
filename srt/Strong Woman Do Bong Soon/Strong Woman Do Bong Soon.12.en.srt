1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,642
-What are you doing?
-Enjoy.

2
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:18,929
With how many women
did you hang out like this?

3
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,747
Eat yours.

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,554
I've never exchanged noodles
with a woman. You're the first.

5
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,651
You're lying.

6
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:32,267
I never dated a girl
that ate these noodles.

7
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:34,950
Since I've dated non-Asians mostly.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,351
I thought you said,
you were too busy to date.

9
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:40,343
Yes, that's true.

10
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:44,039
Your father told me
that you were quite famous...

11
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:47,454
...for dating a lot of girls
when you studied abroad.

12
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:50,153
I guess you dated everyone
you wanted already.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,465
I went to America when I was young
and came back during high school.

14
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,766
Do you know why?

15
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:00,636
The girls wouldn't leave me alone.

16
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:04,332
I thought I'd end up
dead in Hyde Park with...

17
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,443
...all those jealous
girls that desired me.

18
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:07,945
-Oh, really?
-You have no idea.

19
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:09,846
You had a wild and crazy life.

20
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,346
No. I was fatally charming.

21
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:17,141
-Mr. An.
-Will you keep calling me that?

22
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,141
-Then what should I call you?
-Now that you've mentioned it...

23
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:22,649
I think we should decide
how to address each other.

24
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:26,657
Why should we do that?
Are we dating or something?

25
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:30,672
What? We've done everything
a couple would do.

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,363
-What?
-Except only a few things!

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,372
What is this if we aren't dating?

28
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:41,266
You have a different
view of relationships.

29
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,073
-You're quite liberal.
-What are you talking about?

30
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:46,066
-What?
-What?

31
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,871
You're making me look very weird.

32
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:52,591
I didn't. Can I have some?

33
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,875
-No! Eat yours!
-It's good.

34
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,072
It'll taste different, then.

35
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,654
"Dobong Walnuts"

36
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:16,221
They caught the criminal,
but I'm still worried.

37
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:17,935
Call and ask where Bongsoon is.

38
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:21,541
I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about the neighbors.

39
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:23,041
How can you not be worried?

40
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,216
She's my princess and I would
never give her up for anything.

41
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,608
Is this all the money...

42
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,005
"Hormones in the Room"

43
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,511
Why are you reading garbage like this?

44
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:42,981
It's an intellectual book
about the solitude of modern men.

45
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:45,886
The book knows exactly how I feel.

46
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:49,743
You'd never understand. Never!

47
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,553
What?

48
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:55,338
I should just... Hey! Come here!

49
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,358
Are you okay?

50
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,457
-What happened?
-Did you catch him?

51
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,568
Where is he? Where?

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,967
-Where is he?
-Did we lose him?

53
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:16,861
Darn.

54
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,256
It was scary, right?

55
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,764
No.

56
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm fine.

57
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,408
I don't think he'll show up today.

58
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:38,114
We'll protect you.
You're safe, so don't worry.

59
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:40,202
I'll take you home.

60
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:44,120
-Detective, I'm taking her home.
-Okay.

61
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:45,715
Let's go.

62
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,611
What happened? I thought we got him.

63
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,273
Hearing the siren from the
patrol in this neighborhood...

64
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,479
...means something bad happened.

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,780
Bongsoon.

66
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,876
You may be very strong and special

67
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,479
,but to me, you're just a
woman I want to protect.

68
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,493
Protecting is my expertise.

69
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:35,089
-You should go home.
-No!

70
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,083
Don't ask me to leave.
Do you have plans after I leave?

71
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,698
No, I don't! Go.

72
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,412
-I'm going inside.
-I want to see you go inside.

73
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,404
Or I'll be worried.

74
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,610
Bye.

75
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:57,816
Bye.

76
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,333
Go now.

77
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:37,293
How did this scum do this? He set us up!

78
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,802
I think he's playing with us.

79
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,993
Darn.

80
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:44,700
Darn, I don't believe this!

81
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,087
I don't believe this!

82
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:54,474
Gukdoo, Jo Heeji was
your girlfriend, right?

83
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,217
Yes.

84
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,539
So, this scum went after
your girlfriend to...

85
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,047
Wait a second. Intentionally?

86
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,843
Hold on, so he did a
background check on her,

87
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,930
and went to Hannam-dong?

88
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,837
What kind of scumbag is he?

89
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,950
That son of a gun has got some guts.

90
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,929
We must do something, sir.

91
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:20,937
Wait. Let me think.

92
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:26,434
The special unit has a warrant
issued for that suspect, right?

93
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,933
-Yes.
-Darn!

94
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,127
What are you doing?
Brown Bear, come with me!

95
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,387
Hey Knockboy,
you and Magnifying Glass check the...

96
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,280
-Was it Mangwon-dong?
-Banghak-dong.

97
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,975
We got a report of a lady
missing in Banghak-dong.

98
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,086
-Review that today.
-Okay.

99
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,476
Loose, you review...

100
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:50,794
...all other attempted cases and
send summonses to all witnesses.

101
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,084
And Gukdoo.

102
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,592
You need to calm down.

103
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:57,791
Let's go.

104
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,523
The victim of Banghak-dong
weighs over 80 kg.

105
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,628
She doesn't fit the profile.

106
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,236
We have to investigate anyway.
Let's go to the scene.

107
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:29,931
But don't you feel like
that Kim Janghyeon...

108
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,526
Shut up!

109
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,518
...is listening to everything we say?

110
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:37,254
How did he know we would
be guarding Jo Heeji?

111
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,047
Yeah. Gosh.

112
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:46,166
Sir, it seems like he
knows our every movement.

113
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:50,136
Something's definitely not right.

114
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,007
He's not here yet.

115
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,603
Now here's a problem.

116
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:07,315
That employee.
How are the two connected?

117
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:12,200
Do you think he has nothing to do...

118
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,097
...with this case?

119
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,823
According to my analog intuition,

120
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,323
he knows everything.

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,404
Did we ask headquarters to
track the location of his phone?

122
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,312
Yes, let me check.

123
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,485
-Darn.
-What?

124
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:33,897
He might be using a cloned phone.

125
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,302
The phone registered under
his name is inactive.

126
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,168
-That son of a gun.
-We can't locate him.

127
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,092
Where is he?

128
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:25,143
Do Bongsoon!

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,788
You thought your friend saved you?

130
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,274
Shut up!

131
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,405
I didn't untie your hands,
so you could do that.

132
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,625
Beg. Use your hands to beg!

133
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,864
Beg! More earnestly!

134
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,819
Kyungshim, what are you doing?
When are you coming back?

135
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,740
I need to tell you something.

136
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:45,008
Actually, Mr. An said that he likes me.

137
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:56,373
Really? I'm so happy for you.

138
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:06,070
I always envied your strength.

139
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:07,565
What?

140
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,344
What do you mean you envied me?

141
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,439
Did you forget how shocked I was,

142
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:14,629
when I knocked out that
guy in high school?

143
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:18,815
Right, I remember. You were so worried.

144
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,728
I was always afraid of hurting people.

145
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:27,519
Though I thought of hurting
someone without a reason,

146
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,471
so I would lose my strength.

147
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,840
Hurt someone without a reason
and you'll lose your strength?

148
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:53,049
Hurt someone without a reason
and you'll lose your strength?

149
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,995
Kyungshim

150
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,016
What are you doing?

151
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:21,721
Hey!

152
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,705
What are you doing?

153
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:31,965
Think. Why did he come here
to testify as a witness?

154
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,964
To tap us?

155
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:36,610
Or...

156
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,875
...a hidden camera?

157
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,969
What?

158
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:45,572
-Darn!
-If...

159
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,668
...we were him,

160
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,487
where would we install it?

161
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:56,074
Which spot would give
him the whole view...

162
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,814
Now you found it? You idiots.

163
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,740
-What's that?
-What the heck?

164
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,634
Sir.

165
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:34,194
Your mother's hospital bills
will be due soon. Here.

166
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:37,081
Don't feed them tomorrow.

167
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,597
They're getting uglier,
since they're not working out.

168
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:43,380
The new one needs to
starve for a whole week.

169
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,285
She's too fat.

170
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,473
Also,

171
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,371
the police found out I'm the one.

172
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:57,323
The game starts now.

173
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:30,874
Bongsoon.

174
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:45,372
Kyungshim, are you sleeping?

175
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:54,926
What are you doing?

176
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:58,929
I was going to go to sleep.

177
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,326
Okay, then do that,
and don't go wandering about.

178
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:03,921
I won't.

179
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,347
Good night, Bongbong.

180
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,823
Good night, Minmin.

181
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,632
Do I send him a heart? No.

182
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,817
Good night, Minmin.

183
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,572
She called me Minmin.

184
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,977
Is she human?

185
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,687
She's killing me with her cute face.

186
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,179
Good-night, Minmin.

187
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,475
Minhyuk, go to sleep.

188
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:10,388
Go to sleep and see her in your dreams.

189
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:13,646
Goodnight, Minmin.

190
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,758
Gosh, what do I do?

191
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,790
One more time.

192
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,187
Goodnight, Minmin.

193
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,049
Bongsoon, use your strength.

194
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,453
-Use your strength!
-Help me.

195
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:42,257
-Bongsoon!
-My strength is gone!

196
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:45,339
-Bongsoon!
-My strength is gone...

197
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,444
Bongsoon!

198
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,947
Is this Bongssuni?

199
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,459
Yes, she's just like you.

200
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,250
-How?
-Do you like it?

201
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,750
Yours looked like Super
Mario without a mustache.

202
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,996
Short and wearing overalls.

203
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,198
They weren't overalls. It was a jumpsuit.

204
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,406
Well, that won't work.

205
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:21,009
It makes her look like an
airhead in the country.

206
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,811
It doesn't!
She's supposed to be fresh and cute.

207
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,700
-It's not fresh at all!
-Calm down.

208
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,708
You don't like it?
Then go ahead with the airhead.

209
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,510
Well, I didn't say that I don't like it.

210
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:35,009
That's not what I meant.
Though her eyes are too big.

211
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,207
Your eyes are big.
Bigger and prettier than these.

212
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:43,117
You see, I'm good at
everything but drawing.

213
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,694
You're good at it.
She looks very much like me.

214
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:49,058
-But how?
-Really?

215
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,963
Mr. Kong, send this to the graphics team.

216
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:52,772
But Sir...

217
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:57,470
But I think her legs
are a little too long.

218
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,859
-Her legs?
-A little too long.

219
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,090
A little?

220
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:04,273
Yeah, that's the concept,
so we should shorten them.

221
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:06,678
-Okay.
-I'll be in the library.

222
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,376
You get the files ready. Let's do this!

223
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,857
-Let's do this.
-Get things ready.

224
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes, Sir.

225
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,960
Sorry about the legs.

226
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,969
What is wrong with him?

227
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:45,417
The high schoolers came to
the hospital to see you.

228
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,422
They want revenge.

229
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,462
We gave them your number.

230
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,549
We had no choice.
They caused too much trouble.

231
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,565
-I can't be bothered.
-Where are you?

232
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,842
-Hello?
-Hey!

233
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,834
You're the boss, right?

234
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,540
-Who are you?
-That's none of your concern.

235
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,441
-I need to see you.
-Tell me who you are first!

236
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:28,238
You messed with our sister!

237
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:31,143
That matter has already been settled.

238
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,286
It doesn't concern you.

239
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,381
-I'm hanging up.
-Let's fight!

240
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:41,286
-How old are you?
-How old are you?

241
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,162
-Let's fight!
-Boy, hang up.

242
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,968
I'm not in the mood for this.

243
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:49,468
Hang up! Hang up, and I'll call you again.

244
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,453
-Very well.
-Don't hang up now. Hey!

245
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:04,659
-Hell...
-You son of Pigsy!

246
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,866
You hung up on me?

247
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:10,459
Let's fight!
Did you get cold feet? Answer!

248
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,674
-Hey! Hey!
-What's that?

249
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:13,752
You got cold feet.

250
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:19,165
He got cold feet.
Who's that wearing a white robe?

251
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,073
Hey!

252
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,978
Yes, hello?

253
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,984
I'm not buying it.
You buy it if it's so good.

254
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,294
Baek Tak. Hey, Baek Tak!

255
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,190
He hung up on me again?
I'm wasting money calling.

256
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,588
Sir, stop the bus! I'm getting off!

257
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:45,899
I need to go to the bathroom quickly!

258
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,295
I'm getting off.

259
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,505
I need to go to the restroom.

260
00:21:58,865 --> 00:21:59,673
Wait.

261
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,276
-Thank you!
-Wait.

262
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,681
-Thank you.
-Wait, you're...

263
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:28,496
Oh, my! Mr. Oh!

264
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,383
Hello, Mr. Oh. Come out of there.

265
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:34,200
You scared me.

266
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,003
So,

267
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:41,020
you're giving a presentation
for this lousy game tomorrow.

268
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:43,720
Yes, I need your help.

269
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:49,676
I think right now I need your
cooperation more than ever.

270
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,875
You're not fooling me.

271
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,774
I'm telling you.

272
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,081
We'll never develop this game.

273
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,190
Who on earth would play
such an old-fashioned game?

274
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:02,991
You're so dumb.

275
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:07,761
Oh, come on. Don't say that.
Trends come and go.

276
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:14,959
I am much prettier and taller.
I don't lack anything.

277
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,631
Tell me. How many
account books do you have?

278
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,623
One. An overdraft.

279
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:23,512
What did he see in you?

280
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:26,234
But why are you here?

281
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,227
You came to see me?

282
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,631
Are you crazy?

283
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,224
I came to get Mr. An's approval.

284
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,224
Where's my coffee?

285
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:37,407
Oh, come on.
You can get your own coffee.

286
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,428
It doesn't look good that
you order around your staff.

287
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:45,436
But if you really want
me to get it for you,

288
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:49,940
we can talk about it
again in the meeting room.

289
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,128
I feel like I'm suffocating!

290
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,717
How dare you.

291
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:01,017
-Hello.
-Hi.

292
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:06,644
Why do men go crazy for younger women?

293
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,800
Bye, Mr. Oh.

294
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:11,288
Get out of my way!

295
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:18,371
I got worried that he might hit you,

296
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,149
and you'd end up beating him
up, so I came in.

297
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:25,659
They're so identical.

298
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:27,467
He looks just like him.

299
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,760
Does he really not have a twin
he lost contact with long ago?

300
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,570
I don't think so.

301
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:37,677
His parents are teachers.

302
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,776
He had a sheltered life.
He hasn't seen much of life.

303
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:44,578
-How old is he?
-He was born in 1980.

304
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,085
-In 1980?
-Yes.

305
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:49,791
-1980?
-On Valentine's Day, February 14.

306
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,386
He hates his birthday.

307
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,299
He gets lonely very easily.

308
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:58,440
This is humiliating!

309
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:00,424
-Sorry, sir.
-So...

310
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,624
Can you prove he installed the camera?

311
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,624
Sir, please.

312
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:08,628
It's not about closing the case.

313
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,522
We must find the true criminal.

314
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,721
Do you know how peaceful it got
for the residents of Dobong-dong?

315
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:17,114
-We caught the criminal.
-He's not the one.

316
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,811
His height matches the doctor's
and the footprint matches, too.

317
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:24,407
-How is that solid evidence?
-What is it if it's not?

318
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:30,377
Got it. If that's what you think,
I'll do what I have to do.

319
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,046
-We'll wrap this up.
-Listen to me.

320
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,832
You need the promotion.

321
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,736
Let's not create more problems, okay?

322
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,559
Namaste.

323
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,467
Namaste.

324
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:09,880
Who's that wearing that white...
It's the boss.

325
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:24,288
Boss!

326
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,161
Here!

327
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,072
-He went in here.
-Let's go!

328
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,764
You can't just go in.

329
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,165
Public buildings and temples
are open to everyone.

330
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,665
What are you talking about?
Is a monk a public servant, then?

331
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:42,670
Shut up! Follow me!

332
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,872
We can't just let them go.

333
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:47,380
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

334
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:57,307
Were you discharged looking like that?

335
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,914
We just left the hospital.
We never cared about procedures.

336
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,721
Start caring from now on.

337
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:07,373
We should lead a good life.

338
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,778
We can't do that.

339
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,262
It'd be easier for a dog to
stop eating its own poop.

340
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,758
You fool, don't...

341
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,964
Don't mention poop.

342
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,328
But where the heck are we?

343
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:25,621
It's a temple.

344
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:30,115
-I know, but what kind of temple?
-Shush.

345
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:32,726
Keep your voice down.

346
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:37,027
Nobody knows about this place.

347
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,518
That monk fled from the
Indian government...

348
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:44,557
...and religious oppression,
and stays here as an illegal alien...

349
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:47,652
...to discipline himself.

350
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,072
Then that priest...

351
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:04,801
-I mean, is that monk Indian?
-Yes.

352
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,190
He doesn't look Indian at all.

353
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,024
Maybe Korean-Indian?

354
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,293
Enough!

355
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:12,444
That's blasphemy.

356
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:14,727
His name is...

357
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,045
...Nizamuddin.

358
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:21,958
You must learn that
appearances are deceptive.

359
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,537
Namaste.

360
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:25,252
Namaste...

361
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:29,992
Hey!

362
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:35,881
I got you!

363
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:40,555
Yay, I finished it!

364
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:50,261
He's not back from the library?

365
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,634
-Mr. Kong.
-Hey, Bongsoon.

366
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:59,541
Do you want to see the draft
of your character they created?

367
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,832
-No, I'll look at it with Mr. An.
-Sure.

368
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,936
But did he leave? Is he still at work?

369
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:08,731
Oh, he wanders around
the building sometimes.

370
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,643
So the employees are always alert.

371
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:15,238
Though it's not what he planned.

372
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:19,933
Oh, I see. Thanks. Go back to work.

373
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,768
That's something precious.

374
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,079
What is it that you want?

375
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,196
Why did you try to hurt our Sis?

376
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,410
No, they're still growing.

377
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:45,931
I'll answer to that later.
I can see you're high schoolers.

378
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:48,035
-Don't talk down to me.
-I repeated a grade six times.

379
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,146
You little brat!

380
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:53,581
-How dare you talk like that?
-Stop!

381
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,480
Let me handle this.

382
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:58,773
Those are...

383
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,464
-...dangerous skills.
-What skills?

384
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,749
-What?
-What is it?

385
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:05,464
What's that?

386
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,706
No!

387
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:19,206
Fighting is bad!

388
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:20,817
No fighting!

389
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,706
Fools.

390
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:41,560
He's not here.

391
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,364
Where is he?

392
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,592
-Bongsoon.
-Oh, my goodness.

393
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,476
What are you doing there?

394
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:00,073
Did you finish?

395
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,675
Yes, I'm done.
You should take a look at it.

396
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,864
Come here for a moment.

397
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,257
-What?
-Come here.

398
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,459
What is this place?

399
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,594
It's the seminar room.
Nice, right?

400
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,802
Oh, it's nice.

401
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,295
Nobody's...

402
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:20,601
...using it today.

403
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:24,821
So what? What do you want to do?

404
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,932
I see you're expecting something.

405
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,838
No, I'm not.

406
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,819
My goodness.

407
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,333
-See?
-What?

408
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:37,033
-See? What is this?
-What?

409
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:40,017
-I've seen this before.
-What...

410
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:49,226
I'm at a loss for words.

411
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,615
I'll protect you like this.

412
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,419
So nothing can hurt you.

413
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,709
I'll protect you.

414
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:10,298
You said you need time
to look into your heart.

415
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,103
Can you tell me now?

416
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:23,404
Well...

417
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,305
No.

418
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:32,221
Don't tell me.

419
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:35,515
I can...

420
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:37,721
...tell already.

421
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,124
Gosh, I'm going crazy!

422
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,002
Let's get back to work.

423
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:00,304
Hey, don't!

424
00:33:00,423 --> 00:33:04,419
Don't smile like that!
You make my heart flutter.

425
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,921
What am I supposed to do
if you smile at me like that?

426
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:10,531
I'll have a heart attack.

427
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,970
Let's go back now.

428
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:15,160
Hey!

429
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,160
What?

430
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,214
But...

431
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:14,190
Let's go.

432
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:20,563
Bhante, please forgive us.

433
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:24,563
Boss!

434
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:29,552
Baek Sutak, you know what place this is.

435
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,362
But you fought. I'm disappointed.

436
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,354
-You will now be born again.
-Born again.

437
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,542
The trash in your heart will go down.

438
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:47,928
Your wrongdoings of the past,
your criminal records

439
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:52,413
your arrogance are all going down.

440
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:55,627
This water will cleanse everything.

441
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:58,540
-Don't avoid it.
-Bhante.

442
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,230
Three, two, one. It's gone.

443
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,453
Get on your knees.

444
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:10,366
Join me.

445
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:20,481
You have more criminal records.
I can tell right away.

446
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:22,679
It's all written on your face.
I'm cleansing everything.

447
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:25,992
Your wrongdoings and
your criminal records.

448
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:28,075
They're all washed away.

449
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,472
This water is cleansing it.

450
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,067
Slap of water, punk. Slap!

451
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:35,768
It's all going down.

452
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,054
-You, too.
-I got splashed already.

453
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,064
I heard you repeated six times.

454
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:43,517
Because you played hooky.
You always play hooky.

455
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,506
I know it all, you fool.

456
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,610
It's all gone now.
Don't try to avoid it.

457
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,403
You'll get splashed more.

458
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:53,893
It's going down for you, too.

459
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:57,784
This water washes everything away.
You repeated three times, too.

460
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:00,984
Think about your parents.
All your wrongdoings.

461
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:05,380
You're also cleansed.
You are bad. Very bad.

462
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:09,142
It's all washed away.
You'll need all this water.

463
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,642
Thank you!

464
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:14,142
-You're cleansed now.
-I'm cleansed!

465
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:19,627
What? Wait. My leg hurts.

466
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,823
I can't sit down. Hold on.

467
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,423
Done.

468
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,629
-Sprinkle.
-I have no water for you.

469
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,827
You'll be born again next time.

470
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,319
What? I want water, too!

471
00:36:32,438 --> 00:36:36,017
Get some water from over
there and sprinkle it on me!

472
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:39,500
-You don't talk back like that!
-I'm not talking back!

473
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:42,903
You talked back. That's a disease!

474
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:44,506
I don't have water!

475
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,007
Hey, Bhante.

476
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:53,034
Good. Now let's all go back.

477
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:55,630
What's the use of getting revenge?

478
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:58,828
We should all be one!

479
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,045
Shut up and come to eat.

480
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:03,536
Free of charge.

481
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:11,746
-We're having a workshop?
-Yes.

482
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,254
-Right, it's your first time.
-Yes.

483
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:19,650
We have workshops,
whenever we start a new project.

484
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:22,547
You don't get new ideas
inside your office.

485
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,943
You need to get some air
to get new inspiration.

486
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,657
-But just the two of us?
-Of course.

487
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,639
Everyone on the Pre-development team.

488
00:37:29,724 --> 00:37:31,536
-Anything wrong with that?
-Gosh.

489
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,025
It's just the two of us.

490
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,095
Workshop.

491
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,094
Eat.

492
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:02,847
Let's eat.

493
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:07,468
Why is Monk Nimuttinza not eating?

494
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:10,753
He doesn't share the table with us.

495
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,854
And it's Nizamuddin.

496
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:18,445
It is very rude to say
his name incorrectly.

497
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,945
Let's eat.

498
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:23,228
I always liked temple food.

499
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:28,847
Mr. Nizaddinza, what's this?

500
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,042
Do you know naan?

501
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:36,431
-I don't.
-We eat naan in India.

502
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:38,931
Eat your naan.

503
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,926
Okay.

504
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:49,489
Wow, it's the beach!

505
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,472
Now let's start working
looking at this beautiful beach.

506
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,480
I'm so excited!

507
00:38:59,047 --> 00:38:59,670
What?

508
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:01,765
Come here.

509
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,456
Okay, let's do that.

510
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:06,964
Come here quickly.

511
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:08,974
She's so pretty.

512
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,268
You know, I think her
nut-cracking hammer is too big.

513
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,069
Then there'll be no room
for growth for the item.

514
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:27,690
Right?

515
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:31,293
-What?
-I think it's too big.

516
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:34,784
Right, right. Let's do that.

517
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:37,782
-What else?
-What size do we make it?

518
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:46,138
It could be a wooden hammer
from the very beginning,

519
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:49,169
but if you upgrade it as time goes by,

520
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:52,979
it could get shiny with precious stones.

521
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:01,419
Gosh.

522
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:07,139
It's hot in here. Don't you feel hot?

523
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,199
Gosh.

524
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:13,021
I can't stay here.

525
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,532
Let's go out. This is torture.

526
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,625
Where are you going? We haven't finished.

527
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:23,180
-How can you work?
-We came to work.

528
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:26,283
You said you get new ideas,
when you get fresh air.

529
00:40:31,154 --> 00:40:32,555
Ideas?

530
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,235
Let's get out, okay?

531
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:44,429
Ideas? Yeah, right.

532
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,127
Ideas...

533
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,933
Geez.

534
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,475
What the heck!

535
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:11,147
-Look at that! There!
-Hey! Hey!

536
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:15,449
Hey!

537
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:18,746
Come here.

538
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:24,025
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

539
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:45,833
Wait there.

540
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:12,881
Bongsoon!

541
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:17,859
I'm going to stand here.

542
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:22,879
Would you come to me?

543
00:45:31,683 --> 00:45:32,596
Really?

544
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,397
Bongsoon is dating that handsome man?

545
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:37,897
I think she is.

546
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:41,896
I'm going to go to the temple
and pray for a hundred days.

547
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,198
I'm so glad for you, Jinyi!

548
00:45:44,585 --> 00:45:47,714
Is that why you're treating
us to these black noodles?

549
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:51,199
I'll treat you to more expensive
dishes, if they sleep together.

550
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:52,688
Oh, yeah!

551
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:55,497
Did you make dinner for your husband?

552
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,592
I don't have to do that!

553
00:45:57,677 --> 00:46:00,084
He's strong. He can cook for himself.

554
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:03,787
-Then who makes money?
-He's strong, so he can.

555
00:46:03,872 --> 00:46:05,176
Isn't that too unfair?

556
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:08,760
He should have expected it,
when he married a beauty like me.

557
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,267
He promised when we got married.

558
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:12,855
-Jinyi.
-What?

559
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:15,968
Don't be so harsh on him.
He'll grow apart from you.

560
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:19,365
What if he has an affair?

561
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,071
I'm going to crush all
his bones if he does.

562
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:33,405
Hold on. Wait.

563
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,451
Thank you.

564
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:53,363
Are we done with the workshop?

565
00:46:54,866 --> 00:46:57,257
-What?
-We didn't do any work.

566
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,376
The presentation is tomorrow.

567
00:46:59,472 --> 00:47:04,070
I'll prepare it tonight,
so don't worry about it.

568
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:05,467
Sorry, I...

569
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:09,237
I didn't mean to disturb.

570
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,134
-Go.
-You go first.

571
00:47:14,237 --> 00:47:15,930
-Come on. Go.
-Go inside.

572
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,946
Oh, come on.

573
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,940
I'll go after, I see you get in your car.

574
00:47:22,025 --> 00:47:24,231
I'll get in the car after,
I see you go inside.

575
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,142
Okay.

576
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,952
Bye.

577
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,555
Bongsoon.

578
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,281
I miss you so much...

579
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:55,905
But sometimes, I can't remember
you, when I close my eyes.

580
00:47:58,114 --> 00:47:59,802
And that makes me so sad.

581
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:07,640
So let me see you now.

582
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:15,665
Thanks...

583
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,946
...for coming into my life.

584
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:33,010
Now go.

585
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,905
-Okay.
-Go.

586
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:41,724
Go.

587
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,888
I already miss her.

588
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,291
I have to create the presentation.

589
00:49:17,573 --> 00:49:19,589
No, get a hold of yourself.

590
00:49:20,484 --> 00:49:22,592
-Come in!
-Bongsoon.

591
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:24,375
Hello, my Bonggi.

592
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:27,063
My Bonggi?

593
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:30,372
Did you have a good day?
You look so happy.

594
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:34,366
-Can you tell?
-It's too obvious.

595
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,072
Really?

596
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,760
What's up? What do you need?
How can I help you?

597
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:45,125
-Do we have some rice left?
-There's no rice?

598
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:49,410
You haven't eaten yet?
Should I cook for you?

599
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:53,720
No, go back to what you were doing.

600
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:56,522
I'll make noodles. I can cook that.

601
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:58,022
Okay, do that, then.

602
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,893
Though I suddenly miss
Kyungshim's fishcake stew.

603
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:06,195
-When is she coming back?
-I'm not sure. I'll ask her.

604
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:08,824
-Tell her to bring some fishcakes.
-Okay, I will.

605
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,816
Bye, Bonggi.

606
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,372
Right, she hasn't been calling.

607
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,166
What's up, Kyungshim?

608
00:50:34,245 --> 00:50:35,646
Hello, Bongsoon.

609
00:50:37,957 --> 00:50:39,458
"Hello, Bongsoon"?

610
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:45,412
"Kyungshim"

611
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:07,759
"Do Bongsoon"

612
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:11,444
-Hi, Bongsoon.
-Gukdoo, it's me.

613
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:14,650
The alert device you gave to Kyungshim.

614
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:16,349
Can you locate her with it?

615
00:51:16,738 --> 00:51:18,549
Yes, but what's going on?

616
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:20,067
Can you check that?

617
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:22,644
Something's not right with Kyungshim.

618
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,554
But she's in Busan.

619
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:28,245
Yes, she said she would go, but...

620
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,557
...I'm afraid she didn't.
Can you check that?

621
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:33,352
Okay, I'll check it now.

622
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:40,346
Hello, I'm Lieutenant In
Gukdoo from Crime Squad.

623
00:51:40,446 --> 00:51:42,354
Can you track the location
of the wearable alert device...

624
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:44,449
...we gave to Na Kyungshim? Quickly.

625
00:52:00,101 --> 00:52:02,919
"Hey yo, Bongbong."

626
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:07,772
"Hey yo, Bongbong."

627
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:18,054
Hey yo, Bongbong.

628
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:25,450
Hey yo, Bongbong!

629
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,136
No.

630
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:35,667
Hey yo, Bongbong!

631
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,659
Strange.

632
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:40,365
That's weird.

633
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:46,906
Call me.

634
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:49,897
Call me, please.

635
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:54,865
Call me, call me.

636
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,253
I'm busy now. I'll call you later.

637
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,029
What is this?

638
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:10,027
Dolkong.

639
00:53:10,614 --> 00:53:13,226
How is Dolkong doing?

640
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:15,420
Dolkong...

641
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:27,009
He's fine.

642
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:39,545
Hey, wait! Over here.

643
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,345
What's this?

644
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:44,838
What's this?

645
00:53:52,536 --> 00:53:53,865
That son of a gun.

646
00:53:55,637 --> 00:54:01,661
So you found this luggage and
device yesterday around 11:00 pm?

647
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:04,464
-Yes, I told you.
-Why didn't you report it?

648
00:54:04,558 --> 00:54:06,860
-I don't own a phone.
-You don't own a...

649
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:08,962
Hey, Gukdoo.

650
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:12,263
Did you call her parents?

651
00:54:13,436 --> 00:54:17,350
-Yes.
-This is unbelievable.

652
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,104
-Let's search that junkyard.
-What?

653
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,604
What?

654
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:26,906
Why? I'll take the blame.

655
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:30,295
We can just go,
and search without a warrant.

656
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:32,303
I'll take the blame for it, so let's go!

657
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:34,933
Let's catch him!

658
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:41,330
I swear I'm going to catch
that scumbag tonight!

659
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:44,818
-That scumbag!
-Hey, you're going where?

660
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,509
-Where?
-Sir, we have to go.

661
00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:52,058
-Let us go.
-Hey, listen.

662
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,772
Don't stain my good name.

663
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,463
If you get out of here,
you're giving up your badges!

664
00:54:58,548 --> 00:55:00,447
If you still want to go, go!

665
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:03,963
Go if you want! You... What?

666
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:06,050
Hey.

667
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:10,490
What are you doing?

668
00:55:11,097 --> 00:55:12,886
-Sorry, sir.
-You...

669
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:16,969
What are you doing?

670
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,511
Gosh, I miss her again.

671
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,114
She'll be tired if she's not sleeping.

672
00:55:56,806 --> 00:55:58,816
Are you asleep already?

673
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:03,725
We can postpone the presentation.

674
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:06,726
Go to bed and sleep tight.

675
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,647
Hey. Hey, Bongsoon! No, no.

676
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:53,340
So it's here? Kim Janghyeon is here?

677
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:57,645
Don't! I told you because you insisted,
but you can't be here.

678
00:56:57,732 --> 00:56:59,549
You can't come here alone.

679
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:01,744
I sent Kyungshim a message.

680
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:05,046
You know her dog Dolkong died last year.

681
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,232
We had a funeral together.

682
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:11,941
I asked her how Dolkong is doing, and...

683
00:57:12,526 --> 00:57:16,125
...she said he's fine!

684
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:21,930
If he touches even one strand of hair,
he'll see what I can do!

685
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,422
-Go home and I'll...
-No!

686
00:57:24,722 --> 00:57:26,706
-Kyungshim!
-Hey, Bongsoon!

687
00:57:30,508 --> 00:57:31,405
Sir.

688
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:33,698
Have you ever seen this woman?

689
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,706
You've never seen her?

690
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:52,312
-It's this smell.
-Darn it!

691
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:55,820
Where did he hide them?

692
00:57:56,716 --> 00:58:00,324
They're not here.
There's no space for them.

693
00:58:00,422 --> 00:58:04,013
He wouldn't hide them in the open.

694
00:58:23,617 --> 00:58:24,438
Bongsoon!

695
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:26,985
Let's go.

696
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,787
It's dangerous here. Come with me.

697
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:40,915
Let's go.

698
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:46,384
Kim Janghyeon didn't come here today.

699
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:50,082
That son of a gun.

700
00:58:55,756 --> 00:59:01,155
What does he want by kidnapping
Kyungshim and those women?

701
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,067
He started a game,
he wants to play with us.

702
00:59:05,353 --> 00:59:08,575
He even installed hidden
cameras at the station.

703
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,359
What?

704
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:14,820
We have to find Kyungshim quickly.

705
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:38,725
Bongsoon, are you asleep?

706
00:59:48,295 --> 00:59:51,288
Did she really go to
bed after I told her to?

707
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:55,898
Don't tell me she went out again.

708
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,192
Gosh, I'm so worried.

709
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:41,760
Done.

710
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:55,192
Kyungshim, where are you?

711
01:01:02,228 --> 01:01:03,645
Hey yo, Bongbong.

712
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,223
Bongsoon, I'm fine.

713
01:01:24,324 --> 01:01:26,818
-Kyungshim!
-Don't come!

714
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,645
Do you want to rescue your friend?

715
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,137
Then don't call the police.

716
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,722
If you do, she dies here.

717
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,341
Don't come!

718
01:01:51,738 --> 01:01:53,022
Shut up!

719
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:57,221
Find her on your own,

720
01:01:57,733 --> 01:02:00,229
or she dies here.

721
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,633
Do you see?

722
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:13,319
I demand an apology.

723
01:03:08,406 --> 01:03:10,397
Please help me.

724
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,621
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

725
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:57,422
Please, don't try to do anything alone.

726
01:03:57,535 --> 01:04:00,226
-Bongsoon hasn't come yet.
-Where's Kim Janghyeon?

727
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:03,440
-You came for your friend?
-Is his employee an accomplice?

728
01:04:03,525 --> 01:04:05,533
Kyungshim!

729
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:08,920
I can't stop you from going
there alone and risking yourself.

730
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:10,221
It's driving me nuts!

731
01:04:10,332 --> 01:04:13,167
I'll live as a monster.
You live your peaceful life.

732
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:14,862
You find me that easy?

733
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:16,745
I want to be like everyone else.

734
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:18,847
But I can't.

735
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:21,967
Stop hurting others like a coward.
Fight me.

736
01:04:22,052 --> 01:04:23,757
Blow up the whole place!

737
01:04:25,249 --> 01:04:28,258
Don't worry. I'll save you.
