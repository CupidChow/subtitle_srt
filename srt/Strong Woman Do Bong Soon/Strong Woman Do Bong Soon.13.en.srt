1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,427
I need your help.

2
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:09,724
Kyungshim got kidnapped.

3
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,929
Please help me find her.

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:16,214
-You can find anyone you want.
-That scum kidnapped Kyungshim?

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,604
He said he'll kill her,
if I call the police.

6
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:22,200
Don't ask anything.

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:26,124
Just help me find him and Kyungshim.

8
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,106
What if we found them?

9
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,199
You can't go there alone.

10
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:33,190
His name is Kim Janghyeon.
He owns a junkyard.

11
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:36,898
I've been there already, but he's gone.

12
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,802
And there were no traces of Kyungshim.

13
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,798
Okay, I'll try to find
her, but we'll go together.

14
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,918
-Don't go there alone.
-If anything happens to her...

15
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,908
-Bongsoon, look at me.
-Kyungshim...

16
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:51,711
-Look at me.
-Kyungshim...

17
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:52,804
Bongsoon!

18
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:55,511
She'll be fine.

19
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:56,822
Don't worry.

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,623
That scum is a collector.
He won't kill her.

21
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:01,312
Okay?

22
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,610
-Don't cry.
-Yes.

23
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:08,112
Everything will be fine.

24
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,530
Initially, he went after
skinny, petite girls.

25
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,445
But things changed for him.

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,631
He caught on to our investigation
as it has always been reported.

27
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:29,536
Since he knows that our suspect
is only after thin women,

28
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,228
he chose that opportunity to
choose his victims randomly.

29
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:36,014
-And that started with Kyungshim.
-Right.

30
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,110
But,

31
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,219
when Bongsoon...

32
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,210
What?

33
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,210
Something...

34
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:43,404
...unexpected happened,
and he got in trouble.

35
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:44,102
Something unexpected?

36
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,093
His pattern changed and now,
all he wants is revenge...

37
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,994
...out of spite and obsession.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,685
I failed to see that.

39
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:56,199
We don't know what other
horrible things he'll do now.

40
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:58,087
Jo Heeji was just a trap.

41
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:02,380
It was a trap for the police.

42
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,699
His real target was Kyungshim.

43
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,401
Kyungshim...

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,290
The problem is...

45
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:13,900
He knows you're friends
and he won't go lightly.

46
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:16,184
That's what worries me the most.

47
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,374
Bongsoon.

48
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,175
Please, don't try to do anything alone.

49
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,558
Okay?

50
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,638
I hope you know,

51
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,933
how much I want to protect you.

52
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,338
This will protect you.

53
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,546
I beg you. Please wear
this all the time. Please.

54
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,033
I'll take you home.

55
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,821
Go home and try to sleep.

56
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,319
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

57
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,523
I'll try finding her in the meantime.

58
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,473
Kim Janghyeon.

59
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:43,964
The junkyard.

60
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,279
The junkyard...

61
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,970
The employee in that junkyard.

62
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,970
His name is Jang Kwangseok,
and he was born in 1976.

63
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,176
He lives with his old mom.
No criminal records.

64
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,380
Kim Janghyeon has a
history of mental illness,

65
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,174
and was exempted from military service.

66
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,777
He started a fire when he was 15,
and caused a man to die,

67
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,867
so he's been in a juvenile
correctional institute.

68
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:25,951
It's not a surprise.

69
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:29,873
I knew he'd have some history.

70
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,873
I checked with the immigration office.

71
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:35,370
Kim Janghyeon never went to Sudan.
His employee lied.

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,672
-He never left the country.
-Then what?

73
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:42,057
Did he lie to his employee
or is his employee an accomplice?

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,899
They're in this together.

75
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,090
How do you know?

76
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,098
It's my instinct.

77
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,394
You're taking after me. I like that.

78
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,084
Okay! We still don't
have a search warrant.

79
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,587
Let's start the guerilla
war in his house first.

80
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,068
-Yes, sir!
-I'll go to the junkyard.

81
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,690
You saw there's nothing there.

82
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,670
Something tells me there is.

83
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:06,568
There could be something hidden.

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,884
Okay, then you follow your instincts.

85
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:13,971
Brown Bear and you come with me.
We'll search his house.

86
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,357
-Yes, sir.
-You check his medical records.

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,367
Meet the psychiatrist that treated him.

88
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,357
-Okay.
-And Loose, you...

89
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,849
-Handle the superintendent?
-You're very smart.

90
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,055
And Gukdoo, you go to
Jang Kwangseok and...

91
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,349
Where is he? He left already?

92
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:32,858
He's the fastest cop.
At least in Asia he is.

93
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,323
Bongsoon, I'm fine.

94
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,547
Don't come!

95
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:15,150
Don't come!

96
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,832
Don't come!

97
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,763
The file is ready, sir.

98
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,573
Bongsoon hasn't come yet.

99
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,970
I told her to come directly
to the planning department.

100
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:55,265
Maybe she worked all night
to prepare for the presentation,

101
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,685
and woke up late.

102
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,569
-Let's wait a little more.
-Should I call her?

103
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,109
"Ugly larva."

104
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,109
"Wrinkly larva."

105
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,514
You've gone through so much.

106
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,709
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

107
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:22,812
-You can't leave.
-Is this a prison?

108
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:24,606
I can leave if I want to.

109
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,908
Sir.

110
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,090
Your name is...

111
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,189
"Trap"

112
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,377
-Is your name really Trap?
-Yes.

113
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:41,454
Trap means "The beautiful tree of plum".

114
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:45,232
-Trap.
-Was Trap your real name?

115
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:50,743
Yes, you buttonhole eyes.
Who'd use that as a fake name?

116
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:52,933
Trap...

117
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:55,428
Mr. Trap.

118
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:58,936
If you want to leave,
you must first be discharged.

119
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,736
I'll prescribe you medication.

120
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,022
-Okay.
-"Ugly larva."

121
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,335
What's going on?

122
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:12,236
-My butt is itchy.
-His butt is itchy.

123
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,446
It's too early to remove the dressing.

124
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,139
-What?
-I think there's a bug in my butt.

125
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,033
Say it more slowly.
What did you say?

126
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,337
A bug in the butt.

127
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,742
-I think he wants his butt spread.
-Right?

128
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,168
-Son of a gun.
-Xia Junsu? He's in the army.

129
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:32,736
-Shut up.
-Show up? Shin Se-kyung?

130
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,335
-He meant spread his butt!
-Yes, you are right!

131
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,730
No. Why would he want that?

132
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,539
-Sir!
-Why the heck are you...

133
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:46,745
...reciting that stupid poem?
Do you call that poetry?

134
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,046
The boss said,
I should read it to Kwangbok.

135
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,746
He needs to feel at ease.

136
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,032
Look at him. His body is like old rags.

137
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,540
What comfort would some poetry give him?

138
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,730
-You have nothing in your mind!
-I only did my best.

139
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:03,122
But who's "Duck Lady of Yangjae"?

140
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:06,910
Title,

141
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:10,021
"You Need to Think."

142
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,011
I am...

143
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,312
...Duck Lady...

144
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,821
...of Yangjae.

145
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,820
Don't ask why I'm called Duck Lady.

146
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,805
I can't be Chicken Lady.

147
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:25,503
You need to think.

148
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,499
I was writing a poem.

149
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:34,605
It's...

150
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:38,208
...been three years already,
since I became an anonymous poet.

151
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,925
I even published five books of poetry.

152
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:46,245
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

153
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,634
We don't know where
we come from or where we'll go.

154
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,737
Life is futile and meaningless.

155
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:55,337
I'd like to retire from the world
and spend the rest of my life...

156
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,130
...trying to find enlightenment.

157
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,428
-What do you think?
-I need to go to the world.

158
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:05,325
I need to get groceries.
I need to use your car.

159
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:07,715
Well,

160
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,025
I left my car in the world.
What do you need?

161
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,725
You ate up my curry and got fat.

162
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:19,336
I need some hair elastics.
I can't keep using a chopstick.

163
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:22,532
And I also need hair conditioner
for when I shampoo.

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,011
You could get those things...

165
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:27,313
...at the rest stop convenience store.

166
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,514
I had a fight with the
part-time worker there.

167
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:31,523
Don't tell anyone.

168
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:35,726
He asked for my ID and I don't have one.

169
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,122
-I don't know what to...
-Namaste.

170
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,568
"Mr. Kong"

171
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:54,053
"Presentation at 10. Don't be late."

172
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,127
She isn't picking up her phone.

173
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,619
Sorry, but let's postpone
the presentation.

174
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:44,032
-You came for your friend?
-Where is Kim Janghyeon?

175
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,349
He's not here.

176
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,349
-Not here.
-Then, where is he?

177
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,449
I don't know. He must be with your friend.

178
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,847
Tell me where Kim Janghyeon is!

179
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:56,859
Don't yell at me. I don't know.

180
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,557
Kyungshim!

181
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:04,952
Kyungshim!

182
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,762
Kyungshim!

183
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:19,866
Kyungshim!

184
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:22,461
What?

185
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:26,876
Kyungshim!

186
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,466
What the heck?

187
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,566
Kyungshim!

188
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,549
Kyungshim!

189
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,870
"Mission Complete. 100%"

190
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:29,984
Okay, done.

191
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,263
The number you have
dialed is not available...

192
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,739
Kyungshim.

193
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,028
Kyungshim.

194
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,637
Where are you?

195
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,068
Kyungshim!

196
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:55,966
Kyungshim!

197
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:00,075
Is anybody here?

198
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,600
Help...

199
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,807
Here!

200
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,607
Help!

201
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,210
Are you alright?

202
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:34,699
It's dangerous. Back off for a while.

203
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,405
I'll get you out of there.

204
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,799
Come out.

205
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:53,703
Are you alright? Back off.
I'll get you out.

206
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,694
Back off.

207
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,738
Blow up the whole place!

208
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,929
Your friend dies today.

209
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:14,532
If she dies, you're dead, too!

210
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,141
Excuse me. Are you alright?

211
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,047
Wake up!

212
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,435
Are you okay?

213
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:51,535
Don't worry. I'm here. Please calm down.

214
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,329
Let's get out of here. Wait.

215
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:57,343
Kyungshim! Kyungshim!

216
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:02,042
-He must have taken her outside.
-Kyungshim!

217
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,144
Oh, no!

218
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,070
What's that?

219
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,269
Careful!

220
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:34,362
Be careful. I'll help you.

221
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,570
-Are you okay?
-Please help me.

222
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:40,368
Are you okay? Be careful.

223
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,289
There. Let's go that way.

224
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,986
Wait here. Just one moment.

225
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:54,177
Where is Kim Janghyeon?
Tell me now! Where is he?

226
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:58,254
I can't find my friend! I beg you.
Please, tell me.

227
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,943
-I don't know!
-Hey!

228
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:02,935
-Stop right there!
-I don't know.

229
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,546
Let go!

230
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,856
You have the right to remain silent.

231
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:12,157
Anything you say can be used against you.

232
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,661
You have the right to an attorney.

233
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,375
But it's over for you, jerk!

234
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:39,897
I told you I'd help you.
I said I'd come with you.

235
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:42,204
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:46,506
The women...

237
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:49,814
Did you rescue them?

238
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,421
What about Kyungshim?

239
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:42,327
What's all this?
Everything's a mess here.

240
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,634
-Take the photos quickly.
-Yes, we're taking photos.

241
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,842
What are you doing?
Why is the special unit here?

242
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:51,326
It's our case.
We'll investigate it. Get out!

243
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,427
The commissioner said
we should cooperate.

244
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,721
I didn't hear anything!
You want to take credit?

245
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,920
-Sir, look!
-What?

246
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:00,618
Come quickly!

247
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,610
Did you find something?
There's something there?

248
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:05,618
It's here.

249
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,125
What's all this?

250
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:11,929
Son of a gun. I knew it.

251
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,739
He's not a usual one.

252
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:16,851
How many cameras are there?
He's a complete psycho.

253
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:28,964
We have breaking news.
All three of the missing women...

254
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,449
...have been safely rescued.

255
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,859
-The fact that they have been...
-So scary.

256
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,557
...trapped in a junkyard
basement is shocking the public.

257
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,053
The police arrested an employee
at the crime scene...

258
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,664
...who is under investigation
for being the accomplice.

259
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,665
Kim Janghyeon, the true criminal
and the owner of the junkyard...

260
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:50,363
...disappeared, and the police
are trying to track him down.

261
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:56,250
The police refused to talk about
the conditions of the rescued victims.

262
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,247
According to the neighbors...

263
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:02,249
...a big explosion was heard,
and the junkyard burst into flames...

264
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,143
...right before they were rescued.

265
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:08,347
We believe the police carried
out a special operation.

266
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,244
The victims have been hospitalized,

267
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:13,766
and are being treated.
According to the hospital,

268
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,547
the victims went through
an extremely traumatic situation.

269
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,952
The victims will receive
psychological treatment...

270
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,139
...to regain mental stability.

271
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:25,440
-No interviews! Get out!
-One question...

272
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,225
Sorry, no!

273
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:33,142
No, no. Stay in bed. Stay in bed.

274
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:38,953
I can't imagine how horrible it was.

275
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:41,953
But you've managed well.

276
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,857
Excuse me,

277
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,063
I know it's very difficult,

278
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,752
but how did you come out...

279
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,769
...safely from the explosion?

280
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,382
Kim Janghyeon, the true criminal
of the Cheongwoon Intersection...

281
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,500
...serial missing case...

282
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,081
...created a secret hiding place
in the basement of his junkyard...

283
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:01,370
-Sir...
-...to confine his victims...

284
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,774
...committing unheard
of and grotesque crime.

285
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:07,968
As a fanatic of the play
"Bluebeard and His Seven Brides",

286
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,069
it is believed he used this
play as a motive for his crime.

287
00:26:26,993 --> 00:26:31,386
The criminal escaped
and has been put on the wanted list.

288
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:34,101
-The women are being protected...
-Hey.

289
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,597
Tell Kyungshim to not
come to Seoul for a while.

290
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:39,382
Who knows where that criminal could be.

291
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:44,675
-We must be extra careful.
-We presume the motive of...

292
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,382
Find her on your own.

293
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:51,881
Or...

294
00:26:57,994 --> 00:27:00,796
You should have told me.
Why did you go there alone?

295
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,501
This is between Kim Janghyeon and me.

296
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,891
How is that between you two?

297
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,986
We put him on the wanted list.

298
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,073
-I have to do this alone.
-I'll catch him.

299
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,478
-You stay out of it.
-He sent this video to me.

300
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:13,978
-He wants me.
-Then even more so!

301
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,470
No!

302
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,962
If the police get involved,
Kyungshim will be in more danger.

303
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:20,658
The police are already involved.

304
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:25,637
It doesn't matter.
Don't make it go public. Please.

305
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,241
-Bongsoon.
-He said he'll kill her,

306
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:30,941
if I inform the police.

307
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:59,230
We'll make it a closed investigation.

308
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:00,504
Thanks.

309
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,305
And...

310
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:05,314
...don't tell anyone, I rescued the women.

311
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:06,724
I won't.

312
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,329
Don't worry.

313
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,620
Let's go.

314
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:26,645
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

315
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,448
Let go of my hand!

316
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,273
-What am I to you?
-Mr. An.

317
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:40,470
Yes, I get it.

318
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:42,678
I'm not your priority.

319
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:45,471
And I also know you're special.

320
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:50,775
I know I shouldn't do this.
What else do I know?

321
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:52,068
Yes,

322
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:55,482
that I can't be like any
other man if I'm to love you.

323
00:28:57,782 --> 00:28:59,697
I can't stop you from going
there alone and risking yourself.

324
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,586
You won't listen even
if I tried to stop you.

325
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,489
I think I know quite well, don't I?

326
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,783
What else should I know?

327
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,783
I told you from the beginning,

328
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:12,490
-that I'm not like everyone else.
-I know you're different!

329
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,387
I know that very well.

330
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:20,963
But I'm about to go crazy.

331
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,078
I'm dying out of anxiety.

332
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,872
The fact that you went there
to confront him alone...

333
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,571
...is driving me nuts!

334
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:30,857
Then why did you train me?

335
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,468
-You didn't expect this?
-I didn't!

336
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,769
I didn't expect, I'd love you so much.

337
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,206
We can't be together.

338
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:55,602
What?

339
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:00,099
Loving someone is a luxury to me.

340
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,498
I'll live as a monster.

341
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,300
You live your peaceful
life like before we met.

342
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,692
We were never a good match.

343
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,097
What did you say?

344
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,790
We should just stop here.

345
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:21,788
That's it.

346
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,495
I can't believe you're saying that.

347
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:31,695
You find me that easy
because I'm crazy about you?

348
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:38,496
Hey, Do Bongsoon.

349
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:42,694
Hey!

350
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:54,699
I also...

351
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,203
...want to be like everyone else.

352
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:01,401
But I can't.

353
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,068
I don't want to lose,

354
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,257
the person I love ever again.

355
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,055
If you stay with me,

356
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,460
you'll be in danger.

357
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:30,350
Can't you just stay with me?

358
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:59,870
So the Avengers girl is
actually very strong.

359
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:06,264
And that means she really did
beat up those mobsters by herself.

360
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,957
-Yes.
-My goodness.

361
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:11,453
How is that possible?

362
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,849
That tiny girl...

363
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:18,646
No. The victims testimony
weren't making any sense.

364
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:24,661
It sounded as absurd
as those kids from kindergarten.

365
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:26,044
They said,

366
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:27,941
she took the steel bars off,

367
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,641
and threw them away.

368
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:32,950
Jeez. Can you believe that?

369
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:37,149
Wait. Is it true?

370
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:38,847
They're telling the truth?

371
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:42,347
Sir, please...

372
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,450
...keep it a secret.

373
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,843
I don't need to keep it a secret.

374
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:50,645
Who'd ever believe that?

375
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:53,767
Though it makes no sense,

376
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:58,167
there's nothing bad about
letting others know she's strong.

377
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:59,157
The thing is...

378
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:02,078
...she wants to have a normal life.

379
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,156
And Kim Janghyeon knows,

380
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:07,652
she has this super strength.

381
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:09,549
What?

382
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:12,255
The other time,
when he tried to kidnap Kyungshim,

383
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,749
Bongsoon lied about...

384
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,153
-...him ran away because she screamed.
-Right?

385
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:21,643
I thought that didn't make sense.

386
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,042
He has kidnapped Kyungshim
and sent Bongsoon a video of her.

387
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,341
-What?
-So...

388
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,841
...we can't let this go public.

389
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,944
It has to be a secret investigation.

390
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,341
Only you and I...

391
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,445
...can know this.

392
00:33:46,888 --> 00:33:48,398
I know, right?

393
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,009
No wonder you got fat
after eating all that.

394
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,209
-You really...
-I love that part.

395
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:58,800
When he's in the room
with the cockroach it suddenly...

396
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:14,975
What are you doing with
my husband in broad daylight?

397
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,690
Jinyi, didn't you know
we had a charity bazaar today?

398
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,186
Bazaar...

399
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,797
I've been invited to give out autographs.

400
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:28,976
I also did some volunteering.

401
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:33,394
He also helped the kids bake cookies.

402
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,992
He did a good thing.

403
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:37,697
Yes, honey.
I'll tell you about it at home.

404
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:39,285
Shut up!

405
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:44,882
I wonder why I didn't
know about that event.

406
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:47,600
-Did you know?
-No.

407
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,798
-You?
-Not at all.

408
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:51,790
Well, it's lack of information.

409
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:55,894
If all you do is read articles
about celebrities on the web,

410
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,799
there's no way you'll know
that this event was happening.

411
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:01,394
-I check the borough's website.
-You should do that often.

412
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,894
It's full of useful information.

413
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,885
-I should go. Bye.
-Bye. Good job today.

414
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:10,593
-Bye.
-Good job? Come here!

415
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:13,587
What was that supposed to be? What...

416
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,301
-My goodness. What are you doing?
-Why are you beating him?

417
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:19,793
What? My goodness!

418
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:22,098
What are you two doing?

419
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,485
Are you protecting my husband? Are you?

420
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,579
I'm not protecting him!
I'm trying to mediate here.

421
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,720
Mediate? Are you a judge?

422
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:35,082
Then you get the beating on his behalf!

423
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:36,588
-Jinyi!
-What?

424
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:39,685
He didn't do anything
to deserve a beating!

425
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,979
-It's okay.
-Let me talk!

426
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:44,883
-What on earth?
-And your speech is so crude!

427
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,891
Like you didn't know!

428
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:49,176
I don't believe this. You come here!

429
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,665
Jeez! Hey!

430
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,665
Come here for your shoe. One, two...

431
00:35:58,057 --> 00:35:59,764
Do you even have eyes?

432
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,665
Come in. Come in.

433
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:04,493
Here's Crime Squad Three.

434
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:07,969
Oh, you did a great job!

435
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,378
The boys of Crime Squad Three
did a good job with...

436
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:15,367
...the secret investigation after
the special unit took the case.

437
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,074
Team leader, Yook! Come here.

438
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,582
-Oh, please.
-He did such a great job.

439
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,782
-Say something.
-The case is not solved yet.

440
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,589
He did a great job.

441
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,287
Did we catch the criminal?

442
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:30,406
No, not yet! Put your cameras away!

443
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:33,376
You're interfering with
the investigation if you do this. Get out!

444
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:36,071
Get out! Come on!
You get out, too, sir.

445
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:39,372
Do we have to hold a ritual
for you to leave? Get out.

446
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:44,177
Report Choi and Kim, let's go out
and have a drink. Let's go.

447
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:45,676
What are you doing?

448
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:48,280
We're not done yet! Get back to work!

449
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,375
Yes, sir!

450
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,370
They can walk the streets freely
because there's nothing going on.

451
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,677
If something was going on,
they wouldn't walk around like that.

452
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,383
-She's right.
-Don't doubt your husband.

453
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:03,905
I think she's right. They're not dating...

454
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,467
I mean, there's nothing between them.

455
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,664
My goodness.

456
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:10,573
Having a handsome husband...

457
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,772
...is such a big headache.

458
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,568
If you have good looks,
you can't avoid that.

459
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:22,160
I don't think he's handsome
enough to be causing headaches.

460
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:29,164
Do you know how handsome he
looks in a wrestling singlet?

461
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,075
I've never seen him
wearing it so I don't know.

462
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,175
He's not that handsome.

463
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,474
-Do you want to see?
-No!

464
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:38,974
I have to go home.

465
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:41,557
I just remembered,
I had something urgent to do.

466
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:43,462
-Something urgent?
-See you later.

467
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:57,008
"Suspect Wanted. Call 112 or report to the
nearest station as soon as you see him."

468
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:04,885
He didn't...

469
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:09,412
...mention,
where he'd take his last victim?

470
00:38:09,512 --> 00:38:11,504
I know this is difficult.

471
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:15,896
Can you tell me anything
that you can recall?

472
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:17,999
I'm not sure.

473
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,308
I was locked in the whole time...

474
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:23,999
Okay, thanks.

475
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:26,196
But...

476
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:30,003
...whenever he came to the basement,

477
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,894
I could hear a music box.

478
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,487
A music box?

479
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:39,979
Yes.

480
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:47,876
Where is that girl?

481
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,764
-Who?
-The girl that saved us.

482
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:54,661
She saved us and vanished.

483
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:58,459
She looked like a beautiful angel.

484
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:01,666
If I wasn't...

485
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,468
...dreaming.

486
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,053
So a woman saved you?

487
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,746
See? What did I tell you?

488
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:15,737
I told you to schedule interviews
before launching the new game.

489
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:18,838
You said you hate reporters, so...

490
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,544
Yes, I hate them, but work is work.

491
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:23,544
You won't work if you
don't like something?

492
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:27,333
Why are you so simple-minded?
Can't you be a little smarter?

493
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:31,917
Get out.

494
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,923
-Mr. Kong.
-Yes, sir.

495
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,715
Find where Bongsoon is.

496
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:41,818
Yes, sir.

497
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:03,712
Bongsoon.

498
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,399
Bongsoon.

499
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:10,621
Mr. An is asking for you.

500
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,413
-I see.
-Did you have lunch?

501
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,009
I'm not hungry. You go and eat.

502
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:23,226
Why didn't you come
to the presentation yesterday?

503
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,727
-I'm sorry.
-We were all waiting.

504
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:31,824
I was very flustered.
You didn't pick up your phone.

505
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:38,034
Did you two fight?

506
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:07,274
Sir,

507
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,378
she's in the office pantry.

508
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:21,945
What? Did they really fight?

509
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:30,057
She's not even eating.

510
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:43,342
-Let's go and get lunch.
-I'm not hungry.

511
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:47,643
-You should eat anyway.
-Kyungshim must be starving.

512
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,451
I can't be the only one eating.

513
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,369
Don't mind me.

514
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,161
Do Bongsoon.

515
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:07,064
You have to eat to stay
strong and save your friend.

516
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:09,865
I don't have to eat to stay strong.

517
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:13,067
-Don't mind me.
-Say that one more time...

518
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:16,670
I won't eat,
if you're going to starve yourself.

519
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:23,564
I'm sorry.

520
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:26,962
It's my fault.

521
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:29,170
No.

522
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,273
Don't say sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

523
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,863
Okay,

524
00:42:40,472 --> 00:42:41,562
do as you please.

525
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,657
Starve then. Nobody is stopping you.

526
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,649
I'll stop worrying about you.

527
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:19,569
Where do I get spicy chicken feet?

528
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,987
"Food Delivery"

529
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:37,189
"Spicy chicken feet"

530
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:37,880
"Order"

531
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:48,368
So you're saying you only did
as Kim Janghyeon told you, right?

532
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:53,851
Because if you didn't,
he wouldn't give you this!

533
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:55,057
Right?

534
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:57,438
I don't know.

535
00:43:57,556 --> 00:43:59,756
Hey, Jang Kwangseok!

536
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:03,945
Kim Janghyeon disappeared.
Where did he go?

537
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,246
You...

538
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:07,841
...can never catch him.

539
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:08,849
Hey.

540
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:10,944
Hey!

541
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:14,144
The drug is wearing off?
My sugar level is dropping.

542
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:16,748
Don't laugh!

543
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:21,963
Why are there so many stairs?
Are these stairs to heaven?

544
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:24,567
Darn, it's so high.

545
00:44:26,173 --> 00:44:29,367
Hey, isn't that the monk?

546
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:31,669
What is he doing?

547
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:37,457
I'm an expert in different martial arts,

548
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,360
but I've never seen that. What's that?

549
00:44:40,557 --> 00:44:44,368
Are you really an expert
in different martial arts?

550
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:49,386
You claim that but I never saw it.

551
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:51,588
Hey, every part can be a vital point.

552
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:02,647
What the heck?

553
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:04,750
Namaste.

554
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:27,153
-Are you sleeping, sir?
-No.

555
00:45:28,254 --> 00:45:30,241
I'm disciplining myself.

556
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:37,168
-What brought you here?
-We don't know what to do now.

557
00:45:37,253 --> 00:45:40,056
-What do we do?
-Lead a good life.

558
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:41,271
-Gari.
-Yes, sir.

559
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,358
-Hwang.
-Yes, sir.

560
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,865
How do you define life?

561
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:50,365
Life is...

562
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:56,572
...a lump of poop.

563
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:59,578
You said that when you left us.

564
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,175
Why do you keep mentioning dirty poop?

565
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,768
Poop is never dirty!

566
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:10,350
Anyway, we go back to dust,

567
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,634
when we die.

568
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,538
Life...

569
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,633
...is so meaningless.

570
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:25,239
Money, power, image! They're all useless.

571
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,567
Sorry.

572
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:30,636
Hello?

573
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:33,951
Really?

574
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:35,753
I understand.

575
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:37,965
Sir,

576
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:41,773
the borough approved our
redevelopment project.

577
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:42,978
What?

578
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:44,857
Let's go there now!

579
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,968
Do you know how much
that project is worth?

580
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,259
Even after deducting
the construction cost,

581
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,454
we gain 20 percent in profits!

582
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:57,447
Let's go! No, no.
You pack my things and come.

583
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:59,657
I'm leaving.
I need to meet the man in charge.

584
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:01,742
Redevelopment. Redevelopment.

585
00:47:01,827 --> 00:47:03,741
It's 30,000 dollars per 3.3 meters!

586
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:05,438
We have more viewers.

587
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,841
It's going up and up.

588
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,541
Should we open this?

589
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:13,620
-You said it's drug water.
-Shut it.

590
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:14,730
It's fine.

591
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,446
It smells like poop!

592
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,442
Who left the bathroom door open?

593
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:28,649
Title, "Counting Stars At Night."

594
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:30,451
"Counting stars."

595
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:33,239
"There are so many stars."

596
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:35,438
"But I still count stars."

597
00:47:36,028 --> 00:47:40,626
"I count stars until I have
no shame under the heaven."

598
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:43,019
"For eight nights and nine
days, I count stars."

599
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:45,717
"Now only four stars remain."

600
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,708
What does this mean?

601
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,915
Four stars? Four?

602
00:47:51,904 --> 00:47:53,003
Four criminal records?

603
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:55,019
-Only four?
-More.

604
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:57,215
Oh, so he means lead a good life?

605
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,620
-Namaste.
-Namaste...

606
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,829
Join me at the sauna.

607
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:12,924
It's 30 minutes from here
if you ride bus number 420.

608
00:48:13,012 --> 00:48:15,027
There's a new sauna.

609
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:18,519
I have two free pass coupons.

610
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:22,125
I need someone to scrub my back. Join me.

611
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,511
Well, I...

612
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,828
-I don't go to saunas.
-Join me!

613
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,211
-I went to one over Chuseok.
-Then let's go next week.

614
00:48:29,315 --> 00:48:31,624
-It expires next week.
-Okay. We'll go.

615
00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:34,546
Give me your business card.

616
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:39,549
What if you disappear?
Give me your business card.

617
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,041
I'll text you.

618
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,131
He's not normal.

619
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:19,671
Unidentified Caller

620
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:28,570
Well, I guess you must be really strong.

621
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,761
How did you get out of there?

622
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,887
Where's my friend? Is she safe?

623
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:42,188
You ruined my wedding.

624
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,369
Fight me.

625
00:49:43,672 --> 00:49:46,982
Stop hurting others like a coward.
Fight me.

626
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:49,469
Let my friend go! Set Kyungshim free!

627
00:49:52,974 --> 00:49:54,168
Is Kyungshim...

628
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,763
-Is she safe?
-If I let her go,

629
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,887
-will you marry me instead?
-Okay.

630
00:50:01,746 --> 00:50:03,071
Anytime.

631
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:06,390
-Meet me right now.
-I'll meet you tonight.

632
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,589
I'll text you the address.

633
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:10,080
Also,

634
00:50:10,787 --> 00:50:12,682
you need to get all dolled
up for the occasion.

635
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:30,248
Kim Janghyeon,
this scum is not a usual criminal.

636
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:33,635
He continuously supplied him with drugs.

637
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:37,730
The drug turned out to be from a gang
in Hong Kong, China.

638
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:42,353
He made him an addict,
so he could easily manipulate him.

639
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:45,452
-Anyway, you two.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,043
Request an arrest warrant.

641
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,533
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

642
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:50,921
Somehow,

643
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:54,327
I get the feeling that
he'll do something tonight.

644
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:21,765
"Spicy chicken feet"

645
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:31,231
Where did she go this time?

646
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:48,421
If I let her go,
will you marry me instead?

647
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,488
"Spicy chicken feet"

648
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,258
Keep quiet.

649
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,782
Don't worry, Kyungshim.

650
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:13,970
I'll save you.

651
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:17,169
Just stay safe until I do, okay?

652
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,929
Sorry, I'm taking off today.

653
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:10,996
No matter what you say...

654
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:13,298
...or think,

655
00:54:15,298 --> 00:54:16,907
my feelings for you won't change.

656
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:35,273
"Bongbong"

657
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,757
"Do Bongsoon"

658
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:28,894
Dowon intersection 217.
Come to the J-Top construction site.

659
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:30,497
Get dolled up.

660
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:37,897
"Suspect Wanted"

661
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:12,038
"Bongsoon's House"

662
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:16,038
"An Minhyuk"

663
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:24,534
I think something will happen to Bongsoon.

664
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:26,447
-What?
-You need to come.

665
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:28,050
You're the only cop I trust.

666
00:57:28,146 --> 00:57:29,546
Where's Bongsoon?

667
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:32,845
Kyungshim!

668
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,337
Kyungshim!

669
00:57:37,944 --> 00:57:39,340
Kyungshim!

670
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:47,537
-Kyungshim!
-You did get dolled up.

671
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,629
No need to hurry.

672
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:56,910
I'll be there soon.

673
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,181
I'm coming!

674
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,590
Kyungshim!

675
00:58:16,668 --> 00:58:19,275
Come and save your friend.

676
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:55,826
Are you okay?

677
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:02,315
Get up, Kyungshim. Everything is fine.

678
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:06,201
Bongsoon, he's not the criminal.

679
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:08,408
-What?
-He's not the criminal.

680
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:09,803
Wait here.

681
00:59:17,835 --> 00:59:21,755
Sir? Sir, are you okay? Sir!

682
00:59:24,052 --> 00:59:27,652
Bongsoon, don't come! Don't!

683
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,830
Bongsoon, don't come! Don't!

684
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:52,537
Hey!

685
00:59:53,943 --> 00:59:55,732
Come and save your friend!

686
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,137
Save her like the last time.

687
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:11,436
I know that hurting an innocent person
will make me lose my power,

688
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:13,944
but sometimes I think I should do that.

689
01:00:33,247 --> 01:00:36,458
What? You lost your strength?

690
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:38,647
That makes it boring.

691
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:41,841
I even prepared this tranquilizer gun.

692
01:00:43,823 --> 01:00:45,952
Why are you so weak?

693
01:00:47,446 --> 01:00:50,540
-Try that again. Go on.
-Kim Janghyeon.

694
01:00:50,836 --> 01:00:52,135
Let her go!

695
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:56,537
Lay one more finger on
her, and I'll kill you.

696
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:30,725
Kim Janghyeon, stop!

697
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,422
Get out of the car!

698
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:38,303
Bongsoon.

699
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:42,011
I'm here.

700
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:43,614
You're fine.

701
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:02,970
I'm here.

702
01:02:13,698 --> 01:02:14,781
Bongsoon!

703
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:17,376
Bongsoon!

704
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:01,654
"Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"

705
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:04,054
It always hurts me to think of Bongsoon.

706
01:03:04,149 --> 01:03:05,943
I'm not special anymore.

707
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:08,552
It doesn't matter to me
if you're special or not.

708
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:11,961
-I think he's a good person.
-He's like a savior.

709
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:14,766
Hey, An Minhyuk! Minhyuk!

710
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:18,258
All I want is for you to be happy.

711
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,159
If you're happy, I'm happy.

712
01:03:20,244 --> 01:03:23,063
Do you think Bongsoon
can have a normal life?

713
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:24,459
How high was that cliff?

714
01:03:24,557 --> 01:03:26,879
More than 50 meters.
There's no chance he survived.

715
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:28,768
But where's the body?

716
01:03:28,965 --> 01:03:30,863
-Mr. An, be careful.
-Don't worry about me.

717
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:32,465
Don't leave Bongsoon alone.

718
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:33,813
Bongsoon!

719
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:38,375
You're like a peanut,
so I can put you in here.

720
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,672
But it seems like
I'm not in your heart.

721
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:43,559
You are in my heart.
