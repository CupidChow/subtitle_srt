1
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,141
Then why leave her to me?

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,713
I didn't. Why would I
entrust her with you?

3
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:16,470
I planned to come and pick her up.

4
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:19,653
Gukdoo.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,855
Hey, are you okay?

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,930
Seriously.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,529
We're short of hands already.
Why did he go there?

8
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,942
The criminal saw her face several times.

9
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,344
-I understand why he's worried.
-Is he dating her?

10
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,438
Did we get the identikit of
the mask from the victim?

11
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:49,216
Brown Bear and Spectacles
are working in shifts on that.

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,386
Something like this?

13
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,720
-No.
-No?

14
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:57,324
-Then something like this?
-No.

15
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:00,727
-What about this or this?
-Neither of them.

16
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:06,316
It made him look bald
and covered his whole face.

17
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,637
-Bald?
-That criminal must be very ugly.

18
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:15,842
Or why would he wear a mask?

19
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,147
I think you should exclude
anyone that is good-looking.

20
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,450
If he's good-looking,
he'd do it without reserve.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,250
Why wear a mask?

22
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,024
Why can't you find him
in CCTV footages?

23
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:31,091
He's avoiding cameras
because he's not photogenic.

24
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,995
You should remember that
or you might regret it later.

25
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,200
Alright.

26
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,704
You have a big house.

27
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,696
Where's an empty room? Nice couch.

28
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:50,010
-Forget the room. I'll sleep here.
-The couch isn't comfortable.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,693
Then we can sleep
together in my bed.

30
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,414
What? No, never.

31
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,483
I don't mind. Do you mind?

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,685
Of course not.
We can sleep in my bed.

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:04,558
No, Gukdoo!
No, Gukdoo. Never!

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,761
Mr. An is... He's...

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,360
-Then excuse me.
-No! He's gay!

36
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:18,772
I wouldn't have accepted this
if he was a straight man.

37
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,676
Everyone knows it anyway.
Can't you just tell him?

38
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,551
I don't want anymore misunderstandings.

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,463
Okay, since everyone knows,
I think he should also know.

40
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,979
She's my bodyguard.

41
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,489
What is this supposed to be?
Are you two kidding me?

42
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,090
-No!
-No!

43
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,394
I've been blackmailed continuously
so I hired her as my bodyguard.

44
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,496
That's absurd.

45
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:44,480
Do you think that makes any sense?

46
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:48,607
Why hire a female bodyguard?
And someone as feeble as her?

47
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,203
You're making no sense.

48
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,306
Feeble? She's...

49
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:58,812
He gets involved in scandals
when he's around male bodyguards.

50
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:04,117
You know they're usually
well-built and handsome.

51
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:07,421
So in order to prevent
that kind of scandal.

52
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,024
He's very strict about his image.

53
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,226
Everything you're saying is absurd
and you want me to believe it?

54
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:17,938
-Yes!
-Very well. Let's say it's true.

55
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,133
There must be plenty of rooms.
Let's use separate rooms.

56
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,936
Can I get a room?
I won't be messy. May I?

57
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,937
A room?

58
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:26,449
I don't think we should use
separate rooms.

59
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,534
-We shouldn't!
-We shouldn't!

60
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,104
Why don't we do this?

61
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,892
Since we were brought together,

62
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
why don't we stay up without sleeping
for two days straight?

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,744
Okay?

64
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm doing better than usual today.

65
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,415
That's right.

66
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,855
-Slightly to the right.
-Move away.

67
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,659
Shoot.

68
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,680
The cutoff line of
the police academy is too high.

69
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,767
You're so busy studying that
you can't practice catching.

70
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,473
Don't be so discouraged.

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,209
How could you miss that?

72
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,183
Excuse me.

73
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:13,874
Game over.

74
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,466
Don't be so discouraged.

75
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,872
One more match?

76
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:20,073
What game?

77
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:32,852
I'll start.

78
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,199
I left the station an hour ago.

79
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,102
It's not office hours so I can drink.

80
00:07:55,314 --> 00:08:00,413
Why are you competing with drinks?
Then I'm drinking, too.

81
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,414
-No!
-No!

82
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,337
Will you stop...

83
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,487
Gukdoo, are you okay?

84
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,490
-Gukdoo.
-You can't handle it?

85
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:50,330
What are you doing? Hey!

86
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,535
-Drink.
-Will you stop it?

87
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:00,840
Hey.

88
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,314
Hey, stop. Gukdoo!

89
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,319
Jeez!

90
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:22,829
Sometimes you're too harsh on Bongsoon.

91
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,431
She's only strong.

92
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,735
But what if the bad guy has a weapon?

93
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,153
That's why I sent her to her boss.

94
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,941
He took her in to protect her.

95
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,544
You could've sent her to your mother.

96
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,246
-Aren't you going to work?
-How can you let an adult woman...

97
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,356
-...spend the night with a guy?

98
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,052
My goodness. He's gay. Are you stupid?

99
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,350
Listen. I don't think he's gay.

100
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,959
Oh, my. Did you feel that, too?
You don't think he's gay, right?

101
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,863
No. We went to the club together
and he looked at girls like this.

102
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,666
With a sensual look in his eyes.

103
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,570
What? Then we can't let
Bongsoon stay there!

104
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,870
If you really care for her,
don't do anything about it.

105
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:13,279
Don't make a fuss and make
things come to nothing!

106
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,685
I trust my daughter.
Though I don't trust him.

107
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:23,289
I hope my son-in-law
enjoys the first night.

108
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,893
What? Son-in-law?

109
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,595
First night?

110
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,538
Jeez!

111
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:15,041
Keep quiet.

112
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,623
Gosh, I don't believe this!

113
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,925
Gosh!

114
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,794
Jeez.

115
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,197
Why am I...

116
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,998
Mr. An?

117
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,008
Gukdoo.

118
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:59,118
Gukdoo, I'll go and get something
to wake you up. Stay here, okay?

119
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:18,204
Sir, wake up. You can't sleep here.

120
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,108
-Sir, you'll freeze to death.
-Who's this?

121
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,111
It's very cold.

122
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,813
I want a blanket.

123
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,515
Look at this. Whoa.

124
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:33,519
Sir, you shouldn't be sleeping here.

125
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,221
Stop right there!

126
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,991
What the heck?

127
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,894
Wait.
Did you take that away from him?

128
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,430
Why do you care? Can't we?

129
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,702
Oh, how scary! How scary!

130
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,404
Running errands?

131
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,106
You're my type.

132
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:59,395
It's cold outside. Should we go
in somewhere and warm ourselves?

133
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,181
Leave the wallet where it was.

134
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,384
Shoot. I think he's a cop.

135
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,496
What a rotten day.

136
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,658
Put it back. I've been clear enough.

137
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,865
Are you sad that we didn't toy with you?

138
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:23,069
I could have just let you go...

139
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,371
...but you're asking for it.

140
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,542
Okay,

141
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:31,549
shall we?

142
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,946
-What?
-Let's go.

143
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,254
Are you okay?

144
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:45,858
She's beating them!
That girl is beating them up.

145
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,739
How dare you?

146
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,310
What on earth?

147
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,878
Gosh. You never listen, do you?

148
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,700
Today is a very long day.

149
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,528
What exactly is she?

150
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,031
A vampire?

151
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,849
What is this?

152
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,856
What? You want to protect me?

153
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,759
What a joke.

154
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,375
Protect me? Sure, right.

155
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,582
Gukdoo, sleep. Careful.

156
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:20,686
I'll put your legs up. There.

157
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,791
Goodnight.

158
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,692
I want food.

159
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,499
-Good evening.
-Who are they?

160
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,370
-Oh, Yes.
-We won't hurt you.

161
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,418
What's that?
Are they undercover?

162
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,919
Wait.

163
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,021
Are they from Team Two?

164
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,662
-Sir, the patrol is following us.
-Did it get leaked?

165
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:01,928
They know she's missing.
We know, so they should know.

166
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,664
Shoot. I need a smoke.

167
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,599
She covered him?

168
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,302
While I'm on the floor?

169
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:19,672
She's favoring him?

170
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,079
This is mine.

171
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:31,948
I'm freezing.

172
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:43,462
I almost saw her face.

173
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,165
I was so close to seeing her eyes.

174
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:13,426
No way. That's impossible.

175
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,595
Goodnight.

176
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,476
I think she's going to stay there.

177
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,581
Let's go.

178
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,583
-Where?
-Home.

179
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,088
But let's have some rice first.

180
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:47,493
-What do you want to eat?
-I said rice, you idiot!

181
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:50,097
There are many kinds of rice dishes.

182
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,407
Rice soup, bean sprouts,
and rice soup, fried rice,

183
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,300
japchae rice, wraps, and rice...

184
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,302
-Shut up.
-Okay.

185
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,052
-What? What?
-Aren't you going to work?

186
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,289
-Hi, ma'am.
-Hi.

187
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,155
I brought some abalone porridge.

188
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,692
This is for Bonggi.
Take it to him on your way out.

189
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:19,492
What about me?

190
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,862
Get something in a diner.

191
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:26,866
I wonder if my son-in-law
had a good night.

192
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,986
You're calling him that again.

193
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,506
I hope she makes him breakfast.

194
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:36,391
I'm worried that she'll get up late.

195
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,889
I heard Gukdoo's there.

196
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:42,481
-What?
-She said Gukdoo's with them.

197
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,283
That's a relief. Very good.

198
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,187
What? Why does he work
so hard unnecessarily?

199
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,588
He should catch the criminal instead.

200
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,026
He sent her over there.
Why did he have to go?

201
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:55,528
He's not very smart,
just like his mother.

202
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,264
Nobody rewards him for that!

203
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,994
-What is this?
-Oh, that?

204
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,285
I think about my country
and people even when I eat.

205
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,021
-Thanks, Bongsoon.
-Enjoy it, Gukdoo.

206
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,689
It's my food.
You should thank me.

207
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,791
-But how did we get home last night?
-What?

208
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,194
You walked in.
Don't you remember?

209
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,179
Why are you having toast and chocolate?

210
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,299
I didn't drink,
so I don't need hangover soup.

211
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,600
Let me help you.

212
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,378
Thanks, Gukdoo.

213
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,183
Who won last night?

214
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,587
The last thing I remember
is you passing out.

215
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,689
How strange.

216
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:59,592
As far as I remember
you were the one who passed out.

217
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,260
Are you really gay?

218
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,463
I don't answer personal questions.

219
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,898
You have no manners.

220
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,085
Anyway, you can't stay together alone.

221
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,272
Neither can you.

222
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,809
You two can never stay together alone.

223
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:23,415
I didn't want to say this but do
you know what you did last night?

224
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,025
Jeez!

225
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:39,765
-Hey, where are you going?
-Gukdoo.

226
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,693
-Where are you going?
-Hey!

227
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:43,469
-Gukdoo.
-How dare...

228
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,272
-Gukdoo.
-Come here.

229
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,074
What is he doing?

230
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,068
What's going on?

231
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,870
Gukdoo!

232
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,108
What?

233
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,917
No! No, no!

234
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,620
Don't, don't, don't!

235
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,124
No! No! No!

236
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,427
What are you doing?

237
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:45,914
What's going on? Don't do that?
Oh, no!

238
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,501
I have to go home before midnight.

239
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,303
My carriage turns into a pumpkin.

240
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,172
-What?
-Bye.

241
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:54,473
Hey.

242
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:59,178
-Wait for me.
-Gukdoo.

243
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:08,387
Hey, lock the door.
It's dangerous.

244
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,413
Oh, my gosh.

245
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,394
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:50,162
It's okay. Do you find it spicy?

247
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:52,199
Who said it's spicy?

248
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,199
No, I'm just asking.

249
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,874
It's so soft.

250
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,810
It's good? Can I have one?

251
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,280
I usually don't have breakfast.

252
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,650
Enjoy. Have one more bowl.

253
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,654
Gukdoo, is it too spicy?

254
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,991
Have some chocolate. Say, "ah."

255
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,836
"Unknown Caller"

256
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:44,750
You will never take over Osung.
You'd better give up.

257
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,118
You jerk!

258
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,021
You coward.

259
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,225
Come up and tell me face to face.
Don't waste time on this.

260
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,830
Tell the shareholders tomorrow
in the meeting that you decline.

261
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,930
What if I don't?

262
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,001
Then I will destroy you
and Ainsoft as well.

263
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,036
This time I'll use a real bullet.

264
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,507
Bring it on. I'll catch you
before you even try.

265
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,009
Brace yourself.

266
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,617
-Another blackmail call?
-No. Let's eat.

267
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,621
I think you need help
from the police, not a bodyguard.

268
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,237
I refuse. I don't trust the police.

269
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,896
-Hello?
-We located the cloned phone.

270
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,312
We'll carry out a raid.
Get here quickly.

271
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,600
A cop from another station
will protect your witness.

272
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,902
-Don't worry about that.
-Okay.

273
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,472
Bongsoon, another officer
will go to your office later.

274
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,575
-Don't send him back.
-Are you leaving?

275
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:49,014
I'm asking you man-to-man.
Please take good care of her.

276
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:56,989
Goodbye, Gukdoo.

277
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,490
Bye.

278
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,599
Don't worry, Mr. An. I'll protect you.

279
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,664
-Your friend asked me to protect you.
-I can protect myself.

280
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:19,344
You made the soup spicy
on purpose, right?

281
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:23,050
You messed around with food.
That's a breach of contract.

282
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,553
What did I do this time?

283
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:29,354
You shall protect your
employer's body and mind...

284
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:33,026
...and you shall not willfully neglect
any injury on his body.

285
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:35,527
You just injured my stomach.

286
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:39,633
Your stomach? Show me.
Then prove that it's injured.

287
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,000
You can't prove it.

288
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,104
What happened to you?

289
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:49,341
I have heartburn!
Why is the soup so spicy?

290
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:53,212
That's because you drank!

291
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,114
You blame me for everything.

292
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,717
You would even blame me
if you tripped while walking.

293
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,320
Are you really protecting me?

294
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,021
I've been getting hurt more
ever since I met you.

295
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,423
Now even the stomach!

296
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:08,716
Stop it! Before it gets worse.

297
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,430
-What?
-I mean it.

298
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,699
Now eat.

299
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:18,891
Okay, then.

300
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,166
-You came?
-Yes, sir.

301
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,151
It's that house.
Third floor, to the left.

302
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,653
You wear this and go in.

303
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,824
-Okay.
-Let's get it started.

304
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,129
-Who is it?
-Delivery!

305
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,099
-I'm not expecting any delivery.
-Are you Mr. Kim Seokbae?

306
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,000
Yes. Why?

307
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:51,303
-Your package.
-Yeonhui-dong, Mapo-gu...

308
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,739
-What's this?
-Don't move!

309
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,425
You are under arrest as a
suspect of a kidnapping.

310
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,711
-Kidnapping? What kidnapping?
-Don't move!

311
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,947
You have the right to hire a lawyer.

312
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:04,917
Mr. An, we have a problem.

313
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,405
Osung Construction's stock price
has hit the lower limit.

314
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,192
Why? Because of the accident
at the Chinese site?

315
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,093
No, actually...

316
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,296
What? What is it?

317
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,632
-Because of some rumors.
-What rumors?

318
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,436
The rumors about you liking men.

319
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:36,915
The website removed my pole
dancing video the last time.

320
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:41,720
Don't worry too much.
They'll remove it in time.

321
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:44,723
Mr. Park, it's An Minhyuk speaking.

322
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:49,228
I'd like to remove the rumors about me
that are spreading through your website.

323
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,031
If our business suffers,
yours will be affected, too.

324
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,068
And thanks for removing
the pole dancing video.

325
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,439
I trust that it'll be
removed immediately. Bye.

326
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,043
Did you ask them to remove
my video the last time?

327
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,379
-Yes.
-Thank you.

328
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,183
Yes, you should be very thankful.

329
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,595
-Hey! They found that bike.
-What?

330
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:27,699
Now finding that guy that
shot me, attacked the cop,

331
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,104
shot down my helicam,
and is tailing me is a matter of time.

332
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,405
Did you really find it?

333
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,908
He put it on sale on a website
for secondhand stolen bikes.

334
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,279
It's hard to find it if they
change the plate and sell it.

335
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,880
And how did you find it?

336
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,383
Why do you think
I don't trust the police?

337
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,386
Because I'm smarter than them.

338
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,760
These are all stolen bikes.

339
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,629
He didn't change the plate.

340
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,065
-Did you get the phone number?
-Not just the number.

341
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:05,037
Name: Oh Hyunjoong.
Age: 30. 180 cm, 75 kg.

342
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,072
He works for Baektak Developments.

343
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,359
Baektak Developments?
It sounds really familiar.

344
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,580
It's a company run by thugs
that does anything for money.

345
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,747
Look.

346
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:23,422
They have been bound up
with my father's company.

347
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:28,160
They started as a service company ran by
thugs and became a development company.

348
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,464
They're associated deeply
with my father's business.

349
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,763
And he's the CEO.

350
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,166
He used to work for my father.

351
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,405
His real name is Baek Sutak.

352
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:42,674
-Why An Minhyuk?
-I know.

353
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:48,180
Is this fate or inevitable?

354
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:52,184
I will catch the guy that stole the bike.

355
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,185
You will?

356
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,054
You don't trust the police.

357
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,589
-Let's go.
-Hey!

358
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,391
Come on!

359
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:01,202
Hey!

360
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,785
Can you be more gentle?

361
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,105
No, I think there's been
an accident in front of us.

362
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,806
Yes, it's an accident.

363
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,981
Jeez! What the heck?

364
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:25,650
Hey, roll down the window.
Where do you have your eyes?

365
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,686
-Watch where you're going!
-You suddenly stopped.

366
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,490
-So I stepped on my brakes.
-Break? It's break time for you?

367
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:33,759
Don't you know about braking distance?

368
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,994
-He's going overboard.
-I'm sorry.

369
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,898
-I'll call the insurance company.
-Insurance?

370
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,599
I don't believe this!

371
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,588
-Get out of the car! Now!
-Okay, I'm getting out.

372
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:48,807
-That scumbag.
-You almost killed me.

373
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,979
I died and she'll call
the insurance company!

374
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,882
-That jerk.
-Is that what you want?

375
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:57,282
-Can I have your card?
-My face is my card.

376
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,851
Go ahead and hit it. Come on!

377
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:03,390
Don't frown like that.
It makes you even uglier.

378
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,293
You got a new face through surgery.

379
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,362
Now come with me. Come on.

380
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:13,165
Stop it!
She'll call the insurance company.

381
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,801
Women! Friends?
Do you get along well?

382
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,804
The two of you are both tiny.

383
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,906
-What should I do?
-Excuse me!

384
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,508
What are you doing?

385
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,581
What do you want?

386
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:31,316
Your car looks fine. Hers is more damaged.

387
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,020
She apologized and she'll cover
the damages. What's the problem?

388
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,723
You caused her to bump into your car.

389
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,426
It wasn't only her negligence.
So what? Do we call the police?

390
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,028
No, I mean...

391
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,702
What a rotten day!

392
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:53,205
Are you running away?

393
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,158
To turn off the engine. It's wasting gas.

394
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,376
-To protect nature!
-What a scumbag.

395
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,916
Stay in your car and call
the police the next time.

396
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,088
Thanks.

397
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:14,226
Are you a new gang or what?
You bunch of idiots!

398
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,113
Don't try to talk to people like that.

399
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,699
The Korean police...

400
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,401
...are trustworthy.

401
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,738
Thank you so much. Thank you.

402
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:33,912
Where is she?

403
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:40,519
What lunatics!

404
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:45,123
You should thank that I became
a nicer person. You idiots!

405
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,826
I have a black belt in taekwondo!

406
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,929
-Sir.
-Sir? Sir!

407
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:54,332
-Who are you?
-Hey, don't be so loud.

408
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:57,237
Pull over somewhere quiet.
I need to talk to you.

409
00:33:57,337 --> 00:34:02,052
Jesus, Buddha, please!
Somewhere quiet? Okay.

410
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,443
Somewhere quiet and deserted.
It's dangerous. Hold my hand.

411
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:06,711
Is that not what you want?

412
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,017
I'm turning the corner.
We're almost there.

413
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:16,021
Yes. Can you pull over there
where there's no one around?

414
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,628
Okay. Here we are.

415
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,736
Hey, where are you going?
Are you crazy?

416
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:32,237
Why are you getting out? Hey! Hey!

417
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,044
What is this?

418
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:42,664
Stay here until I'm done, okay?

419
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:45,450
Oh, that's a new concept.

420
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:52,157
-You shouldn't treat her like that.
-Wow, she's something.

421
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,061
-But that's...
-I tried to control myself...

422
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,664
...but I can't.

423
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,533
-I tried to restrain myself!
-Where are you going?

424
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,635
But I can't!

425
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,237
This is crazy.

426
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,207
Okay. Here we go.

427
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,009
-What?
-Hold on tight.

428
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,714
-Sorry!
-Wow.

429
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,887
Why do you remain silent
when a man confronts you?

430
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,992
When you talk to women
that are weaker than you,

431
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:31,196
you cuss and threaten them.

432
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:37,102
But you become so meek when
a guy with a nice car talks to you.

433
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:40,205
Don't you think that's really cowardly?

434
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,208
You shouldn't lead your life like that!

435
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,112
You must be generous to the weak!

436
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,402
What should I do?

437
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:01,326
Nasty.

438
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,899
Oh, Mr. An.

439
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,872
When did you get here?

440
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,175
Oh, sorry. I'm late.
I'll drive. Let's go.

441
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,577
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

442
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,380
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

443
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,384
-Get in!
-Yes, ma'am.

444
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:27,686
I mean, okay.

445
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,405
I went there and found nobody.

446
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,491
We know you called the ballet
teacher three times that day.

447
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,194
-And you play innocent?
-Of course I called her!

448
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,314
Once, for directions to the bar.
A second time when I got there.

449
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,199
The third time
because I didn't find her.

450
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,601
It's yours, right?

451
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,705
-Why do you use a cloned phone?
-Gosh.

452
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:52,377
I'm heavily in debt.

453
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,880
It's hard to make a living.
I failed twice in business.

454
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,884
My old mother is taking
care of my daughter.

455
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,887
I don't even have money to
buy my daughter a backpack!

456
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,657
According to the owner of that bar,

457
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,659
she left as soon as
she picked up your call.

458
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,961
Then check my dash cam!

459
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,663
He's not the one.

460
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:17,068
He followed her and on that day,
he went in the bar to drink alone.

461
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,170
He heard when she picked up the phone.

462
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,572
Oh, the location here is...

463
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:24,337
The owner of the bar thought
it was just another driver.

464
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,444
Obviously he didn't drink...

465
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:31,249
...and he paid in cash
to not leave any traces.

466
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:38,340
Sir, a man was seen taking
the car from the parking lot.

467
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,059
-What?
-We can't see his face,

468
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,661
but it's the same guy that
disguised himself as a doctor.

469
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:46,348
His height and the way
he walks are identical.

470
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,369
A third victim...

471
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,872
I think it is...

472
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,877
Did you see the movie "King Kong"?

473
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:04,349
The female protagonist looks
at the sunset and says,

474
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,051
"Beautiful."

475
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,966
Beautiful.

476
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,558
I feel like...

477
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,761
...I became the protagonist.

478
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,265
Are you saying that I'm King Kong?

479
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:24,269
A very special King Kong.
A peanut-like King Kong.

480
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,843
How can this great strength
come from someone so tiny?

481
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:35,747
I don't know. I was born this way.

482
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,649
Is it some kind of superpower?

483
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,753
It runs in my family.
Passed down to women only.

484
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:46,457
So you mean if I marry you...

485
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,360
...I don't mean I'll marry you.

486
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,570
If you get married and have
a daughter, she'll be like you?

487
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,366
Yes, unless a major change happens.

488
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:58,469
That's absurd.

489
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,078
Don't lower your head.
You didn't do anything wrong.

490
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,282
It runs in your family.
You were born that way.

491
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:14,586
Just like I was born handsome,
you were born strong.

492
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,889
It's all about you in the end.

493
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:23,895
But remember you told me...

494
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,498
...that you want to use that
strength the right way?

495
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,275
You were born like this,
so let's make you great.

496
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,777
I'll help you.

497
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,345
You need training.

498
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,146
Training?

499
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,668
It's like in the games.

500
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:47,952
If you use your strength like a brute,
you'll lose your power and get banned.

501
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:54,259
Let's see how you can use
your strength the right way.

502
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,562
I will make you...

503
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,762
...be like "Gina."

504
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:43,875
My car!

505
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,558
No!

506
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:05,129
No!

507
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,840
Heeji, what brought you here?

508
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,939
Have you had dinner?
Should we go for dinner?

509
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,344
No, Gukdoo.

510
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,746
I came to tell you something.

511
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,139
I'm starting to have doubts.

512
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,544
I had to tell you this
to have peace of mind.

513
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,048
I'm sorry. I know I'm selfish.

514
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,451
I'm hurting you to feel at ease.

515
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,557
I've started to have
feelings for someone else.

516
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:17,168
Hello?

517
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,972
Gukdoo, what are you doing?

518
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:24,075
I'm working.
Is everything alright?

519
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,918
Yes, don't worry about me.

520
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm on duty tonight so I won't go home.

521
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:35,170
So don't forget to lock your door.

522
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,090
But why did you call?

523
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,094
To tell you that you don't
have to worry about me.

524
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,463
I can't help it. I'm worried.

525
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,868
I'm stronger than you think.

526
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:55,740
No matter how strong you are,

527
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,843
to me, you're a weak woman.

528
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,816
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

529
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:18,463
Gosh, the two of you are real eyesores.

530
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,166
Where are we going now?

531
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,769
-Are we going to catch the guy?
-No, not today.

532
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,572
Just shut up and go.

533
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,618
Your father called you again?

534
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:43,521
I'll help you, so you help me too.

535
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,822
-What?
-Let's go.

536
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:55,533
Get married!

537
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,516
We need to make connections
with a respectful family...

538
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:08,412
...and change the image that
we're a business run by gangsters.

539
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:12,717
That's the only way to
clarify those absurd rumors.

540
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,818
So get married.

541
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,920
I already found a good spouse for you.

542
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:18,823
I have a girlfriend, father.

543
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,534
I'm living with her.

544
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,156
-Minhyuk.
-It just happened.

545
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,543
-Is it true?
-What? Well...

546
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:40,044
It's true that we live together, but...

547
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,846
Her parents are very strict.

548
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,448
They're a family of traditions
and they haven't approved yet.

549
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:48,052
-What do your parents do?
-What? Well, they...

550
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:51,155
They have a walnut business.

551
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,658
Walnuts? Do they export?

552
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,762
-No, they make it.
-They grow walnut trees?

553
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:00,665
-Do they have a farm?
-No, actually...

554
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,669
I've never seen a walnut tree...

555
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,769
-They have a walnut pie shop.
-What?

556
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,573
Anyway, I have a girlfriend,
so don't bring that up again.

557
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:13,277
What about the rumors
that say you like men?

558
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,013
Well, would you want me to like men?

559
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,318
No comment, then.

560
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm going to marry her.

561
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:25,723
Isn't she pretty, father?

562
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:29,427
You're so pretty.
She's so pretty.

563
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,630
I promise you'll have a grandson soon.

564
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,334
-What?
-Are you okay?

565
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,338
You wanted two?

566
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,241
-What? Two?
-No.

567
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:44,942
-A boy and a girl?
-What?

568
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,445
I don't know what made you
think I would tolerate it.

569
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:50,248
But you violated my human rights
and the terms of the contract!

570
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,750
I find it very rude and unpleasant!

571
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:55,653
I said I'm sorry.
You saw the situation.

572
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,856
Why? Why should I marry you?

573
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,125
-I don't want to marry you either!
-Exactly!

574
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,431
My father wants to marry me off
to a family for business!

575
00:46:04,516 --> 00:46:07,131
And why do you use me
to make an excuse?

576
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,735
Think how offended my mom
would feel if she found out.

577
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,638
-Hello?
-Are you doing well?

578
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:16,040
Mom, don't worry.

579
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,642
Mr. An would never do that.

580
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:20,280
-Knock him out.
-Nothing happened.

581
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,047
-Don't worry.
-Something should happen.

582
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,449
-Get him drunk.
-Don't worry, Mom.

583
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,251
Of course I'm worried.

584
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,266
You must knock him out
on the bedding I gave you.

585
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:32,256
What, Mom?

586
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,059
You don't want me to cause
any inconvenience for him,

587
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,695
so I should use that bedding?

588
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:42,700
Yes, Mom. I'll handle it.
Don't worry. Bye!

589
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:51,809
-My mom is a little worried.
-Your mom is so protective.

590
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:54,412
I don't think she should be.

591
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,816
What is she talking about?
She's babbling nonsense.

592
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,836
Wake up! We'll start
the special training today.

593
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,338
You must first build up
your physical strength.

594
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:21,872
Wake up.

595
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:40,358
Go!

596
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:15,393
What do I do? Go down? Go up?

597
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,570
Hey, wait! Bongsoon!

598
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:33,379
Why do you keep going?

599
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:37,381
-You said to go.
-I know, but... wow.

600
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,984
What exactly are you?

601
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,191
Oh, my! Wait for me!

602
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:52,672
Did you put that amulet
inside Bongsoon's bedding?

603
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:57,468
Yes. That amulet will fire
up the man's energy...

604
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,473
...and burn Bongsoon's neck.

605
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:03,974
-So they'll become one...
-They say he's gay.

606
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:06,877
Aren't you counting chickens
before they even hatch?

607
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,881
I don't think he's gay.
I trust in my intuition.

608
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,588
How do we get rid of the
redevelopment company?

609
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:18,140
I know. That man is so bothersome.

610
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,659
He looks like an underling
of Pigsy. He's so pushy.

611
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,944
What? He makes a good impression.

612
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:29,552
You always say that when you see
chubby men. I don't understand you.

613
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,070
You know I like the macho style.

614
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,473
You're so funny.

615
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:39,777
I think Gukdoo's dad
is the most handsome.

616
00:49:39,879 --> 00:49:41,078
-Oh, my goodness!
-That's right.

617
00:49:41,463 --> 00:49:44,466
Come on! He looks like
an underling of a bandit.

618
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,383
-My husband is better!
-To Jinyi,

619
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,185
everyone's an underling to her.

620
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:53,090
Gukdoo's dad is better
than his mom, at least.

621
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,492
What?

622
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:58,996
She made a lot of money
with her new novel.

623
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,198
-Right, right.
-What was the title?

624
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:04,006
-"Hormones at Home?"
-"Hormones in the Attic?"

625
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:05,803
"Hormones in the Room."

626
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,607
It's about the loneliness
modern people feel.

627
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,710
We humans are a ball of hormones.

628
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,714
And that ball gets locked in
the house created by civilization...

629
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:20,017
...creating all kinds of disharmony,

630
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,220
which in turn creates
the pathologies in society.

631
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:27,076
How can you come up
with such a great idea?

632
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,562
"That discord and...",
all I can say is you're great!

633
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:40,738
They also must be struggling
with their lonely hormones.

634
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:44,141
-The pie, please.
-Oh, right!

635
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,643
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Thank you. Bye.

636
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,848
We'd like to order!

637
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,149
Yes, sir.

638
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,653
Acting bossy.

639
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,256
-Go and check.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,230
We created this sketch based
on the testimony of the witness.

641
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,148
I don't think the mask is
made in Korea.

642
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,265
We're checking all similar masks.

643
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,067
-The shoe?
-Yes.

644
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:12,937
It's this shoe.

645
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,640
A 295 mm size is very rare.

646
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:19,743
We're checking on the store
and date that it was sold.

647
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,375
-What's this?
-A returned sample.

648
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:24,538
-Did you check all the footage?
-Did you?

649
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:27,272
Not yet!
My eyes are getting sore.

650
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:32,333
Where's Gukdoo this time? Jeez, this brat.

651
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,797
He's been dumped, right?

652
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,666
-How did you know?
-That's the power of analog.

653
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,139
I like "Chief Investigator"
because it has that analog feel.

654
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,973
I love that sentimental feeling.

655
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,676
One day, Choi Boram looks
at the bad guys and says,

656
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,383
"Can you eat after you killed someone?"

657
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,083
"You shouldn't be able to eat
if you really were human!"

658
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:04,989
-Amazing lines, right?
-What do you mean?

659
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:07,891
He's trying to see the human
side of the murderer.

660
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:10,497
Why would a murderer skip his meal?

661
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,199
You're not getting it.

662
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,598
What does that have to do
with Gukdoo getting dumped?

663
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,500
Go to the shoe store!

664
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,302
Hello?

665
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:20,804
-In Gukdoo!
-Yes.

666
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:23,007
Did you get Do Bongsoon's testimony?

667
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:24,508
She's on her way here.

668
00:52:24,897 --> 00:52:27,611
I heard Kyungsim's voice
so I approached her...

669
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:34,518
...and that man was holding an iron pipe,
trying to hit Kyungsim.

670
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,395
You must have felt terrified.
So he was wearing a mask?

671
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,127
Yes.

672
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,031
It covered his whole face...

673
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,735
...but I saw his eyes.

674
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,540
Did you meet his eyes?

675
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,910
He turned back and I met his eyes.

676
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,213
It was scary.

677
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,789
And he ran away as soon as he saw you?

678
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:09,586
What?

679
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,288
Yes.

680
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:13,794
I screamed really loud.

681
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:16,396
He ran away just because
you started screaming?

682
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:21,498
What? I screamed as loud as I could.

683
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,701
I screamed, "Help!"

684
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:28,772
I made the loudest noise I could.

685
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:34,878
But you know what?

686
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,382
He smelled really weird.

687
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,883
He smelled?

688
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:42,986
Yes, he smelled...

689
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,056
...like the smell of oil.

690
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,358
-What kind of oil?
-Well...

691
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:54,064
It smelled like gas, but it's not
the smell you get in gas stations.

692
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:57,668
I think I smelled it somewhere before.

693
00:53:58,172 --> 00:53:59,970
But where?

694
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:06,243
Right! It's the smell of asphalt.

695
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,646
-Asphalt?
-Yes.

696
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,821
Thanks for your help, Bongsoon.

697
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:23,427
Gukdoo, are you okay? You don't look good.

698
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,629
Heeji...

699
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,902
Started to have feelings
for another person.

700
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:35,706
She's a bad girl.

701
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:41,678
But weirdly, I don't feel sad.

702
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,782
Yes, I know how that feels.

703
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,985
First, it doesn't feel real.

704
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,789
But it starts to hurt as time goes by.

705
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:57,897
Don't worry, Gukdoo. She's just wavering.

706
00:54:58,198 --> 00:54:59,897
It will pass.

707
00:55:12,264 --> 00:55:13,177
Why...

708
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,213
... are we friends?

709
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:36,333
Don't forget to lock your door
while you stay with your boss.

710
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:39,430
Your boss is not gay. Wake up.

711
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:43,207
You're busy. Go back to work.

712
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:45,409
-I have to go.
-Take care.

713
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,513
You know what to do if anything happens.

714
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,215
Don't make me laugh.

715
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,288
I don't like the police generally,

716
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,791
but I especially dislike this one.

717
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,332
Hello.
Let me help you get home safely.

718
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,334
-Can I walk you home?
-No!

719
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,735
Where are you headed off to?

720
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,738
-We can...
-We can walk you home!

721
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,808
My daughter was terrified.

722
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,612
They're making things feel even worse.

723
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,114
Can we ask them to stop?

724
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,516
They won't listen to us.

725
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,719
Okay, I'll talk to them.

726
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,921
They're outside right now.

727
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:34,224
If they weren't in those vests,
they would look like criminals.

728
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:38,028
What's taking her so long?

729
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,931
Hey!

730
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:47,237
We need more signatures,
but there's nobody outside.

731
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,541
Trash, trash.

732
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,243
How many did you get?

733
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:57,748
Don't spit your chewing gum!
We're cleaning here!

734
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,650
Who the heck are you?

735
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,852
You can't spit chewing gum.

736
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,154
Will you remove it?
You have no conscience!

737
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,757
You rude little brats.

738
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,660
-Eyes down!
-Hey, hey.

739
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,230
-Hey, you scared me!
-Hey.

740
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:17,334
Do you have two lives?
Why are you so daring?

741
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:21,805
What? And who the heck are you?

742
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,007
Watch your language.

743
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:27,314
Don't mess with us.

744
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:32,082
If Sis finds out, you're dead.

745
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,384
Let's go!

746
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,186
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

747
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,626
Those brats. Go!

748
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:43,460
Goodness.

749
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:46,563
What did they say?

750
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,298
That we're dead if their Sis finds out.

751
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,470
Oh, Miss! Miss!

752
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:54,905
Wait! We're not bad people.
We're here to protect you.

753
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,077
I need signatures
to fill my quota.

754
00:57:57,177 --> 00:58:00,410
I'll walk you home.
Just sign here.

755
00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:03,413
-No, wait!
-Let go of me!

756
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,185
-I'll protect you.
-Help me!

757
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:07,718
I'll take you home.
All I need is your signature.

758
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,220
-Let her go.
-All I need is...

759
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,892
Just a signature.

760
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,524
-Hey, wait.
-What are you doing?

761
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:20,030
Who are you granny?

762
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:28,005
Geez.

763
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,598
Oh, my back.

764
00:59:06,215 --> 00:59:09,245
Welcome. Are you feeling better
from your headache?

765
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,272
No, I still have it.

766
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:14,171
-A painkiller and this.
-Okay.

767
00:59:18,408 --> 00:59:20,494
You're still under treatment.

768
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,388
It's not good to take
sleeping pills for too long.

769
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:25,305
I can't sleep.

770
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:29,012
Would you like to come
to church with me?

771
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:30,397
To church?

772
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:33,592
Yes, my insomnia got better
after I started going to church.

773
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:36,373
-You find peace.
-I can try.

774
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:39,466
It's been 20 days since I've been
going to early morning prayers.

775
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:41,177
Tomorrow is the last day.

776
00:59:41,264 --> 00:59:43,632
Daniel prayed for 21 days.

777
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:45,927
The neighborhood got dangerous recently.

778
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:49,046
It'll be dangerous at dawn.

779
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:51,446
The Lord protects us.

780
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:54,819
-How much is it?
-That will be four thousand won.

781
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:57,009
"Dobong Walnuts"

782
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,610
Why isn't she here yet?

783
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:05,085
Maybe she's home already.

784
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:07,207
No, she said she would come to the shop.

785
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:08,593
Then make a call.

786
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:14,234
Mom!

787
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:18,572
Mom! Oh, Mom!

788
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,582
Why did you get so weak?

789
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:26,287
-Hello, Mother.
-Hi. How have you been?

790
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:33,745
You're as weak as someone
who has been starving for days.

791
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:37,807
I missed you, Mom!

792
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:42,699
I heard there's been many
incidents in the neighborhood.

793
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:46,995
I found some human trash
on my way here.

794
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:53,419
I did some cleaning up, so call the
police and tell them to finish cleaning.

795
01:01:11,889 --> 01:01:13,494
Darn it!

796
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,352
Please, don't come!

797
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:26,635
Please, don't come!

798
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,210
Aren't you lonely?

799
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:40,099
You're doing this
because you're lonely.

800
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:43,312
Wait just a bit more.

801
01:01:44,259 --> 01:01:46,165
I'll bring new friends soon.

802
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:49,756
Please, let me go home.

803
01:01:51,262 --> 01:01:53,925
Home? This is your home.

804
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:29,581
Don't forget to lock your door
while you stay with your boss.

805
01:02:29,681 --> 01:02:32,764
Mr. An is not gay. Wake up.

806
01:03:34,574 --> 01:03:35,781
Baek Tak.

807
01:04:56,802 --> 01:04:58,098
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

808
01:04:58,214 --> 01:05:00,600
What do I do now?
Who do I trust?

809
01:05:00,705 --> 01:05:02,503
He doesn't want to hurt his brother.

810
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:04,677
We can go about here and
there like crazy people.

811
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:08,707
Promise me you won't cry
and feel sad alone. Promise?

812
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:12,807
Beaten up by a tiny girl?
And now what? A granny?

813
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:14,693
I'll escort you, sir.

814
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:18,418
You never do anything right
and always get in trouble.

815
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:20,819
Why do you hate me so much?

816
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,215
My heart hurts 10, 20 times more.

817
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:25,654
I'm on your side. I'll help you.

818
01:05:26,273 --> 01:05:27,557
In secret.

819
01:05:28,454 --> 01:05:31,064
Your strength and us.

820
01:05:31,164 --> 01:05:33,056
The bus reminds me of someone.

821
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:36,731
An angel my mom sent to me from heaven.

822
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:41,976
That day, he came one step closer to me.
