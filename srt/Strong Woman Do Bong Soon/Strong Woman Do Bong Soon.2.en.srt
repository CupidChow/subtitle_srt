1
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,185
It's the 300th episode special.

2
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,425
That episode was a legend.

3
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,112
-It's Kim Hyeja.
-Black noodles again?

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,701
-Wow. She looks so young.
-Detective Kim.

5
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:32,069
What are they watching?

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,107
"Chief Investigator".

7
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,311
It's the first crime drama series.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,678
It's a ritual Chief does.

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,868
Whenever we have a big case,
he watches one episode...

10
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,509
...and the case gets solved.

11
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,416
-It's not our case.
-We were told to cooperate.

12
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,225
There are CSI, The Mentalist,
Criminal Minds and what not...

13
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,459
... but you watch that?

14
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,365
Was it really released
after the Korean War?

15
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:52,287
Hey!

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,345
Do you know that criminals
never miss one of those episodes?

17
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,168
That's why you should
watch the American ones.

18
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:00,650
You really know nothing, do you? Listen.

19
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,524
There's a trend in crime.

20
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:10,245
There's this orthodox energy that flows
with the energy of the universe.

21
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,478
How do I put it?
Hey, how do we explain this?

22
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,518
Anyway, something like that.

23
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,536
But you can't investigate based on that.

24
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,445
Because there will be more and more crimes
where you can't find solid evidence.

25
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:25,368
Then on what do we rely on?

26
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,363
We rely on intuition!

27
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:29,779
We return to the analog.

28
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:34,528
You brat.

29
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:37,804
Do you know what's the best-selling
book in the history of mankind?

30
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:40,060
-The Bible!
-That's right! The Bible!

31
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,897
What's the reason?

32
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:43,567
-Originality!
-Exactly. Originality.

33
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:48,151
Classics.
The answers are all in there.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,991
You really know nothing.

35
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:51,575
Right?

36
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,879
Let's eat. You didn't have
breakfast, did you?

37
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,055
I did.

38
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:00,980
Really?

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,389
Eat again, then.

40
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm not hungry.

41
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,521
I only come to work 
on Mondays and Thursdays.

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,834
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

43
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,846
And that info has been leaked.

44
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,152
I have something to say to you.
So from now on...

45
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,207
...I think only you and I
should know my schedule.

46
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,488
-What are you doing? Sit.
-Oh, right.

47
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,146
I've been followed
and blackmailed recently.

48
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,566
-By who?
-I don't know.

49
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,802
-I'd have caught him if I knew.
-Then report it to the police.

50
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,793
I don't like the police.
I don't trust them.

51
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,461
I will catch him.

52
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,496
-I need your help.
-What?

53
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,746
You said you like games.

54
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,338
What's wrong? It's exciting.

55
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,152
Let's catch him like in the games.

56
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,308
It'll be fun.

57
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:56,647
You want to develop a game, right?
You should do it.

58
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,151
We'll win anyway.

59
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,364
Are you kidding me?

60
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:03,057
Life is a game and game is life.

61
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,655
Don't be so serious.

62
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,837
Do you have many people
that bear grudges against you?

63
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:11,311
Does a game character become stronger
because it has many enemies?

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,800
The world is filled with bad people
so you need to increase your defense.

65
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,312
Why do you dislike the police?

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,134
-Do you like them?
-Yes.

67
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:19,850
They're cool.

68
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,782
Why aren't you eating? Eat.

69
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,152
You can't choose to not eat.
I'm the boss and I give the orders.

70
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,613
I don't eat lunch. I have one meal a day.

71
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,302
You should have told me that earlier.

72
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,453
"Unknown Caller"

73
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,464
You'd better not ignore my warnings.
Look forward to what's coming.

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,033
When did you start to get these calls?

75
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,235
A couple of months ago.

76
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,394
Protect me. That's your job.

77
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,027
Mr. Kong has my schedule.
You can ask him tomorrow.

78
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:03,076
Yes.

79
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,469
I'm not going to play around today.
I'm upset so I don't feel like working.

80
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,723
I don't want to work.
Why do you look at me like that?

81
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,918
No, I've heard something before.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,057
Heard what?

83
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:21,834
That you only work twice a week
and sometimes even less.

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,834
See? I'm so popular that
I get too much attention.

85
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,181
It's so tiring.

86
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:35,842
I'll hang around the riverside,
the mall, and the bookstore today.

87
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,028
What?

88
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,345
Do I have to escort you everywhere?

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,112
Of course. Do you even have to ask?

90
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:47,852
Let's go.

91
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,013
Start the car.

92
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,969
-Me?
-Just in case. There could be a bomb.

93
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,678
You want me to die, then?

94
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:07,912
Then should I die?

95
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,044
You're my bodyguard. Wake up!

96
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,268
Start the car.

97
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:41,044
She starts the car and baam!

98
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,535
Do it.

99
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:51,535
Done.

100
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:53,486
Good job!

101
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:05,830
Hey!

102
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,282
Think this is a taxi?

103
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:10,229
Sit in the front seat!

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,676
Jerk.

105
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,073
Shouldn't I drive?

106
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:35,867
You don't understand the concept
of prioritizing your client's safety.

107
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:40,098
If I let you drive and a car rushes in,
which way would you steer the wheel?

108
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,392
"Dobong Walnut"

109
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:50,179
I don't want to imagine how
her mother is feeling right now.

110
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:52,613
She took care of her all these years.
Nothing can make her feel better.

111
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:57,216
I've complained many times to the borough
to do something about that intersection.

112
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,669
-We had a similar incident last year.
-Right.

113
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,021
Hosoon, bring us some hot water!

114
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,671
But I'm against the commercial complex.

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,279
If they build that high-rise building,
we won't be able to see the sunlight.

116
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,777
-We'll lose all the sunlight!
-You're right.

117
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,701
Isn't that better than
becoming a crime-prone area?

118
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,157
Crime-prone area? Where?

119
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:18,814
-It's Mihwa.
-Hello!

120
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,146
Hello, hello.

121
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,780
-I'm picking up what I ordered.
-Right, right.

122
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:25,346
She has that beauty pageant smile
even when there's been a murder.

123
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,403
I know.

124
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:30,684
The dead girl won't return to life
even if she gets angry, right?

125
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,073
You're right.

126
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,201
Excuse me, Mihwa!

127
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,068
Hi, Jinyi.

128
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,973
Can I talk to you for a moment?

129
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,030
Yes.

130
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,535
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

131
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,542
We started a signature campaign...

132
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,574
...to vote for or against redevelopment
of the area next to the laundry shop.

133
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:58,246
We're asking
all the block leaders to sign.

134
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:02,320
If someone important like you signs,

135
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,105
the borough will listen, don't you think?

136
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,601
Right.

137
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,521
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,218
I support the redevelopment...

139
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,427
...but I also understand those
that are against it.

140
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:15,746
I haven't decided yet.

141
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:19,461
That spot is perfect for
a four-storied building!

142
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,625
I'm just against the commercial complex
which will be built right there. Yes.

143
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:29,034
Those who do have a say
all live near the area...

144
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:32,225
...so the signature campaign
is fundamentally unfair, I think.

145
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,172
What do you mean unfair?

146
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:38,944
I think we should create a committee
of people without conflict of interest.

147
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:39,888
Excuse me.

148
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,780
-Here's your order.
-Oh, thanks.

149
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,629
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

150
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,574
Bye.

151
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:46,726
Bye.

152
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,668
Seriously?

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,869
You...

154
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,023
-She just doesn't get along with me.
-I know.

155
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:57,954
-Did you see?
-Yes.

156
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,612
She does all the talking and leaves.

157
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,705
She's just showing since she's a writer.

158
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:04,115
Acting superior because she's educated.

159
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:07,533
I can't stand her. She's such a snob!

160
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:09,856
-Seriously.
-Auntie!

161
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:11,834
Hello.

162
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,731
-Kyungsim!
-Auntie!

163
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,455
My goodness!

164
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,659
-Act natural.
-What?

165
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,760
-Someone is watching us from somewhere.
-Who?

166
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,302
Don't let people notice
you're my bodyguard.

167
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,734
Oh, okay.

168
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,303
But holding hands is weird.

169
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:33,906
It doesn't look natural.

170
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,856
-Stop talking and follow me.
-Okay.

171
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:43,369
Here.

172
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,560
How much is it?

173
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:02,435
I can't believe the money I spent in
the internet cafes is spent on his suits.

174
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:05,091
Hey.

175
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,658
-Yes, sir.
-How do I look?

176
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:09,842
You look cool.

177
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:16,986
I only bought something for myself.

178
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:19,806
Let's go back. I'll buy you something.

179
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:23,623
-No, that's fine.
-Don't refuse. You can accept it.

180
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,838
No, I'm really fine. You don't have to.

181
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,818
What do you want?

182
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,482
No...

183
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,751
You don't want it?

184
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,480
Let's go.

185
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,368
Wow!

186
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,216
Try to make it swirl.

187
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,573
Wow! Whoa!

188
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:06,895
It's so amazing.

189
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,662
-Hey.
-Yes?

190
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,311
Look to your 12 o'clock direction
without looking so obvious.

191
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,238
12 o'clock?

192
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,045
-Right in front of us.
-Oh.

193
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,600
-Did you see him?
-Yes, yes.

194
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,502
He's looking at us right now.

195
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:20,676
-Let's catch him.
-Now?

196
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,566
No. Can you act natural?
So that nobody notices.

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,720
He's running away. He's running away!

198
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,527
He's so fast. Shouldn't we go after him?

199
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,016
I am after him right now.

200
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,202
Faster!

201
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,300
Oh, it's filming.

202
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:47,967
Wow!

203
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,935
-Did you get something?
-I did. His number plate.

204
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,011
That's great.

205
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,923
Are you hungry?

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,412
Well, yes...

207
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,634
Go home and eat.

208
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:58,585
You...

209
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,301
Don't go on a diet.

210
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,800
Just eat anything you want.
Like really anything.

211
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:07,513
You have more scheduled.
But can I go home?

212
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,073
Yes, because he's gone, too.

213
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,229
He got caught.

214
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,202
What about Mr. Kong's tailbone?

215
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,937
It won't heal so fast.

216
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:24,167
I'm thinking about visiting him.
I can ask him for your schedule.

217
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:30,398
He'll be embarrassed and mad to see you.

218
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:33,458
-You wanted me to visit him.
-Yeah, you can visit him.

219
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,798
What do you want me to do?

220
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,448
You live near the crime scene.

221
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,462
-Did you know that?
-Yes.

222
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,187
Why does someone living in
a nice area do something so bad?

223
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:51,514
Gosh, I'm hungry.

224
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,289
Is there a good bakery here?

225
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,872
-Do you like pastries?
-I love them!

226
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,959
There's a walnut pie shop
if you turn into that alley.

227
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,022
Sounds great.

228
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,335
"Dobong Walnut"

229
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,078
People won't pass by here.

230
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,329
We don't have any customers.

231
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,735
Then sell the cracked walnuts
on discount sale.

232
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,077
-Hosoon.
-Yes?

233
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,646
Post "Cracked walnuts
on discount sale" on the window.

234
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:24,568
Okay.

235
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,945
Did you get any signatures?

236
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,434
It's not easy.

237
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,667
I heard Bongsoon got a job.

238
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,146
-You have to wait and see.
-Why?

239
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:38,328
The fortune-teller said she has itchy feet
and can't stay in one place too long.

240
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,944
But your son turned out so good.

241
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,773
He's in Hansei University medical school,
and he's so handsome, too.

242
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:49,765
That's why Gukdoo and Bonggi were
rivals since they were together in school.

243
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:52,301
Both are handsome and did well at school.

244
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,469
My concern is Bongsoon.

245
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,268
Wish she would find a rich crazy guy.

246
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,443
There's none like that.

247
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:00,743
Isn't that Bongsoon?

248
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,434
-Hello!
-Hell...

249
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:13,678
Two egg tarts and one walnut pie, please.

250
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,668
Right away.

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,667
-Let's eat this, too.
-What?

252
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,315
-This cake.
-Ah.

253
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:25,167
Two pieces of cake, too.

254
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:27,461
Okay. Right away.

255
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:31,437
Hello.

256
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:48,702
Hi.

257
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,928
-Here it is.
-The receipt, please.

258
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,329
You'll need it.

259
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,382
-Here it is.
-Thanks.

260
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,601
-Enjoy!
-Thank you!

261
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:04,635
Bongsoon!

262
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:07,273
Bye.

263
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,978
Oh, my. Is he her boyfriend?

264
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,717
I hope so!

265
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:19,493
His build is great. Perfect.

266
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,135
He's lighting up the neighborhood.

267
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:25,396
Jinyi, she found a good catch!

268
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,679
Oh, my. Look at that.
They're getting in his car!

269
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,767
And it's a luxury car. He must be rich.

270
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,279
He's glowing in the vibe of a rich guy.

271
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,901
My goodness! Buddha, hallelujah, amen!

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,344
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

273
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,945
-Two, two, three, four, five, six...
-Kyungsim!

274
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,767
Bongsoon!

275
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,312
Sorry. Sorry.

276
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,822
I'm so happy to see you!
How have you been?

277
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,454
-How have you been?
-Good!

278
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:57,885
So you got a job as the bodyguard
for the CEO of Ainsoft?

279
00:15:57,974 --> 00:15:58,917
I did.

280
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:01,018
-"The Chronicles of Albertan?"
-Yeah.

281
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:04,087
You finally decided to use your talent.

282
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:05,688
Good thinking.

283
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:10,679
My goal is developing my game project,
"The Super Girl Bongsoon."

284
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,427
And getting a permanent job there
as a developer.

285
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,251
That's my goal!

286
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,360
But is your boss nice to you?

287
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,534
It says he loves clothes
and he's a game geek.

288
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,545
He's not interested in women
and he's really handsome.

289
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:31,502
Don't even start. He's the jerk type.
He's a man and he loves shopping.

290
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,955
So there's no smoke without fire.

291
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,951
That's why he hired a female bodyguard.
To prevent any scandals with men.

292
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,312
I'm telling you.

293
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,301
Handsome men with great style
and no women, definitely are.

294
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,134
It's getting wrinkly.

295
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,413
Kyungsim? Hi.

296
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:48,973
-Hi, Bonggi.
-Did you bring it?

297
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:51,452
-Of course!
-Awesome!

298
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:53,779
Hey.

299
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,893
My goodness!

300
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,033
Hey, listen.

301
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:01,095
There's a very nice
and funny back up catcher I know.

302
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:02,879
-Do you want to meet him?
-No.

303
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,779
I told him a lot of good things about you.

304
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,289
There's nothing good about me.

305
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,191
Bongsoon! You're really pretty.

306
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,568
Have confidence in yourself.

307
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,575
What good is it to be pretty
if Gukdoo won't even look at me.

308
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,234
You're still in love with him?

309
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,757
Aren't you tired of him?

310
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,647
I can't seem to lose interest in him.

311
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,373
It's because you don't let it go.

312
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,534
-Did you prepare the rice?
-Mom, it's still too early.

313
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:28,690
I'm hungry. Get up and cook.

314
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,518
I'll help her.

315
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:33,713
I bought three packs of
the Busan fish cakes that Bonggi likes.

316
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,747
Thanks, Kyungsim.
I have no one else but you.

317
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,690
Get up now!

318
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:42,717
Wow! You brought a lot!

319
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:43,717
No, just a little.

320
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,446
Kyungsim, you're always so generous.

321
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:47,813
Been so long since I had them.

322
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,635
Here it comes!

323
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,592
It looks so good.

324
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,029
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

325
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,871
-Enjoy.
-Eat up.

326
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,991
Is the guy you came to
the store with your new boss?

327
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,479
-Yes.
-How old is he?

328
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,411
I don't know.

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,801
He's super young.

330
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,868
He gave you a ride home
on your first day of work?

331
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:08,858
Yes.

332
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,567
You should marry him.

333
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,984
Mom!

334
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:17,701
He's the winning number sent from heaven.

335
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,733
-You should stop watching dramas!
-Is he single?

336
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,667
He's gay.

337
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,042
Gay? So he likes men?

338
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,032
Yes, Auntie.

339
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,622
It's okay.

340
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,955
Rich and flawless guys
don't exist anymore.

341
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,037
It's okay. It's okay.

342
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,142
It's okay!

343
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:49,842
Gosh, it's hot!

344
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:51,553
Mom!

345
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,588
"Dobong Station > Banghak Street
> Express Bus Terminal"

346
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,821
Yes, call forensics. We're on our way!

347
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,836
-There again?
-What on earth is going on?

348
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,712
Okay, got it.

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,399
Sir, they're taking the victim
to Hansei University Hospital.

350
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:59,208
Hey, Spectacles stay here
and the rest come with me.

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,890
-Where to?
-Where to? To the hospital!

352
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:05,765
Yes, we're on our way.
We'll go to Hansei University Hospital.

353
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,340
Hey, it's now! Do it!
Attack! Come on, quickly!

354
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,745
-No!
-Game over.

355
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,045
-What are you doing?
-It's bad timing.

356
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,781
You're not good at games.
You shouldn't play. Darn!

357
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:28,320
They tried to kill another woman!
It's getting so scary.

358
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,987
How scary.

359
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,112
She died? She died.

360
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,795
What the heck are you doing?

361
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,384
Everyone, you're disturbing
the investigation.

362
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,579
Please, return to your homes.

363
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,746
-Go home.
-My goodness.

364
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:45,867
-Go home.
-Go home, ma'am.

365
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,579
Someone saw her just in time
and she didn't die.

366
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,112
-That's a relief, really.
-Tell me about it.

367
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,467
Let's go home quickly.

368
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:09,785
We have breaking news.

369
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,513
Tonight at 11 PM, 23 hours
after the murder in Dobong-dong...

370
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,535
...a similar incident
occurred in the same area.

371
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:23,179
What is shocking is that
the crime scene was also destroyed.

372
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,850
The victim this time is Ms. Kim
and she is a high school teacher.

373
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:29,919
Fortunately, a witness
appeared and saved her life.

374
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,944
How is she?

375
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,255
We'd have lost her
if she came a little later.

376
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:38,679
We need to watch her
for a couple more days.

377
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,800
But her ribs were fractured
so she's having a hard time breathing.

378
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,628
I can't give a final diagnosis.

379
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:51,136
Forensics already took photos
of the footprints.

380
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:57,445
He came minutes after
I had left the crime scene.

381
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:58,816
You came alone?

382
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,946
Don't you know about teamwork?

383
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,146
It's not like that.

384
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,354
I live around here.

385
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,020
I was on my way home to get changed.

386
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:13,792
No CCTV cameras or dash cams.

387
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,420
He knows the neighborhood.

388
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm sure.

389
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,221
The victim barely survived
thanks to the witness.

390
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:24,435
He ran away when someone showed up.

391
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,247
You must be very surprised.

392
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:32,305
-I was.
-Tell us what exactly happened.

393
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,534
I was on my way home.

394
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,768
But around the left alley...

395
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:37,836
Don't kill me!

396
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,925
I heard someone scream, "Don't kill me."

397
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:41,968
So, I went there.

398
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,269
Don't kill me!

399
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,521
-And then?
-Don't kill me!

400
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,451
Since I went closer...

401
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:50,697
...I saw him trampling the girl down
and he ran away when he saw me.

402
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,734
What did he look like?

403
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,324
He was wearing a black hoodie, I think.

404
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,504
Yes, and black pants.

405
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:08,607
He was about 180 cm tall.

406
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,234
-His face?
-I couldn't see his face.

407
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:14,953
Anything in particular that you remember?

408
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,285
Yes, his feet.

409
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:20,712
He had big feet.

410
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,368
He has big feet...

411
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,377
-It must have been so terrifying.
-I know.

412
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:49,820
You know what?

413
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:55,602
I think people that harass those
who are weaker are the worst.

414
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:56,539
Me too.

415
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,803
He's the worst.

416
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:01,777
How can he do that to a woman?

417
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:04,331
He deserves to be punished badly.

418
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,379
Bongsoon.

419
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,469
I think you should teach him a lesson.

420
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:09,775
That will do.

421
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:10,976
Hey.

422
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,412
Who am I to give anyone a lesson?
I can't even manage my own life.

423
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:15,801
Do you have a younger sister?

424
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,669
Go with him. Couple.

425
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:24,846
Guys that bully others in groups
are so bad.

426
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,872
-The fashion king.
-I think so.

427
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,646
-She's pretty.
-She's cute.

428
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:29,750
She's cute.

429
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:32,463
What?

430
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,004
If you don't have money...

431
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,714
Hey kids!

432
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,236
Yes. Hi.

433
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,682
There's been a lot of incidents here
so the police are patrolling more often.

434
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,277
I suggest you go home early.

435
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:48,139
You go home early.
It's none of your business.

436
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,812
Then let your friend
standing alone go home.

437
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,846
What the heck?

438
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,322
-Go home if you're drunk.
-Hey.

439
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,301
Hey, who's the leader here?

440
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,887
Who's the leader?

441
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:15,574
Have you lost your mind?

442
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:18,498
Get lost.

443
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,045
Jeez.

444
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,846
Excuse me, kids.

445
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,589
Apologize to her and go home.

446
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:29,724
Is the president backing you?
Why are you so daring?

447
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:31,523
Do you have 18 lives?

448
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:39,301
Jeez. You were so busy doing bad stuff
that your shoelaces got untied.

449
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,734
That wasn't enough, was it?

450
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:58,801
Should I do this to your shoes, too?
Do you want to go home with bare feet?

451
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,021
You come here. Come on.
Give me your phone.

452
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
This is my number.

453
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,167
-Call me if they bully you again, okay?
-Okay.

454
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:14,012
And go to college.

455
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,139
I've tried. Without college,
life gets a little too hard.

456
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,063
-You.
-Yes.

457
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,707
If I see you one more time...

458
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,928
...first your feet,
then your legs, and then...

459
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,202
Guess where?

460
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,863
Let's go. Give him his bag.

461
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,368
I'll take you home.

462
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,050
And now the next story.

463
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:59,513
After the murder and kidnapping in
Dobong-dong that occurred recently...

464
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:03,446
...the police decided to install
more CCTV cameras in the area...

465
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:07,421
...and patrol more frequently
to reinforce anti-crime measures.

466
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:11,162
The police are after the suspect
of the murder in Dobong-dong...

467
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,945
...and announced it's been difficult to
identify a suspect for lack of evidence...

468
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,710
...which is causing more discomfort
in the neighborhood.

469
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,467
448...

470
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,745
Yes, I need you to check a number plate.

471
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:36,311
Sir, we have the result of the autopsy
of the first victim, Jung Hyangsook.

472
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,926
Really? Let me see that.

473
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,379
Let's see...

474
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:44,339
She was 172 cm tall and weighed 48 kg.

475
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:47,678
Wow, she was a very skinny girl.

476
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,232
Her hand was stabbed eight times.

477
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,399
She resisted until the end.

478
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,834
He first hit her stomach.

479
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,920
Stomach rupture due to external force.
Then he strangled her.

480
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:01,334
She must have resisted a lot
because he beat her face.

481
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:04,312
Then he must have dropped
the knife he had in his hand.

482
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,901
So he held the knife incorrectly.

483
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,451
That's why he stabbed her stomach
with the blade looking upward.

484
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,632
He had already decided to kill her.

485
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:16,109
But the blade was wrongly positioned
so it didn't go through as planned.

486
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,105
Then he tried to change
the direction of the knife,

487
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,194
while it was still stabbed into her.

488
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:23,561
That's why she only has
a wound on her stomach.

489
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,232
He's not good at using knives.

490
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:29,169
I don't think the second victim
was attacked by the same offender.

491
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:32,921
-He didn't use a knife this time.
-Right.

492
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,477
You can't say for sure.

493
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,256
The first offender didn't use a knife
from the beginning.

494
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:42,378
The second offender might have missed
the timing because a witness appeared.

495
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,548
I don't think so.

496
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:48,103
Since he's not good with knives,
he might have tried to just punch her.

497
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:52,937
Okay. I think we need to take a break.
Let's rest for a bit.

498
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,634
Lieutenant In, you go to the hospital.

499
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:56,736
Okay.

500
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,510
He wanted to knock her down.

501
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,003
He didn't want to kill her.

502
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,596
Sorry.

503
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,545
Who is it?

504
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:23,274
Oh...

505
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,769
Hi, I'm Do Bongsoon.

506
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:29,119
-Why are you here?
-I need Mr. An's schedule.

507
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,308
Ask Ms. Kim on the PR Team!

508
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:34,612
I brought some flowers and this...

509
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:35,778
Gosh.

510
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,568
Yeah. What do I do?

511
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:39,824
Oh! I'll put it here.

512
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,968
-It hurts badly, right?
-Jeez!

513
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:48,901
You can't wear a plaster on the tailbone
so it takes a long time to heal.

514
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:51,901
You can't sit, you can't lie down.
It's the worst situation.

515
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,746
The ribs are also hard to heal...

516
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:57,635
-Do you have to say that now?
-Oh, right. Sorry.

517
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,268
There is one method
that helps the tailbone to heal fast.

518
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,754
It's called fecal wine.

519
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:05,022
Or poop wine.

520
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,845
It's literally wine made of poop.

521
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,364
It helps the bone heal fast.

522
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:13,045
Did you come to make me feel worse?
What? Poop wine?

523
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:17,900
Oh, no. My granny is
an expert in this field.

524
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,648
She hurt many people. Anyway!

525
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:24,850
Poop wine is the best cure for tailbones.
Better than modern medicine.

526
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:26,142
Disgusting.

527
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:29,235
Would you like me to make
this wine for you?

528
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,101
-Will you shut up?
-No! Don't get angry.

529
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,500
That will strain the sphincter
and you won't heal quickly.

530
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:39,146
-Get out of here right now.
-Okay. I'm leaving.

531
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,568
I'm really sorry.

532
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,635
If you need poop wine, I'll...

533
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,592
-Please leave!
-Okay. I'm sorry.

534
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:50,401
I'm really sorry. I'm leaving. Sorry.

535
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:56,629
It's always bossy people
that cause problems.

536
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:59,732
Why did he have to ask him
to have fight one-legged?

537
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,901
It's Gukdoo.

538
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,068
Hello?

539
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,139
-Gukdoo, it's me.
-I know.

540
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:47,746
-I'm looking at you.
-What?

541
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,729
I came to visit someone
in the hospital and I see you.

542
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,326
Oh, I see you, too.

543
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:57,322
I'll go to you.

544
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,206
-What are you doing here?
-Here?

545
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,634
I'm watching and protecting a victim.

546
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,235
Oh.

547
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,412
What are you doing here?

548
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,769
Someone I know got injured
so I came to visit him.

549
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,342
Who?

550
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:22,935
Well...

551
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:33,255
Anyway, he had a one-legged fight,
fell down, and hurt his tailbone.

552
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,277
What?

553
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,001
Tailbone...

554
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,895
How does he hurt his tailbone
having a one-legged fight?

555
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,823
-What?
-Did he fight against you?

556
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,232
No! Not against me.

557
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,915
Then why are you visiting him?

558
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,955
You should be working during the day.

559
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,068
Why are you here?

560
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:49,753
Gukdoo, I got a job.

561
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,068
I'm happy for you.

562
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:53,669
Bongsoon, do me a favor.

563
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,613
I need to go to the restroom.

564
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,263
-Can you stay here?
-Yes.

565
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:00,679
Call me right away if anyone else
other than a doctor or nurse approaches.

566
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:01,633
Got it?

567
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,893
See you.

568
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,971
"Patient: Kim Jiwon
Note" Intensive post-operative care"

569
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:23,483
-Excuse me.
-Oh, yes, yes.

570
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,467
Oh, no.

571
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,238
Call the detective.

572
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,588
It's an emergency. We have to
take her to the operation room.

573
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:36,810
Okay, I will.

574
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,820
Oh, Gukdoo.

575
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:59,953
It was an emergency and the doctor
took her to the operation room.

576
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,968
What?

577
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:03,361
He... Oh, there he is.

578
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,736
Where's the patient?

579
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,242
What? It started to beep
so you came in and took her.

580
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:12,245
What are you talking about?
I'm coming from the OR.

581
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:13,176
Oh?

582
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,165
He sounds different
from the doctor earlier.

583
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,045
When did he come for her?

584
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,233
About five minutes ago.

585
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,481
The suspect showed up!
Shut down the hospital!

586
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,369
He's trying to take the victim with him!

587
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:46,694
Show me the intensive care hall.

588
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,708
Okay.

589
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,867
Darn!

590
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:47,468
I'm sorry, Gukdoo.

591
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,031
It's my fault.

592
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:51,001
No, it's not your fault.

593
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,472
I shouldn't have left.

594
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:54,492
I'm sorry.

595
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,861
Do you think she'll be alright?

596
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,930
Oh no.

597
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:02,423
Don't worry. I don't think
he took her to kill her.

598
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,992
I'll find her no matter what.

599
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:06,704
I wish I could help you.

600
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,912
-Sorry.
-Call the detective.

601
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,504
It's an emergency. We have to
take her to the operation room.

602
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,015
Right! I heard his voice.

603
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,750
Do you remember his voice?
Do you think you'd recognize it?

604
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,768
Yes, I think I would.

605
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:25,220
I have to go back to the station.
You go home, okay?

606
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:30,718
Hey, take a taxi. I'll call you one.

607
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,901
Don't worry.

608
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:41,705
It's not your fault.

609
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:45,540
Okay, I won't. You should go.

610
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,782
What if they rebuke him
because he lost the criminal?

611
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,312
What? They can take disciplinary action!

612
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:40,014
The victim got kidnapped!

613
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:43,000
In a hospital where she was supposed
to be watched and protected!

614
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:44,910
It's my fault.

615
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:47,382
I'll take the blame on my own.

616
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,207
What the heck?

617
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:53,223
All we can do now is catch him.

618
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:56,174
I'll delay the disciplinary action.

619
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,527
Get the footage from
the cameras in the parking lot!

620
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,991
And track the number plate!

621
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,234
This guy is not easy.

622
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:06,985
He doesn't use knives,
he uses his brain.

623
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:11,278
How could he not leave a fingerprint
on the scene.

624
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:15,268
He's got some guts.
He dared to come there!

625
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,385
Chief.

626
00:42:16,924 --> 00:42:20,508
I need to request
protection of a witness.

627
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,225
-What?
-Do Bongsoon. A friend of mine.

628
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,217
He saw Bongsoon's face.

629
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:26,162
Bongsoon?

630
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:27,365
Do Bongsoon?

631
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,600
It sounds familiar.

632
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:31,886
That Avengers girl.

633
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,345
-She's in danger.
-She beat up seven thugs.

634
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,610
My friend, Bongsoon...

635
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,824
...is a feeble woman.

636
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:41,295
Goodness.

637
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:43,161
Gosh.

638
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,744
Do Bongsoon.

639
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:15,923
What are you doing here?

640
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:23,100
Will she be alright?

641
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,804
He won't kill her, will he?

642
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:30,174
He wouldn't have taken her
if he wanted to kill her, right?

643
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,304
She needs to be treated. I'm worried.

644
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:40,472
Being strong...

645
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,907
...doesn't help in this kind of situation.

646
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,651
Do you think...

647
00:43:50,287 --> 00:43:52,830
...there's any way I can help him?

648
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:55,461
Hey.

649
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,248
Hello.

650
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,204
What's this?

651
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,535
Why are there so many?

652
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:20,357
-What are you doing?
-Oh, hello.

653
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,558
The skull messenger
isn't popping up today.

654
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:34,345
Look at his hacking skills.

655
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:36,178
Very poor.

656
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:37,948
He's just an amateur.

657
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,874
I changed my password.

658
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:46,059
There was another incident
in your neighborhood.

659
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:47,624
She got kidnapped.

660
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:49,435
When I was in the hospital.

661
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,482
Kidnapped?

662
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,709
Ms. Kim, the teacher that was attacked...

663
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:59,390
...got kidnapped by a man disguised
as a doctor while she was hospitalized.

664
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:03,112
It's a bizarre and unprecedented case.

665
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,638
The police checked footage from dash cams
and CCTV cameras...

666
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:09,201
...and tracked the license plate
of the offender's car...

667
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,624
...but the car was unregistered...

668
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,808
This is amazing. It's so interesting!

669
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,100
What? Someone got kidnapped!

670
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,267
The kidnapper is very smart.

671
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:21,418
Of course, I hope they catch him.
They should catch him...

672
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:23,699
...but I don't think they will.

673
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,429
He'll outsmart the police.

674
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:28,220
Wow.

675
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,496
This is incredible.

676
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:31,297
Why did he kill one,

677
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,320
but let the other one live?

678
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,069
So you think it's the same offender?

679
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:37,191
Of course.

680
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,512
-The police don't think so.
-That's what the police thinks.

681
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,525
You have to approach it
from the kidnapper's perspective.

682
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:44,596
It's the same guy.

683
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,309
He destroyed the crime scene...

684
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:53,059
...because he wants to feel superior
to the murderer.

685
00:45:53,148 --> 00:45:57,479
You know, the profiler said that on TV.

686
00:45:57,568 --> 00:45:58,646
He's wrong.

687
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:00,158
The evidence was collected.

688
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:02,675
So why destroy the scene
when it'll soon be restored?

689
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:05,212
That's not what the murderer wants.

690
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,498
He wants to show how brutal,

691
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:09,834
and motiveless he can be.

692
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:11,159
He didn't kill her.

693
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:12,270
Why?

694
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,205
He never planned to kill her.

695
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:20,028
If he did, he would have stabbed
her throat or heart.

696
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:22,179
There was no evidence of rape.

697
00:46:22,544 --> 00:46:24,876
He threatened her with knife
because she resisted.

698
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,082
Since he's bad with knives,
he ended up killing her.

699
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:28,469
Killing her was a mistake.

700
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:32,164
How do you know so well
as if you were the criminal yourself?

701
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:34,855
My childhood dream was...

702
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,196
...to become a criminal.

703
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:41,600
What?

704
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,467
Is Mr. Kong still lying face down?
His tailbone was broken into three pieces.

705
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:47,803
You really are amazing.

706
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:52,270
Why did you have to ask him
to have that one-legged fight?

707
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:53,237
Hey!

708
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,590
Excuse me. Let me answer the phone.

709
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,573
Hello, Gukdoo.

710
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:08,245
An officer from headquarters
will stay with you, so don't worry.

711
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:09,627
Where are you?

712
00:47:09,968 --> 00:47:11,871
That's not necessary.
Don't worry about me.

713
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,049
What if something happens to you?

714
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:16,258
It's my official duty.
Just do as you're told.

715
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:17,710
Where are you? I'll send him to you.

716
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:18,645
Gukdoo.

717
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:22,638
I got a job in Ainsoft as a secretary.

718
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:23,607
Okay.

719
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:25,613
Do you stay all day in your office?

720
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:28,078
No, I go out here and there.

721
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,857
My boss is a very busy man.

722
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,911
I think she's complaining.

723
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,567
The officer's name is Choi Siwon.

724
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,442
Let me talk to him when you meet him.

725
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:37,685
Okay.

726
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,021
Gukdoo!

727
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:42,195
-Don't skip any meals.
-Okay, bye.

728
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:45,078
Who's that?

729
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:47,491
My friend who graduated from
the Police Academy with honors.

730
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,882
Oh, In Gukdoo?

731
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:49,975
How do you know?

732
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:52,155
Just now you said, "Gukdoo".

733
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,909
I didn't say he's In Gukdoo.

734
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:56,478
Don't you remember
where we met for the first time?

735
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,001
He's that police officer.

736
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,650
Your personality changes drastically
when you talk to him.

737
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:04,901
You're my boss, but he's my friend.

738
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,445
It's obviously different.

739
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:09,959
Do you realize you're nice to him
while you're rude to your boss?

740
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:13,301
No, I'm not.
I think you're just getting ideas.

741
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:15,926
You like that cop, right?

742
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:19,108
How did you know?

743
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:20,151
You're...

744
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:22,779
Just too obvious.

745
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:24,612
Everything about you is easy to tell.

746
00:48:26,813 --> 00:48:28,024
He's good-looking.

747
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:32,253
-Totally...
-Totally my type.

748
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:36,135
Men lose interest if you're too obvious.

749
00:48:36,234 --> 00:48:38,253
If I can tell, he can tell even better.

750
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,612
You said you don't like the police.

751
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,226
Just keep not liking them.

752
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:44,242
I like the good-looking ones.

753
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:45,947
Oh...

754
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,783
But...

755
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:52,263
I think an officer will stay with me.

756
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:54,172
Why?

757
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,175
So you mean you'll watch her closely
all day long?

758
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:12,049
-Yes.
-Why?

759
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:19,924
Bongsoon watches me and you watch her?
Is this some kind of multilevel marketing?

760
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,563
Officer, come here.

761
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:38,134
Come here.

762
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:42,181
She doesn't need your protection.

763
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,447
She's stronger, much stronger than you.

764
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,146
You don't believe me?
Then try arm wrestling with her.

765
00:49:51,234 --> 00:49:52,586
Or a one-legged fight.

766
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:54,858
I'm currently on duty.

767
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:56,257
Excuse me.

768
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,467
What the heck?

769
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,902
Mr. Kong's tailbone hasn't healed yet?

770
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,935
I told you it hasn't healed yet.

771
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:28,381
Yeah, it's been broken into three pieces.

772
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,161
Humans shouldn't have lost their tails.

773
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:33,540
He wouldn't be injured if he had a tail.

774
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:37,468
Like in the movie "Avatar."
They communicate with their tails.

775
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:41,011
We Koreans say, "Wagging your tail."

776
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:45,090
That's a universal expression.

777
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,711
Why? Avatars communicate with their tails.

778
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:54,354
So until when will you watch her?

779
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:57,625
As far as I know, I'll keep on
watching over her until I get orders.

780
00:50:57,714 --> 00:51:00,512
The first reason I don't like
the police is that they're too slow.

781
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:01,790
Second, they fuss around
after they're done.

782
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:04,746
Third, they do useless things.
Fourth...

783
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:07,665
They don't listen when they're advised.

784
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:10,868
On duty?

785
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:36,293
Good girl.

786
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,816
You're awake.
You have to wake up.

787
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:45,469
Do you know how hard
it was to bring you here alive?

788
00:51:46,972 --> 00:51:48,284
My first bride.

789
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,410
-Save me...
-What are you talking about?

790
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,495
You were dying and I saved you!

791
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:54,412
Save me!

792
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:56,103
Keep quiet.

793
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,155
Save me!

794
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:04,611
Save me!

795
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:09,345
Don't be scared.
A groom never hurts his bride.

796
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,844
Darn!

797
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:17,401
Smile. Smile!

798
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:28,935
There are only two reasons why...

799
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,510
...independent game developers
don't come up with a sequel.

800
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:38,812
First, independent game developers have
less human and financial resources.

801
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:41,449
Second, independent game developers...

802
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:45,559
...must put a lot of effort
into launching one game...

803
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,879
...so there's little chance
they'll develop a sequel.

804
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:51,785
They can't think about
a sequel from scratch.

805
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:55,723
The success or failure of a game
affects the survival of the company.

806
00:52:55,811 --> 00:53:00,136
So rather than distributing their human
and financial resources in sequels...

807
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:05,178
...they usually invest everything
in one game. That's how it's usually done.

808
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:08,770
To create a sustainable market
for independent games...

809
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:14,827
...we must attract more investment
to support the creativity of developers.

810
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:16,367
Thank you.

811
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:27,289
Officer, I'm really fine.
Can't you just stay here?

812
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:30,410
-I can't. I'm currently on duty.
-Gosh!

813
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:32,511
Where am I?

814
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:34,337
Mr. An, where are you going?

815
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:36,016
-To the restroom.
-Wait, wait.

816
00:53:36,105 --> 00:53:37,332
What?

817
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:39,599
Do you want to go there with me?

818
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:42,615
Right.

819
00:53:43,212 --> 00:53:45,567
I'd rather have you come with me.
Let's move on to the next level.

820
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:46,545
What?

821
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,358
But Mr. An...

822
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,969
I'm a bodyguard so I'll stand here.

823
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:00,105
My legs hurt.

824
00:54:00,194 --> 00:54:02,961
Listen, you should have
a one-legged fight with her.

825
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:04,795
I'm currently on duty.

826
00:54:04,884 --> 00:54:06,855
Is peeing part of your duty?

827
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,808
The woman that got kidnapped
in Dobong-dong is alive.

828
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,778
He would never kill her.

829
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:14,384
"The 3rd Korea Indie Game Forum"

830
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:23,389
So don't investigate suspects
with similar criminal records.

831
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:26,577
Robbers, rapists, and murderers, I mean.

832
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:31,742
Oh?

833
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,644
And listen to people's advice.

834
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:48,394
Where the heck is she?

835
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,461
-Do Bongsoon!
-Yes!

836
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:54,391
-Oh, gosh! I lost him.
-Lost who?

837
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:58,178
I saw someone suspicious
but he disappeared in a flash.

838
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:02,155
Suspicious people don't look suspicious.

839
00:55:02,244 --> 00:55:05,089
Do you think everyone wearing a cap
or a mask is a kidnapper or robber?

840
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,343
Actually the average...

841
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:11,708
-What's taking him so long?
-What?

842
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:25,510
-Call 911.
-What?

843
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,326
-Call 911. Now!
-Okay, okay.

844
00:55:30,878 --> 00:55:32,579
Oh, no.

845
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:34,701
I'm sorry. I should have caught him.

846
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:37,666
I didn't do my job.

847
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:41,875
I didn't expect him to use a knife.

848
00:55:43,046 --> 00:55:45,774
I hope I'd feel safe
if you stayed around.

849
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:48,622
It's gotten more dangerous now.

850
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,945
-Quit.
-No.

851
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:56,956
I'll understand the concept
of prioritizing my client's safety.

852
00:55:57,093 --> 00:55:58,492
So don't fire me.

853
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:00,796
-I'll protect you.
-It's dangerous.

854
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,051
He could have stabbed you.

855
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,576
I won't let anyone stab me.

856
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,572
You really can't think of anyone?

857
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,203
There are too many.

858
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,677
My half-siblings,

859
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,209
my competitors...

860
00:56:18,618 --> 00:56:20,663
And players I met to fight in real life.

861
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,405
I really can't pick one.

862
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:23,891
There are too many suspects.

863
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,808
The only person I trust in my family
is my second brother.

864
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,988
I have another mother
besides my biological mother.

865
00:56:35,077 --> 00:56:37,160
And I had another mother before her.

866
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,679
My family's a mess.
I have three half-brothers.

867
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:43,988
I told them I'm not interested
in that company and left.

868
00:56:44,077 --> 00:56:45,667
And I made it with Ainsoft...

869
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:46,770
...but...

870
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:49,934
...my father got more determined...

871
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,900
...to let me run his company
after seeing my success.

872
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:57,681
Since then, I became
the public enemy in my family.

873
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,261
Whoever it is...

874
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:01,342
...I will catch him.

875
00:57:08,544 --> 00:57:12,658
Fortunately, the wound isn't deep,
so we sutured it and dressed it.

876
00:57:13,143 --> 00:57:14,731
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

877
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,258
Hi, Gukdoo.

878
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,310
I'm almost done.

879
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:06,310
I'll be right there.

880
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,105
Did I make you wait?

881
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,250
No, I just got here.

882
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,269
It's our 100th day today.

883
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,169
You've been too busy lately
to notice, right?

884
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:34,006
We had a case last night.

885
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,880
We're working in shifts to investigate.

886
00:58:38,744 --> 00:58:41,503
I have to go back to work later. Sorry.

887
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,438
No, that's okay.

888
00:58:44,496 --> 00:58:46,588
I guess you couldn't get any sleep.

889
00:58:46,677 --> 00:58:47,624
Goodness.

890
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,155
You should eat something quickly
and get some sleep.

891
00:58:51,244 --> 00:58:52,817
You were on duty last night.

892
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:56,069
-Let's eat something good.
-Sure.

893
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:06,412
Bongsoon.

894
00:59:08,697 --> 00:59:10,227
Stay with me today.

895
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:14,081
I'll protect you and you'll protect me.

896
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:16,478
How about that?

897
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,028
You look very expectant hearing that...

898
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:25,996
...but nothing you expect will happen,
so don't get any ideas.

899
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:27,822
What expectations?

900
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:31,802
You know, the usual thing that happens
when a man and a woman are together.

901
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:36,944
Mr. An, why would I stay in your house?
I refuse.

902
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:39,679
You really are hopeless.

903
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,878
-What are you talking about?
-Don't you want to try to seduce me?

904
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:45,140
Staying in my house is
the opportunity of your life.

905
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:48,565
No, I do not intend to do so.

906
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:53,289
And according to what I've heard,
you're not interested in women.

907
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,895
-Are you a woman?
-Am I a man, then?

908
00:59:57,862 --> 00:59:59,789
Let's go to my house
and stay there in the meantime.

909
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:00,722
It's in the contract.

910
01:00:00,811 --> 01:00:04,008
You will accept any requests
in order to protect me.

911
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:08,543
I never expected living together
would be part of "any requests."

912
01:00:08,644 --> 01:00:10,015
Then what request did you expect?

913
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:14,168
Protecting my client from
different kinds of threats.

914
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:17,284
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm in danger right now.

915
01:00:17,373 --> 01:00:19,786
What if an assassin breaks
into my house at night?

916
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,790
Assassin? Are you a ninja?

917
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:24,211
I'm scared.

918
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,767
-Sleep with me in my house.
-What?

919
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,759
-Okay?
-Gay...

920
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,555
No! I'm going home.

921
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:34,899
My parents are very strict.

922
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:37,530
Is everything going as planned?

923
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,881
I only have a few weeks left.

924
01:00:40,993 --> 01:00:43,927
I'm doing well,
but my fingers hurt a little.

925
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:45,288
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

926
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:49,009
I was planning to see one next week.

927
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:53,456
Sorry. I have to take it.

928
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:55,352
It's okay. Take it.

929
01:00:57,944 --> 01:00:58,789
Hello?

930
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,758
Hey, the officer protecting
Do Bongsoon was attacked.

931
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:02,999
What?

932
01:01:03,088 --> 01:01:04,822
You like that policeman, right?

933
01:01:05,144 --> 01:01:06,322
But he doesn't like you back.

934
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:08,842
It's a one-sided love, right?

935
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:12,405
-How did you know?
-I can tell from what you do.

936
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,763
You'll only have crushes all your life.

937
01:01:14,852 --> 01:01:17,070
Use me to make him jealous.
That's how men work.

938
01:01:17,245 --> 01:01:22,378
They start to look at you
when you start to meet someone else.

939
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:27,532
So...

940
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,283
...stay with me today.

941
01:01:30,878 --> 01:01:33,966
I don't want to be alone today.

942
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,840
Okay, okay.

943
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:42,263
But I charge double for overtime work.
We must be exact with numbers.

944
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,384
-Are you hungry?
-What?

945
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:53,461
Do you want to eat?

946
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:55,447
Yes.

947
01:01:55,536 --> 01:01:57,747
I'm not getting used to
the one meal a day yet.

948
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,150
Hi, Gukdoo.

949
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:07,023
Here?

950
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,143
Wait. Mr. An...

951
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:11,728
What's the address?

952
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:16,002
Sit.

953
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,282
Hot!

954
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,515
Let's eat.

955
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:36,737
The walnut pie is good, right?

956
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:38,740
It is. We should go there again.

957
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:41,758
I think it's so-so.

958
01:02:42,177 --> 01:02:44,238
You took me there.

959
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:47,346
My parents run it.

960
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:49,833
That guy was my dad.

961
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:56,639
What? Why didn't you tell me?

962
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,326
-What for?
-I wouldn't have gone if I knew.

963
01:02:59,415 --> 01:03:01,947
That's why I didn't tell you.
We have to sell.

964
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:05,046
You win. Is it good?

965
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:09,143
The noodles are a little mushy.
I like them a little firm.

966
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:13,388
-It feels quite weird.
-What?

967
01:03:13,477 --> 01:03:16,041
Eating ramyeon with a woman
at night alone.

968
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,030
Do you mean you should eat with a man?

969
01:03:20,844 --> 01:03:22,232
Have you ever dated someone?

970
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:24,169
You haven't, right?

971
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,565
Of course I have.

972
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:30,607
-I'm a femme hommtal.
-What's a femme hommtal?

973
01:03:35,764 --> 01:03:38,577
Did you just mix femme fatale
and homme fatale?

974
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:42,386
Femme hommtal!
You do wonders with words.

975
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:48,189
I'm not good at foreign languages
and four character idioms.

976
01:03:48,844 --> 01:03:55,133
But please don't judge me
as someone lacking knowledge.

977
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:56,782
Okay, I won't.

978
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,317
-Eat up.
-Okay.

979
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:12,319
Who is it?

980
01:04:18,946 --> 01:04:20,123
Gukdoo.

981
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:23,818
Whose house is this?

982
01:04:24,806 --> 01:04:27,603
Do Bongsoon will be staying
with me here today.

983
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:31,282
She can stay here, so don't worry.

984
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:32,305
What is this place?

985
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:34,752
-And who is he?
-Well...

986
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:36,995
Let's go.

987
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:40,570
A woman shouldn't stay
at a man's house alone.

988
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:41,630
Are you crazy?

989
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:42,652
Come with me.

990
01:04:43,715 --> 01:04:44,695
She's staying.

991
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:53,649
-Who are you?
-I need her here today.

992
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,358
I'm taking her with me.

993
01:04:55,945 --> 01:04:56,857
I said she stays.

994
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:59,596
-I'm taking her.
-No, you aren't.

995
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,450
I will take her.

996
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:03,833
You can't.

997
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:33,922
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

998
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,410
I will be in charge of protecting
Do Bongsoon from now on.

999
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:37,113
As you please.

1000
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:38,878
History is always made at night.

1001
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:40,708
-Let's do it.
-That's not the life I've led.

1002
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:42,336
-Are you kidding me?
-Did you sleep with him?

1003
01:05:42,745 --> 01:05:43,505
I did.

1004
01:05:43,594 --> 01:05:45,055
All men are dogs!

1005
01:05:45,144 --> 01:05:46,856
-Look.
-I'm looking.

1006
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,079
She's here. Do Bongsoon!

1007
01:05:49,168 --> 01:05:50,744
-Be nice.
-Hello!

1008
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,100
Doesn't she look like Do Bongsoon?

1009
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:56,067
-Bring her to me.
-I will kill you myself!

1010
01:05:56,156 --> 01:06:00,023
How strong are you?
Are you a man?

1011
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,318
Your friend was very worried about you.

1012
01:06:03,552 --> 01:06:08,026
You have a girlfriend.
So why are you so nice to me?

1013
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:10,088
Can you stay alone?

1014
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:11,946
Are you worried about me?

1015
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:15,648
I can tell.
