1
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:06,206
What are you? A walnut cracker?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,797
What are you doing?

3
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:18,089
-Newbies, you show her!
-Yes, sir!

4
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,901
You little thing.

5
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,020
What? Why is everyone down?

6
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:50,917
What are you doing?
You take care of her!

7
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,314
Yes, sir!

8
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:01,216
Now open your eyes.

9
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,510
Always look straight
into the opponent's eyes.

10
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,695
-Then you can predict his moves.
-Okay.

11
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,298
Try to avoid my moves.

12
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,678
Hey. What the heck?

13
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,555
Yeongdeungpo and Cheonho-dong.
Attack together.

14
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,658
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

15
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:24,293
What? You haven't fought
with your bare fists lately?

16
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,595
-Everyone, go after her!
-Yes, sir!

17
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,469
We're not going to hurt you.

18
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,564
-Excuse me.
-Listen to me.

19
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,572
-You know me, right?
-Take it easy.

20
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,867
-It's not what we mean.
-You shouldn't do this.

21
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,681
We were just told to...

22
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,230
She's right here. My turn.

23
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:26,733
Where do I punch you first?

24
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,955
Please stop!

25
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,222
Ms. Do.

26
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,017
Bongsoon!

27
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:05,054
Mr. An...

28
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,848
Mr. An!

29
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,149
Oh, no...

30
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:15,641
Mr. An...

31
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,156
Are you okay?

32
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,367
He's been stabbed in the abdomen.
We administered first-aid.

33
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,681
The bleeding stopped.
It's not a deep wound fortunately.

34
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:05,303
We'll do a CT scan
of his abdomen just in case.

35
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,627
Boys.

36
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:25,421
Boys, we should just give up.
Let's just go sailing.

37
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:26,616
But I...

38
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,526
...get seasick.

39
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,126
Please, wake up.

40
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,818
I'll listen to whatever you say
and I'll take any bossy attitude.

41
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:03,721
I won't talk back or be impudent or...

42
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:08,951
Mr. An?

43
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:11,931
Mr. An.

44
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,329
I'm glad.

45
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:17,632
What?

46
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,429
I'm glad I took the fall,

47
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,343
and you didn't get hurt.

48
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,456
Mr. An...

49
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,445
-Is that what you were expecting?
-What?

50
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,348
Look at me.

51
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,848
Ever since I hired you as my bodyguard,

52
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:41,860
I have not had one peaceful day.

53
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:44,257
Are you okay?

54
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:46,868
-How long have I known you?
-Well...

55
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,874
It feels like it's been years.

56
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:53,045
-Gosh, it hurts.
-What?

57
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,743
How many stitches did I get?

58
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,242
Well. Twelve, actually.

59
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,036
You insisted that
the stitches should be very close.

60
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,337
-I did?
-Yes.

61
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:06,245
Gosh. They sewed my body.

62
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:09,237
I cared for my body so hard. My goodness!

63
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,542
I'm sorry.

64
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,629
Are you okay?

65
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,336
Yes, thanks to you.

66
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:17,426
You should be.

67
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,227
-How will you repay me?
-What?

68
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,824
Are you okay?
Is it very painful?

69
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,342
Did the doctors take anything out
from my body during surgery?

70
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,323
-What?
-Did they take anything out?

71
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,617
Take what out?

72
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,632
Why does it hurt so much?

73
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,816
It feels like something's missing.

74
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,001
Did they take one kidney away?

75
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,831
-It hurts!
-Oh, no.

76
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,136
-It hurts!
-Mr. An!

77
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:48,850
Mr. Kong.

78
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,441
What on earth happened?

79
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:55,854
How can you get stabbed?

80
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:01,937
I'm fine, but you never know.
I might die of tetanus.

81
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,838
I might even have complications.

82
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,449
So don't cry now.

83
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,949
You can cry later
when the results come out.

84
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,062
Don't cry. Stop.

85
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,546
-Do Bongsoon.
-Yes? Are you okay?

86
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,622
I'm sorry.

87
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:19,827
-Go and eat something.
-What?

88
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:26,749
-You haven't eaten all day.
-How can I when you're in pain?

89
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,834
Do you think I'll get
better, if you starve?

90
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:32,557
So go and eat something.
Then you can look after me.

91
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,158
I'm about to see and hear things.

92
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,460
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

93
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:40,266
-You just said something.
-No, I didn't.

94
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:44,075
-I didn't say anything.
-See? I'm hearing things.

95
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,155
Grab a quick bite,

96
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,370
and come back.

97
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,971
Okay, if that's what you want...

98
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,169
I'll be right back.

99
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,764
-I'm fine.
-What?

100
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,455
Raise the bed.

101
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,577
I'll spend some time relaxing here
so pay careful attention to work.

102
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,774
-Are you really okay?
-I'm fine.

103
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,776
It's not a deep wound. I'm okay.

104
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,049
-And one more thing.
-Yes?

105
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,262
Don't let our employees know,

106
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,271
that I have been stabbed.

107
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:26,478
What?

108
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:30,168
I guess this is how
Admiral Yi Sunsin felt.

109
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,460
Turn the TV on for me.

110
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:10,066
-Soyoung said she likes you?
-I don't like her.

111
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:11,971
Why? She's pretty.

112
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,860
I don't like big girls.

113
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:17,261
I like women that are as light
and soft as the cosmos.

114
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:18,972
Someone you want to protect.

115
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,965
-Oh, no!
-What's going on?

116
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,457
-Let's go!
-Okay.

117
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,457
This is so weird.
How can it bend like this?

118
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:38,254
-How on earth did this happen?
-A little girl did this.

119
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,873
Oh, come on. You must have been drunk.

120
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:43,374
No! I saw her with my own eyes.

121
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,286
A little girl bent it like this.

122
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,600
-An iron bar?
-She bent it like this.

123
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:51,693
Did you drink or not? You did!

124
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,990
What? No.

125
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:01,490
You can do it! You can do it!

126
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,184
We can do this, guys!

127
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,442
It was you.

128
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,028
Are you okay?

129
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,424
Yes, I'm fine.

130
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,225
Did you know?

131
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:45,333
About what?

132
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,737
Is that why you hired
her as your bodyguard?

133
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,044
Bongsoon doesn't want you to know.

134
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:54,741
So pretend you don't know.

135
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,234
Why did you do that?

136
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,446
-Do what?
-Why did you take the fall?

137
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,650
Why do you think I did?

138
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,634
I saw everything.

139
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,420
How Bongsoon...

140
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,536
If I look back,
many things didn't make sense.

141
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,149
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

142
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,355
Actually,

143
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,233
Bongsoon is a little different.
She's very special.

144
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:09,739
-Since when?
-She was born that way.

145
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,442
Gukdoo, do me a favor.

146
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,948
This hospital is packed
with the guys she beat up.

147
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,829
I don't want people to find out.

148
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,434
Don't make a case of it
and please cover it up.

149
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,934
I don't know about the others,
but I won't forgive the guy...

150
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:31,149
...that tried to stab her.
I'll book him and arrest him.

151
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:33,141
What if she got stabbed?

152
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,338
Her boss doesn't want to press charges.

153
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,623
And actually, he's the only victim.

154
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,924
Thankfully, he's not badly wounded.

155
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,166
Bonggi said Bongsoon isn't hurt.

156
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,865
He said that to calm me down.
I have to see her myself.

157
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,950
Where is she?
What's the room number?

158
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,049
-It's not that way, it's this way.
-Yes, that way.

159
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:01,339
-What? Really?
-Yes.

160
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,442
Did my son-in-law take the fall for her?

161
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,339
-He got stabbed?
-Yes.

162
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:08,353
Where is he?

163
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:09,235
My goodness.

164
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,050
Mr. An! Oh, my.

165
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,743
-What brought you all here?
-My goodness.

166
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,140
How do we repay your kindness?

167
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:25,140
It's okay. I'm fine.

168
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,135
Don't say that.

169
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:30,344
We're not so shameless.
We're a family with dignity.

170
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,349
We owe you so much.

171
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,033
We must repay you.

172
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:38,112
-No, I'm really fine.
-You can have Bongsoon.

173
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,327
You can take her.

174
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:59,494
You, Gukdoo!
Where have you been all day?

175
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,880
-Aren't you going home?
-Headquarters wants us off.

176
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:09,668
They want our hands off the
Dobong-dong serial murder case.

177
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,381
Do you all hear me?

178
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,890
-Yes!
-Yes!

179
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:25,271
He's not here at this hour.
We should try doing something.

180
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,171
We're tied up. What can we do?

181
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,782
Where on earth are we?

182
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:33,561
I'm not sure,
but I think people can hear us.

183
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,846
I heard sounds of people and cars, too.

184
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,148
We could scream together.

185
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,342
I'll count and we can
cry out for help together.

186
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,644
Okay, let's do that!

187
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:50,233
Let's cry out for help
on the count of three.

188
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:51,534
Okay.

189
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:56,237
One, two, three!

190
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,928
-Help!
-Help!

191
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:02,118
-Help!
-Help!

192
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,118
-Help!
-Help!

193
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,214
-Help!
-Help!

194
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,507
Help...

195
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:13,599
-Help!
-Help!

196
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,102
-Help!
-Help!

197
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,905
-Help!
-Help!

198
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:23,626
-Help!
-Help!

199
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,626
-Help!
-Help!

200
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,623
-Help!
-Help!

201
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:32,925
-Help!
-Help!

202
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:24,629
This is why,
I shouldn't be nice to you.

203
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:34,835
Ma'am, this case is now under
the special investigation unit.

204
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:39,833
You should lay the case to them.

205
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:42,816
I'm sorry for the trouble.

206
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,408
My daughter...

207
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,313
-...will be fine, right?
-Yes,

208
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:49,529
she'll be fine.

209
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,608
Ask him...

210
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:57,917
...to take me instead.
Please? It wasn't...

211
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,305
...a dark alley.

212
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,798
I'm sure the criminal is
someone, who knew her.

213
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,295
Or someone from the neighborhood.

214
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,901
-We got it!
-It's near Dobong 3-dong 40-Gil.

215
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,485
No more CCTVs from here.

216
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,892
He smelled really weird.

217
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:18,582
It's the smell of asphalt.

218
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,976
Please find my daughter. Please!

219
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,976
Gosh, what should I do?

220
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:38,187
Are you out of your mind?
"You can take Bongsoon"?

221
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:40,582
You can't be serious.
How can you say that?

222
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:45,082
I'd ask him to take you with
her, if I could.

223
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,295
But what use can he make of you?

224
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:51,890
-It was very impressive, though.
-I know, right?

225
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:55,883
He got stabbed trying
to protect Bongsoon.

226
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,276
I'm so moved.

227
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,680
-But who the heck was it?
-Yes, who was it?

228
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:03,672
Who tried to stab her?

229
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:09,974
-Don't you feel any pain?
-I'm fine.

230
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,085
It has to be painful.
You're bearing with it well.

231
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,971
-It'll be sore.
-When do the stitches come out?

232
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:18,670
-In about a week.
-A week?

233
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,064
My goodness!

234
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:24,056
Are you still in pain?

235
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:28,456
Each cell of my body
is very sensitive, you know.

236
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,868
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

237
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,561
Lie down.

238
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,249
-Careful.
-Gently.

239
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:44,042
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh...

240
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:49,055
-Bonggi!
-Oh, Heeji.

241
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:54,451
Gukdoo said he liked someone
for a long time.

242
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,538
Did he say that?

243
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:58,038
Yes.

244
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:03,635
A girl who does stupid things
that makes him feel upset.

245
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,031
I actually had a hunch.

246
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,223
It didn't feel like he really liked me.

247
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,616
Now I know why.

248
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,020
Are you okay?

249
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:26,112
I always asked myself
when I was with him.

250
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,592
Do we love each other?

251
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,512
Do we really like each other?

252
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,993
But I feel different
when I'm with you.

253
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:46,890
I'm sure when I'm with you.
I don't want to waste time.

254
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,689
Gukdoo and I are friends.

255
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,896
You and I will need time
before we start going out.

256
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:58,387
What if I meet someone
else during that time?

257
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,007
What if you meet someone else?
It's all about timing.

258
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:07,101
Let's go out on just five dates.

259
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,198
If it doesn't work, we quit.

260
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:20,303
Shouldn't I,

261
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,105
the man suggest those things?

262
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:38,616
Sir.

263
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,220
You are here, sir.

264
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:45,212
It's fine.

265
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:52,321
Get some rest.

266
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,238
All our boys are hospitalized here.

267
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,126
Boss!

268
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,709
-Boss.
-Boss.

269
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:16,402
-Where's Kwangbok?
-There...

270
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:23,500
Was it you?

271
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,207
-What?
-Was it you?

272
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,113
-No...
-I said no weapons!

273
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,405
Mobsters should never dog-paddle
even if they're drowning!

274
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,104
-Let go!
-Boss...

275
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,303
Let go! What will become of you?

276
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,603
No, it's not him.

277
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:55,813
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

278
00:26:58,006 --> 00:26:59,098
That finger!

279
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:06,189
Who was it?
Who tried to stab my daughter?

280
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,992
Ma'am, please calm down.

281
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:11,883
Oh, so it's you.
You were one of them?

282
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:14,183
I never liked you!

283
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,892
Looking like Pigsy's underling!

284
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,180
Pigsy...

285
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,572
Ma'am, I may have done wrong,
but don't blame my face.

286
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:26,763
Whatever! Who was it?
Did you try to stab her?

287
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,375
No, it wasn't me.

288
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:31,054
Who was the scum?
Who stabbed my son-in-law?

289
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,158
Your son-in-law... Ma'am, calm down.

290
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:36,360
Calm down? Do you think
I can calm down, you Pigsy?

291
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,444
Pigsy?

292
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:40,436
I feel very offended.

293
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:42,236
Who was it? I want to know right now.

294
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:45,736
I won't calm down unless
I beat him from head to toe!

295
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,125
Who was it?

296
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:50,631
-Was it you?
-Me again?

297
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,527
Ma'am!

298
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:01,835
It's not him, it's him.

299
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,145
You should have told me it's not him!

300
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,946
He did say...

301
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:30,978
What? I can't beat up
someone in this condition!

302
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:34,470
Right? Let me offer you
my sincere apology...

303
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,673
-Then I'll beat you!
-What?

304
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,570
Instead of him!

305
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,552
What?

306
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:57,931
-I'll take care of it.
-Don't make a fuss of it.

307
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:00,042
He didn't want to stab me.

308
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,251
We can let this slide.
Don't make a problem of it.

309
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,464
This isn't about you.

310
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,556
It's a problem of my pride.
How dare they stab my son!

311
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:12,969
When I supported them?

312
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:15,866
Like I said, father.
They weren't trying to stab me.

313
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:19,483
Then who did they try to stab?
Why did you...

314
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:23,277
Why did you take the fall?

315
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:24,872
Are you an idiot?

316
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,469
It doesn't even hurt.

317
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:28,677
What?

318
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,478
I'm not afraid of getting stabbed.

319
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:34,779
I've been through worse.

320
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:37,684
What? I took you in
and brought you up!

321
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:38,967
You took me in?

322
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,679
Right, I'm not your son.

323
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,576
I was not a brother to them.

324
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,970
Mother considered me
a beggar you took in.

325
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,780
That's how you treated me.
What's wrong with that?

326
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:51,976
Why didn't you just abandon me
like you abandoned mom?

327
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,381
Why did you take me in
and bring me up?

328
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:57,395
How dare you!

329
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,895
I told you to not mention
your mother again.

330
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,884
What have I not done for you?

331
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:07,591
Did you lose your mind now
that your business is successful?

332
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:09,892
Please leave.
I don't want your company.

333
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,608
Do you think running a business is easy?

334
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:16,298
Did you start? I'll be there soon.

335
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,971
Oh, really?

336
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,686
The son of his ex-wife.

337
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:25,885
It's nothing serious. He's fine.

338
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:30,282
He's used to being alone. Okay.

339
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,568
Gosh. You...

340
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,768
How dare you! You impudent...

341
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:40,872
Minhyuk, Minhyuk.

342
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,078
-This is a mess!
-Is Minhyuk okay?

343
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,764
Honey!

344
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:25,718
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

345
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,319
How can I help you?

346
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:31,819
Are you the owner of this place?

347
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:33,118
I am. Why?

348
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:37,618
I heard someone scream, "Help!"

349
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:41,549
He was wearing a black hoodie, I think.

350
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:44,609
He was about 180 cm tall.

351
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:48,027
I couldn't see his face. Yes, his feet.

352
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:50,123
He had big feet.

353
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,116
So you're back from Africa?

354
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,720
Yes. Did you catch the criminal?

355
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:03,530
Not yet.

356
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,927
You helped us the last time
by giving us a description,

357
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:08,919
but unfortunately, we haven't.

358
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,725
What brought you here?

359
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:16,321
You said you buy and sell
second-hand car parts, too.

360
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:19,322
-Can you check my car?
-Okay.

361
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,132
Let me see your car.

362
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:32,756
Sir.

363
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:37,865
Your car looks fine.

364
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:40,365
We're closing now.

365
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,959
I see.

366
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:59,021
That's why the other team said
it's not the same guy...

367
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:01,632
...that murdered Jung Hyangsook.

368
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:03,537
I think it's the same guy.

369
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:08,334
It was in the same crime scene,
but we found different footprints.

370
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:11,832
Two different footprints...

371
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,270
What's going on?

372
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:30,462
You have itchy feet, don't you?
Where have you been?

373
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,272
-Sir!
-What?

374
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:35,451
Why did the killer destroy
the first crime scene...

375
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:37,966
-...but then go back there?
-What about that?

376
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,974
The footprints at the
crimes scene were different.

377
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:47,389
The unidentified footprint in
Jung Hyangsook's crime scene.

378
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:49,012
One was size 270.

379
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,783
What if that was the
footprint of the real killer?

380
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,085
So then what?

381
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:58,489
You're suggesting the real killer
did it in the same crime scene...

382
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,593
...to destroy evidence?

383
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:05,279
He left a fake footprint to confuse us.

384
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,285
Do you remember the witness Kim Janghyeon?

385
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,364
Yes, of course I remember.

386
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:13,269
He gave us crucial clue.
He said the guy's feet are big.

387
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,064
I went to check today,

388
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,770
and it turned out that he's
the owner of the junkyard.

389
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:27,672
Let's stake out.

390
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,534
-Go home.
-No, I'll stay here.

391
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,940
-I want to be alone. Go.
-Mr. An!

392
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:51,329
Why do you want to be
alone in hard times?

393
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,124
You always do that.

394
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:59,225
You go in hiding when you
really need a shoulder to cry on.

395
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:03,522
Stop doing that. You promised me.

396
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,429
I'll be here with you.

397
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:17,925
Aren't you hungry?

398
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:22,836
I'm hungry.

399
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:25,329
Anything you want to eat?

400
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,442
The food we had in your house.

401
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:39,930
Are you cooking for a ceremony?
Why can't I have some?

402
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,933
No! Mr. An should eat it first.

403
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:47,338
I hope he likes it.

404
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:49,738
I hope he enjoys it.

405
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,138
Why did you do that?

406
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:21,949
What?

407
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:26,947
You took...

408
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:29,945
...the fall for me.

409
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:32,645
Why did you do that?

410
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:46,906
You did this before.

411
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,406
The first time we met
at the police station.

412
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,209
You stared at me like this.

413
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:04,642
Don't look at other guys like that.

414
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,263
-It was you, right?
-What?

415
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,582
The bus girl.

416
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,668
You stopped it,

417
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:19,268
right?

418
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:19,775
Gosh.

419
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,785
Mom's going to kill me.

420
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,792
What do I tell her?

421
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,375
That was the first time.

422
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:35,573
I've always hid my power.

423
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,859
It was my first time using
my strength to help others.

424
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,859
It felt strange.

425
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:47,571
I thought you were really an angel
my mom sent from heaven.

426
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:48,974
Wow.

427
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:50,783
And it was you?

428
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,577
An angel? Oh, come on.

429
00:39:57,393 --> 00:39:59,195
I was going to visit
my mom's graveyard.

430
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:01,191
After skipping night prep work.

431
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,293
Wait.

432
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:05,207
After skipping night prep work?

433
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:07,998
-Were you in high school then?
-What?

434
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:09,998
You just said that,
you skipped night prep work.

435
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,788
-No.
-I always was curious.

436
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:14,395
How old are you?

437
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:17,188
-Why do you want to know?
-If you were in high school...

438
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,689
Then it means you're my age or younger.

439
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:23,305
And you talked down to me?

440
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:29,409
-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
-I need a painkiller.

441
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,612
-I'll call the nurse!
-No, don't.

442
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,598
No? Why not? It hurts.

443
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:37,198
-I'll call the nurse.
-Hey, hey.

444
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,901
Don't go anywhere. Stay right next to me.

445
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:40,693
Okay.

446
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:43,264
I need some rest.

447
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:46,085
-Finish what you were doing.
-Oh, right.

448
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:51,102
Hey, that hurts even more.

449
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:52,997
Are you okay?

450
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,494
-I'm bleeding a little.
-What?

451
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,096
Nothing. Keep doing that.

452
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:03,687
It's fine now.

453
00:41:08,003 --> 00:41:10,198
That's good. Yeah.

454
00:41:10,894 --> 00:41:11,892
Do it properly.

455
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:16,401
Yes, in between the fingers.

456
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:48,157
Hey! That's not how sis does it.

457
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,252
Do it again. You need more skills.

458
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:56,835
-Then how about this?
-Did you blacken her face?

459
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,034
-Yes.
-Hey! Remove that!

460
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:01,526
You don't do that to her face!

461
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,835
-Try something else.
-Okay.

462
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:10,237
-Hey! That's poop on her face!
-Then what?

463
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,023
You want a beating?
Did you lose your mind?

464
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,123
Are you crazy?

465
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:16,718
-You want a beating?
-Shall we fight?

466
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:24,743
-Did you beat them?
-"Did you beat them?"

467
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:26,537
Hey.

468
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:29,037
-Hey, change her voice.
-Okay.

469
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:31,728
-Hey, dub it with my voice.
-How?

470
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:34,721
"Did you beat them?"

471
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:38,332
-I'm hungry.
-What do you...

472
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:41,736
Mom! Dad!

473
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:45,753
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, Mr. An.

474
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:46,848
Sit here.

475
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:49,556
He kept saying he wants homemade food.

476
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,270
Alright.

477
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,781
You might have never tried it,

478
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,477
but once you try,
you can't help but try again.

479
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:03,699
It's the famous
Dobong-dong bibimbap!

480
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,381
-Mom, taste it!
-Okay.

481
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:06,684
Let's see.

482
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:10,796
-It's good.
-It's good. It's good.

483
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,788
You've waited a long time. Here.

484
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:16,391
-Say, "Ah."
-Bongsoon, stop!

485
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:18,288
My goodness.

486
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:21,708
Look here. He's fasting today.

487
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:24,700
Oh, my gosh. That's a pity.

488
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:27,429
That's too bad.

489
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,430
It's okay.
Don't worry about me and enjoy it.

490
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:37,147
-No, we can't do that.
-No, I'm fine.

491
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,255
Let's finish it up quickly.

492
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:43,849
He can't eat today. Quickly.

493
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:46,053
-Quickly! Come on!
-Okay, finish it up.

494
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:49,149
-You need a spoon.
-He's fasting.

495
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:52,533
-I'm sorry he's missing this.
-Quickly.

496
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:01,530
-It tastes good.
-He really can't eat?

497
00:44:01,634 --> 00:44:03,934
-He can't. He shouldn't.
-He can't?

498
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,311
Sir.

499
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,406
Come here and sleep next to me.

500
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:35,893
I don't sleep next to just anyone.

501
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:38,903
Just anyone?

502
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,301
Okay, then.

503
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:45,206
I'm sleeping.

504
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,209
Anyone have cookies?

505
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:03,895
"Fasting"

506
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,600
-Go home.
-Oh, no. No.

507
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:22,796
Go home.

508
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:27,796
Sir, ma'am, thanks for coming.
Please take her with you.

509
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:31,199
What are you talking about?
She's not going anywhere.

510
00:45:31,286 --> 00:45:33,913
It was a long day for her.
She needs to get some rest.

511
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm fine.

512
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:36,915
Then I'm staying with you.

513
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,309
-What?
-Don't refuse.

514
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:41,023
I'm good at taking care of patients.

515
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:43,507
I've hurt a lot of people.

516
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:46,426
Many were hospitalized because of me.

517
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,030
I'm the best nurse.

518
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:51,410
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

519
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:53,912
-You'll need help.
-I can handle it.

520
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:02,915
I'll feel more comfortable alone.

521
00:46:05,411 --> 00:46:06,913
Let's take this and go home.

522
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:08,413
Let's go.

523
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:11,418
-Let's go.
-Pack things up.

524
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:12,913
Okay, okay.

525
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:04,227
If you...

526
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,633
...had stabbed her,

527
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:11,238
I'd have killed you.

528
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:15,037
Now leave.

529
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,744
I hope to not see you ever again.

530
00:47:21,634 --> 00:47:22,622
This.

531
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,122
We're not close enough
to exchange things like this.

532
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:32,817
What's your relationship with Do Bongsoon?

533
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:34,740
Especially not close
enough to talk about that.

534
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:36,225
How did you recruit her?

535
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:40,628
How did you find such rare talent?

536
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:43,327
-Get out!
-I will get out.

537
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:54,329
What the heck?

538
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:03,241
Ms. Do!

539
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:12,038
I can't accept that.

540
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,341
I sincerely apologize for my
boy playing against the rules.

541
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:18,538
He did it on his own.

542
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:21,333
I hope you understand, I never meant that.

543
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:25,916
Our duel...

544
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,131
...ends here.

545
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:31,624
We lost. We admit our defeat.

546
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,514
I also hope to not see you
again because of this issue.

547
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:41,516
As you've seen,
I have many working for me.

548
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:43,402
Word about this can't spread.

549
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,218
Or I must quit this business.

550
00:48:46,303 --> 00:48:49,485
Don't worry about that.
I don't want the word to spread either.

551
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:52,779
Good. If word spread, you won't
find anyone to marry you.

552
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:54,289
That's not why!

553
00:48:54,374 --> 00:49:00,373
I just want to lie low.
You try leading a good life, too.

554
00:49:02,952 --> 00:49:04,264
I'll try.

555
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,058
Okay. I have to go now.

556
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:08,740
By any chance,

557
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:11,534
-would you like to work with me?
-Would you...

558
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:14,756
Try to lead a good life.

559
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,535
Get well soon.

560
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:31,805
-You didn't go home?
-You really don't know me.

561
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,285
I promised I'd stay with you.

562
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:40,587
And I'm not like you.
I keep my promises.

563
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,584
And my mom also brought me
clothes that I can change into.

564
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:47,883
-Mr. An.
-What?

565
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,478
What game should we play?

566
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,685
What game?

567
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,179
I need to take a bath.

568
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:00,082
A bath...

569
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,262
You got cold feet?

570
00:50:02,462 --> 00:50:05,055
-Help me wash my hair.
-Gosh...

571
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:08,268
-Okay.
-Why? Expected something else?

572
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:12,367
What? You're getting racy.

573
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,570
What are you doing?

574
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,363
Help me wash my hair. Come on.

575
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:18,363
Okay. Should I call the nurse?

576
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,157
-I'll take it off.
-Oh, my.

577
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:22,959
Let me help you.

578
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,555
They found her bag and phone.
I think she got kidnapped.

579
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:35,846
We have a witness.

580
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:40,139
The problem is we can't investigate.

581
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:42,331
We can't issue a warrant...

582
00:50:42,443 --> 00:50:45,530
...and the special unit won't
share information with us.

583
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:48,149
Janghyeon didn't get out
of the junkyard...

584
00:50:48,234 --> 00:50:51,945
...by the time it happened.
Who was it, then?

585
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:54,751
Then what? We got it wrong?

586
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,648
Darn, what a headache.

587
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:05,833
Well, no criminal is bold enough
to show up at the police station.

588
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:10,937
Loose and Spectacles are staking
out the area just in case.

589
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,326
Okay, got it.

590
00:52:57,785 --> 00:52:58,898
Go and sleep.

591
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:00,786
I'll dry it myself.

592
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:01,862
Yes?

593
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,871
Okay.

594
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:06,981
Then I'll go to sleep.

595
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,586
It was you.

596
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:09,584
And we meet again.

597
00:55:57,985 --> 00:56:01,480
What? What's this? Hey!

598
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:06,976
Sir, we have a problem!
Wake up! Look at this!

599
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:11,663
-This is so humiliating!
-What the heck is this?

600
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,593
It's all over the internet.

601
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:17,387
This is Mangchi! It's humiliating!

602
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:20,601
Call Charles and tell him
to cover the faces of the boys!

603
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:21,988
It's already made public.

604
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,694
-Deleting it now won't help.
-Report it to the police!

605
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:27,201
We're not in a position
to report to the police.

606
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:34,690
The video clearly shows
we're the offenders.

607
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,391
You show him. Show him.

608
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:39,391
Here, look.

609
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:52,404
-Another girl was kidnapped.
-I heard.

610
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:56,087
Don't you think it was safer
with the underlings of Pigsy here?

611
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:59,889
She got kidnapped
right after they left.

612
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:04,396
Gosh, I don't think we should've
asked them to leave.

613
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:06,492
Nothing's for free.

614
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:10,494
Letting them protect us is
accepting the redevelopment.

615
00:57:10,589 --> 00:57:12,280
That's true, though.

616
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:14,382
Gosh.

617
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:24,005
A girl went missing last night,
but he didn't come out of there.

618
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:26,418
I'm afraid we're guessing wrong.

619
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:29,529
Maybe the chief's intuition
isn't as good as it used to be.

620
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,124
He should quit watching
"Chief Investigator."

621
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:35,928
Hey, there's one thing
we're better at than the FBI.

622
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:37,436
Do you know what that is?

623
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:40,131
Intuition.

624
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,648
There's something fishy about that guy.

625
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:46,644
Oh, come on. FBI?

626
00:58:09,495 --> 00:58:12,595
Resume

627
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:28,483
Hey, hey! Wake up!

628
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:30,086
He's going out.

629
00:58:46,844 --> 00:58:50,455
-To the right.
-He keeps changing lanes.

630
00:58:50,553 --> 00:58:52,145
Did he find out?

631
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:57,318
Go after him. Don't lose him!

632
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:58,704
-It's strange.
-Don't lose him.

633
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,761
-I think he knows.
-Follow him closely!

634
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:05,208
Darn!

635
00:59:06,524 --> 00:59:10,706
Pull out! Darn!

636
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:14,314
-Pull out!
-We're the police!

637
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:15,608
Move your car!

638
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:21,419
Darn it.

639
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:39,039
I'm sorry.

640
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:43,331
Sorry.

641
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:46,236
That's fine.

642
00:59:47,044 --> 00:59:48,239
Hi, mom.

643
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:50,247
Did you have lunch?

644
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:56,848
I'll eat lunch with Professor Kim
to talk about the solo.

645
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,066
I'll drop by the studio and go home.

646
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:21,726
"Bongsoon starts in development"
is on tomorrow's schedule.

647
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:26,244
Make it after I leave the hospital.

648
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:27,029
Okay.

649
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:31,114
-When do you plan to leave?
-When?

650
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:32,613
Why?

651
01:00:34,421 --> 01:00:35,407
-Yes?
-Why?

652
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,110
Well.

653
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:43,723
Wearing a robe like he's in a hotel.

654
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,414
I think I should go now, sir.

655
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:49,501
-Okay.
-Bye.

656
01:00:50,302 --> 01:00:54,702
I'm sure there's a reason why
they ask you to wear their gown.

657
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:57,211
Do you have to stand out?

658
01:00:57,296 --> 01:00:59,601
Did I not tell you I hate matching colors?

659
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:02,893
Wearing patient gowns
doesn't help you recover faster.

660
01:01:08,673 --> 01:01:09,581
Gukdoo.

661
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:14,788
Bongsoon, I need you to come
with me to the police station.

662
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,593
Last night, we had another incident.

663
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:20,593
What? Another woman
got kidnapped last night?

664
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:23,895
-Yes, we need you to check.
-No.

665
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:27,086
Don't go.
Don't get involved anymore.

666
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,979
I can't do that.

667
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:30,987
-What?
-I should go.

668
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:34,996
I don't want you to get hurt!

669
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:39,978
It's fine if I get hurt.

670
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:42,795
But I really don't want you to get hurt.

671
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:46,985
I'll be right back.

672
01:01:50,383 --> 01:01:51,678
Darn.

673
01:01:56,976 --> 01:01:58,270
Bongsoon...

674
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:01,646
I will protect her!

675
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:06,248
What did you say? Hey, come back here!

676
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:10,670
I can't believe this.

677
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:18,659
You saw me, right?

678
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:20,754
See what?

679
01:02:21,964 --> 01:02:24,255
You saw me beat them up.

680
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,875
What about it?

681
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:29,776
That's why he hired you as his bodyguard.

682
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,878
You have to be good at something. Right?

683
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,996
-Bongsoon.
-Yes.

684
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:48,001
It's always like this between us.

685
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:50,706
-What?
-I mean...

686
01:02:51,191 --> 01:02:52,500
...the timing.

687
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:55,506
He got stabbed to protect you.

688
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:59,204
But I'm not glad at all that he did.

689
01:03:09,968 --> 01:03:12,466
Is it another young and skinny girl?

690
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:14,156
Yes, it's the same guy.

691
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,767
But our team is off the case.

692
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,482
Any clues about the kidnapper?

693
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:21,267
That's why we need your help.

694
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,981
-Help us out.
-Okay.

695
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,164
Let's go.

696
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:35,920
Oh, the Avengers Girl. How are you?

697
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,413
-Hello.
-Hi.

698
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:39,318
Bongsoon, this way.

699
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,612
-I was on my way home.
-Yes.

700
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:45,827
But in the left alley...

701
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:48,621
...I heard someone scream, "Help!"

702
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,223
So I went there.

703
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,324
-When I got closer,
-Sorry.

704
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:56,221
he was trampling on the girl.

705
01:03:56,306 --> 01:03:58,213
-Sorry.
-He ran away when he saw me.

706
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,724
-It's him.
-Are you sure?

707
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:03,504
Yes, I'm sure. It's him.

708
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,098
Gukdoo.

709
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:08,698
-They caught him.
-What?

710
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:17,379
We have breaking news.

711
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:27,842
What happened?

712
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:29,842
They caught the criminal.

713
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,429
-It's not Janghyeon.
-What?

714
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:38,719
But it's that voice.

715
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:41,323
He's the criminal! I'm sure!

716
01:05:14,902 --> 01:05:16,704
"Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"

717
01:05:16,804 --> 01:05:20,101
-Do you still like Gukdoo?
-My heart races when I see him.

718
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:22,001
Let's meet tomorrow.
I need to talk to you.

719
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:24,295
I have something to say.
I have to say it now.

720
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:27,184
-I'm really confused.
-What on earth are you doing?

721
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:30,478
-You sensed it, too.
-Fight me. Isn't that more fair?

722
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,284
Where are the women?

723
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:35,082
Gukdoo is out of his mind!
He's not on the team anymore!

724
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:38,375
Why did you put him with her?
He's really harsh on the newbies.

725
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:41,579
-Does he have a twin brother?
-I am the rabid dog here!

726
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:43,577
Let's see who wins.

727
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:45,669
Oh Dong... Byung?

728
01:05:46,262 --> 01:05:47,757
Did you really intentionally
let yourself get stabbed?

729
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:51,153
-Yes.
-Do you have to be with him?

730
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:53,656
Bongsoon. Bongsoon!

731
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,664
-You don't have to do this.
-I have to.

732
01:05:58,156 --> 01:05:59,555
I think, I should.
