1
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:01,680
She's not normal at all.

2
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:12,299
Bang!

3
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:16,358
Oh, yeah. That's it.

4
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:19,391
I'll fight with my bare fists.

5
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,779
Nuclear punch. Yes, yes.

6
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,011
"Cool Gukdoo"

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,125
Hello?

8
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,336
Are you staying
in his house again tonight?

9
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,293
No, I'm home.

10
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,687
I'm telling you as a friend.
You're not a kid anymore.

11
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:40,988
You're old enough to get married.

12
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,617
Think like a grown-up and be modest.

13
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,765
What did I do?

14
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,848
Just listen to me.

15
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,810
Okay. Is that why you called?

16
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,487
That criminal saw your face.

17
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:55,559
I think you should change your hairstyle
and try to wear different clothes.

18
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,090
Don't worry.

19
00:02:57,283 --> 00:03:00,115
And give Bonggi my thanks.

20
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,366
-About what?
-About Heeji.

21
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:05,873
-He helped her in the hospital.
-You can thank him yourself.

22
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,271
Heeji already did.
I don't want to repeat it.

23
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,788
Then why should I?

24
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:14,346
Are you mad at something?
Why are you so sensitive?

25
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:18,007
I also get mad and hurt!

26
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,900
I have feelings.
And my feelings get hurt!

27
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,285
Do Bongsoon!

28
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:25,633
What?

29
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,370
We're friends.

30
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:31,287
So everything I say is for your own good.

31
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:35,355
Stop it! I know we're friends. Bye!

32
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:40,787
I've never hung up on him first.

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,286
Lately, it's not only getting hard to
control my strength, but also my feelings.

34
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,301
"Rude Boss"

35
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:03,174
-Hello?
-Are you feeling better?

36
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:06,156
I was feeling better
until I answered your call.

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,899
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,614
Why did you call?

39
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,419
Listen, I'm just really curious.

40
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,457
But how strong are you?

41
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,363
-Are you...
-Am I what?

42
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,674
I mean are you...

43
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,836
...a man?

44
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:29,921
Why are all my bosses crooked,
perverts, or psychos?

45
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,276
You can be honest with me.
Your secret is safe with me.

46
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,554
Why? Will you date me if I'm a man?

47
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:38,155
Did you disturb my privacy
at this hour to ask me that?

48
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,346
I'm just very curious.

49
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,895
How can you be so strong?

50
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:43,057
Does that make any sense?

51
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,719
Is your toe okay?

52
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,053
Why would it be okay?

53
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,893
It's even more sore at night.

54
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,873
I can't imagine how painful it is
for Mr. Kong and his tailbone.

55
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:59,155
I don't know what I'll do if I get mad.

56
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,989
If you call me late at night
and speak nonsense...

57
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,378
...I don't know where
I'll trample on next time.

58
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,040
-Are you threatening me?
-Oh, no.

59
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,311
How could I dare to threaten my boss?

60
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,981
Hey! Can you also crack...

61
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:18,840
...a rock with your head?

62
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:22,243
You can find that out tomorrow
right away when I hit your head...

63
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:25,559
...and see if your head cracks or not!
I'm hanging up!

64
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,662
-What a lunatic!
-What a lunatic!

65
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,358
Gukdoo.

66
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,469
No!

67
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,768
No, no, no. No!

68
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:53,779
Gosh, that was so dirty.
What a dirty dream!

69
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,020
Dirty! So dirty!

70
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:58,752
Dirty! Dirty!

71
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,721
Dirty! Dirty!

72
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,514
Do you see anything?

73
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,911
Not yet.

74
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,993
Lieutenant In, did we get any reports of
a missing person in Dobong-dong?

75
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,857
-Did you check?
-I checked all the reports.

76
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,751
Most of them are people
that ran away from their homes.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,071
In the 153rd episode of
"Chief Investigator"...

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,441
...nobody reported a kidnapped woman
missing for ten days.

79
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,120
Why? Because she lived alone
and she was always so unruly...

80
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,216
...that everyone thought
she's just wandering around.

81
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:39,246
But the milkman reported it to the police
because she hadn't paid for her milk.

82
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:46,236
That report became the clue to
catching the serial killer of women.

83
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:50,645
The hermits that live alone
are the problem.

84
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,654
Nobody reports them as missing.

85
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:56,056
Both Jung Hyangsook
and Kim Jiwon lived with their families.

86
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,022
Did they?

87
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:05,218
So now he could be after
a woman that lives alone.

88
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:06,975
That is highly possible.

89
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:11,711
Do we have the results of
the footprints from forensics?

90
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,971
We'll get it today in the afternoon.

91
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,090
Is that true?

92
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,010
Are the rumors true?

93
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:19,776
No!

94
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,851
What are you talking about?
It's not true.

95
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,209
So your brother has business
in the redevelopment project.

96
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,999
No, Jinyi. That's not true.

97
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:36,783
My brother will be selling the shops,
but someone else owns them.

98
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,961
-Hosoon, get me a drink.
-Yes, ma'am!

99
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,993
Exactly! The reason you're
supporting the redevelopment...

100
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,277
...is because your brother is connected.

101
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,222
Just a little.

102
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,919
I don't think that's right.

103
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:55,790
The others might think we're doing this
for the sake of money too.

104
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,170
-Exactly.
-Oh, come on, girls.

105
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:03,245
Why don't we do this?
If you turn a blind eye...

106
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:08,835
...I'll ask my brother to give you
the best spot without commission.

107
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,230
I promise! I promise.

108
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,320
Really?

109
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:18,157
I don't think we should
discuss it among us.

110
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,060
We should get professional advice.

111
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,392
Professional advice? From whom?

112
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,912
I can see it. I can see it.

113
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,257
You'll make money but...

114
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,943
...some man will throw
a wrench in the works.

115
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:38,590
What?

116
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,529
Man, not woman?

117
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:45,029
Who? Gukdoo's mother? That novelist?

118
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,205
It's not a writer.
It's someone with a knife.

119
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:52,754
You were against the redevelopment
for four years and now you're for it.

120
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,843
The original company that planned it
won't sit back and do nothing.

121
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:58,945
They'll definitely hire thugs.

122
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,243
You don't need to be...

123
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,318
...a fortune teller to know that.

124
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,076
So, do we eventually win or lose?

125
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:13,110
The one that holds the blade can't
defeat the one holding the handle.

126
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,378
You need to consider this issue
for a long time.

127
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:20,565
The ones making the decisions
have the last word. You get it?

128
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,192
You should buy them off.

129
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:33,155
Then go ahead with it and the price
will go up fourfold in three years.

130
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,750
Oh, my goodness. Fourfold.

131
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:41,284
Okay, now that's settled.

132
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:45,427
It's about my daughter Bongsoon.
She just got a job recently.

133
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,349
Is there any way she can get
involved with her boss romantically?

134
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,476
Your fee first.

135
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,455
Tell me her birthday again.

136
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,050
August 15, 1991. 2:30 AM.

137
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,711
I want them to sleep together.

138
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,976
That's the fastest way
for a romantic relationship.

139
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,854
Good morning, Mr. An.

140
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:20,535
It says "P" today.
What does it mean?

141
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:21,955
Come here.

142
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:23,521
You're not going to see the doctor?

143
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,621
You didn't tell the doctor you left.
They're looking for you.

144
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:27,618
Just come here.

145
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:28,833
Okay.

146
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,102
Quickly!

147
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,820
Stand there.

148
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,227
Okay.

149
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,262
Okay.

150
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:40,600
The "P" in the schedule
stands for 'private'.

151
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:45,242
You said you're not good
with four character idioms.

152
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,069
Then I'll make it five characters.

153
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,041
Privacy,

154
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:50,669
which means my private life.

155
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:51,678
Oh my gosh.

156
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:54,270
Whoa. Half of your schedule is "P."

157
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,368
Of course.
My dream is being the idle rich.

158
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,264
I'm living my dream.
It's almost a dream come true.

159
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:01,642
Isn't that awesome?

160
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:07,345
Oh. I haven't found the bike yet.
The police will never find it.

161
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,501
So I enlisted the help of some people.

162
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,486
How?

163
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,479
Let's say I used some cash.

164
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,268
-And did they find it?
-No, not yet.

165
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,575
I'm hungry. Cook me something.

166
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,701
Am I your maid?

167
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:23,177
Do you know the pain I'm feeling...

168
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,977
...in the two sesamoid bones between
the metatarsus and phalanges?

169
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:30,168
Oh? Did you just grumble?

170
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:34,306
You're the offender and I'm the victim.
Are you treating the victim badly?

171
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,718
No. Stay here.

172
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,284
I'll cook.

173
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,059
I'm on my way.

174
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,263
It's one meal a day!
I need a hearty breakfast!

175
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:48,034
-Make lots of dishes.
-Okay.

176
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,277
This is nice.

177
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,677
Leave that there!

178
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,467
Don't touch it!

179
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:11,958
Hands off.

180
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,696
Abalones.

181
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:19,910
And...

182
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,490
Have this.

183
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,444
What?

184
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:07,212
I said I wanted rice.

185
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:11,105
An apple in the morning
keeps the doctor away. Drink up.

186
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,592
I want rice.

187
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,995
I want rice!

188
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:25,305
Rice!

189
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,485
I want rice!

190
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,186
What? Really?

191
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,554
She's very lucky in her career.

192
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:35,643
She is extremely, extremely lucky!

193
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:38,888
A career for a woman is her husband.

194
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,213
She'll marry a good man.

195
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,566
But she said her boss is gay.

196
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:47,542
Why do you want to marry off
your daughter to a dog?

197
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:50,345
-Is she really your daughter?
-Not a dog but a homosexual.

198
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:57,754
Then, one will overpower the other.

199
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:01,200
Do you mind if he hits her?

200
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:03,727
I don't think she'll get hit.

201
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,308
It's always like this with him.
He's half right and half wrong.

202
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,798
Who do we have to buy off, then?

203
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,339
The head of the borough, I suppose.

204
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,309
I think it's the police.

205
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,611
They hold the handle.

206
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:23,055
Then, wouldn't it be gangsters?
Maybe it's the leader of the gang.

207
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,120
Jeez. How can you interpret it like that?

208
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,213
My goodness.

209
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,198
No?

210
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,500
But is that good-looking man really gay?

211
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,913
That's what she said.

212
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:41,704
He's an appetizing red apple
from the neighbors' tree.

213
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:47,404
But the apple isn't edible.
It's so disappointing.

214
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:49,836
Is breakfast ready?

215
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:13,372
It looks like my mom's cooking.

216
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,218
Delicious.

217
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:56,487
I came out because
I couldn't stand looking at him.

218
00:16:56,576 --> 00:17:00,910
He hired me as a bodyguard
and should use me those kind of work.

219
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,243
Why does he ask me things
he should ask a maid?

220
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:06,926
Okay, Bongsoon. Calm down.

221
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:10,183
You trampled on his foot.
You can't complain.

222
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,810
No, no! He ignores the police.
He ignores the laws.

223
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:16,777
The whole world revolves around him.

224
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,287
It's like he's the center of the universe.

225
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,460
Then why did he give me a walkie-talkie?

226
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,013
I didn't take this job
to cook for this fool.

227
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:28,535
Ms. Do!

228
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,816
I finished breakfast.

229
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:32,785
It was so good I had one more bowl.

230
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:35,922
I have to go out now. I need your help.

231
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,051
Yes, sir. I'm coming.

232
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,154
He ignores the police.
He ignores the laws.

233
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:44,485
The whole world revolves around him.

234
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:46,274
It's like he's the center...

235
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,496
What's this?

236
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,798
-"Did you hear? He's such a fool."
-What's this?

237
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,987
If you want to insult me,
you should leave my property.

238
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,654
This is breach of contract.

239
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:04,615
What breach of contract?

240
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:09,021
You shall not defame your boss. Get it?

241
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:12,024
That's not defamation.

242
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:16,362
-He's such a fool.
-"Fool. Fool. Fool!"

243
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:19,932
-That really is defamation.
-It was an affectionate "fool."

244
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:21,934
-What?
-And...

245
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:26,754
I didn't call you a retard, bastard,
lunatic or a pervert.

246
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:30,010
It was just fool.
How is that defamation?

247
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,374
It is a derogatory term you use
to label someone as below average...

248
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:37,320
...while at the same time
feeling less guilty. Am I wrong?

249
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,718
You're totally wrong!

250
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:43,322
Anyone could be a fool sometimes.
Why do you think I insulted you?

251
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,944
-Oh, really?
-Yes!

252
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,529
Okay. Shall we get back to work, then?

253
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:51,894
Okay.

254
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,019
Aren't you going to help me?

255
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,494
I thought you could walk.

256
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,242
It's very painful.

257
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm so tired.

258
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,712
-Can't you run fast?
-I finish 100 meters in 28 seconds.

259
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,201
I mean in 26 seconds.

260
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:23,450
Why are you so slow? You fool.

261
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:27,910
What? It was just an affectionate "fool."
Why stare at me like that?

262
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,803
It's so uncomfortable
to have one toe cracked.

263
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,843
I can't walk anymore!

264
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,643
-What?
-I can't breathe.

265
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,525
I feel nauseous.

266
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,043
The excuses you make.

267
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,277
Oh?

268
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:54,244
-What's wrong with this?
-Oh?

269
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,531
Hey! Come here!

270
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,099
Get up. Come on.

271
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:01,901
-What's going on?
-A gun!

272
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,122
Mr. An!

273
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:25,407
Mr. An! Are you okay?

274
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,502
You're bleeding.

275
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:22,621
Are you awake?

276
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,244
It hurts! It hurts!

277
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:26,987
Are you okay?

278
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,877
-You did that intentionally, right?
-Of course not.

279
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:31,444
I'm so relieved.

280
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:34,776
The bang was so loud
I thought it cracked something.

281
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:37,476
-Is your arm okay?
-My head hurts more!

282
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,942
I feel like I'm going to die.
Am I alive?

283
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,064
Yes, you're very much alive. Don't worry.
I'll take you to a hospital.

284
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:45,724
Which doctor should I see?
An orthopedist? A surgeon? A neurosurgeon?

285
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,113
-I'll take you to a general hospital.
-No. Take me home.

286
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:54,274
-You hurt your arm. You got shot.
-It's a metal bead, not a bullet.

287
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:57,210
But anyways, you're bleeding.
I'll take you to a hospital.

288
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,735
Do you always go to a hospital
if you bleed? The problem is not my arm.

289
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:03,815
-I feel like my skull is splitting in two.
-Your skull?

290
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,953
-How many do you see?
-Two.

291
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,329
From my experience,
your nut doesn't split so easily.

292
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,796
-Nut? What?
-I'm starting the car.

293
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,194
Let's go!

294
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,356
We should hurry.

295
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:22,336
I think I'm bleeding from my head.

296
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:25,711
It hurts! It hurts!

297
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:31,416
Mr. An, from what I can see,

298
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,141
you are dehydrated, so...

299
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,209
Don't talk to me.

300
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,043
Drink some water.

301
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,009
Oh, I should disinfect the wound.

302
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:54,385
Does it hurt?

303
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,089
Please stand the sting.

304
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,685
Does this make any sense?

305
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:43,894
It doesn't. How can they shoot
you with a metal bead?

306
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,409
That's not what I'm talking about.

307
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:49,528
You lifted a man weighing
70 kilograms like nothing and ran.

308
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,277
How strong are you actually?

309
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:58,587
Now that I think of it,
you're weird in many ways.

310
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:02,274
You beat up all those strong men
at once the first time I saw you.

311
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:05,368
Mr. Kong used to be a marine
but he hurt his tailbone fighting you.

312
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,191
He's so embarrassed he won't see anyone.

313
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,647
And the weirdest thing is...

314
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,167
...you ran with me in your arms.

315
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,117
You.

316
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,553
What exactly are you?

317
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,728
Well, you see...

318
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:23,128
Are you taking some kind of drugs?

319
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,664
Or is it that you are...

320
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,709
..an alien?

321
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:31,228
Or are they experimenting
a new drug on you?

322
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:35,056
Stop it.
That's not what matters right now.

323
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:39,745
Thank god it was a metal bead.
What if it was a real bullet?

324
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,487
Are you worried about me?

325
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:44,016
I'm telling you as your bodyguard.

326
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:48,153
Yes, you were supposed to protect me!

327
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,525
You never listen!

328
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,239
How does it feel to get shot?

329
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:02,976
Today was a metal bead.

330
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,670
The next time it will be a bullet.

331
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,798
Who are you?

332
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:09,741
What do you want, you jerk?

333
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:14,711
Give up Osung Group.
Tell your father you won't succeed him.

334
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,072
If you don't, I will disintegrate Ainsoft.

335
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:21,120
Who are you to disintegrate Ainsoft?

336
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:22,876
Then go for it!

337
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,300
Mr. An, are you okay?

338
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,201
Let's talk later. You can go home.

339
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,020
-I'll stay with you.
-I'm fine. I want to be alone.

340
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,609
Will you be alright alone?

341
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,874
Don't worry.
I have something to do on my own.

342
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:55,374
What?

343
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:02,489
Always so full of whim.

344
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,607
Always do as he pleases.

345
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:11,012
Yesterday he was scared to be alone
and begged me to stay with him.

346
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:45,342
I want to leave this house.

347
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:48,841
I don't want troubles with my brothers.

348
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:53,804
I want to live doing what I want to do.

349
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,962
Enjoy.

350
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:31,717
-See you.
-Thank you.

351
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,763
Bongsoon, you're already home?

352
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:53,022
-Did you get fired again?
-No, dad. Do you think I always get fired?

353
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,972
-What about lunch?
-What about you?

354
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,808
I had breakfast late. I'm not hungry.

355
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,273
Can I help you with anything?

356
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:04,318
None.

357
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:05,786
Here, have this.

358
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:06,985
Thanks.

359
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:10,207
-Where's mom? Hanging out again?
-Yes, you know.

360
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:13,411
-It's hard for you too.
-Same goes for you.

361
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,844
Go home and get some walnuts.
There's a 30 kg delivery at 4:00 p.m.

362
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,066
-Okay, I'll get them and crack them all.
-Thanks.

363
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:25,037
Bongsoon!

364
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,238
Huh?

365
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:37,958
Take this.

366
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,498
Dad...

367
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:46,463
-Dad.
-Take it.

368
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,254
I can't take this.

369
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:50,177
Alright.

370
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:54,743
-Here.
-Dad.

371
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,600
You have more?

372
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:59,245
Take it, take it.

373
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,097
-Take it.
-Dad.

374
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:12,774
That's like my blood.

375
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:16,220
Your mom will kill me if she finds out.

376
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,080
Bongsoon, what's with these clothes?

377
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:23,004
Buy yourself some pretty clothes.

378
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,731
Dad...

379
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:28,454
-Okay, okay.
-Thank you.

380
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,546
-I'm leaving.
-Go, go.

381
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,629
Is Gukdoo not coming?

382
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,358
It's just me.

383
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:54,706
Oh, I see.

384
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,509
My finger is feeling much better
thanks to you.

385
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,220
The professor is an expert in that field.

386
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:01,300
I see.

387
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:03,402
Excuse me.

388
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:09,836
What would you like?

389
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:12,080
The spinach pasta is good here.

390
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:13,901
Then I'll have that.

391
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:16,487
-I'll have the same.
-Okay.

392
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,856
I heard a lot about you.

393
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,479
You and Gukdoo were
rivals in high school.

394
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,304
Did Gukdoo say that?

395
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:29,986
Jeez. I'm not sure if I should reveal
the truth to his girlfriend.

396
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,626
It's okay. You can tell me.

397
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:35,045
What makes you think he's my rival?
I fed him and clothed him.

398
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,683
He was under me.
He couldn't even sit at my table.

399
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:41,106
You're so funny.

400
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:43,875
You think I'm kidding. It's true.

401
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,044
-Really?
-Really.

402
00:31:00,413 --> 00:31:01,658
Thank you!

403
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,304
Hello?

404
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:08,004
Where are you?

405
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:23,052
-Hey.
-Yes!

406
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,650
-Did you pick up all the garbage?
-Yes!

407
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:29,823
Boss!

408
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,053
Take us as your men!

409
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,367
Take us!

410
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:37,383
Be our boss! Teach us!

411
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,939
-Teach us!
-Teach us!

412
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:42,271
We were looking for the strongest one.

413
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,755
-We were!
-We were!

414
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,243
Why are the alleys so clean today?

415
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:50,203
-There's not one cigarette butt.
-It means there's less people...

416
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,245
That's not it.

417
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:01,144
Crime-free Dobong-dong.
Clean Dobong-dong.

418
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:03,689
We filed so many complaints
to the borough.

419
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:06,594
I guess they finally...

420
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:07,526
It's here, sir.

421
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,863
"Dobong Walnut"

422
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:18,179
-Welcome!
-Welcome.

423
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,892
Thanks. Hello.

424
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:22,783
Oh.

425
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:25,789
Two walnut pies...

426
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:29,735
...two egg tarts and two drinks, please.

427
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:33,366
Oh, right.
Ten packs of walnut cookies, too.

428
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,354
-Ten?
-Yes.

429
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:38,790
How much is it?

430
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,460
84,000 won, sir.

431
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:52,887
Thank you.

432
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:59,198
He's Do Bongsoon's father.

433
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,033
We'll just stay for the pie.

434
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:03,208
Stop moving.

435
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,368
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

436
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:26,392
-From the borough?
-Policemen?

437
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,940
Just customers.

438
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:51,914
Excuse me.

439
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,632
You can cut it in smaller pieces.

440
00:33:57,721 --> 00:33:58,559
Oh.

441
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,969
Do you have tools...

442
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,523
Tools? Oh!

443
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,088
Thank you.

444
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,054
Why didn't we think of this?

445
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:43,620
Boss, the world is so dark
and you are the light!

446
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:45,735
You're the hope!

447
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:47,133
Take us in.

448
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:48,726
-Take us in!
-Take us in!

449
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:56,030
Hey!

450
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,121
The ball!

451
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:00,339
Pass the ball!

452
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,458
-This?
-Yes.

453
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:04,669
Sure.

454
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,186
Oh, my goodness!

455
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:14,854
-Boss!
-That's...

456
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,781
-What is that?
-I'm sure!

457
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,653
It's a UFO! Dobong-dong is amazing!

458
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,374
We must build a building here!

459
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,186
Yes, Dobong-dong!

460
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,746
Boss!

461
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,835
-See you again!
-See you again!

462
00:35:36,454 --> 00:35:40,188
-Boss, we love you!
-We love you!

463
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:42,421
You're the best!

464
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,399
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

465
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:47,887
-Boss, we love you!
-We love you!

466
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:51,687
-We love you!
-You're the best!

467
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:55,920
-Boss, we love you!
-We love you!

468
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,977
Boss!

469
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:07,686
High school.

470
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,370
A time where you go
through a stormy period.

471
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:16,442
A time where you're crazy enough to not
believe the earth revolves around the sun.

472
00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:19,078
I had my high school days, too.

473
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:23,882
Now that I think of it,
it was really a stormy period.

474
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:25,958
Was it because of studies, you ask?

475
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:28,487
No way.

476
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:35,487
This rock here is known as the shaky rock.

477
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:39,436
This rock can be shaky...

478
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,210
...but it will never fall
even when pushed.

479
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:44,955
Whether 10 or 100 people push it...

480
00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:53,878
I've caused some trouble to my country.

481
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,447
Oh? What happened? What should I do?

482
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,840
-Bongsoon, come here!
-What do I do?

483
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,412
It's not like that?

484
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,653
Oh, no!

485
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,219
What are you doing there?

486
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,087
What was that?

487
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,053
I've broken countless things.

488
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:32,721
And it was during high school that
I decided to hide my strength forever.

489
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,531
I like women that are as light
and soft as the cosmos.

490
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,124
Someone you want to protect.

491
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:46,120
More so than getting cursed
if I used my strength unjustly...

492
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,336
...Gukdoo's words scared me.
So I concealed my strength even more.

493
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,955
I took handicraft classes
as an after-school activity.

494
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,820
Though I couldn't finish a muffler...

495
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,021
...because they canceled it
for lack of applicants.

496
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,888
College admission was
just around the corner.

497
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,591
I never liked studying
and I spent all day knitting...

498
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,719
...so I had to face reality.

499
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:28,072
Please help Bonggi get admitted to
Hansei University's medical school.

500
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:32,202
And please help Bongsoon
get admitted to any college.

501
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:38,216
I don't care where. Just any college.

502
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:43,132
Pray earnestly with all you heart.

503
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,656
You didn't study. Pray, at least.

504
00:38:57,823 --> 00:39:01,972
I don't care about college.
Please let me date In Gukdoo.

505
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:10,415
I read about Buddha when I was nine
and I was extremely inspired by him.

506
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:14,854
I thought I'd pray to him trusting in
his knowledge and reputation...

507
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:20,053
...but that day, I couldn't trust him.

508
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,031
-He was laughing at me.
-Hey, In Gukdoo!

509
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:27,232
Congratulations.

510
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,201
You're dating Juyoung?

511
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,021
Yeah, it happened.

512
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,153
And you made it to the police academy.

513
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:37,573
Now you're even dating
the most popular girl.

514
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:38,920
I envy you.

515
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,045
Let's go to the cafeteria.

516
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,354
Thank you so much, Buddha.

517
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:59,231
Bonggi got admitted to Hansei University's
medical school thanks to you.

518
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,156
And please don't forget
about my poor Bongsoon.

519
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:05,864
Help her study one more year.

520
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:08,292
It doesn't have to be a four-year college.

521
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,607
Please help her get admitted
to a junior college, at least.

522
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:15,497
It can be a corrupt college.
That doesn't matter at all.

523
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:19,450
Please, help her.

524
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:22,104
Please.

525
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:23,854
Jeez.

526
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,430
Hey! Hey!

527
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,710
What are you doing? Come out.

528
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:01,754
-What happened?
-What's going on?

529
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:03,492
How can this happen?

530
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,221
How did this happen?

531
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,850
He turned his back on me first.

532
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:27,737
Look. I bought this with
the money dad gave me.

533
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,887
"Cool Gukdoo"

534
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,331
-Hello?
-It's me. Where are you?

535
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,177
-I'm home.
-Let's meet up. I'll go there.

536
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:43,226
But...

537
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:46,971
It's true that we argued,

538
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,766
but my mom didn't like Jiwon.

539
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:56,080
Her father was ill, so she wanted
to get married quickly.

540
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,986
It's the voice of the fiancé
of the woman that got kidnapped.

541
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,992
Is this the voice you heard?

542
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:03,926
Call the detective.

543
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,745
It's an emergency. We have to
take her to the operation room.

544
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,154
No, it's not him.

545
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:11,996
Yeah, I thought so, too.

546
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,982
I hope you catch him.

547
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:20,763
Take care of yourself.

548
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:24,447
There are many bad guys that are after
feeble women like you.

549
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:27,800
Okay. Make sure to catch him.

550
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,081
Yes, I'll catch him.

551
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:34,488
How are things with Heeji?

552
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,287
She went to the countryside
for a concert.

553
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,285
To the countryside?

554
00:42:39,374 --> 00:42:43,527
Yes, they don't just perform in Seoul.

555
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:45,029
Oh...

556
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:48,705
How's everything?

557
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:49,634
What?

558
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,787
How's what?

559
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,224
Your job.

560
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:54,731
Just so-so.

561
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,989
Okay, get inside.

562
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:59,331
-Are you going to the station?
-Yes, I have to go.

563
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,446
Oh...

564
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:01,900
Gukdoo.

565
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,417
Cheer up. And don't skip meals.

566
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,014
You're my friend.

567
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,853
Don't worry about me
and get going. I'm off.

568
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:39,955
Kyungsim.

569
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,250
Gosh, you get so weak
every time you meet Gukdoo.

570
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:50,025
Do you want to see a late-night movie?
I feel so depressed.

571
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:52,758
Great! There are always lots of seats
for late-night movies.

572
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:56,988
-I'm home.
-Hi.

573
00:43:57,086 --> 00:43:58,760
-I want water.
-Okay.

574
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:03,580
Do Bonggi, did you meet
Gukdoo's girlfriend?

575
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,084
Yes, for lunch.

576
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,203
She said she went to the countryside.

577
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,318
Bonggi, we're going for
a late-night movie.

578
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,597
-Do you want to join us?
-What the heck?

579
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:17,331
How did you know someone
replaced me for today's night duty?

580
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,221
-What? Really?
-What movie will you watch?

581
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:21,020
We haven't decided yet.

582
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:22,887
Cheer up, Bongsoon.

583
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:23,895
What's wrong?

584
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,418
It's me, Minhyuk.

585
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:42,455
Hi, Minhyuk. How are you?

586
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:43,760
I'm fine.

587
00:44:43,986 --> 00:44:47,185
It's hard to meet up with you.
You should play golf.

588
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,224
Dongseok.

589
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:51,412
I need your help.

590
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,331
Why? What happened?

591
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,449
I've been blackmailed lately.

592
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:58,040
They even shot me with a slingshot.

593
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:01,132
-Isn't that funny? Like it's a joke.
-What?

594
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:03,665
Who on earth would do that?

595
00:45:03,754 --> 00:45:05,154
That's what I have to find out.

596
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:09,540
But I think it's one of you.

597
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:14,178
-No way!
-Do you know what he asked?

598
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:16,875
He asked me to give up Osung Group.

599
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,765
Who do you think wouldn't
want me to succeed dad?

600
00:45:19,854 --> 00:45:20,609
Are you serious?

601
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:22,881
And he's so infantile.

602
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:25,407
He's not blackmailing the CEO of Ainsoft.

603
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:28,232
It's like he's blackmailing the cowardly,
seven-year-old An Minhyuk...

604
00:45:28,348 --> 00:45:30,332
...who would get terrified by it.

605
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,462
I'm sorry, Minhyuk.

606
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,377
I want you to help me find out who he is.

607
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:36,631
It's either An Dongha or An Kyunghwan.

608
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:38,315
How can I help you?

609
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,193
Go and tell them.

610
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,007
If I catch them,

611
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:45,914
I'll kill them.

612
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,454
That I'm not the seven-year-old boy.

613
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:52,864
I told you. Stay away from my room!

614
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:55,248
-You came in my room!
-You touched my stuff.

615
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,121
-You did.
-Get in there.

616
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,488
-Get in there.
-Get in there!

617
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:00,977
-Come on!
-Get inside!

618
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,818
-For stepping into my room.
-Yes, right!

619
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:05,098
-Get inside.
-And stop crying.

620
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:10,269
No! Open, please. I'm sorry!

621
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,158
I'm sorry!

622
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,887
Don't do that!
Don't do that, Kyunghwan!

623
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:17,889
He's getting out of breath!

624
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,308
-Open it!
-Don't do this!

625
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:22,954
Minhyuk, are you okay?

626
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:26,077
Come out. It's okay now.

627
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,941
Hey, 9:40, 10:40, 11:00.
Which one do you want?

628
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:58,239
-Anything.
-Then the R-rated one.

629
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,030
When does this start?

630
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,820
What are you doing?

631
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,988
I'm going to the movies.

632
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,225
With whom?

633
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,460
With a friend.

634
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:12,631
I want to join you.

635
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,321
Darn. He's so senseless.

636
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,272
Who is it?

637
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:18,423
My boss.

638
00:47:18,512 --> 00:47:20,432
-What does he want?
-He wants to join us.

639
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,254
-Great! Say yes.
-No!

640
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:23,766
-Why?
-He's crazy.

641
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:25,954
He's not. Tell him to come!

642
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,449
-Whoa.
-What?

643
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,465
I'll buy the tickets. How many?

644
00:47:30,554 --> 00:47:34,585
That's great! Let's invite him, please.
Come on!

645
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:44,921
Oh?

646
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:48,388
-They're going somewhere.
-Where do you think they're going?

647
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:51,335
I don't know.

648
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:57,342
Follow her. Smoothly.

649
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,505
How is that sad?

650
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,054
It's the saddest movie ever!

651
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,489
I hope they never make a sequel!

652
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:15,072
Oh, she's back.

653
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:23,366
Oh! My sister cries
when she watches superhero movies...

654
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:27,798
...like Hulk, The Avengers
and Spider-Man.

655
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:30,401
Why?

656
00:49:32,212 --> 00:49:34,320
Are you sad that Hulk's pants got ripped?

657
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,546
Or that Spider-Man feels stuffy
in his mask?

658
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,636
The more I know you, the weirder you are.
Amazing.

659
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:46,427
Hey, why don't we go to a club
and chase your gloom away?

660
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:48,313
Let's go. I'll pay.

661
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,988
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

662
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:52,342
Exciting.

663
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:07,387
They're going to a club.

664
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:12,109
She's having fun.
She seems to be very cheerful.

665
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:13,725
She sobbed during the entire movie.

666
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:17,882
She has a sentimental side as well.

667
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,585
Two guys, two girls.
Having fun in pairs.

668
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:23,920
And she has a normal sexual orientation.

669
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,684
She was holding the girl's hand.

670
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:26,924
Let's go.

671
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:28,943
I'm hungry.

672
00:50:29,353 --> 00:50:30,753
Where to? To the club?

673
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:35,113
Do you go to the club
when you're hungry?

674
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,849
You moron! Idiot!

675
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,721
Oh, but one of them was
An Minhyuk from Ainsoft.

676
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:47,854
He's inside already.

677
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,321
Drink, Bongsoon.

678
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,677
-Stop serving her.
-Let her drink all she wants!

679
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:03,190
It's okay! You drink, too!

680
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:07,598
-There. Bottoms up.
-Don't drink too much.

681
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:11,631
Let me pour for you, Mr. An.
Shall we make a toast?

682
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,506
Hold up your glasses.
One, two, three. Cheers!

683
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,921
-Bongsoon, let's go and dance.
-Stop drinking.

684
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,479
-Let's go!
-Okay!

685
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:25,221
Let's go!

686
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,001
Let's go.

687
00:51:36,754 --> 00:51:38,958
Hey, hey. Bongsoon!

688
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:50,461
Good.

689
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,842
-I think she's drunk.
-I know.

690
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:56,691
-She shouldn't get drunk.
-I know.

691
00:51:57,086 --> 00:52:00,553
She's already weird when she's sober.
She'll get weirder when she's drunk.

692
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:51,982
Where is she going?

693
00:53:03,587 --> 00:53:05,561
-What's going on?
-What happened?

694
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:08,655
-What happened?
-What went wrong?

695
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:09,733
My goodness.

696
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,146
What did she do?

697
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:13,255
Huh? Why is this...

698
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:21,568
What? What's going on?

699
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,288
What's happening?

700
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:27,355
Bongsoon!

701
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,855
-I'm sorry.
-Bongsoon!

702
00:53:31,654 --> 00:53:35,252
-Keep dancing. I'll take this away.
-Bongsoon! Bongsoon!

703
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:59,468
Gosh, what a headache.

704
00:54:05,953 --> 00:54:10,661
Are you crazy?
I can't believe what you did!

705
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:13,732
Why do you start hitting me
first thing in the morning?

706
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,587
Don't you remember
what you did last night?

707
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,902
What did I do?

708
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:20,067
Last night...

709
00:54:20,596 --> 00:54:24,359
...I went to the movies
and then we went to a club.

710
00:54:24,484 --> 00:54:29,433
And in the club, I think I danced...

711
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:41,520
Your handsome boss
brought you home last night.

712
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,532
-Really?
-Do you know what you did?

713
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,720
What did I do?

714
00:54:46,253 --> 00:54:48,411
-Did I throw up?
-That would have been better.

715
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,955
-Did I hit him?
-I'd rather you hit him!

716
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:54,661
Then what did I do?

717
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:02,287
-Mom!
-We're home. Hey.

718
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:07,269
-Gosh!
-You have to take your shoes off.

719
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,654
-Oh, my. Oh, my. Bongsoon!
-The floor is moving, mom.

720
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:16,331
Oh, wait a second.
Are you Bongsoon's boss?

721
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,803
-Yes.
-Mom!

722
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:23,855
Mom, he is really such a jerk.

723
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:30,865
What are you doing?
I never taught her to behave like this.

724
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,588
-I think she drank too much.
-Yes, she did.

725
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,765
Hey!

726
00:55:35,587 --> 00:55:36,442
Mom...

727
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:38,123
...he's gay.

728
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:40,971
Oh, right.

729
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:48,612
Hey!  You know what?
Log out of your gay mode!

730
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:51,364
Hey, what do you mean log out?

731
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:53,599
It's log in. Will you stop now?

732
00:55:53,687 --> 00:56:00,666
Hey, stop making a pass
at Gukdoo or I'll kill...

733
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,106
Bongsoon! You're not killing anyone.

734
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,666
-Let's go to your room.
-Yes, go.

735
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:10,321
Hey! Stop staring at Gukdoo's butt!

736
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,231
And if you touch his butt...

737
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,787
...I'm going to take your butt away!

738
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:20,722
Take what away?

739
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:22,422
Mom!

740
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:25,726
He's really, really a jerk.

741
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:32,295
I'm going to break all his teeth!

742
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:38,729
I want to be unemployed again!

743
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,027
-Let's go to your room.
-Yes, please. Take her.

744
00:56:41,116 --> 00:56:43,116
-Okay, one.
-Let me go!

745
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,991
-Two.
-You...

746
00:56:45,493 --> 00:56:47,260
-Three.
-Go to your room right now!

747
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,993
Marrying him is impossible now.

748
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,920
Go and beg for him to not fire you.
My goodness.

749
00:56:59,008 --> 00:57:01,733
This happened because
I stopped praying to Buddha.

750
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:03,353
My goodness. Seriously.

751
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:10,335
A big hole was made in my shameless life.

752
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:15,082
The enzyme that breaks down the alcohol
went on a vacation last night.

753
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:18,739
I lost my mind last night.

754
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:22,733
Wear sackcloth and ashes
and beg for his forgiveness!

755
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:24,063
Beg on your knees!

756
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:36,531
Sir, we have a report of a missing person
and I think it's connected.

757
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,710
She's 32 and she runs a ballet academy.

758
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,578
-A ballet academy?
-Yes.

759
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,487
Then she must be slender.

760
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:46,656
-She wouldn't weigh that much.
-That's exactly what I think.

761
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,765
-I think something's fishy.
-Yes, I think so.

762
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,887
Go and check her last whereabouts.

763
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,485
Sir! Sir, we have
the results from forensics.

764
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:02,165
The footprints are from
limited edition shoes sold last year.

765
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:04,820
-Designer shoes.
-Yes, designer shoes.

766
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:10,155
Then things are getting easy.
Then, let's check where they were sold.

767
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,098
Yes, sir.

768
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:27,393
Please don't hurt me!

769
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,554
Please don't hurt me!

770
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:35,379
Please...

771
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,554
You have to get well soon.

772
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,487
You're my second bride.

773
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:53,910
I like slim girls.

774
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:56,662
You must be slim to wear
the wedding dress.

775
00:58:56,986 --> 00:58:58,782
Only one meal a day, okay?

776
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:00,495
Please save me.

777
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:05,154
I won't.
A bridegroom never hurts his bride.

778
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:06,820
Why...?

779
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,801
Shut up.

780
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,654
I hate it when girls talk too much.

781
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:36,940
Please! Please save me!

782
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:39,109
Please don't hurt me.

783
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,315
Please save me.

784
00:59:45,787 --> 00:59:47,521
Please don't hurt me!

785
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,455
Mom!

786
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:56,020
Lee Juyoung. She runs a ballet academy.

787
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,359
She was last seen in a nearby pub
around eleven at night two days ago.

788
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,731
She called a designated driver.

789
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,378
I checked the driver's number
and it was a burner phone.

790
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:05,288
Track down that cloned phone.

791
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:07,721
Did you check the victim's number plate?

792
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,668
Yes, I found nothing in particular.

793
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:12,077
We should track the last route she took.

794
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:13,508
I want all of you...

795
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,188
...to move quietly.

796
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,720
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

797
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:32,964
First, I'll give him
a psychiatrist's note.

798
01:00:33,053 --> 01:00:37,032
I actually suffer from a serious
mental disorder and lose my mind at times.

799
01:00:37,187 --> 01:00:39,798
I could make him feel pity for me.

800
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,920
Second, I pretend nothing happened.

801
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,520
Third, he was also drunk so
I could put the blame on him.

802
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:49,181
Hey.

803
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:52,048
About your boss.

804
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,150
I don't think...

805
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,714
...he's gay.

806
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,918
Gay. Fourth,

807
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:02,054
I introduce him to a nice guy.

808
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:05,061
Maybe that's the best solution.

809
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:19,331
You know what?
Log out of your gay mode!

810
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,646
I want to be unemployed again!

811
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:28,251
I'm going to take your butt away!

812
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,491
Oh, Do Bongsoon.

813
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:48,605
Hi, Mr. An.

814
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:53,637
Did you sleep well?

815
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,265
Yes, I did. Did you?

816
01:01:56,354 --> 01:01:59,954
Yes, it wouldn't matter if
someone like me slept well or not.

817
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:02,585
What are you talking about?

818
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:06,854
Mr. An, give me a chance and I'll...

819
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:08,236
Did you have breakfast?

820
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:09,687
What?

821
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,968
No, not yet.

822
01:02:12,057 --> 01:02:15,431
Bongsoon, you know
I'm going to my office today.

823
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:16,897
I know.

824
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:18,168
Okay.

825
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,863
I'll see you in my office.

826
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:21,962
Have a hearty meal and take your time.

827
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,691
I'll go to work after working out.

828
01:02:23,884 --> 01:02:25,093
You don't have to come early.

829
01:02:25,901 --> 01:02:26,743
Okay.

830
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,961
Okay, see you later.

831
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,921
Yes.

832
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:36,194
This is how you'd feel when you didn't do
your homework and your teacher got sick.

833
01:02:38,323 --> 01:02:42,231
Why does he sound so gentle?

834
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,982
He's as kind as Jesus and Buddha.

835
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:50,587
Oh, you're a nice guy.

836
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,688
She's extremely cute.

837
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,254
She'll take my butt away. Wow.

838
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,111
That's very creative...

839
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:03,254
And sassy.

840
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:05,422
Sexy.

841
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:13,153
My goodness. She's so cute.

842
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:16,092
I want to bite her.

843
01:03:16,487 --> 01:03:19,778
Hey, no matter how I look at it,

844
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:21,248
I don't think he's gay.

845
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:28,533
Kyungsim, that's not important.
Character is all that matters in a person.

846
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:32,142
My boss is a very good person.

847
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,425
You said he's crazy. What happened to you?

848
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:42,121
I guess you can lose your mind sometimes
if you run a big company like that.

849
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:46,465
You insulted him saying
his head is full of poop.

850
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:49,555
You said he's obsessed
with clothes like a gigolo.

851
01:03:49,644 --> 01:03:53,987
No, no. He's just very stylish.

852
01:03:54,076 --> 01:03:55,877
I'm going to work.

853
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:57,792
See you in the evening. Bye!

854
01:03:58,253 --> 01:03:59,430
She's crazy. Crazy.

855
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:18,294
Sorry.

856
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,994
Sorry.

857
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,087
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

858
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:10,107
Why is she taking so long?

859
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:11,763
Do you think you're in your bedroom?

860
01:05:11,852 --> 01:05:13,319
He might be after my friend.

861
01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:16,757
-My friend?
-Don't you dare touch her.

862
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,711
-I'll give her a ride home.
-I'll pick her up.

863
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,787
-I'll give her a ride home.
-There are all sorts of rumors about her.

864
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:24,287
That she's a North Korean spy.
That she's an alien.

865
01:05:24,376 --> 01:05:27,443
-She really has no idea?
-There's something I'm good at...

866
01:05:27,535 --> 01:05:28,886
...which you don't know about it.

867
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,881
I've always hidden my strength.

868
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:35,787
It's not my fault that I'm strong!

869
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,310
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

870
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,706
-Let's go now.
-I don't think he's gay.

871
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:42,988
Is Do Bongsoon your friend?

872
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:45,985
-Go inside.
-I don't think it's a one-sided love.

873
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:50,133
Can you just stop doing something else
and just stay with me?
