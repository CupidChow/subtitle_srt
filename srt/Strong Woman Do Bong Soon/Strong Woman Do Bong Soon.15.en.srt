1
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:11,662
Go away. Please.

2
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,048
-Please go!
-I'm not leaving you alone.

3
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,014
-Please go!
-I'm coming with you.

4
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:20,621
Please go!

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,613
Bongsoon!

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,174
Don't cry!

7
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:36,452
There's not much time!

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,304
Please go!

9
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,012
Bongsoon!

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,601
I need to tell you something.

11
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,751
Please go!

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,298
There's not much time!

13
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,293
Please go away!

14
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,785
I'm not leaving you.

15
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:22,745
I'm here with you.

16
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:24,593
Don't be afraid.

17
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,270
Okay?

18
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,300
Please. Please, help me.

19
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:43,793
Please help me save him!

20
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:03,523
Book of Ability

21
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,030
Look at that!

22
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,408
It's okay.

23
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,351
You're fine.

24
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,907
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

25
00:03:58,554 --> 00:03:59,502
I'm fine.

26
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,912
You ruined your clothes.

27
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:05,897
I'll buy you more when I get paid.

28
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:08,924
Really? Promise?

29
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:09,951
Yes.

30
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,092
Bongsoon.

31
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:25,967
Let's go.

32
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,729
-Who is it?
-Dad. He wants me home quickly.

33
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,893
Let's finish this quickly.
He must be very worried.

34
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:56,991
What if I don't go home tonight?

35
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,333
What did you have in mind?

36
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:13,670
I didn't have anything in mind.

37
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:19,180
My gosh.

38
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:23,462
You drive me nuts.

39
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,297
Dad's waiting.

40
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:35,804
Let's finish this quickly.

41
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:41,697
You hurt your hand.
Let me drive, okay?

42
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:45,078
So you mean tonight...

43
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,097
We'll...

44
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,456
Do you want to...?

45
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,364
Hello?

46
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:03,044
-Yes, sir.
-Is it my dad?

47
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,943
Yes, I'm taking her home now.

48
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:11,071
Yes, we'll be there. Don't worry.

49
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:12,602
Bye.

50
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:17,357
Did my dad ask us to get home soon?

51
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:21,134
-I'll take you home.
-Okay.

52
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,611
-Go inside.
-Okay.

53
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,966
Go home and sleep tight.

54
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:58,842
You tell me to sleep tight
after what you told me?

55
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:11,086
Today was...
the happiest day of my life.

56
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,141
I'm going home. Bye.

57
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,672
There goes my good night's sleep.

58
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:33,073
Please go away!
Please go!

59
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:40,240
There's not much time!

60
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,242
Please go!

61
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,836
She asked me to go away.

62
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,040
To save me.

63
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,683
I'll never leave you alone.

64
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,992
Go away!

65
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,204
I'm not leaving you.

66
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:35,108
I'm here with you.
Don't be afraid.

67
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,688
I'll protect you like this.

68
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,979
So nothing can hurt you.

69
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,318
I'll protect you.

70
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:38,060
Today was...
The happiest day of my life.

71
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,378
What if I don't go home tonight?

72
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,088
It's driving me crazy.

73
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:48,123
What if I don't go home tonight?

74
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:39,898
What if...

75
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,305
...I don't go home tonight?

76
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,540
Darn!

77
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,116
I was just...

78
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,641
I missed you.

79
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:33,773
Did you sleep well?

80
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:37,738
Let's go.

81
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,727
Treat me.

82
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,173
Do I have something there?

83
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,664
No, I'm just looking.

84
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:54,307
Hello.

85
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,587
-Hello.
-Mr. Kong.

86
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:58,164
-When did you get here?
-I've been here since yesterday.

87
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,111
-How is your head?
-Fine. It's quite hard.

88
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,036
-I'm glad it is.
-At least your head is hard.

89
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,946
-Treat me.
-He's right there.

90
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,572
-Don't.
-Why not?

91
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,235
-He's right there.
-That's okay.

92
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,840
Mr. Kong, tell Mr. Oh
to come to my office.

93
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,993
-He went to the hospital.
-Why?

94
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,624
He got his feet caught
in the emergency exit...

95
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,800
...trying frantically to get out
of the building on his own.

96
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,214
He always seems to get caught somewhere.

97
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,231
Okay. Thank you.

98
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:36,097
Thank you.

99
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:40,914
Careful, sir.

100
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,409
Don't touch me!

101
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,319
Kwangbok?

102
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,798
Oh, my!

103
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,159
Who are you?

104
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:28,798
Why do I see myself in you?

105
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:31,390
We look so alike.

106
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,551
You might be my other self.

107
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,695
I'm in you!

108
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,957
Title, "Won Bin."

109
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,742
This cracks me up.
It's titled "Won Bin."

110
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:46,161
Then I'm Hyun Bin.

111
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:49,744
It's the poetry book that was left
in the temple by Baek Tak.

112
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,161
It's so touching.

113
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,434
Check out this poetry. Listen.

114
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,456
Title, "The Dog After the Chicken."

115
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,226
"The dog chased the chicken."

116
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,770
"The chicken was faster than the dog."

117
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,619
"The dog ended up staring at the roof."

118
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:10,107
"It turned out that the chicken
had long legs! Long legs!"

119
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:12,249
Wow!

120
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,956
I got goosebumps.

121
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,769
It looks like the perpetrator
left the building in the chaos.

122
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,113
The police will come later...

123
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:21,258
...to check the crime scene
and the footage from the cameras.

124
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,655
Okay. Give them our full cooperation.

125
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,163
-We will, Sir.
-You may go now.

126
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:26,081
Yes, Sir.

127
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,068
Where did she go again?

128
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,215
Kim Janghyeon.

129
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,907
I will catch you.

130
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,103
"Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement"

131
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:07,382
Comb the entire area
so he can't go anywhere.

132
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,416
Got it?

133
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,747
Please have a look.

134
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,515
-It's that guy.
-He's a really bad one.

135
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,205
I saw him on the news.

136
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,905
And he looks like a normal guy.

137
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,216
-I'm scared to walk the streets.
-So this guy...

138
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,103
"Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement"

139
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:26,138
How is this possible?

140
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:30,780
Gosh, I really don't get this.

141
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:35,837
What the heck is going on?
Where do we start?

142
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:40,384
That scum is driving me nuts!

143
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,133
He fell off a cliff, right?

144
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:47,528
He rolled down and drowned, right?
How can he still be alive?

145
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,592
That's what I wanted to ask.

146
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:55,469
But sir, the bomb squad said
the bomb exploded in the air.

147
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,294
-Because the CEO of Ainsoft threw it.
-What?

148
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,594
It just doesn't make sense...

149
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,400
...that a human could
throw it so far away.

150
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:10,001
He threw the bomb away?

151
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,595
-That Avengers girl, Do Bongsoon...
-Yes?

152
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,023
-She works in that building, right?
-Yes, sir.

153
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:20,159
He wasn't after An Minhyuk.

154
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,680
He was after that young lady, Do Bongsoon.

155
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,588
So he found out the secret
about your strength...

156
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:28,334
...and set up a trap.

157
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:30,337
That's what happened.

158
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:36,363
Kyungsim told me you lost your strength.

159
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:38,178
Are you okay?

160
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:40,610
Well, Gukdoo...

161
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,187
...I got it back. I'm strong again.

162
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,012
-Then did you throw the...
-Yes.

163
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,408
I threw the bomb.

164
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,520
Anyway, it's a relief.

165
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,760
But how did such a miracle happen?

166
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:02,489
I prayed with all my heart
to help me save him.

167
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,189
Did An Minhyuk...

168
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,418
...know that you were tied to the bomb?

169
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,993
Yes.

170
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,905
So he knew...

171
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,769
...and didn't leave you?

172
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:23,967
Yes.

173
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,176
I can't put this in my report.
Nobody would believe it.

174
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,731
-You should go inside.
-Okay.

175
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:40,623
Your coffee, sir.

176
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,748
I have to go and check the crime scene.

177
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:45,007
Okay. Don't skip your meal.

178
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,225
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

179
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,990
I'm so glad that you're safe.

180
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:02,287
And that you got your strength back.

181
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,791
Thanks.

182
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,608
I'm always here for you.

183
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:07,959
You know that, right?

184
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,618
I know.

185
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,061
That's why I always
feel reassured. Thank you.

186
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,606
You should go.

187
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:23,215
Things are still...

188
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,820
"Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement"

189
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,129
"Summary of All Updates"

190
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:45,624
The police went back.

191
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:50,197
We cooperated and showed them
the machine rooms and the rooftop.

192
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,642
-Good. Mr. Kong?
-Yes?

193
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:54,664
Let's make a special notice banner
to pop up...

194
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,613
...when the users access
our game servers.

195
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:58,452
That criminal, Kim Janghyeon.

196
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:00,382
We'll show his face
in the pop up notice...

197
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:03,058
...with all his details
and a bounty on his head.

198
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,669
To expose him as much as possible.

199
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:08,193
There will be no way out
for him this time.

200
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:09,592
I'll catch him.

201
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,994
-Son of a gun.
-Yes, Sir.

202
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,434
Sir...

203
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:25,813
I'm not sure if I should say this, but...

204
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:28,113
-No, never mind.
-What?

205
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:32,381
Well...

206
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:39,220
That cop that came today.
What's his name? Bokdoo?

207
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,473
-It's Gukdoo.
-Oh, yes.

208
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,006
-That cop...
-What about him?

209
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,660
Ms. Do...

210
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:52,029
I mean, he...

211
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:58,444
...hugged Ms. Do.

212
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,667
What?

213
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:12,690
He hugged her?

214
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:16,082
-I mean...
-When? Where? How?

215
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:19,454
Well, a while ago
in the lobby of the first floor.

216
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,447
What the hell?!

217
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:24,637
That prick...

218
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:30,694
-Show me.
-What, Sir?

219
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:36,260
How did he hug my girlfriend?
Show me how he hugged her.

220
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:39,351
-What?
-Show me how he did it!

221
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:40,895
Yes, sir.

222
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:44,410
-Show me exactly how he did it.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:47,245
Imagine that you're him
and show me how he hugged her!

224
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,111
-I'll be Bongsoon.
-Then I'll be Bokdoo.

225
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,322
-It's Gukdoo!
-Okay, okay.

226
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,850
That Gukdoo...

227
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:56,893
You have to bend over.

228
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:02,969
She's short, you know, and he's tall.

229
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:06,157
Yes, I think that's how it looked.

230
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:12,885
Gukdoo came up to her like a man,
and held her and hugged her.

231
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:18,934
She was in his arms comfortably
as if she was in her dad's arms.

232
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:21,379
I mean, her mom's arms.
Like a baby...

233
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,284
So warm.

234
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:06,093
No, it's not what you think.

235
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:08,935
What's wrong with you?

236
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:12,037
Let's get out.

237
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:16,281
Sorry, Sir.

238
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:17,877
Darn!

239
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,784
"Dobong-dong, District 6-4,
Redevelopment Plan"

240
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,519
"1. Development Plan
2. Location of Development"

241
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:28,441
Monk Zanimuddin, sir...

242
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,508
-It's Nizamuddin.
-Right.

243
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,030
Anyway, I did a background check on him.

244
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:38,186
Why did you check up on him?

245
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,818
But where on earth
did you meet that monk?

246
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:51,379
Do you remember when Mangwi
stabbed me three years ago?

247
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:55,349
Of course. It was a random attack.
I remember how you...

248
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,069
You ran for your life.

249
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:59,586
Hey! When did I run?

250
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:06,472
Well, he cured me
without any surgical operation...

251
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:09,735
...and only using
his energy restoration skills.

252
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:14,253
To show my gratitude,
I've been sponsoring him for two years.

253
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:17,957
Actually, the other day
when we went to the sauna...

254
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,064
..I saw a tattoo on his flank.

255
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:22,161
It was a map of Korea.

256
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:24,671
That's understandable.

257
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,297
He loves Korea.

258
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:31,954
But an arrow was pointing
somewhere to the southern sea...

259
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:33,570
...and it read "My home."

260
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:37,379
So what? He came to Korea to settle down.

261
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,513
It must be his second home!

262
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,027
Don't do useless things
and just focus on your work!

263
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:45,254
Right?

264
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:47,630
I thought so.

265
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:54,999
Don't look for me.

266
00:26:55,435 --> 00:26:58,288
I want to find myself.

267
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:03,114
Is he out of his mind?
He ran away from home?

268
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:07,186
What do we do, ma'am?
We don't have pies or tarts.

269
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:08,974
We can't do business today.

270
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:14,237
My goodness. He ran away from home?

271
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,396
Oh. Hello, Mr. Kong.
Where's Mr. An?

272
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,466
He must either be on the rooftop
or walking around the building.

273
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,961
He always does that
when he gets angry or too agitated.

274
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:10,961
-Angry? Why?
-Well, actually...

275
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:15,057
-Sorry.
-Mr. Kong!

276
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,363
My goodness.

277
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:31,009
Do Bongsoon!

278
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,103
Yes?

279
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:36,199
Mr. Oh, did you get hurt?
Oh, no. Are you okay?

280
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:38,475
Don't come close to me.

281
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,377
Should I make you coffee?
Oh, you were on it.

282
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:44,430
Who are you?
What on earth are you?

283
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:48,090
I told you. I'm Do Bongsoon
from Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu.

284
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:49,660
Go back to your planet.

285
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:52,950
-Leave Earth!
-Oh, come on. I'm not E.T.

286
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,253
-I can't leave Earth.
-My gosh.

287
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:59,313
Right, you like it with
a spoonful of sugar.

288
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:00,845
You shrewd wicked thing.

289
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:04,622
My eyes will witness your end.

290
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:07,206
Oh, come on.

291
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:14,084
Be nice to the newbies.
Don't be so mean to them.

292
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,690
They match. A spoon set.
Aren't they pretty?

293
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:22,961
It's a present.
Bye, then.

294
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,389
-Hello?
-It's me, An Minhyuk.

295
00:29:47,474 --> 00:29:49,647
-Yes, what is it?
-Are you available today?

296
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:50,992
I need to talk to you.

297
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:54,780
I need to talk to you, too.

298
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:58,175
-I'll text you when and where.
-Okay, you do that.

299
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,919
Hell... Hello?

300
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:06,271
I really can't find a way to like him.

301
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,435
You didn't have your one meal, did you?

302
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,903
Let's go and get lunch.

303
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:16,926
Forget about lunch.

304
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:19,885
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Huh?

305
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,016
There's one thing
I'd like to make clear...

306
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,060
Minhyuk.

307
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:33,033
Can I call you that
when it's just the two of us?

308
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:35,772
Darn it.

309
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,208
I have to be strict.

310
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,108
I can't let her butter me up.

311
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:47,192
What you call me doesn't matter.
What matters is how you feel...

312
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,774
Can I call you "Min-min"?

313
00:30:58,512 --> 00:31:00,947
I'm hungry.
Let's go and get lunch.

314
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:02,570
Okay? Let's go.

315
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:06,692
Oh, wait. What were you going to tell me?

316
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:07,841
It's all fine now.

317
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:12,155
Well, I give hugs to my employees, too.

318
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,118
Shall we eat? Let's go.

319
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:24,219
-So annoying.
-Look at what you're wearing.

320
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,538
What are you, an African chief?

321
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:28,217
-What's all that?
-What?

322
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:29,443
Spoons and chopsticks.

323
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:32,965
Does that help increase
your appetite? What is that?

324
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,428
This? Do Bongsoon did it to me.

325
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,751
She's the weirdest living thing
I've ever seen in my life.

326
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:45,889
Are you learning a new craft?
Like metal craft?

327
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:48,910
What? Forget it!

328
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:52,673
I think I deserve an explanation.

329
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,976
-What?
-Why were you two hugging?

330
00:31:55,535 --> 00:31:57,949
It was a reenactment.

331
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,474
-Oh, are you jealous?
-Gosh!

332
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:08,115
Why are you laughing at me?
Don't look at me!

333
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,685
You're crazy.
People are watching.

334
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:15,457
Since when were they so close?

335
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:17,795
You eat it like this.

336
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:25,390
Have some more.

337
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:26,522
It's so good.

338
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:30,795
I'm meeting someone after work.

339
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:31,848
Who?

340
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,324
A jerk that I can't find a way to like.

341
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:47,332
Who's this model?
Should we hire her?

342
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,688
She'd represent our game perfectly.

343
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:51,970
I guess.

344
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,334
Which one should I pick?

345
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,795
Let's pick this one.
You liked her from the beginning.

346
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,953
This. Remember this?

347
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:01,811
She's just to die for.

348
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,784
I'll show you another one.

349
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,431
When did I say that?

350
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,571
What are you talking about?

351
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,786
-But...
-I told you a male model will do.

352
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,467
Oh, come on!
We've never hired a male model.

353
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:23,260
You said they cost too much.

354
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:26,307
When did I say that?
What's wrong with you?

355
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:30,642
You said that!
You've always liked this model.

356
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:34,312
She looks scary.

357
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,174
-Why are her legs so long?
-But...

358
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,783
Get out. Get out.

359
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:41,319
What's wrong, sir?

360
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:45,094
Gukdoo, I need to talk to you.
Let's meet tonight.

361
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,771
Why are you...

362
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,470
Mr. An likes male models.

363
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,895
-Bongsoon...
-Bongsoon...

364
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,142
-Go ahead.
-No, you go ahead.

365
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:42,686
I need to make this clear to you.

366
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:45,736
-Bongsoon and I...
-Hold on!

367
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:50,363
Why do you keep talking down to me?

368
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,324
What on earth?

369
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:56,949
-Then talk down to me, too.
-I'm not disrespectful like you.

370
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:59,289
I don't talk down to people
that I'm not close with.

371
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,916
You think I'm talking down to you
because I consider you as a friend?

372
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:04,976
Who said I wanted to be your friend?

373
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,951
Exactly. So why are you
talking down to me right now?

374
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:09,657
Do you want to be my friend?

375
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,778
You're so ridiculous.

376
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,214
Do you...

377
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:25,250
...like Bongsoon?

378
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:28,165
Do I like Bongsoon?

379
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:34,069
How dare you ask me that.
Who are you to ask me that?

380
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:36,584
You're so full of yourself.

381
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,457
That's what I want to say.

382
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:41,427
Hey.

383
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,028
Stay away from my girlfriend.

384
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:52,201
I'm not taking this anymore!

385
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:55,419
You jerk.

386
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:58,637
We should have done this
a long time ago, right?

387
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,366
Yeah, it took us a while.

388
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,796
-You want a piece of me?
-Don't cry later.

389
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:04,883
You jerk.

390
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,233
What are you doing here?
How did you know?

391
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:12,402
-She came to see me.
-Who are you to meet her?

392
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:13,739
Why do you care if I meet her?

393
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,223
Stop it!

394
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:21,677
What are you doing? This is embarrassing.
Everyone's watching you.

395
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:27,385
Hold on. Then that jerk
you talked about is...

396
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,215
Anyway!

397
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,048
Let's catch Kim Janghyeon together.

398
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:38,182
That's why I wanted to meet you.

399
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:44,952
But I guess today is not the day.
So let's just drink.

400
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,826
-No!
-Why? Why not?

401
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,202
-Who are you to order her around?
-I'm her friend.

402
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,595
-Who are you?
-You son of a...

403
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,479
-You're just a cop...
-None of your business, jerk.

404
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,738
Then let's go all the way.
Don't drink that! Hey!

405
00:36:57,979 --> 00:36:59,357
I'll just pour it for you.

406
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,408
You, too. There.

407
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:04,513
Cheers!

408
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,332
Gosh, you're heavy.

409
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,742
You have really long legs.

410
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,140
Mom, I'm going to work!

411
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:45,327
Mom, I'm going to work!
Dad, I'm leaving!

412
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:47,265
Your dad didn't come home last night.

413
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,017
What?

414
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:51,852
What? Dad didn't come home?

415
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,471
He ran away from home.

416
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,845
-He ran away?
-He ran away?

417
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,285
-But...
-But why?

418
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:02,826
-He just left.
-You beat him up, didn't you?

419
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,772
-I did not.
-Yes, you did.

420
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,296
He walked out.

421
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,090
You don't believe me?

422
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:46,724
Seriously?

423
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:09,349
I have a terrible hangover
but I'm feeling terribly good.

424
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:15,221
You must be very uncomfortable.
She didn't even get you a blanket.

425
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,661
Good morning!

426
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:24,653
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

427
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,810
You need to chase your hangover away.

428
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,482
Baby, what's going on?

429
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,069
My dad...

430
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,301
...ran away from home.

431
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,476
He ran away?

432
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:45,380
Hi.

433
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:56,761
Thanks, Bongsoon.

434
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,476
You're in my house.
You should thank me.

435
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,510
Thank you.

436
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,677
Can I say what
I wanted to say last night?

437
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:16,814
I plan to catch Kim Janghyeon
with my own hands.

438
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:17,815
I need your help.

439
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,562
"Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement"

440
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,763
Why do we have to do this
here on our own?

441
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:48,746
Everyone's attention is on the police.

442
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:51,420
We need to do something different.

443
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:56,116
Then why is he joining us?

444
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:58,648
I also hate the idea of working with you.

445
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,504
-What, you jerk?
-Did you call me "jerk"?

446
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:02,273
Would you please?

447
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,546
Can you please put
your feelings aside for a minute?

448
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:09,478
If you're not going to help me,
I'm doing it on my own.

449
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:10,703
-No!
-No!

450
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:19,610
Okay, I'll help.

451
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:21,957
But don't do anything alone!

452
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,648
Only if you discuss everything with me.

453
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,396
Okay.

454
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,434
Anyway, this is what I think.

455
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,538
Kim Janghyeon knows I'm alive,
so he'll come after me.

456
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:37,098
That makes sense.
He's very obsessive.

457
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:39,887
He's being searched
as an identified criminal.

458
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:43,416
Things aren't the same for him.
He can't move freely.

459
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,479
Then we have to make sure
he can't even go into hiding.

460
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:50,041
What can he do
if he's driven into a corner?

461
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:54,412
-We think he'll likely to stow away.
-Stow away?

462
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:56,360
It's the last resort for wanted suspects.

463
00:41:56,445 --> 00:42:00,492
His face is exposed, so he can't make
a fake passport and leave.

464
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:02,737
It's very likely he'll contact a broker
to get on a cargo ship.

465
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:03,655
Stow away...

466
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:06,034
A broker...

467
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:10,754
Then we'll need some information.

468
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,569
Hello? It's An Minhyuk.

469
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,573
You owe me a favor, remember?

470
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:24,370
Okay.

471
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,135
I'll look into it.

472
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:34,604
What are the recent trends for stowaways?

473
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:38,264
The criminal will very likely
stow away on a cargo ship.

474
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:40,645
Contact the brokers that handle that.

475
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,799
Choongshik from the Wolsa gang
handles that. He knows everything.

476
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:47,644
Do Bongsoon and Choongshik.

477
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:52,356
Why are the best men
not working for me? Why?

478
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,390
-I don't get it either.
-It concerns you.

479
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:57,375
Right.

480
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:01,749
We have to do something
to make him come out.

481
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:11,557
A spear, not a sword.

482
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:13,731
No, not like that!

483
00:43:13,816 --> 00:43:15,561
-I can play better.
-I'll kill you!

484
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:16,778
You're all dead.

485
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:19,595
Who the heck is it now?

486
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,354
Wow, they're all dead.

487
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,836
Sis!

488
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,400
How are you doing?
I'm keeping up with your blog.

489
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:29,318
Yes, Sis!

490
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,685
I need to ask you a favor.

491
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,396
Yes! Yes!

492
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,130
-At your command!
-At your command!

493
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:38,550
-Bye, Sis!
-Bye!

494
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:39,669
-We love you.
-Listen.

495
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:43,968
She asked us to post
Kim Janghyeon's face on our blog.

496
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,485
-So everyone can see it.
-It's a direct order.

497
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,421
The boss gave us a mission.

498
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:53,225
-Exactly! It's our first mission.
-Right.

499
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,490
-Let's catch him!
-Catch him!

500
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,044
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

501
00:43:58,485 --> 00:43:59,357
Let's go!

502
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:01,837
Good job.

503
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:03,122
Let it spread!

504
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,909
-Click, click!
-Let it spread!

505
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:09,316
Good job. Good job.

506
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:11,506
Hey.

507
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:16,748
-Have you seen him?
-No.

508
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,924
We looked everywhere.

509
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,935
"Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement"

510
00:44:37,197 --> 00:44:38,311
It looks like him.

511
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,200
Call the police.

512
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,753
Hello? Police?

513
00:44:49,941 --> 00:44:51,920
Are you Mr. Jung?

514
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:52,838
Yeah.

515
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,216
It's going to cost you a lot.

516
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:11,796
Two more.

517
00:45:20,074 --> 00:45:21,728
The bullets are inside.

518
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:27,453
It's from Russia.

519
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,194
KGB agents used this.

520
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:35,667
Hey, it's me.

521
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:39,521
The guy Baek Tak is looking for.
The wanted man.

522
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,350
He was just here.

523
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:43,308
Yes.

524
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:45,553
Really?

525
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,165
Okay. Got it.

526
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:53,052
Sir, I don't think Kwangbok
can make it back to Seoul.

527
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:55,666
Why?
-He went to his hometown...

528
00:45:55,751 --> 00:46:00,547
...and spent some time outside,
but he got stung by bees.

529
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:01,980
His mouth again.

530
00:46:02,277 --> 00:46:04,364
What sin did he commit in his past life?

531
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:06,509
It's like the universe wants him dead!

532
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:08,839
He's getting all the bad luck.

533
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:10,721
It's Choongshik.

534
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:12,136
Choongshik!

535
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,588
What did you say?

536
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:16,173
Okay.

537
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,610
What's going on?
Did he find him?

538
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,189
Yes, there were six stowaways.

539
00:46:20,274 --> 00:46:24,600
One guy reserved a spot
for the 15th, and paid for it.

540
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:27,780
It's a young guy.
It's very likely that it's him.

541
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:30,681
-Then check what he looks like.
-The problem is...

542
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:35,196
...that he bought a gun from
Deukgoo, the pawnbroker.

543
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:36,226
A gun?

544
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:38,628
A long one.

545
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,741
A rifle!

546
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:42,439
Faster! Speak faster!

547
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:51,818
-Hello?
-It's me.

548
00:46:51,973 --> 00:46:53,477
On the 15th at 11:00 p.m.

549
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:55,876
A cargo ship to Shandong, China.

550
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:59,083
But he bought a sniper rifle.

551
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,056
Suspect Wanted for
Kidnapping and Confinement

552
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:28,513
Do you need a bag?

553
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:29,734
Yes.

554
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:47,185
He asked if he gets the money
just by reporting it.

555
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,794
Are you sure it wasn't a prank call?

556
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,230
Yes, we checked the camera
and it looked like him.

557
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:52,148
Okay.

558
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:54,562
He was seen at a store in Songdo.

559
00:47:54,646 --> 00:47:56,292
He's already in Songdo?

560
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,186
Gukdoo's right.
He's planning to stow away.

561
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:01,485
I don't think he'll just leave.

562
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,700
I agree with you.

563
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:06,178
He bought a sniper rifle.

564
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:10,184
He's planning to hide somewhere
and shoot Bongsoon first.

565
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:13,667
It's likely he'll call her out somewhere
he can see her clearly.

566
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:16,848
We have to make him
come over to where we want.

567
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,154
Only then can we catch him.

568
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:21,260
You're getting more and more daring.

569
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:25,306
Don't worry. I can do it.
I'm Do Bongsoon.

570
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,430
Yes, you're Do Bongsoon,
not Wonder Woman.

571
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:30,007
You're not even scared of guns now?

572
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:32,111
-Bongsoon.
-Huh?

573
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:33,560
If...

574
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:40,483
If he calls you, provoke him
and try to hurt his pride.

575
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:43,151
He hates being belittled by women.

576
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:46,995
Then you tell him where to come
and then hang up on him.

577
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:49,405
He'll take the bait.

578
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,429
Okay. Got it.

579
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:06,043
According to Gukdoo's informant,
it's very likely he'll take a freighter...

580
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:11,228
...from Inchon Harbor to Shandong, China
on the 15th at 11:00 PM.

581
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:13,435
The escape route is this trade port.

582
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,239
We'll stake out here
near the freighter...

583
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,088
...and ambush him. Okay?

584
00:49:21,173 --> 00:49:23,879
Let's catch him this time.

585
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:25,340
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

586
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:26,396
Yes, sir.

587
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,239
How can you sell this stuff
to your neighbors?

588
00:49:30,324 --> 00:49:35,272
And it's not even cheap!
These egg tarts stink of raw eggs!

589
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:38,537
Which means they're fresh.

590
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:43,050
Of course they smell like eggs.
They wouldn't smell of potatoes.

591
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:46,007
Whatever! I want a refund.

592
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:48,645
But you...

593
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,979
You ate four out of the twelve
and you want a refund?

594
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:56,034
What kind of situation is this?

595
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,562
Anyway, I want a refund!

596
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,845
I had a very hard time
eating those bad tarts.

597
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:04,782
-Bad tarts?
-Yes, they taste bad.

598
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:08,688
Just give her the money.
How much is it?

599
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,839
-How much is it?
-1,500 won each.

600
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,974
-So go ahead and calculate.
-Stop.

601
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:16,015
I can't take this anymore.
You've done this before, right?

602
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,799
-You have a bad habit!
-What?

603
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:20,399
I'll teach you a lesson.
This isn't your first time!

604
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:24,181
How dare you? What?

605
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:25,656
How dare you...

606
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:29,441
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry it smelled bad.

607
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,781
Sorry for the inconvenience.

608
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,678
You'll get the refund.
Of course you will!

609
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,595
Ho-soon, what are you doing?

610
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:41,614
Oh, you look so pretty today.
My goodness!

611
00:50:42,357 --> 00:50:45,904
We'll make it better next time.

612
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:47,351
Here you are.

613
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:50,318
Thank you. Come again.

614
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:53,464
Your makeup looks great today.

615
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:57,306
-Get home safely.
-Goodbye!

616
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,655
Bye! Thank you.

617
00:51:01,865 --> 00:51:04,638
-Oh, Mr. An.
-Yes, hello.

618
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:07,939
Hello. Where's Bongsoon?

619
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:11,252
I just dropped her off
and came by to say hello.

620
00:51:11,337 --> 00:51:12,503
Oh my goodness!

621
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:18,411
Hello, I'm a friend of Bongsoon's mom.

622
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,694
Mr. An, have a seat, please.

623
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,303
-Yes, sit. Sit.
-Okay.

624
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:25,892
Over here.

625
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,363
-Ho-soon.
-Yes?

626
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:33,868
-What would you like?
-It's okay, I'm fine.

627
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:35,793
Oh, have something.

628
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:37,736
-Coffee?
-Yes.

629
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:40,059
-Americano, please.
-Okay.

630
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:43,467
I'll find Bongsoon's dad
and bring him back home.

631
00:51:44,128 --> 00:51:45,212
What do you mean?

632
00:51:45,297 --> 00:51:48,091
Bongsoon is very worried.

633
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:51,953
Oh...

634
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:56,651
I gave him freedom.

635
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:59,518
Freedom, freedom.

636
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:04,581
The love between us is so deep.

637
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:10,317
Sometimes we need to stay apart.
You need distance.

638
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:12,687
Too much heat is bad for you.

639
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:13,605
You burn out.

640
00:52:15,251 --> 00:52:18,224
By the way, Mr. An.

641
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,142
Yes?

642
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:28,996
May I know the date
and hour of your birth?

643
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,832
W-Why do you ask?

644
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:34,174
Well...

645
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:38,368
To check me and Bongsoon's
love compatibility by our horoscopes?

646
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:43,341
Well, not exactly...

647
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:44,412
Please check.

648
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,439
And let me know the results.

649
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:49,559
If they say we're not a good match...

650
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:51,532
-If they say that...?
-If they say that...?

651
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:57,646
Can you go around until you find someone
who says we're a perfect match?

652
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:00,063
Yeah!

653
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:05,250
This is great!

654
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:09,056
I really like you.

655
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,552
I'm also curious.

656
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:12,706
Then Mr. An...

657
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:15,472
Can I have...

658
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:21,031
...your date and hour of birth?

659
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:22,433
Okay!

660
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:26,625
Hosoon, the coffee!

661
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,002
"Book of Ability"

662
00:53:44,782 --> 00:53:51,782
I, Do Bongsoon, saved three women
and my friend, Kyungsim.

663
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:58,710
And this time, I will catch
their kidnapper with my own hands.

664
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:29,732
-Hello?
-You managed to survive?

665
00:54:31,516 --> 00:54:32,549
Kim Janghyeon?

666
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:38,909
-Where are you?
-You want to know where I am?

667
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:40,791
I think we should meet.

668
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:41,708
Why?

669
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:45,519
You want to catch me now
since you're strong again?

670
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:50,451
Are you trying to run away because
you're scared of a little girl like me?

671
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:52,109
Me? Scared of a girl?

672
00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:53,991
You got cold feet.

673
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:56,317
You're no match for me.

674
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,150
I'm no match for you?

675
00:54:58,235 --> 00:55:00,144
Come and meet me if you dare.

676
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:04,326
Remember that construction site?
I'll wait there. Tonight.

677
00:55:14,205 --> 00:55:15,546
It's tonight.

678
00:55:17,344 --> 00:55:21,336
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

679
00:55:26,218 --> 00:55:27,242
Okay.

680
00:55:28,874 --> 00:55:31,149
But I still need time.

681
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:37,979
I need time to understand
and accept your particular situation.

682
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,674
Look at me.

683
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:50,314
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

684
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:01,564
Okay.

685
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:39,072
Kim Janghyeon.
Today, I'll catch you.

686
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,791
Do you copy?

687
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:15,474
-Yes.
-Yes.

688
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,889
Kim Janghyeon will be hiding
somewhere within firing range.

689
00:57:18,484 --> 00:57:19,317
Be careful.

690
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:32,449
Kim Janghyeon.

691
00:57:32,988 --> 00:57:35,092
Stop hiding like a coward
and show yourself.

692
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,438
Fight me.

693
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:41,218
Rooftop on the right!

694
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,483
Bongsoon. Bongsoon!

695
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:52,662
Are you okay? Bongsoon!

696
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:38,670
Gukdoo, you go after him.
I know where he went to.

697
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:41,961
He moved up the departure date.
It's today at Incheon Port.

698
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:42,907
Incheon Port?

699
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:17,503
Hey, Kim Janghyeon.

700
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:28,507
The container on the left,
50 meters ahead.

701
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,917
Turn to your right.

702
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:38,513
To your right.

703
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:11,970
No, it's a dead end.

704
01:01:19,704 --> 01:01:20,659
To your right.

705
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,127
Turn to your right.

706
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,064
You're almost there.

707
01:01:40,151 --> 01:01:41,065
Okay!

708
01:02:05,363 --> 01:02:06,196
You...

709
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,809
I shot you.

710
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:12,081
I never get satisfied
unless I get things done.

711
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,369
It's a bulletproof vest made
from the most advanced material.

712
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:22,305
Nothing goes through it.

713
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:25,147
Bongsoon. Bongsoon!

714
01:02:25,429 --> 01:02:27,326
Are you okay? Bongsoon!

715
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,793
Shoot.

716
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:32,148
Look at this.

717
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:34,707
-Okay.
-You drive me nuts.

718
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:39,630
Gukdoo, Bongsoon's fine.

719
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,092
Now go.

720
01:02:42,303 --> 01:02:43,839
That son of a...

721
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,388
I told you. You're no match for me.

722
01:03:45,056 --> 01:03:48,024
Oh, hey. You're here.

723
01:03:59,234 --> 01:04:00,232
Kim Janghyeon!

724
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:06,492
Wow! That was a nice shot.

725
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:22,918
Kim Janghyeon, now you're in a cage.

726
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:26,296
You'll be caged up
for the rest of your life.

727
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,470
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

728
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,740
Do you know what's different
about about your soulmate?

729
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:34,121
You see yourself in his eyes
and you look really happy.

730
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:35,532
Bongsoon is...

731
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,900
...like me.

732
01:05:36,985 --> 01:05:39,139
I only exist when she's with me.

733
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:41,604
I'm nothing without her.

734
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:43,660
I like Mr. An.

735
01:05:43,744 --> 01:05:45,105
Thanks, Dad.

736
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,098
You can spread your wings now.

737
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,022
I can't save the world all by myself.

738
01:05:50,107 --> 01:05:53,476
But I was given back this strength,
so I want to use it for good.

739
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:56,804
How did I end up loving
such an amazing woman?

740
01:05:56,889 --> 01:06:00,704
I'll protect you, too.
Like that girl in your dungeon.
