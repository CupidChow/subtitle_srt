1
00:00:01,514 --> 00:00:02,840
Kim Janghyeon, stop!

2
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,565
Get out of the car!

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,483
Bongsoon.

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:16,390
I'm here. I'm here.

5
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:26,130
Bongsoon!

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,188
Shoot.

7
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,566
Take her in.

8
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:38,180
Search thoroughly!

9
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,776
Jeez. That was a big fall.

10
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,101
What about the body?
Did they find it or not?

11
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,606
They haven't.

12
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:04,335
He fell from that height? Gosh.

13
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:07,988
He tried so hard to escape
to eventually die like this.

14
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,970
That's what I'm talking about.
Eventually, he died this way.

15
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,007
Lieutenant In!

16
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,122
Gukdoo!

17
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,234
Stop showing me that face.

18
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:21,083
The case is closed.

19
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,009
Search every nook and cranny!
We can't be here all night!

20
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,376
Yes, sir!

21
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,482
I'm taking Bongsoon with me.

22
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:54,947
Dad.

23
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:57,382
You came back? You must be tired.

24
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,466
A little. Why didn't you go to bed?

25
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,786
Bongsoon went out
and hasn't come back yet.

26
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,513
-Did you try calling her?
-Her phone is off.

27
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,690
-Bongsoon, it's very late. Why...
-Hello, sir.

28
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,183
It's An Minhyuk.

29
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,097
Oh, Mr. An. Hi.

30
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,931
I'm sorry I didn't call.
Bongsoon is here with me.

31
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:09,640
Oh, she's with you. She didn't
come home, so I got worried.

32
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,054
I'm sorry, sir.
I should have called you.

33
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:16,183
Bongsoon fell fast asleep, so...

34
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,998
Did something happen?

35
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,059
Yes, but it's alright now.

36
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:26,860
-Do you want to talk to her?
-Don't wake her up.

37
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:31,385
I trust you, Mr. An.

38
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:34,304
Okay. Don't worry.

39
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:36,897
Bye.

40
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,342
Yeah.

41
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,261
-Is she with her boss?
-Yes, he said she's fine.

42
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,778
Are they getting serious?

43
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,911
I think he's a good man.

44
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:22,148
Not just good. He's like a savior.

45
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:32,431
It always hurts me to think of Bongsoon.

46
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,246
She wasn't the smartest kid.

47
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,499
All she had was strength
from her mother's genes...

48
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:43,069
...and I was worried she'd get in trouble.

49
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:48,035
I never felt at ease
when she mingled with people.

50
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:52,045
What if she gets hurt?

51
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,576
Like what happened this time.

52
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:59,686
If he wasn't there for her...

53
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:03,192
Do you know why I became a doctor?

54
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:07,859
For Bongsoon.

55
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,633
I wanted to understand and study...

56
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,260
...the strength that was
passed down to her.

57
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:22,688
I wanted to help her have
the normal life she wanted.

58
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:28,209
Bonggi.

59
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:34,924
Do you think Bongsoon
can have a normal life?

60
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:40,610
It won't be easy. And that worries me.

61
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,135
I'm always worried about her.

62
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,418
You little kid.

63
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,835
You talk as if you're the older one.

64
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,343
I am.

65
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,027
Look at me.

66
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,296
I'm looking.

67
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:43,195
Please love me.

68
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,904
I am...loving you.

69
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,874
You're like a peanut,
so I can put you in here.

70
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,734
But it seems like I'm not in your heart.

71
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,005
You are in my heart.

72
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:42,341
I love you.

73
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:23,781
Bongsoon...

74
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,769
Did she...?

75
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,224
Bongsoon!

76
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,994
Finally, finally.

77
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:38,259
Bonggi, your sister finally slept out.

78
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:39,311
She's with her boss.

79
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:41,422
-I thought so!
-Dad talked to him last night.

80
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,770
It seems like something happened.

81
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:45,271
What happened?

82
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:47,324
I don't know.

83
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,681
Hello?

84
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,046
Ma'am.

85
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:58,244
Kyungsim, how are you?
You haven't called in a while.

86
00:11:58,378 --> 00:11:59,463
Are you not coming to Seoul?

87
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:01,321
Ma'am...

88
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,037
Kyungsim. Why are you crying?

89
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,596
Are you sick? Kyungsim!

90
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:28,436
Bongsoon.

91
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,574
Are you up?
What happened to Kyungsim?

92
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,119
Don't worry. She's fine.

93
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,203
She doesn't want to be in the hospital.

94
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:25,265
She'll go to your house
after the treatment.

95
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:27,373
That's a relief.

96
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,447
Did you...

97
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:41,020
You never listen, do you?

98
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,809
I always knew you didn't,
but it's still unbelievable.

99
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,584
What did I tell you?
I told you not to go alone.

100
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,942
I'm very angry.
I'm just holding it back.

101
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:54,244
Sorry. I want to go home.
I need to see Kyungsim.

102
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:55,268
Okay.

103
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:38,478
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

104
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,117
You told me that.

105
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,060
"Case Report: After abducting Na Kyungsim,
Kim Janghyun ran into An Minhyuk..."

106
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,268
"Case Report"

107
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:13,155
-They didn't find the body?
-Not yet. I'll call again.

108
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,402
-Yes, do that.
-Okay.

109
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,210
-Lieutenant In.
-Yes?

110
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,157
Are you done with the case report?

111
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,270
-Yes, I'm on it.
-Okay.

112
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:23,227
But you know what?

113
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:28,548
Na Kyungsim said
An Minhyuk came to her rescue.

114
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,986
But it just doesn't add up.

115
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,868
I'll take care of it.

116
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,610
Okay.

117
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,401
-You do that.
-Yes, sir.

118
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,967
How could Bongsoon not tell us...

119
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:57,577
...when she knew
Kyungsim got kidnapped?

120
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:01,514
He told her he'd kill her
if she called the police.

121
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:04,021
I can't imagine how horrible
it's been for Kyungsim.

122
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:07,099
My goodness.

123
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,779
Why is she taking so long?

124
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah. Where is she?

125
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,715
-Kyungsim!
-She's here!

126
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,789
Go, go, go!

127
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:16,451
Oh, Kyungsim!

128
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:17,898
I'll go now.

129
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,796
You're fine now.

130
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,939
Thank God it didn't get worse.

131
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:26,098
You're fine. You're fine.

132
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:28,681
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

133
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,272
Oh, I feel so bad for you.

134
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,162
Kyungsim, here. Here.

135
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,375
Drink up.

136
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,527
Slowly.

137
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,440
-Good. Good.
-Slowly.

138
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,988
My goodness.
It must have been horrible.

139
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,906
Your mother should have called me.

140
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:47,938
She had her reasons.

141
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:51,145
The kidnapper threatened her
by saying that...

142
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,172
...it would be worse for me
if she let anyone know.

143
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:59,146
The police said you need rest
and to be treated in a hospital.

144
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,368
-Will you be fine at home?
-I don't want to be in a hospital.

145
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,753
You look so thin and worn since
you haven't eaten properly.

146
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:11,313
-Yes.
-I'll prepare some food. You need to eat.

147
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,297
No, I'm fine.

148
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,669
I'm going to Busan now.

149
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:19,324
Yes, you go, but you need to eat first.

150
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,860
I'll go and get some oxtail and meat.
Wait for a bit.

151
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,785
Yes, get back quickly.

152
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,705
-Go inside. Take today off.
-Thanks.

153
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:36,575
About the security guard
that got injured...

154
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,692
Don't worry about that. He'll get better.

155
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,094
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of everything.

156
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,724
-Okay.
-You take care of Kyungsim.

157
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,499
Okay, bye.

158
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,666
And think about me, too.

159
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:55,935
I will.

160
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,917
Kyungsim!

161
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,622
It was really horrible, wasn't it?

162
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,573
Did he hurt you badly?

163
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,026
Are you not hungry?

164
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,697
You must have been so scared.

165
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,942
But you know that I'm mentally strong.

166
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,237
I gotta agree to that.

167
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:46,300
I even saved some money...

168
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,234
...to buy you a pretty dress.

169
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:53,208
That dress that you wanted.

170
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:57,019
I wanted to get you that dress.

171
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,275
-Bong-bong. Are you okay?
-Yes.

172
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,483
I'm really fine.

173
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,564
Your strength...
At the construction site...

174
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,697
-Kyungsim...
-Yeah?

175
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,492
I...

176
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,093
I lost my strength.

177
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:28,134
What?

178
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:34,831
It's something I always wanted,
but it feels weird now.

179
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,619
Oh, no.

180
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,845
I'm fine.

181
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:44,564
I'm fine if you are. I'm fine.

182
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:50,971
I'm fine. It's okay. Don't cry.

183
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,134
Lie down, Kyungsim.
You need to get some rest.

184
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:57,096
Lie down.

185
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm going to Busan. I miss my mom.

186
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,230
Yes, she'll be worried.
I'll go and visit you.

187
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:17,758
Gukdoo made arrangements
for the police to take me home.

188
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:19,342
That's good.

189
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:25,034
Your mom is cooking oxtail soup.
She wants to feed me.

190
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:30,254
Yes, you should eat before you go. Okay?

191
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:31,718
Thanks, Bongsoon.

192
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:33,159
I'm glad you're fine.

193
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:44,582
Eat this quickly since
the police is coming here soon.

194
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,500
Okay.

195
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,147
Kyungsim, eat it all up.

196
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:54,141
She got kidnapped!
Why didn't you tell me?

197
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:57,490
It hurts! That stings!

198
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:07,521
Ma'am, she lost her strength.

199
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:08,439
What?

200
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,493
-Go inside.
-Okay.

201
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,462
-Call me when you get there.
-I will.

202
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,810
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

203
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:43,475
-Go home.
-Get her home safely.

204
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:57,465
Bongsoon.

205
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,386
We need to talk.

206
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,361
Bongsoon, you'll be fine.

207
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:12,201
You'll soon get used to it.

208
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:17,248
Life goes on, you know.
Live like how others do.

209
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:23,560
You'll feel a little empty
and uncomfortable at first.

210
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:31,383
Do you know what's the first thing I did
when I lost my strength?

211
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:35,040
I started lifting weights.

212
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:38,936
I started with the lightest ones.

213
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,208
I did the things that I used to do.

214
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,529
I just went back to my old routine.

215
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:45,469
As if nothing happened.

216
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:48,174
Mom...

217
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:54,824
Then, life goes on.
You live like everyone else.

218
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:57,365
Okay.

219
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,073
I'll do that.

220
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:06,619
Good. Now I'll take care of you.

221
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:11,223
Do you know why I cared for Bonggi more?

222
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,055
Because of our genes.

223
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,990
The strength goes to the women
while the men are all very weak.

224
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,273
Your uncles were weak, too.

225
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,215
Bonggi got sick all the time he was young.

226
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,291
You don't know how bad I felt.

227
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,862
Now I'll look after you, too.

228
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,906
-Mom...
-Okay.

229
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:43,165
By the way, what happened with you
and my son-in-law? Tell me.

230
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,558
Mom! I told you to stop!

231
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,886
Oh, come on.

232
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:17,065
I'm not special anymore.

233
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:22,133
I have to get used to living
like a normal person.

234
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,172
I can't walk around the streets
at night freely anymore.

235
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:38,960
I can't protect others anymore.

236
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,634
I can't help others
whenever I want anymore.

237
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:09,189
I, Do Bongsoon, am now a normal person.

238
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:29,289
Oh, well.

239
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:14,755
Do you know what's the first thing I did
when I lost my strength?

240
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:17,762
I did the things that I used to do.

241
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:20,389
I just went back to my old routine.

242
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,347
As if nothing happened.

243
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:23,679
Okay.

244
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:27,486
As if nothing happened.

245
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,452
Bongssuni!

246
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,251
Should I put a necklace on her?

247
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:01,998
I've been to the hospital.
The security guard will be fine.

248
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,411
Don't worry about it.

249
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,631
What a relief.

250
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:15,030
We'll go home first, then.

251
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,975
Go, go.

252
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,757
Oh...

253
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:29,623
Is it a bug?

254
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:31,172
What?

255
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:33,719
Bug, bug.

256
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:38,724
The bandage was stuck in your butt.

257
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:42,267
Bandage? Unbelievable!

258
00:27:43,224 --> 00:27:44,820
Bandage, not a bug?

259
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:50,740
I want to go home!

260
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:57,316
Do Bongsoon!

261
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:04,004
This used to be a chopstick,
not handcuffs.

262
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:06,452
Do Bongsoon bent it like this.

263
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:09,096
She said next time it'll be a necklace.
That crazy girl...

264
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,935
-Oh, my!
-Gosh, you startled me.

265
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,268
Do Bongsoon!

266
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:21,605
You come with me.

267
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:45,495
Go to the supply room
and get ten boxes of A4 paper.

268
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:48,055
We're out of paper again.

269
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,883
Okay.

270
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,980
Hurry up.

271
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:54,572
Okay.

272
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,538
Are you walking?

273
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,244
Why are you not running? Run!

274
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:02,879
Run!

275
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:08,113
Run! Do Bongsoon, run!

276
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:13,687
Mr. An.

277
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,144
I have something
very shocking to show you.

278
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,557
Follow me.

279
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,651
You, too!

280
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:26,665
Look at that.

281
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:36,423
No.

282
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,347
What's wrong with her?

283
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:42,062
She could lift ten boxes at once.

284
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,682
This is not right.

285
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:47,734
You're pretending to be weak.

286
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,376
-You fool.
-What?

287
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:56,728
Why do you ask her
to lift things like this?

288
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:00,253
Hey!

289
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,475
It's your day off.
Why did you come to work?

290
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,922
Kyungsim went to Busan.

291
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,839
I had nothing better to do at him.

292
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,736
I have to work.
I went through a lot to get this job.

293
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,318
Kyungsim is fine and that scum is dead.

294
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:24,353
I think we should enjoy dating
like any other couple.

295
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,756
You were so special that
I couldn't plan a normal date.

296
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,438
You can plan a normal date.

297
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:35,033
I'm not special anymore.

298
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,136
I know.

299
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,451
Are you okay?

300
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:50,709
Can I be honest?

301
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:53,969
I'm not okay.

302
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,657
But my mom said I'll be fine soon.

303
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:07,510
Bongsoon, what did I say?

304
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,169
It doesn't matter to me
if you're special or not.

305
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:16,417
All I want is for you to be happy.

306
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,378
If you're happy, I'm happy.

307
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:23,838
I'll lift anything that's heavy
and do all the hard work.

308
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,992
Trust your man.

309
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,789
I'll open the jars for you, too.

310
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,200
You speak like you're older than me.

311
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,248
Hey! I am.

312
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,679
I know we're the same age.

313
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,974
How did you...?

314
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,690
Did Gukdoo tell you?
See? You can't trust the police.

315
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:57,215
Wow! Amazing! I just made a guess.

316
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,510
We're the same age.

317
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,645
Still, you should treat me with respect.

318
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:07,341
I'm more mature than you in every way.

319
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:11,263
Mr. An, can I talk down to you?

320
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:16,012
I think I should. We're the same age.

321
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:18,821
Unbelievable.

322
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,931
I dare you to do it.

323
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,375
Hey, An Minhyuk!

324
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:28,117
Minhyuk!

325
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:32,317
-Hey, An?
-Oh, come on.

326
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:34,534
Hey, An? Hey, Minhyuk.

327
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,462
-Have you lost your mind?
-Hey, An Minhyuk!

328
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:38,182
Let's go.

329
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,004
"Minhyuk"? "Hey?"

330
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,019
-Hey, An Minhyuk. Let's go!
-How dare you.

331
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,605
-You come here.
-An Minhyuk!

332
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,530
Hey!

333
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,155
-Stop that.
-An!

334
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,111
Let's go, An.

335
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:53,905
-Let's go.
-That makes my heart flutter.

336
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:55,760
Congratulations, sir!

337
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:57,521
Twenty percent!

338
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,075
Twenty percent!

339
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:01,329
Twenty percent!

340
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:04,025
-Hey Trap! Hey!
-Yes?

341
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:12,307
I wonder how Kwangbok is doing.

342
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,593
-Is Kwangbok still in the hospital?
-Yes.

343
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,006
He's pestering the doctors
to discharge him.

344
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:22,644
He even asked them to spread his butt.
Did he hurt his brain?

345
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:25,374
There's a booze that can help him
recover at once.

346
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,693
But it's hard to get
and could be poisonous.

347
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:32,001
Monk Nizamuddin treats people
that need to recover energy.

348
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:33,946
I'll ask him for help.

349
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,857
Boss, I just got a call
from that Indian monk.

350
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:41,639
-Yeah?
-He wants us to go to the sauna.

351
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:43,392
He thinks we have nothing better to do.

352
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:45,023
Did he? Then let's go.

353
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,237
He used to wash himself
often in the Ganges River.

354
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,386
He likes water.

355
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:52,975
-"Ganges"?
-Yes.

356
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:55,018
Namaste.

357
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,545
You watch your mouth.

358
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:04,331
How can the borough approve
the project so abruptly?

359
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:06,213
This is not right.

360
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:10,484
This is preposterous!
What about our signatures?

361
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:13,696
The fortune teller said
we should buy off the one...

362
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,722
...that holds the handle,
but we didn't.

363
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:19,947
He said the price will go up
four times in four years.

364
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:22,386
The company run by that handsome man...

365
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,895
...will be doing the redevelopment, right?

366
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,880
Jeez. I shouldn't have
helped that pig face.

367
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:31,673
What is done is done.
Let's just win him over.

368
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:32,590
What?

369
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,821
-It's Gukdoo's mom.
-Hello.

370
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,179
Welcome!

371
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:36,641
-Hi.
-Hello.

372
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,564
I want to make some walnut porridge.

373
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:42,302
-I need walnuts.
-Walnut porridge?

374
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:47,735
Gukdoo lost his appetite.
I feel so bad for him.

375
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,796
Oh, I see.
Wait just a minute.

376
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:53,692
Excuse me.

377
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:04,545
-Yes, Jinyi.
-We can't sell you our products.

378
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:10,681
You're highly educated,
so I guess you'd know better...

379
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:15,580
...but the owner can choose his customers.

380
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,074
We choose to not sell to you.

381
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,958
How is that logical in any way?

382
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:25,023
Excuse me.

383
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:28,083
Who are you to decide
who's my customer and who's not?

384
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,022
It's not your shop, it's mine!

385
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:31,903
If you're going to be rude,
at least have good grounds.

386
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:35,233
Why refuse such a good customer like her?

387
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,303
What right do you have?
When all you do is wander off.

388
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:39,704
Right, Hosoon?

389
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:42,567
Hey.

390
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:45,462
Sorry.

391
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:47,896
Are you out of your mind?

392
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,698
-Wrap it up quickly!
-Okay.

393
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:50,702
Mr. Do.

394
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:58,481
Do you find this funny?

395
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,712
Mr. Do.

396
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:08,299
No, make his eyebrows thicker. Look.

397
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:14,385
The villain must look evil
right off the bat.

398
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,079
See?

399
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,827
He looks very familiar.

400
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,745
Right?

401
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,235
Who is it?

402
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:28,790
Sir.

403
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:41,420
You have a meeting with the executives.

404
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:44,361
Okay, I'll be there.

405
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:49,374
-Identical.
-Identical.

406
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,584
This chocolate looks delicious.

407
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:01,995
-Which one?
-That one.

408
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,523
-This one?
-Yes.

409
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:09,741
Look at this. You should try one.

410
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,382
Say, "Ah."

411
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:36,454
So this is how soft it tastes.

412
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,437
-You did that on purpose!
-So good!

413
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,156
-You did that on purpose!
-Can I have another one?

414
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:42,600
Hey, Trap.

415
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:46,021
What is Do Bongsoon up to these days?

416
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:49,703
Any news or rumors?
Any false rumors or...

417
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:53,962
I heard there's something
between her and An Minhyuk.

418
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:54,959
What?

419
00:37:56,502 --> 00:38:00,084
An Minhyuk and Do Bongsoon are a couple?

420
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,558
-It won't be easy for him.
-Oh, come on.

421
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,163
She wouldn't beat up her boyfriend.

422
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,923
I am very serious.

423
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,554
The water of this sauna
is not suitable for me.

424
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,048
My atopic dermatitis got worse.

425
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:28,073
It's getting really itchy right now.

426
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:31,009
You scratch my back, you fool.

427
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,564
Use that to scratch.

428
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,265
I can't reach my back.

429
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:47,342
I do yoga but I can't reach it.
Scratch my back.

430
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:51,996
-Here?
-Yes, there. It feels so good.

431
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:53,577
Does it feel good?

432
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,801
-Lower.
-Here?

433
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:01,339
Just reach inside and scratch. You fool.

434
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,838
"My Hometown"

435
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:09,294
I shouldn't have tried the special sauna.

436
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,701
It wasn't for me.

437
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,312
Seaweed soup here is good.

438
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:15,226
Their seaweed soup with beef is the best.

439
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,755
I don't eat meat.
Don't get suspicious.

440
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:24,900
Here!

441
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,262
-Where?
-It's here!

442
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,223
What is it? Did you find anything?

443
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,582
-And the body?
-Missing. They couldn't find it.

444
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,596
But they found his clothes nearby.

445
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:35,861
How high was that cliff?

446
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:38,390
More than 50 meters.
There's no chance he survived.

447
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,901
But where's the body?

448
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:44,749
Whatever. It'll come up to the surface
when the time comes.

449
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:45,955
Hey, Gukdoo.

450
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,552
Lieutenant In!

451
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,965
-Yes?
-You, punk.

452
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,378
You did a great job.
Everyone did a great job!

453
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:57,291
We spent days here
and we even got criticized.

454
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,774
-Let's go and have a drink.
-Great!

455
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,920
-What do you want to eat?
-Meat!

456
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,821
-Let's go.
-Let's have clams instead.

457
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:09,549
I can't live with you.
Divorce me right now.

458
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,976
What? You want a divorce?

459
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,317
You sure you won't regret this?

460
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,493
Regret? Oh, please.

461
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:21,732
How can I trust an unfaithful
womanizer like you?

462
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:24,789
-Huh?
-W-What? "Womanizer"?

463
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:27,286
Think before you talk.
Watch your language!

464
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:31,587
-What if I don't?
-What's going on?

465
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:34,832
If you like her so much,
go and live with her.

466
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,258
-What did you say?
-Oh, you want to hit me?

467
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:38,823
Okay, hit me. Hit me!

468
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,329
-Hit me! Come on!
-Mom, stop!

469
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:41,512
-Seriously!
-Move Bongsoon!

470
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,540
Oh, no.
Bongsoon, are you alright?

471
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:46,114
-Bongsoon!
-Are you okay?

472
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,713
Don't push her so hard!

473
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,394
It's your fault! Shut up!

474
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:54,309
You're the one yelling here!
You are! You, you!

475
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:56,789
-Don't point your finger at me.
-Don't hit me! It hurts!

476
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:59,199
Go to Gukdoo's mom
if you like her so much.

477
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,048
-I'll take you to her.
-Okay, let's go!

478
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,775
-Shut up.
-Let's go!

479
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,488
"Book of Ability"

480
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:40,398
I didn't even have the chance
to write in it.

481
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,334
Now I won't be able to write in it.

482
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,517
Don't forget our picnic tomorrow.

483
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:09,145
I'm going on a picnic.

484
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,416
I'll put lots of goodies. Pineapple.

485
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,592
They look like jelly.

486
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,738
It smells so good.

487
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:23,080
Ta-da!

488
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:28,372
I'm going on a picnic.
This is a little... Nope.

489
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:31,301
What about this? Hello, Min-min.

490
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,428
My goodness. I'm so nervous.

491
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,244
Pull yourself together.

492
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,534
The weather is so nice.

493
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:10,657
Let's go.

494
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,303
What?

495
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:13,639
Oh, yes. Let's go.

496
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:48,134
I'm undergoing photosynthesis.
I want to enjoy the sunlight.

497
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:51,068
Your arm will hurt.

498
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,757
What? Are you crying?

499
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:14,122
You're crying because of a comic book!

500
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,386
-I'm not crying!
-It's just a comic book.

501
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:19,157
Then read this. This is funny.

502
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,290
Oh!

503
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:28,948
Oh...

504
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:30,543
No.

505
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:35,947
Ta-da!

506
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:40,699
I put in a lot of effort.

507
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:42,350
-What happened?
-Look what happened.

508
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:43,506
It was actually like this.

509
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,114
-Was it a heart?
-Yes.

510
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:50,254
Let me help you.
I'm an expert with hearts.

511
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:53,557
-Okay.
-Done! Let's eat!

512
00:44:55,397 --> 00:44:58,006
Say, "Ah." Ah.

513
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,449
Is it good? Eat lots of it.

514
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:10,004
I already knew this,
but you really are a great cook.

515
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:11,750
It's so good.

516
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:22,135
-The sausage has a bone!
-Enjoy.

517
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:36,717
Darn!

518
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,737
Shoot!

519
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,314
"Young Entrepreneur
Who Built His Own Success"

520
00:45:55,786 --> 00:46:01,425
"I'm known as an adventurer.
I hate to lose."

521
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,400
"Reporter Kim Taehyung of Daily Media"

522
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:55,934
You are so photogenic, sir.

523
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:03,395
-What time is the meeting?
-Oh, right. Hold on.

524
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:11,395
Bongsoon, Kyungsim told me about it.

525
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,042
Are you feeling better?

526
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,533
Yes, I'm fine.

527
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:17,877
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm near your office.

528
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:19,502
Let's meet up.

529
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,108
--Okay.
-I'll be there soon.

530
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:22,194
Okay.

531
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:27,817
Gosh.

532
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:48,534
How can I help you?

533
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,543
I'm Kim Taehyung,
a reporter from Daily Media.

534
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:52,491
I have an appointment with Mr. An today.

535
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,472
Hold on, sir.

536
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:56,969
The reporter from Ilgan Media is here.

537
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,500
Yes. Okay.

538
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:02,375
Sorry, Mr. An's not
in his office right now.

539
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:05,332
I see. Can I wait inside?

540
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:06,285
Sorry.

541
00:48:09,328 --> 00:48:11,502
His last interview got a good response.

542
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:14,225
I'd like to interview him again
about the new game launching.

543
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:17,561
Hold on.

544
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,416
A reporter came back
to have an interview.

545
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:23,467
Okay.

546
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:26,475
-Please come with me.
-Thank you.

547
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:53,697
Kim Janghyeon?

548
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,797
You!

549
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:09,647
-Help!
-I'll kill her.

550
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:12,983
Darn it!

551
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,144
That son of a gun.

552
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:21,086
We recently received many complaints
about server problems from customers.

553
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:23,606
As a temporary solution,
we decided to increase...

554
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:34,264
And update the server to stabilize it.

555
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,619
-So that the users can...
-Excuse me.

556
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:41,963
-Hello?
-Kim Janghyeon is in your building!

557
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:43,374
Block all the exits!

558
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:48,506
Did you try playing the new game?

559
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,068
I didn't have the time to try it.
I have been very busy.

560
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:55,980
Security, shut down all the doors.
No one gets out of the building.

561
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:57,302
Do it now!

562
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:19,762
-All doors shut down.
-What happened?

563
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:49,780
Zoom in.

564
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,111
Kim Janghyeon.

565
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:55,992
He's alive.

566
00:50:56,534 --> 00:50:57,574
Darn it!

567
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:14,238
A suspicious man is in the building.

568
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,975
-What?
-Attention to all Ainsoft employees...

569
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:19,837
All entrances have been closed off...

570
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:22,014
...and the safety alarm is on.

571
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,291
Report to security
if you find anyone suspicious.

572
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:30,879
Stay in your offices
and take safety measures.

573
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:56,579
Are you okay?

574
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:57,597
Yes.

575
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,691
-Is it...?
-Yes, it's him.

576
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,849
He didn't die. You'll be fine.

577
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:11,055
An Minhyuk, the adventurer of games.

578
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,043
How about you play with me?

579
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:17,363
I can't give you much time.
You have only 15 minutes.

580
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:19,503
If you don't catch me in 15 minutes...

581
00:52:20,118 --> 00:52:23,065
...this building will explode!

582
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:25,876
-The broadcasting room.
-Boom!

583
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,656
Don't leave Bongsoon alone.

584
00:52:38,837 --> 00:52:39,670
Yes, sir.

585
00:52:40,278 --> 00:52:42,849
Mr. An, be careful.

586
00:52:42,934 --> 00:52:43,900
Don't worry about me.

587
00:53:29,054 --> 00:53:30,477
Mr. An.

588
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,038
Get out of here quickly.

589
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:39,370
This is real.

590
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:45,557
Save your documents, turn off
your computers and evacuate the building.

591
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:47,324
I repeat.

592
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:53,335
Save your documents, turn off your
computers and evacuate the building.

593
00:54:00,624 --> 00:54:02,332
-Let's go.
-Come this way!

594
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:03,988
Hurry!

595
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:05,969
-This way, everyone!
-Faster!

596
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:09,193
-What's the plan?
-We'll catch him.

597
00:54:09,277 --> 00:54:10,991
He dared to come in here.

598
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:13,220
Where's Bongsoon?

599
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:14,405
In my room.

600
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:20,515
Come out, Bongsoon.

601
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,919
We should use the stairs
instead of the lift.

602
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:31,902
Please evacuate. Evacuate.

603
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,256
Power control room?
Shut down the electricity.

604
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:00,762
The lights are turning off!

605
00:55:19,701 --> 00:55:21,028
Darn it.

606
00:56:48,683 --> 00:56:54,259
Try to break free. You bent iron
and threw cars like paper!

607
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,343
Try it like you did before!

608
00:56:58,317 --> 00:56:59,345
Come on!

609
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:07,528
Mr. Kong. Mr. Kong!

610
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:10,842
Bongsoon. Bongsoon!

611
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:14,798
Bongsoon! Bongsoon!

612
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:24,942
I think he took Bongsoon.

613
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:35,886
"Current Location: Rooftop"

614
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,037
The rooftop.

615
00:57:42,054 --> 00:57:44,211
You said you'd marry me.

616
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,642
What happens if you don't keep your word?

617
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:56,206
You die.

618
00:58:15,017 --> 00:58:16,026
Bongsoon!

619
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,607
Bongsoon!

620
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,130
Bongsoon!

621
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,936
It's really over now.

622
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:28,174
Bongsoon!

623
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:31,195
Bongsoon!

624
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:38,026
Bongsoon, where are you?
Bongsoon!

625
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:40,999
Bongsoon!

626
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,455
That scumbag.

627
00:59:41,016 --> 00:59:41,972
Bongsoon!

628
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,763
Bongsoon.

629
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:51,876
Bongsoon!

630
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:54,591
Are you in there?

631
00:59:55,754 --> 00:59:56,694
Bongsoon!

632
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:02,958
Bongsoon!

633
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:05,802
Bongsoon!

634
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,673
Answer me if you're there!

635
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:11,308
Bongsoon!

636
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:22,056
You can't come here!

637
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:23,200
Get out!

638
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:26,123
Bongsoon, I'm here.

639
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:29,083
I'm here. Bongsoon.

640
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,591
Please go away!

641
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:43,878
-Go away!
-Bongsoon. Bongsoon!

642
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:46,934
There's a time bomb!

643
01:01:04,307 --> 01:01:05,729
That son of a gun.

644
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:20,705
Please go away!

645
01:01:21,424 --> 01:01:23,501
Get out of here!

646
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,386
I'm not going anywhere.

647
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:42,756
Go away.

648
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:45,242
Please go!

649
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,160
I'm not leaving you alone.

650
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:52,097
I'll go with you.

651
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:02,558
Bongsoon!

652
01:02:05,165 --> 01:02:06,131
Don't cry!

653
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:23,373
Please go.

654
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:25,829
You never listen.

655
01:02:27,704 --> 01:02:31,052
There's not much time!

656
01:02:31,137 --> 01:02:33,604
